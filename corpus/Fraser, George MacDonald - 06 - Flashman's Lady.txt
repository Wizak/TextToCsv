explanatory note since the memoirs of flashman the notorious rugby school bully and victorian military hero first came to light ten years ago and have been laid before the public as each successive packet of manuscript was opened and edited a question has arisen which many readers have found intriguing the five volumes published so far have been in chronological order spanning the period from when flashman was expelled and entered the army to when he emerged from the indian mutiny but not all the intervening years have been covered in the five volumes one gap occurs between his first meeting with bismarck and lola montez in and his involvement in the schleswigholstein question in yet another between when he was last seen on the new orleans waterfront in the company of the wellknown oxford don and slavetrader captain spring ma and when duty called him to the crimea it has been asked what of the missing years the sixth packet of the flashman papers supplies a partial answer since it deals with its authors remarkable adventures from to it is clear from his manuscript that a chance paragraph in the sporting columns of a newspaper caused him to interrupt his normal chronological habit to fill in this hiatus in his earlier years and from the bulk of unopened manuscript remaining it appears that his memoirs of the taiping rebellion the us civil war and the sioux and zulu uprisings are still to come the historical significance of the present instalment may be thought to be threefold as a firsthand account of the early victorian sporting scene it is certainly unique on a different plane it provides an eyewitness description of that incredible forgotten private war in which a handful of gentlemenadventurers pushed the british imperial frontier eastwards in the s lastly it sheds fresh light on the characters of two great figures of the time one a legendary empirebuilder the other an african queen who has been unfavourably compared to caligula and nero a small point which may be of interest to students of flashmans earlier memoirs is that the present manuscript shows signs of having been lightly edited as was one previous volume by his sisterinlaw grizel de rothschild probably soon after his death in she has modified his blasphemies but has not otherwise tampered with the old soldiers narrative indeed she has embellished it here and there with extracts from the private diary of her sister elspeth flashmans wife and with her own pungent marginal comments in the presence of such distinguished editing i have confined myself to supplying footnotes and appendices and satisfying myself of the accuracy of flashmans account of historical events so far as these can be checked gmf so theyre talking about amending the legbeforewicket rule again i dont know why they bother for theyll never get it right until they go back to the old law which said that if you put your leg in front of the ball apurpose to stop it hitting the stumps you were out and damned good riddance to you that was plain enough youd have thought but no those muttonbrains in the marylebone club have to scratch their heads over it every few years and gas for days on end about the line of delivery and the point of pitch and the lord knows what other rubbish and in the end they cross out a word and add another and the whole things as incomprehensible as it was before set of doddering old women it all comes of these pads that batters wear nowadays when i was playing cricket we had nothing to guard our precious shins except our trousers and if you were fool enough to get your ankle in the way of one of alfie mynns shooters why it didnt matter whether you were in front of the wicket or sitting on the pavilion privy you were off to get your leg in plaster no error but now they shuffle about the crease like yokels in gaiters and that great muffin grace bleats like a ruptured choirboy if a fast ball comes near him wouldnt i just have liked to get him on the old lords wicket after a dry summer with the pitch rockhard mynn sending down his trimmers from one end and myself going allout at tother they wouldnt have been calling him the champion then i may tell you the old bastards beard would have been snowwhite after two overs and the same goes for that fat black nawab and the pup fry too from this you may gather that i was a bowler myself not a batter and if i say i was a damned good one well the old scores are there to back me up seven for against the gentlemen of kent five for against the england xi and a fair number of runs as a tailend slogger to boot not that i prided myself on my batting as ive said it could be a risky business against fast men in the old days when wickets were rough and i may tell you privately that i took care never to face up to a really scorching bowler without woollen scarves wrapped round my legs and an old tin soupbowl over my essentials sports all very well but you mustnt let it incapacitate you for the manliest game of all no just let me go in about number eight or nine when the slow lobbers and twisters were practising their wiles and i could slash away in safety and then when tother side had their innings give me that ball and a thirtypace runup and just watch me make em dance it may strike you that old flashys approach to our great summer game wasnt quite that of your schoolstorybook hero applecheeked and manly playing up unselfishly for the honour of the side and love of his gallant captain revelling in the jolly rivalry of bat and ball while his carefree laughter rings across the green sward no not exactly personal glory and cheap wickets however you could get em and damnn the honour of the side that was my style with a few quid picked up in sidebets and plenty of skirtchasing afterwards among the sporting ladies who used to ogle us big hairy fielders over their parasols at canterbury week thats the spirit that wins matches and you may take my word for it and ponder our recent disastrous showing against the australians while youre about it of course i speak as one who learned his cricket in the golden age when i was a miserable fag at rugby toadying my way up the school and trying to keep a whole skin in that infernal jungle you took your choice of emerging a physical wreck or a moral one and im glad to say i never hesitated which is why im the man i am today whats left of me i snivelled and bought my way to safety when i was a small boy and bullied and tyrannized when i was a big one how the devil im not in the house of lords by now i cant think thats by the way the point is that rugby taught me only two things really well survival and cricket for i saw even at the tender age of eleven that while bribery fawning and deceit might ensure the former they werent enough to earn a popular reputation which is a very necessary thing for that you had to shine at games and cricket was the only one for me not that i cared for it above half at first but the other great sport was football and that was downright dangerous i rubbed along at it only by limping up late to the scrimmages yelping play up you fellows do oh confound this game leg of mine and by developing a knack of missing my charges against bigger men by a fraction of an inch plunging on the turf just too late with heroic gasps and roarings cricket was peace and tranquillity by comparison without any danger of being hacked in the members and i turned out to be uncommon good at it i say this in all modesty as you may know i have three other prime talents for horses languages and fornication but theyre all godgiven and no credit that i can claim but i worked to make myself a cricketer damned hard i worked which is probably why when i look back nowadays on the rewards and trophies of an eventful life the medals the knighthood the accumulated cash the military glory the drowsy satisfied women all in all theres not much im prouder of than those five wickets for runs against the flower of englands batters or that one glorious over at lords in when but ill come to that in a moment for its where my present story really begins i suppose if fuller pilch had got his bat down just a split second sooner it would all have turned out different the skrang pirates wouldnt have been burned out of their hellish nest the black queen of madagascar would have had one lover fewer the french and british wouldnt have bombarded tamitave and id have been spared kidnapping slavery blowpipes and the risk of death and torture in unimaginable places aye old fullers got a lot to answer for god rest him however thats anticipating i was telling you how i became a fast bowler at rugby which is a necessary preliminary it was in the thirties you see that roundarm bowling came into its own and fellows like mynn got their hands up shoulderhigh it changed the game like nothing since for we saw what fast bowling could be and it was fast you talk about spofforth and brown but none of them kicked up the dust like those early trimmers why ive seen mynn bowl to five slips and three longstops and his deliveries going over em all first bounce right down to lords gate thats my ticket thinks i and i took up the new slinging style at first because it was capital fun to buzz the ball round the ears of rabbits and funks who couldnt hit back but i soon found this didnt answer against serious batters who pulled and drove me all over the place so i mended my ways until i could whip my fastest ball onto a crown piece four times out of five and as i grew tall i became faster still and was in a fair way to being cock of big side until that memorable afternoon when the puritan prig arnold took exception to my being carried home sodden drunk and turfed me out of the school two weeks before the marylebone match if you please well they lost it without me which shows that while piety and sobriety may ensure you eternal life they aint enough to beat the mcc however that was an end to my cricket for a few summers for i was packed off to the army and afghanistan where i shuddered my way through the kabul retreat winning undeserved but undying fame in the siege of jallalabad all of which ive related elsewhere sufficient to say that i bilked funked ran for dear life and screamed for mercy as occasion demanded all through that ghastly campaign and came out with four medals the thanks of parliament an audience of our queen and a handshake from the duke of wellington its astonishing what you can make out of a bad business if you play your hand right and look noble at the proper time anyway i came home a popular hero in the late summer of to a rapturous reception from the public and my beautiful idiot wife elspeth being lionized and feted and making up for lost time by whoring and carousing to excess i didnt have much time in the first few months for lighter diversions but it chanced that i was promenading down regent street one afternoon twirling my cane with my hat on three hairs and seeking what i might devour when i found myself outside the green man i paused idly and that moments hesitation launched me on what was perhaps the strangest adventure of my life its long gone now but in those days the green man was a famous haunt of cricketers and it was the sight of bats and stumps and other paraphernalia of the game in the window that suddenly brought back memories and awoke a strange hunger not to play you understand but just to smell the atmosphere again and hear the talk of batters and bowlers and the jargon and gossip so i turned in ordered a plate of tripe and a quart of homebrewed exchanged a word or two with the jolly pipesmokers in the tap and was soon so carried away by the homely fare the cheery talk and laughter and the clean hearty air of the place that i found myself wishing id gone on to the haymarket and got myself a dish of hot spiced trollop instead still there was time before supper and i was just calling the waiter to settle up when i noticed a fellow staring at me across the room he met my eye shoved his chair back and came over i say says he arent you flashman he said it almost warily as though he didnt wish quite to believe it i was used to this sort of thing by now and having fellows fawn and admire the hero of jallalabad but this chap didnt look like a toadeater he was as tall as i was brownfaced and squarechinned with a keen look about him as though he couldnt wait to have a cold tub and a tenmile walk a christian i shouldnt wonder and no smoking the day before a match so i said fairly cool that i was flashman and what was it to him you havent changed says he grinning you wont remember me though do you any good reason why i should try says i here waiter no thankee says this fellow ive had my pint for the day never take more during the season and he sat himself down cool as bedamned at my table well im relieved to hear it says i rising youll forgive me but hold on says he laughing im brown tom brown of rugby dont say youve forgotten well in fact i had nowadays his name is emblazoned on my memory and has been ever since hughes published his infernal book in the fifties but that was still in the future and for the life of me i couldnt place him didnt want to either he had that manly openair reek about him that i cant stomach what with his tweed jacket and sporting cap not my style at all you roasted me over the commonroom fire once says he amiably and then i knew him fast enough and measured the distance to the door thats the trouble with these snivelling little sneaks one knocks about at school they grow up into hulking louts who box and are always in prime trim fortunately this one appeared to be christian as well as muscular having swallowed arnolds lunatic doctrine of lovethineenemy for as i hastily muttered that i hoped it hadnt done him any lasting injury he laughed heartily and clapped me on the shoulder why thats ancient history cries he boys will be boys what besides dye know i feel almost that i owe you an apology yes and he scratched his head and looked sheepish tell the truth went on this amazing oaf when we were youngsters i didnt care for you above half flashman well you treated us fags pretty raw you knowof course i guess it was just thoughtlessness but well we thought you no end of a cad and and a coward too he stirred uncomfortably and i wondered was he going to fart well you caught us out there didnt you says he meeting my eye again i mean all this business in afghanistan the way you defended the old flag that sort of thing by george and he absolutely had tears in his eyes it was the most splendid thing and to think that you well i never heard of anything so heroic in my life and i just wanted to apologize old fellow for thinking ill of you cos ill own that i did once and ask to shake your hand if youll let me he sat there with his great paw stuck out looking misty and noble virtue just oozing out of him while i marvelled the strange thing is his precious pal scud east whom id hammered just as generously at school said almost the same thing to me years later when we met as prisoners in russia confessed how hed loathed me but how my heroic conduct had wiped away all old scores and so forth i wonder still if they believed that it did or if they were being hypocrites for forms sake or if they truly felt guilty for once having harboured evil thoughts of me damned if i know the victorian conscience is beyond me thank god i know that if anyone whod done me a bad turn later turned out to be the archangel gabriel id still hate the bastard but then im a scoundrel you see with no proper feelings however i was so relieved to find that this stalwart lout was prepared to let bygones be bygones that i turned on all my flashy charms pumped his fin heartily and insisted that he break his rule for once and have a glass with me well i will thankee says he and when the beer had come and wed drunk to dear old rugby he puts down his mug and says theres another thing matter of fact it was the first thought that popped into my head when i saw you just now i dont know how youd feel about it though i mean perhaps your wounds aint better yet he hesitated fire away says i thinking perhaps he wanted to introduce me to his sister well you wont have heard but my last half at school when i was captain we had no end of a match against the marylebone men lost on first innings but only nine runs in it and wed have beat em given one more over anyway old aislabie you remember him was so taken with our play that he has asked me if id like to get up a side rugby past and present for a match against kent well ive got some useful hands you know young brooke and raggles and i remembered you were a famous bowler so what dye say to turning out for us if youre fit of course it took me clean aback and my tongue being what it is i found myself saying why dyou think youll draw a bigger gate with the hero of afghanistan playing eh good lord no he coloured and then laughed what a cynic you are flashy dye know says he looking knowing im beginning to understand you i think even at school you always said the smart cutting things that got under peoples skins almost as though you were going out of your way to have em think ill of you its a contrary thing all at odds with the truth isnt it oh aye says he smiling owlishly afghanistan proved that all right the german doctors are doing a lot of work on it the perversity of human nature excellence bent on destroying itself the heroic soul fearing its own fall from grace and trying to anticipate it interesting he shook his fat head solemnly im thinking of reading philosophy at oxford this term you know however i mustnt prose what about it old fellow and damn his impudence he slapped me on the knee will you bowl your expresses for us at lords id been about to tell him to take his offer along with his rotten foreign sermonizing and drop em both in the serpentine but that last word stopped me lords id never played there but what cricketer who ever breathed wouldnt jump at the chance you may think it small enough beer compared with the games id been playing lately but ill confess it made my heart leap i was still young and impressionable then and i almost knocked his hand off accepting he gave me another of his thunderous shoulderclaps and said capital it was settled then youll want to get in some practice no doubt says he and promptly delivered a lecture about how he kept himself in condition with runs and exercises and foregoing tuck just as he had at school from that he harked back to the dear old days and how hed gone for a weep and a pray at arnolds tomb the previous month excited as i was at the prospect of the lords game id had about my bellyful of master pious brown by the time he was done and as we took our leave of each other in regent street i couldnt resist the temptation to puncture his confounded smugness cant say how glad i am to have seen you again old lad says he as we shook hands delighted to know youll turn out for us of course but you know the best thing of all has been meeting the new flashman if you know what i mean its odd and he fixed his thumbs in his belt and squinted wisely at me like an owl in labour but it reminds me of what the doctor used to say at confirmation class about man being born again only its happened to you for me if you understand me at all events im a better man now i feel than i was an hour ago god bless you old chap says he as i disengaged my hand before he could drag me to my knees for a quick prayer and a chorus of let us with a gladsome mind he asked which way i was bound oh down towards haymarket says i get some exercise i think capital says he nothing like a good walk well i was thinking more of riding dont you know in haymarket he frowned no stables thereaway surely best in town says i a few english mounts but mostly french fillies riding silks black and scarlet splendid exercise but damned exhausting care to try it for a moment he was all at a loss and then as understanding dawned he went scarlet and white by turns until i thought he would faint my god he whispered hoarsely i tapped him on the weskit with my cane all confidential you remember stumps harrowell the shoemaker at rugby and what enormous calves he had i winked while he gaped at me well theres a german wench down there whose poonts are even bigger just about your weight do you a power of good he made gargling noises while i watched him with huge enjoyment so much for the new flashman eh says i wish you hadnt invited me to play with your pureminded little friends well its too late young tom youve shaken hands on it havent you he pulled himself together and took a breath you may play if you wish says he more fool i for asking you but if you were the man i had hoped you were you would cry off gracefully and save you from the pollution of my company no no my boy ill be there and just as fit as you are but ill wager i enjoy my training more flashman cries he as i turned away dont go to to that place i beseech you it aint worthy how would you know says i see you at lords and i left him full of christian anguish at the sight of the hardened sinner going down to the pit the best of it was he was probably as full of holy torment at the thought of my foul fornications as he would have been if hed galloped that german tart himself thats unselfishness for you but shed have been wasted on him anyway however just because id punctured holy toms daydreams dont imagine that i took my training lightly even while the german wench was recovering her breath afterwards and ringing for refreshments i was limbering up on the rug trying out my old roundarm swing i even got some of her sisters in to throw oranges to me for catching practice and you never saw anything jollier than those painted dollymops scampering about in their corsets shying fruit we made such a row that the other customers put their heads out and it turned into an impromptu innings on the landing whores versus patrons the whole thing got out of hand of course with furniture smashed and the sluts shrieking and weeping and the madames bullies put me out for upsetting her disorderly house which seemed a trifle hard next day though i got down to it in earnest with a ball in the garden to my delight none of my old skill seemed to have deserted me the thigh which id broken in afghanistan never even twinged and i crowned my practice by smashing the morningroom window while my fatherinlaw was finishing his breakfast hed been reading about the rebecca riots over his porridge it seemed and since hed spent his miserable life squeezing and sweating his millworkers and had a fearful guilty conscience according his first reaction to the shattering glass was that the starving mob had risen at last and were coming to give him his just deserts ye damned goth he spluttered fishing the fragments out of his whiskers ye dont care who ye maim or murder i micht hae been killed have ye nae work tae go tae and he whined on about illconditioned loafers who squandered their time and his money in selfish pleasure while i nuzzled elspeth good morning over her coffee service marvelling as i regarded her goldenhaired radiance and peachsoft skin that i had wasted strength on that suety frau the evening before when this had been waiting between the covers at home a fine family ye married intae says her charming sire the son stramashin aboot destroyin property while the feythers lyin abovestairs stupefied wi drink is there nae mair toast well its our property and our drink says i helping myself to kidneys our toast too if it comes to that aye ist though my buckie says he looking more like a spiteful goblin than ever and who peys fort no you an yer wastrel parent aye an ye can keep yer sullen sniffs to yersel my lassie he went on to elspeth well hae things aboveboard plump an plain its john morrison foots the bills wi good scots siller hardearned for this fine husband o yours an the upkeep o his hoose an family jist mind that he crumpled up his paper which was sodden with spilled coffee tach there my breakfast spiled for me our property an our drink ye say grand airs and patched breeks and out he strode to return in a moment snarling and since youre meant tae be managin this establishment my girl yell see tae it that we hae marmalade after this and no this damned french jam confee toor huh sticky rubbish and he slammed the door behind him oh dear sighs elspeth papa is in his black mood what a shame you broke the window dearest papa is a confounded blot says i wolfing kidneys but now that were rid of him give us a kiss youll understand that we were an unusual menage i had married elspeth perforce two years before when i had the illfortune to be stationed in scotland and had been detected tupping her in the bushes it had been the altar or pistols for two with her fireeating uncle then when my drunken guvnor had gone smash over railway shares old morrison had found himself saddled with the upkeep of the flashman establishment which hed had to assume for his daughters sake a pretty state youll allow for the little miser wouldnt give me or the guvnor a penny direct but doled it out to elspeth on whom i had to rely for spending money not that she wasnt generous for in addition to being a stunning beauty she was also as brainless as a feather mop and doted on me or at least she seemed to but i was beginning to have my doubts she had a hearty appetite for the twobacked game and the suspicion was growing on me that in my absence shed been rolling the linen with any chap whod come handy and was still spreading her favours now that i was home as i say i couldnt be sure for that matter im still not sixty years later the trouble was and is i dearly loved her in my way and not only lustfully although she was all you could wish as a nightcap and however much i might stallion about the town and elsewhere there was never another woman that i cared for besides her not even lola montez or lakshmibai or lily langtry or ko dalis daughter or duchess irma or takesawaycloudswoman or valentina or or oh take your choice there wasnt one to come up to elspeth for one thing she was the happiest creature in the world and pitifully easy to please she revelled in the london life which was a rare change from the cemetery shed been brought up in paisley they call it and with her looks my newwon laurels and her fathers shekels we were wellreceived everywhere her trade origins being conveniently forgotten this was just nuts to elspeth for she was an unconscionable little snob and when i told her i was to play at lords before the smartest of the sporting set she went into raptures here was a fresh excuse for new hats and dresses and preening herself before the society rabble she thought being scotch and knowing nothing she supposed cricket was a gentlemans game you see sure enough a certain level of the polite world followed it but they werent precisely the high cream in those days country barons racing knights welltodo gentry maybe a mad bishop or two but pretty rustic it wasnt quite as respectable as it is now one reason for this was that it was still a betting game and the stakes could run pretty high ive known ј riding on a single innings with wild sidebets of anything from a guinea to a thou on how many wickets marsden would take or how many catches would fall to the slips or whether pilch would reach fifty with so much cash about you may believe that some of the underhand work that went on would have made a hays city stud school look like old maids loo matches were sold and thrown players were bribed and threatened wickets were doctored of course corruption wasnt general or even common but it happened in those good old sporting days and whatever the purists may say there was a life and stingo about cricket then that you dont get now it looked so different even if i close my eyes i can see lords as it was then and i know that when the memories of bed and battle have lost their colours and faded to misty grey that at least will be as bright as ever the coaches and carriages packed in the road outside the gate the fashionable crowd streaming in by jimmy darks house under the trees the girls like so many gaudy butterflies in their summer dresses and hats shaded by parasols and the men guiding em to chairs some in tall hats and coats others in striped weskits and caps the gentry uncomfortably buttoned up and the roughs and townies in shirtsleeves and billycocks with their watchchains and cutties the bookies with their stands outside the pavilion calling the odds the flash chaps in their mighty whiskers and ornamented vests the touts and runners and swell mobsmen slipping through the press like ferrets the potboys from the lords pub thrusting along with trays loaded with beer and lemonade crying way order gents way order old john gully the retired pug standing like a great oak tree feet planted wide smiling his gentle smile as he talked to alfred mynn whose scarlet waistscarf and straw boater were a magnet for the eyes of the heroworshipping youngsters jostling at a respectful distance from these giants of the sporting world the grooms pushing a way for some doddering old duke passing through nodding and tipping his tile with his pouleofthemoment arminarm she painted and boldeyed and defiant as the ladies turned the other way with a rustle of skirts the bowling green and archery range going full swing with the thunk of the shafts mingling with the distant pomping of the artillery band the chatter and yelling of the vendors the grind of coachwheels and the warm hum of summer ebbing across the great green field where stevie slatters boys were herding away the sheep and warning off the bobagame players the crowds tendeep at the nets to see pilch at batting practice or felix agile as his animal namesake bowling those slow lobs that seemed to hang forever in the air or i see it in the late evening sun the players in their white tophats trooping in from the field with the ripple of applause running round the ropes and the urchins streaming across to worship while the old buffers outside the pavilion clap and cry played well played and raise their tankards and the captain tosses the ball to some roundeyed small boy wholl guard it as a relic for life and the scorer climbs stiffly down from his eyrie and the shadows lengthen across the idyllic scene the very picture of merry sporting old england with the umpires bundling up the stumps the birds calling in the tall trees the gentle evenfall stealing over the ground and the pavilion and the empty benches and the willow woodpile behind the sheep pen where flashy is plunging away on top of the landlords daughter in the long grass aye cricket was cricket then barring the last bit which took place on another joyous occasion thats absolutely what it was like on the afternoon when the gentlemen of rugby including your humble servant went out to play the cracks of kent at first i thought it was going to be a frost for while most of my teammates were pretty civil as youd expect to the hector of afghanistan the egregious brown was decidedly cool and so was brooke whod been head of the school in my time and was the apple of arnolds eye that tells you all you need to know about him he was cleanlimbed and handsome and went to church and had no impure thoughts and was kind to animals and old ladies and was a midshipman in the navy what happened to him ive no idea but i hope he absconded with the ships funds and the admirals wife and set up a knockingshop in valparaiso he and brown talked in low voices in the pavilion and glanced towards me rejoicing no doubt over the sinner who hadnt repented then it was time to play and brown won the toss and elected to bat which meant that i spent the next hour beside elspeths chair trying to hush her imbecile observations on the game and waiting for my turn to go in it was a while coming because either kent were going easy to make a game of it or brooke and brown were better than youd think for they survived the opening whirlwind of mynns attack and when the twisters came on began to push the score along quite handsomely ill say that for brown he could play a deuced straight bat and brooke was a hitter they put on thirty for the first wicket and our other batters were game so that we had seventy up before the tail was reached and i took my leave of my fair one who embarrassed me damnably by assuring her neighbours that i was sure to make a score because i was so strong and clever i hastened to the pavilion collared a pint of ale from the potboy and hadnt had time to do more than blow off the froth when there were two more wickets down and brown says in you go flashman so i picked up a bat from beside the flagstaff threaded my way through the crowd who turned to look curiously at the next man in and stepped out on to the turf you must have done it yourselves often enough and remember the silence as you walk out to the wicket so far away and perhaps theres a stray handclap or a cry of go it old fellow and no more than a few spectators loafing round the ropes and the fielding side sit or lounge about stretching in the sun barely glancing at you as you come in i knew it well enough but as i stepped over the ropes i happened to glance up and lords truly smote me for the first time round the great emerald field smooth as a pool table there was this mighty mass of people ten deep at the boundary and behind them the coaches were banked solid wheel to wheel crowded with ladies and gentlemen the whole huge multitude hushed and expectant while the sun caught the glittering eyes of thousands of operaglasses and binocles glaring at me it was damned unnerving with that vast space to be walked across and my bladder suddenly holding a bushel and i wished i could scurry back into the friendly warm throng behind me you may think it odd that nervous funk should grip me just then after all my native cowardice has been whetted on some real worthwhile horrors zulu impis and cossack cavalry and sioux riders all intent on rearranging my circulatory and nervous systems in their various ways but there were others to share the limelight with me then and its a different kind of fear anyway the minor ordeals can be damned scaring simply because you know youre going to survive them it didnt last above a second while i gulped and hesitated and strode on and then the most astounding thing happened a murmur passed along the banks of people and then it grew to a roar and suddenly it exploded in the most deafening cheering you ever heard you could feel the shock of it rolling across the ground and ladies were standing up and fluttering their handkerchieves and parasols and the men were roaring hurrah and waving their hats and jumping up on the carriages and in the middle of it all the brass band began to thump out rule britannia and i realized they werent cheering the next man in but saluting the hero of jallalabad and i was fairly knocked sideways by the surprise of it all however i fancy i played it pretty well raising my white topper right and left while the music and cheering pounded on and hurrying to get to the wicket as a modest hero should and here was slim little felix in his classroom whiskers and charity boys cap smiling shyly and holding out his hand felix the greatest gentleman bat in the world mark you leading me to the wicket and calling for three cheers from the kent team and then the silence fell and my bat thumped uncommon loud as i hit it into the blockhole and the fielders crouched and i thought oh god this is the serious business and im bound to lay an egg on the scorer i know i am and after such a welcome too and with my bowels quailing i looked up the wicket at alfred mynn he was a huge man at the best of times six feet odd and close on twenty stone with a face like fried ham garnished with a double helping of black whisker but now he looked like goliath and if you think a man cant tower above you from twentyfive yards off you aint seen young alfie he was smiling idly tossing up the ball which looked no bigger than a cherry in his massive fist working one foot on the turf pawing it bigod old aislabie gave me guard quavered play i gripped my bat and mynn took six quick steps and swung his arm i saw the ball in his hand at shoulder height and then something fizzed beside my right knee i prepared to lift my bat and the wicketkeeper was tossing the ball to felix at point i swallowed in horror for i swear i never saw the damned thing go and someone in the crowd cries well let alone sir there was a little puff of dust settling about four feet in front of me thats where he pitches thinks i oh jesus dont let him hit me felix crouching facing me barely ten feet away edged just a little closer his eyes fixed on my feet mynn had the ball again and again came the six little steps and i was lunging forward eyes tight shut to get my bat down where the dust had jumped last time i grounded it my bat leaped as something hit it a hammer blow numbing my wrists and i opened my eyes to see the ball scuttling off to leg behind the wicket brooke yells come on and the lord knows i wanted to but my legs didnt answer and brooke had to turn back shaking his head this has got to stop thinks i for ill be maimed for life if i stay here and panic mingled with hate and rage gripped me as mynn turned again he strode up to the wicket arm swinging back and i came out of my ground in a huge despairing leap swinging my bat for dear life there was a sickening crack and in an instant of elation i knew id caught it low down on the outside edge full swipe the bloody thing must be in wiltshire by now five runs for certain and i was about to tear up the pitch when i saw brooke was standing his ground and felix whod been fielding almost in my pocket was idly tossing the ball up in his left hand shaking his head and smiling at me how hed caught it only he and satan know it must have been like snatching a bullet from the muzzle but he hadnt turned a hair and i could only trudge back to the pavilion while the mob groaned in sympathy and i waved my bat to them and tipped my tile after all i was a bowler and at least id taken a swing at it and id faced three balls from alfred mynn we closed our hand at flashy caught felix nought and it was held to be a very fair score although kent were sure to pass it easily and since it was a singlehand match that would be that in spite of my blank score how i wished i had gone for that single off the second ball i was well received round the pavilion for it was known who i was by now and several gentlemen came to shake my hand while the ladies eyed my stalwart frame and simpered to each other behind their parasols elspeth was glowing at the splendid figure i had cut in her eyes but indignant that i had been out when my wicket hadnt been knocked down because wasnt that the object of the game i explained that i had been caught out and she said it was a most unfair advantage and that little man in the cap must be a great sneak at which the gentlemen around roared with laughter and ogled her calling for soda punch for the lady and swearing she must be taken on to the committee to amend the rules i contented myself with a glass of beer before we went out to field for i wanted to be fit to bowl but damme if brown didnt leave me loafing in the outfield no doubt to remind me that i was a whoremonger and therefore not fit to take an over i didnt mind but lounged about pretty nonchalant chatting with the townies near the ropes and shrugging my shoulders eloquently when felix or his partner made a good hit which they did every other ball they fairly knocked our fellows all over the wicket and had fifty up well within the hour i observed to the townies that what we wanted was a bit of ginger and limbered my arm and they cheered and began to cry bring on the flash chap huzza for afghanistan and so forth which was very gratifying id been getting my share of attention from the ladies in the carriages near my lookout and indeed had been so intent on winking and swaggering that id missed a long hit at which brown called pretty sharply to me to mind out now one or two of the more spirited ladybirds began to echo the townies who egged them on so that bring on the flash chap began to echo round the ground in gruff bass and piping soprano finally brown could stand it no longer and waved me in and the mob cheered like anything and felix smiled his quiet smile and took fresh guard on the whole he treated my first over with respect for he took only eleven off it which was better than i deserved for of course i flung my deliveries down with terrific energy the first one full pitch at his head and the next three horribly short in sheer nervous excitement the crowd loved it and so did felix curse him he didnt reach the first one but he drew the second beautifully for four cut the third on tiptoe and swept the last right off his upper lip and into the coaches near the pavilion how the crowd laughed and cheered while brown bit his lip with vexation and brooke frowned his disgust but they couldnt take me off after only one turn i saw felix say something to his partner and the other laughed and as i walked back to my lookout a thought crept into my head and i scowled horribly and clapped my hands in disgust at which the spectators yelled louder than ever give em the afghan pepper flashy cries one and run out the guns hollers another i waved my fist and stuck my hat on the back of my head and they cheered and laughed again they gave a huge shout when brown called me up for my second turn and settled themselves to enjoy more fun and fury youll get it my boys thinks i as i thundered up to the wicket with the mob counting each step and my first ball smote about halfway down the pitch flew high over the batsmans head and they ran three byes that brought felix to face me again and i walked back closing my ears to the shouting and to browns muttered rebuke i turned and just from the lift of felixs shoulders i could see he was getting set to knock me into the trees i fixed my eye on the spot dead in line with his off stump he was a lefthander which left the wicket wide as a barn door to my round delivery and ran up determined to bowl the finest fastest ball of my life and so i did very well i told you i was a good bowler and that was the best ball i ever delivered which is to say it was unplayable i had dropped the first one short on purpose just to confirm what everyone supposed from the first over that i was a wild chucker with no more head than flat beer but the second had every fibre directed at that spot with just a trifle less strength than i could muster to keep it steady and from the moment it left my hand felix was gone granted i was lucky for the spot must have been bald it was a shooter skidding in past his toes when he expected it round his ears and before he could smother it his stump was cartwheeling away the yell that went up split the heaven and he walked past me shaking his head and shooting me a quizzy look while the fellows slapped my back and even brooke condescended to cry well bowled i took it very offhand but inside i was thinking felix felix by god id not have swapped that wicket for a peerage then i was brought back to earth for the crowd were cheering the new man in and i picked up the ball and turned to face the tall angular figure with the longreaching arms and the shorthandled bat id seen fuller pilch play at norwich when i was a young shaver when he beat marsden of yorkshire for the singlewicket championship of england so far as i ever had a boyhood hero it was pilch the best professional of his day some say of any day although its my belief this new boy rhodes may be as good well flash thinks i youve nothing to lose so here goes at him now what id done to felix was head bowling but what came next was luck and nothing else i cant account for it yet but it happened and this is how it was i did my damndest to repeat my great effort but even faster this time and in consequence i was just short of a length whether pilch was surprised by the speed or the fact that the ball kicked higher than it had any right to do i dont know but he was an instant slow in reaching forward which was his great shot he didnt ground his bat in time the ball came high off the blade and i fairly hurled myself down the pitch all arms and legs grabbing at a catch i could have held in my mouth i nearly muffed it too but it stuck between finger and thumb and the next i knew they were pounding me on the back and the townies were in full voice while pilch turned away slapping his bat in vexation bloody gravel cries he hasnt dark got any brooms then he may have been right for all i know by now as you may imagine i was past caring felix and pilch there was nothing more left in the world just then or so i thought what could excel those twin glorious strokes my grandchildren will never believe this thinks i supposing i have any by george ill buy every copy of the sporting press for the next month and paper old morrisons bedroom with em and yet the best was still to come mynn was striding to the crease i can see him now and it brings back to me a line that macaulay wrote in that very year and now the cry is aster and lo the ranks divide as the great lord of luna comes on with stately stride that was alfred the great to a t stately and magnificent with his broad crimson sash and the bat like a kids paddle in his hand he gave me a great grin as he walked by took guard glanced leisurely round the field tipped his straw hat back on his head and nodded to the umpire old aislabie who was shaking with excitement as he called play well i had no hope at all of improving on what id done you may be sure but i was determined to bowl my best and it was only as i turned that it crossed my mind old aislabies a rugby man and it was out of pride in the old school that he arranged this fixture honest as god to be sure but like all enthusiasts hell see what he wants to see wont he and mynns so tarnation big you cant help hitting him somewhere if you put your mind to it and bowl your fastest it was all taking shape even as i ran up to the wicket id got felix by skill pilch by luck and id get mynn by knavery or perish in the attempt i fairly flung myself up to the crease and let go a perfect snorter dead on a length but a good foot wide of the leg stump it bucked mynn stepped quickly across to let it go by it flicked his calf and by that time i was bounding across aislabies line of sight three feet off the ground turning as i sprang and tumultuous ovation from the gallery which i acknowledged modestly with a tip of mynns hat and basked in my glory for the rest of the match which we lost by four wickets it was beer all round in the pavilion afterwards with all manner of congratulations felix shook my hand again ducking his head in that shy way of his and mynn asked was i to be home next year for if the army didnt find a use for me he could in the casual side which he would get together for the grand cricket week at canterbury this was flattery on the grand scale but im not sure that the sincerest tribute i got wasnt fuller pilchs knitted brows and steady glare as he sat on a bench with his tankard looking me up and down for a full two minutes and never saying a word even the doddering duke came up to compliment me and say that my style reminded him absolutely of his own did i not remark it to you my dear says he to his languid tart who was fidgeting with her parasol and stifling a yawn while showing me her handsome profile and weighing me out of the corner of her eye did i not observe that mr flashmans shooter was just like the one i bowled out beauclerk with at maidstone in directed to his off stump sir caught him goin back you understand pitched just short broke and shot middle stump bowled all over his wicket ha ha what i had to steady the old fool before he tumbled over demonstrating his action and his houri assisting took the opportunity to rub a plump arm against me no doubt we shall have the pleasure of seeing you at canterbury next summer mr flashman she murmurs and the old pantaloon cries aye aye capital notion as she helped him away i made a note to look her up then since shed probably have killed him in the course of the winter it wasnt till i was towelling myself in the bathhouse and getting outside a brandy punch that i realized i hadnt seen elspeth since the match ended which was odd since shed hardly miss a chance to bask in my reflected glory i dressed and looked about no sign of her among the thinning crowd or outside the pavilion or at the ladies tea tables or at our carriage coachee hadnt seen her either there was a fairish throng outside the pub but shed hardly be there and then someone plucked my sleeve and i turned to find a large beeryfaced individual with black button eyes at my elbow mr flashman sir best respex says he and tapped his lowcrown hat with his cudgel youll forgive the liberty im sure tighes the monicker daedalus tighe evyone knows me agent an accountant to the gentry and he pushed a card

impudence my thanks for the thought mr tighe says i for it dont harm to be civil to a bookie and i was feeling easy you may drink my health with it and i pushed firmly past him at which he staggered and sat down heavily in a froth of cheap champagne while his pals hooted and weaved in to help him not that i couldnt have used the fifty quid but you cant be seen associating with cads of that kidney much less accepting their gelt i strode on with cries of good luck sir and heres to the flash cove following me i was still grinning as i resumed my search for elspeth but as i turned into the archery range for a look there the smile was wiped off my lips for there were only two people in the long alley between the hedges the tall figure of a man and elspeth in his arms i came to a dead halt silent for three reasons first i was astonished secondly he was a big vigorous brute by what i could see of him which was a massive pair of shoulders in a handsomelycut broadcloth and thirdly it passed quickly through my mind that elspeth apart from being my wife was also my source of supply food for thought you see but before i had even an instant to taste it they both turned their heads and i saw that elspeth was in the act of stringing a shaft to a ladies bow giggling and making a most appealing hash of it while her escort standing close in behind her was guiding her hands which of course necessitated putting his arms about her with her head against his shoulder all very innocent as who knows better than i whove taken advantage of many such situations for an ardent squeeze and fondle why harry cries she where have you been all this while see don solomon is teaching me archery and i have been making the sorriest show which she demonstrated by fumbling the shaft swinging her bow arm wildly and letting fly into the hedge squeaking with delighted alarm oh i am quite hopeless don solomon unless you hold my hands the fault is mine dear mrs flashman says he easily he managed to keep an arm round her while bowing in my direction but here is mars who im sure is a much better instructor for diana than i could ever be he smiled and raised his hat servant mr flashman i nodded pretty cool and looked down my nose at him which wasnt easy since he was all of my height and twice as big around portly you might say if not fat with a fleshy smiling face and fine teeth which flashed white against his swarthy skin dago for certain perhaps even oriental for his hair and whiskers were blueblack and curly and as he came towards me he was moving with that mincing latin grace for all his flesh a swell too by the elegant cut of his togs diamond pin in his neckercher a couple of rings on his big brown hands and by jove even a tiny gold ring in one ear partnigger not a doubt of it and with all a rich niggers side too oh harry we have had such fun cries elspeth and my heart gave a little jump as i looked at her the gold ringlets under her ridiculous bonnet the perfect pink and white complexion the sheer innocent beauty of her as she sparkled with laughter and reached out a hand to me don solomon has shown me bowling and how to shoot ever so badly and entertained me for the cricket came so dull when you were not playing with those tedious kentish people popping away and hey says i astonished you mean you didnt see me bowl why no harry but we had the jolliest time among the sideshows with ices and hoopla she prattled on while the greaser raised his brows smiling from one to the other of us dear me says he i fear i have lured you from your duty dear mrs flashman forgive me he went on to me for i have the advantage of you still don solomon haslam to command and he nodded and flicked his handkerchief mr speedicut who i believe is your friend presented me to your so charming lady and i took the liberty of suggesting that we take a stroll if i had known you were to be put on but tell me any luck eh oh not too bad says i inwardly furious that while id been performing prodigies elspeth had been fluttering at this oily flammer felix pilch and mynn in three balls if you call it luck now my dear if mr solomon will excuse to my amazement he burst into laughter i would call it luck cries he that would be a daydream to be sure id settle for just one of ern well i didnt says i glaring at him i bowled felix caught out pilch and had mynn leg before which probably dont mean much to a foreigner good god cries he you dont mean it youre bamming us surely now lookee whoever you are but but oh my god he was fairly spluttering and suddenly he seized my hand and began pumping it his face alight my dear chap i cant believe it all three and to think i missed it he shook his head and burst out laughing again oh what a dilemma how can i regret an hour spent with the loveliest girl in london but oh mrs flashman what youve cost me why theres never been anything like it and to think that we were missing it all well well ive paid for my susceptibility to beauty to be sure well done my dear chap well done but this calls for celebration i was fairly taken aback at this while elspeth looked charmingly bewildered but nothing must do but he bore us off to where the liquor was and demanded of me action by action a description of how id bowled out the mighty three ive never seen a man so excited and ill own i found myself warming to him he clapped me on the shoulder and slapped his knee with delight when id done well im blessed why mrs flashman your husband aint just a hero hes a prodigy at which elspeth glowed and squeezed my hand which banished the last of my temper felix pilch and mynn extraordinary well i thought i was something of a cricketer in my humble way i played at eton you know we never had a match with rugby alas but i fancy id be a year or two before your time anyway old fellow but this quite beats everything it was fairly amusing not least for the effect it was having on elspeth here was this gaudy foreign buck whod come spooning round her damned little flirt that she was and now all his attention was for my cricket she was between exulting on my behalf and pouting at being overlooked but when we parted from the fellow with fulsome compliments and assurances that we must meet again soon on his side and fair affability on mine he won her heart by kissing her hand as though hed like to eat it i didnt mind by now he seemed not a bad sort for a breed and if hed been to eton he was presumably halfrespectable and obviously rolling in rhino all men slobbered over elspeth anyway so the great day ended which ill never forget for its own splendid sake felix pilch and mynn and those three earsplitting yells from the mob as each one fell it was a day that held the seed of great events too as youll see and the first tiny fruit was waiting for us when we got back to mayfair it was a packet handed in at the door and addressed to me enclosing bills for fifty pounds and a badlyprinted note saying with the compliments of d tighe esq of all the infernal impudence that bloody bookie or whatever he was having the starch to send cash to me as though i were some pro to be tipped id have kicked his backside to whitechapel and back or taken a cane to him for his presumption if hed been on hand since he wasnt i pocketed the bills and burned his letter its the only way to put these upstarts in their place to be sure it was very natural of h to pay some attention to the other ladies at lords for they were so forward in their admiration of him and am i to blame you less fortunate sisters he looked so tall and proud and handsome like the splendid english lion that he is that i felt quite faint with love and pride to think that this striking man the envy and admiration of all is my husband he is perfection and i love him more than i can tell still i could wish that he had been a little less attentive to those ladies near us who smiled and waved to him when he was in the field and some even so far forgot the obligations of modesty upon our tender sex as to call out to him of course it is difficult for him to appear indifferent so admired as he is and he has such an unaffected gallant nature and feels i know that he must acknowledge their flatteries for fear that he should be thought lacking in that easy courtesy which becomes a gentleman he is so generous and considerate even to such declasse persons as that odious mrs leo lade the dukes companion whose admiration of h was so open and shameless that it caused some remark and made me blush for her reputation which to be sure she hadnt any but hs simple boyish goodness can see no fault in anyone not even such an abandoned female as im sure she is for they say but i will not sully your fair page dear diary with such a paltry thing as mrs leo yet mention of her reminds me yet again of my duty to protect my dear one for he is still such a boy with all a boys naivetй and high spirit why today he looked quite piqued and furious at the attention shown to me by don sh who is quite sans reproche and the most distinguished of persons he has over fifty thousand a year it is said from estates and revenues in the far east indies and is on terms with the best in society and has been received by hm he is entirely english although his mother was a spanish donna i believe and is of the most engaging manners and address and the jolliest person besides i confess i was not a little amused to find how i captivated him which is quite harmless and natural for i have noticed that gentlemen of his complexion are even more ardent in their addresses to the fair than those of pure european blood poor h was not well pleased i fear but i could not help thinking it would do him no harm to be made aware that both sexes are wont to indulge in harmless gallantries and if he is to be admired by such as mrs ll he cannot object to the dons natural regard for me and to be sure they are not to be compared for don shs addresses are of the utmost discretion and niceness he is amusing with propriety engaging without familiarity no doubt we shall see much of him in society this winter but not so much i promise as will make my dear hero too jealous he has such sensibility it was eight months before i so much as gave a thought to cricket again but im bound to say that even if it had been blazing summer from october to march id still have been too busy you cant conduct a passionate affair with lola montez in which you fall foul of otto bismarck which is what i was doing that autumn and still have much time for recreation besides this was the season when my fame was at its zenith what with my visit to the palace for the kabul medal in consequence i was in demand everywhere and elspeth in her eagerness for the limelight saw to it that i never had a moments peace balls and parties and receptions and devil a minute for serious raking it was splendid of course to be the lion of the hour but confounded exhausting but little enough happened to the point of my story except that the stout don solomon haslam played an increasingly lively part in our doings that winter that was an odd fish decidedly nobody not even his old eton chums seemed to know much about him except that he was some kind of nabob with connections in leadenhall street but he was well received in society where his money and manners paid for all and he seemed to be right in the know wherever he went at the embassies the smart houses the sporting set even at the political dinners he was friendly with haddington and stanley at one end of the scale and with such rascals as deaf jim burke and brougham at tother one night he would be dining with aberdeen and the next at rosherville gardens or the cider cellars and he had a quiet gift of being first with the word from all quarters if you wanted to know what was behind the toll riots or the tale of peels velveteens ask solomon he had the latest joke about alice lowe or nelsons column could tell you beforehand about the new race cup for ascot and had songs from the bohemian girl played in his drawingroom months before the opera was seen in london it wasnt that he was a gossip or couchwhisperer either whatever way the talk turned he just knew the answers he ought to have been detestable but strangely enough he wasnt for he didnt push or show off his entertainment was lavish in his house on brook street where he gave a chinese party that was said to have cost twenty thou and was the talk for weeks and his appearance was what the ladies called romantic ive told you about the earring enough said but with it all he managed to appear modest and unaffected he could charm ill say that for him for he had the true gift of flattery which is to show the keenest possible interest and of course he had money to burn i didnt mind him much myself he went out of his way to be pleasant to me and once i had satisfied myself that his enthusiasm for elspeth wasnt likely to go the length i tolerated him she was ready to flirt with anything in breeches and more than flirt i suspected but there were horny captains i was far leerier of than the don that bastard watney for one and the lecherous snob ranelagh and i fancy young conyngham was itching after her too but solomon had no name as a rake didnt even keep a mistress apparently and did no damage round windmill street or any of my haunts leastways another odd thing he didnt touch liquor in any form oddest of all though was the way that my fatherinlaw took to him from time to time during that winter old morrison came south from his lair in paisley to inflict himself on us and carp about expense and it was during one of these visits that we had solomon to dine morrison took one look at the fashionable cut of his coat and newgate knockers sniffed and muttered about anither scented gommeril wi mair money than sense but before that dinner was through solomon had him eating out of his palm old morrison had started off on one of his usual happy harangues about the state of the nation so that for the first course we had cockaleekie soup halibut with oyster sauce and the income tax removed with minced chicken patties lamb cutlets and the mines act followed by a second course of venison in burgundy fricassee of beef and the chartists with grape ices bilberry tart and ireland for dessert then the ladies withdrew and over the port we had the miners strike and the general ruin of the country fine stuff all of it and my guvnor went to sleep in his chair while morrison held forth on the iniquity of those scoundrelly colliers who objected to having their infants dragging tubs naked through the seams for a mere fifteen hours a day its the infernal royal commission cries he makin mischief aye an itll spread mark me if bairns below the age o ten year is no tae work underground how long will it be afore theyre prohibitin their employment in factories will ye tell me damn that whippersnapper ashley eddicate them says he the eejit id eddicate them would i no an then theres the factory act thatll be the next thing the amendment cant pass for another two years says solomon quietly and morrison glowered at him how dye ken that its obvious surely we have the mines act which is all the country can digest for the moment but the shorter hours will come probably within two years certainly within three mr hornes report will see to that his easy certainty impressed morrison who wasnt used to being lectured on business however the mention of hornes name set him off again i gathered this worthy was to publish a paper on child employment which would inevitably lead to bankruptcies all round for deserving employers like my fatherinlaw with free beer and holidays for the paupers a workers rebellion and invasion by the french not quite so much perhaps smiles solomon but his report will raise a storm thats certain ive seen some of it yeve seen it cries morrison but its no oot till the new year he glowered a moment yere gey far ben sir he took an anxious gulp of port does it was there that is did ye chance tae see any mention o paisley maybe solomon couldnt be certain but said there was some shocking stuff in the report infants tied up and lashed unmercifully by overseers flogged naked through the streets when they were late in one factory theyd even had their ears nailed down for bad work its a lie bawls morrison knocking over his glass a damned lie never a bairn in oor shop had hand laid on it ma goad prayers at seeven an a cup o milk an a piece tae their dinner oot o ma ain pocket even a yard o yarn whiles as a gift an me near demented wi pilferin solomon soothed him by saying he was sure morrisons factories were paradise on earth but added gravely that between the horne report and slack trade generally he couldnt see many good pickings for manufacturers for some years to come overseas investment that was the thing why there were millions a year to be made out of the orient by men who knew their business and while morrison sniffed a bit and called it prospectus talk you could see he was interested despite himself he began to ask questions and argue and solomon had every answer pat i found it a dead bore and left them prosing away with my guvnor snoring and belching at the table head the most sensible noises id heard all night but later old morrison was heard to remark that yon young solomon had a heid on his shoothers richt enough a kenspeckle lad no like some that sauntered and drank awa their time an sponged off their betters etc one result of all this was that don solomon haslam was a more frequent visitor than ever dividing his time between elspeth and her sire which was perverse variety if you like he was forever talking far east trade with morrison urging him to get into it he even suggested that the old bastard should take a trip to see for himself which id have seconded nem con i wondered if perhaps solomon was some swell magsman trying to diddle the old rascal of a few thou some hopes if he was anyway they got along like a matched pair and since morrison was at this time expanding his enterprises and haslam was wellconnected in the city i dare say my dear relative found the acquaintance useful so winter and spring went by and then in june i had two letters one was from my uncle bindley at the horse guards to say that negotiations were under way to procure me a lieutenancy in the household cavalry this great honour he was careful to point out was due to my afghan heroics not to my social desirability which in his opinion was negligible he was from the paget side of our family you see and affected to despise us common flashmans which showed he had more sense than manners i was quite flown by this news and almost equally elated by the other letter which was from alfred mynn reminding me of his invitation to play in his casual side at canterbury id been having a few games for the montpeliers at the old beehive field and was in form so i accepted straight off it wasnt just for the cricket though i had three good reasons for wanting to be out of town just then first i had just encompassed lola montezs ruin on the london stage and had reason to believe that the mad bitch was looking for me with a pistol she was game for anything you know including murder secondly a female acrobat whom id been tupping was pretending that she was in foal and demanding compensation with tears and menaces and thirdly i recalled that mrs lade the dukes little piece was to be in canterbury for the cricket week so you can see a change of scene was just what old flashy needed if id known the change i was going to get id have paid off the acrobat let mrs lade go hang and allowed montez one clear shot at me running and thought myself lucky but we cant see into the future thank god id intended to go down to canterbury on my own but a week or so beforehand i happened to mention my visit to haslam in elspeths presence and right away he said famous just the thing he was keen as mustard on cricket himself and hed take a house there for the week we must be his guests he would get together a party and wed make a capital holiday of it he was like that expense was no object with him and in a moment he had elspeth clapping her hands with promises of picnic and dances and all sorts of junketings oh don how delightful cries she why it will be the jolliest thing and canterbury is the most select place i believe yes there is a regiment there but oh what shall i have to wear one needs a very different style out of london you see especially if many of our lunches are to be al fresco and some of the evening parties are sure to be out of doors oh but what about poor dear papa i should have added that another reason for my leaving london was to get away from old morrison who was still infesting our premises in fact hed been taken ill in may not fatally unfortunately he claimed it was overwork but i knew it was the report of the child employment commission which as don solomon had predicted had caused a shocking uproar when it came out for it proved that our factories were rather worse than the siberian salt mines names hadnt been named but questions were being asked in the commons and morrison was terrified that at any moment hed be exposed for the slavedriving swine he was so the little villain had taken to his bed more or less with an attack of the nervous guilts and spent his time damning the commissioners snarling at the servants and snuffing candles to save money of course haslam said he must come with us the change of air would do him good myself i thought a change from air was what the old pest required but there was nothing i could do about it and since my first game for mynns crew was on a monday afternoon it was arranged that the party should travel down the day before i managed to steer clear of that ordeal pleading business in fact young conyngham had bespoken a room at the magpie for a hanging on the monday morning but i didnt let on to elspeth about that don solomon convoyed the party to the station for the special hed engaged elspeth with enough trunks and bandboxes to start a new colony old morrison wrapped in rugs and bleating about the iniquity of travelling by railroad on the sabbath and judy my fathers bit watching the performance with her crooked little smile she and i never exchanged a word nowadays id rattled her in the old days when the guvnors back was turned but then shed called a halt and wed had a fine shouting turnup in which id blacked her eye since then wed been on civilsneer terms for the guvnors sake but since hed recently been carted away again to the bluedevil factory to have the booze bogies chased out of his brain judy was devoting her time to being elspeths companion oh we were a conventional little menage sure enough she was a handsome knowing piece and i squeezed her thigh for spite as i handed her into the carriage got a bloodfreezing glare for my pains and waved them farewell promising to meet them in canterbury by noon next day i forget who they hung on the monday and it dont matter anyway but it was the only newgate scragging i ever saw and i had an encounter afterwards which is part of my tale when i got to the magpie on sunday evening conyngham and his pals werent there having gone across to the prison chapel to see the condemned man attend his last service i didnt miss a great deal apparently for when they came back they were crying that it had been a dead bore just the chaplain droning away and praying and the murderer sitting in the black pen talking to the turnkey they didnt even have him sitting on his coffin cries conyngham i thought they always had his coffin in the pew with him damn you beresford you told me they did still taint every day you see a chap attend his own burial service says another dont you just wish you may look as lively at your own conners after that they all settled down to cards and boozing with a buffet supper that went on all evening and of course the girls were brought in snow hill sluts that i wouldnt have touched with a long pole i was amused to see that conyngham and the other younger fellows were in a rare sweat of excitement quite feverish they got in their wining and wenching and all because they were going to see a chap turned off it was nothing to me whod seen hangings beheadings crucifixions and the lord knows what in my wanderings my interest was to see an english felon crapped in front of an english crowd so in the meantime i settled down to йcartй with speedicut and by getting him well foxed i cleaned him out before midnight by then most of the company were threeparts drunk or snoring but they didnt sleep long for in the small hours the gallowsbuilders arrived and the racket they made as they hammered up the scaffold in the street outside woke everyone conyngham remembered then that he had a sheriffs order so we all trooped across to newgate to get a squint at the chap in the condemned cell and i remember how that boozy rowdy party fell silent once we were in newgate yard with the dank black walls crowding in on either side our steps sounding hollow in the stone passages breathing short and whispering while the turnkey grinned horribly and rolled his eyes to give conyngham his moneys worth i reckon the young sparks didnt get it though for all they saw in the end was a man lying fast asleep on his stone bench with his jailer resting on a mattress alongside one or two of our party having recovered their spunk by that time wanted to wake him up in the hope that hed rave and pray i suppose conyngham who was wilder than most broke a bottle on the bars and roared at the fellow to stir himself but he just turned over on his side and a little beadlelike chap in a black coat and tall hat came on the scene in a tearing rage to have us turned out vermin cries he stamping and red in the face have you no decency dear god and these are meant to be the leaders of the nation damn you damn you damn you all to hell he was incoherent with fury and vowed the turnkey would lose his place he absolutely threw conyngham out bodily but our bold boy wasnt abashed when hed done giving back curse for curse he made a drunken dash for the scaffold which was erected by now black beams barriers and all and managed to dance on the trap before the scandalized workmen threw him into the road his pals picked him up laughing and cheering and got him back to the magpie the crowd that was already gathering in the warm summer dawn grinned and guffawed as we went through though there were some black looks and cries of shame the first eelpiemen were crying their wares in the street and the vendors of tiny model gibbets and courvoisiers confession and pieces of rope from the last hanging were having their breakfast in lambs and the magpie common room waiting for the real mob to arrive the lower kind of priggers and whores were congregating and some family parties were already established at the windows making a picnic of it carters were putting their vehicles against the walls and offering places of vantage at sixpence a time the warehousemen and porters who had their business to do were damning the eyes of those who obstructed their work and the constables were sauntering up and down in pairs moving on the beggars and drunks and keeping a cold eye on the more obvious thieves and flashtails a blufflooking chap in clerical duds was watching with lively interest as conyngham was helped into the magpie and up the stairs he nodded civilly to me quiet enough so far says he and i noticed that he carried his right arm at an odd angle and his hand was crooked and waxy i wonder sir if i might accompany your party he gave me his name but im shot if i recall it now i didnt mind so he came abovestairs into the wreck of our front room with the remains of the nights eating and drinking being cleared away and breakfast set and the sluts being chivvied out by the waiters complaining shrilly most of our party were looking pretty seedy and didnt make much of the chops and kidneys at all first time for most of them says my new acquaintance interesting sir most interesting at my invitation he helped himself to cold beef and we talked and ate in one of the windows while the crowd below began to increase until the whole street was packed tight as far as you could see both sides of the scaffold a great seething mob with the peelers guarding the barriers and hardly room enough for the dippers and mobsmen to ply their trade there must have been every class of mortal in london there all the dross of the underworld rubbing shoulders with tradesmen and city folk clerks and counter jumpers family men with children perched on their shoulders beggar brats scampering and tugging at sleeves a lords carriage against a wall and the mob cheering as its stout occupant was heaved on to the roof by his coachmen every window was jammed with onlookers at two quid a time there were galleries on the roofs with seats to let and even the gutters and lampbrackets had people clinging to them a ragged little urchin came swinging along the magpies wall like a monkey he clung to our windowledge with naked grimy toes and fingers his great eyes staring at our plates my companion held out a chop to him and it vanished in a twinkling into the ugly chewing face someone hailed from beneath our window and i saw a burly pugnosed fellow looking up my crookedarm chap shouted down to him but the noise and hooting and laughter of the crowd was too much for conversation and presently my companion gave up and says to me thought he might be here capital writer just you watch put us all in the shade presently did you follow miss tickletoby last summer from which ive since deduced that the cove beneath our window that day was mr william makepeace thackeray that was my closest acquaintance with him though its a solemn thought went on my companion that if executions were held in churches wed never lack for congregations probably get much the same people as we do now dont you think ah there we are as he spoke the bell boomed and the mob below began to roar off the strokes in unison one two three until the eighth peal when there was a tremendous hurrah which echoed between the buildings and then died away in a sudden fall broken only by the shrill wail of an infant my companion whispered st sepulchres bell begins to toll the lord have mercy on his soul as the chatter of the crowd grew again we looked across that craning sea of humanity to the scaffold and there were the constables hurrying out of the debtors door from the jail with the prisoner bound between them up the steps and on to the platform the prisoner seemed to be halfasleep they didnt either but began to stamp and yell and jeer drowning out the clergymans prayer while the executioner made fast the noose slipped a hood over the condemned mans head and stood by to slip the bolt there wasnt a sound now until a drunk chap sings out good health jimmy and there were cries and laughter and everyone stared at the whitehooded figure under the beam waiting dont watch him whispers my friend look at your companions i did glancing along at the next window every face staring every mouth open motionless some grinning some pale with fear some in an almost vacant ecstasy keep watching em says he and pat on his words came the rattle and slam of the drop an almighty yell from the crowd and every face at the next window was eagerly alight with pleasure speedicut grinning and crowing beresford sighing and moistening his lips spottswoods heavy face set in grim satisfaction while his fancy woman clung giggling to his arm and pretended to hide her face interesting what says the man with the crooked arm he put on his hat tapped it down and nodded amiably well im obliged to you sir and off he went across the street the whitecapped body was spinning slowly beneath the trap a constable on the platform was holding the rope and directly beneath me the outskirts of the crowd was dissolving into the taverns over in a corner of the room conyngham was being sick i went downstairs and stood waiting for the crowd to thin but most of em were still waiting in the hopes of catching a glimpse of the hanging corpse which they couldnt see for the throng in front i was wondering how far id have to walk for a hack when a man loomed up in front of me and after a moment i recognized the red face button eyes and flash weskit of mr daedalus tighe veil veil sir cries he here ve are again i hears as youre off to canterbury yell youll give em better sport than that ill be bound and he nodded towards the scaffold did you ever see poorer stuff mr flashman not vorth the vatchin sir not vorth the vatchin not a word out o him no speech no repentance not even a struggle blow me thats not

theyll ave the teeth out yore ead less you looks sharp scandalous sir vot you needs a cab thats vot you need he gave a nod a burly brute close by gave a piercing whistle and before you could wink there was a hack pushing through the crowd its driver belabouring all who didnt clear out fast enough the burly henchman leaped to the horses head another held the door and mr tighe hat in hand was ushering me in beaming wider than ever an the werry best o luck this arternoon sir cries he youll bowl them irreglars aht in no time ill wager an he winked again i do ope as you carries your bat mr flashman london bridge cabby and away went the cab carrying a very thoughtful gentleman you may be sure i considered the remarkable mr tighe all the way to canterbury too and concluded that if he was fool enough to throw money away that was his businesswhat kind of odds could he hope to get on my losing my wicket for after all i batted well down the list and might easily carry my bat through the hand whod wager above three hundred on that well that was his concern not mine but id have to keep a close eye on him and not become entangled with his sort at least he wasnt expecting me to throw the game but quite the reverse he was trying to bribe me to do well in fact the upshot of it was i bowled pretty well for mynns eleven and when i went to the wicket to bat i stuck to my blockhole like glue to the disappointment of the spectators who expected me to slog i was third last man in so i didnt have to endure long and as mynn himself was at tother end knocking off the runs my behaviour was perfectly proper we won by two wickets flashy not out nil and next morning after breakfast there was a plain packet addressed to me with three hundred in bills inside i near as a toucher sealed it up again and told the footman to give it back to whoever had brought it but i didnt warm work but three hundred is three hundred and it was a gift wasnt it i could always deny id ever seen it god i was an innocent then for all my campaign experience this of course took place at the house which haslam had taken just outside canterbury very splendid gravel walks fine lawns shrubbery and trees gaslight throughout beautifullyappointed rooms best of food and drink flunkeys everywhere and goasyouplease there were about a dozen house guests for it was a great rambling place and haslam had seen to every comfort he gave a sumptuous party on that first monday night at which mynn and felix were present and the talk was all cricket of course but there were any number of ladies too including mrs leo lade smouldering at me across the table from under a heap of sausage curls and in a dress so dйcolletй that her udders were almost in her soup thats one over well bowl this week that wont be a maiden thinks i and flashed my most loving smile to elspeth who was sparkling radiantly beside don solomon at the top of the table presently however her sparkle was wiped clean away for don solomon was understood to say that this week would be his last fling in england he was leaving at the end of the month to visit his estates in the east and had no notion when he would return it might be years he said at which there were genuine expressions of sorrow round the table for those assembled knew a dripping roast when they saw one without the lavish don solomon there would be one luxurious establishment less for the society hyenas to guzzle at elspeth was quite put out but dear don solomon what shall we do oh youre teasing why your tiresome estates will do admirably without you for im sure you employ only the cleverest people to look after them she pouted prettily you would not be so cruel to your friends surely mrs lade we shant let him shall we solomon laughed and patted her hand my dear diana says he diana had been his nickname for her ever since hed tried to teach her archery you may be sure nothing but harsh necessity would take me from such delightful company as your own and harrys yonder and all of you but a man must work and my work is overseas so and he shook his head his smooth handsome face smiling ruefully it will be a sore wrench sorest of all in that i shall miss both of you and he looked from elspeth to me and back again above all the rest for you have been to me like a brother and sister and damme the fellows great dark eyes were positively glistening the rest of the table murmured sympathetically all but old morrison who was champing away at his blancmange and finding bones in it by the sound of him at this elspeth was so overcome that she began piping her eye and her tits shook so violently that the old duke on solomons other side coughed his false teeth into his wine glass and had to be put to rights by the butler solomon for once was looking a little embarrassed he shrugged and gave me a look that was almost appealing im sorry old boy says he but i mean it i couldnt fathom this he might be sorry to miss elspeth what man wouldnt but had i been so friendly well id been civil enough and i was her husband perhaps that charming manner of mine which tom hughes mentioned had had its effect on this emotional dago anyway something seemed called for well don says i well all be sorry to lose you and thats a fact youre a damned stout chap that is i mean youre one of the best and couldnt be better if if you were english i wasnt going to gush all over him you understand but the company murmured hear hear and after a moment mynn tapped the table to second me well says i lets drink his health then and everyone did while solomon gave me his bland smile inclining his head i know says he just how great a compliment that is i thank you all of you and especially you my dear harry i only wish and then he stopped shaking his head but no that would be too much to ask oh ask anything don cries elspeth all idiotimploring you know we could not refuse you he said no no it had been a foolish thought and at that of course she was all over him to know what it was so after a moment toying with his wineglass he says well youll think it a very silly notion i daresay but what i was about to propose my dear diana for harry and yourself and for your father whom i count among my wisest friends and he inclined his head to old morrison who was assuring mrs lade that he didnt want any blancmange but hed like anither helpin o yon cornflour puddin i was about to say since i must go why do the three of you not come with me and he smiled shyly at us in turn i stared at the fellow to see if he was joking elspeth all blonde bewilderment looked at me and then at solomon openmouthed come with you its only to the other side of the world after all says he whimsically no no i am quite serious it is not as bad as that you know me well enough to understand that i wouldnt propose anything that you would not find delightful we should cruise in my steambrig its as wellappointed as any royal yacht you know and wed have the most splendid holiday we would touch wherever we liked lisbon cadiz the cape bombay madras exactly as the fancy took us oh it would be quite capital he leaned towards elspeth smiling think of the places wed see the delight it would give me diana to show you the wonder of africa as one sees it at dawn from the quarterdeck such colours as you cannot imagine the shores of the indian ocean yes the coral strand ah believe me until you have anchored off singapore or cruised the tropical coasts of sumatra and java and borneo and seen that glorious china sea where it is always morning oh my dear you have seen nothing nonsense of course the orient stinks always did but elspeth was gazing at him in rapture and then she turned eagerly to me oh harry could we out o the question says i its the back of beyond in these days cries solomon why with steam you may be in singapore in oh three months at most say three months as my guests while we visit my estates and you would learn diana what it means to be a queen in the orient i assure you and three months to return youd be home again by next easter oh harry elspeth was positively squeaking with joy oh harry may we oh please harry the chaps at the table were nodding admiringly and the ladies murmuring enviously the old duke was heard to say that it was an adventure damned if it wasnt and if he was a younger man by george wouldnt he jump at the chance well they werent getting me east again once had been enough besides i wasnt going anywhere on the charity of some rich dago showoff whod taken a shine to my wife and there was another reason which enabled me to put a good face on my refusal cant be done mdear says i sorry but im a soldier with a living to make duty and the life guards call what im desolate to deny you what im sure would be the jolliest trip i felt a pang ill admit at seeing that lovely child face fall but i cant go you see im afraid don well have to decline your kind offer he shrugged goodhumouredly thats settled then a pity but he smiled consolingly at elspeth who was looking downinthemouth perhaps another year unless in harrys enforced absence your father could be persuaded to accompany us it was said so natural it took my breath away but as it sank home i had to bite back an angry refusal you bastard thinks i thats the game is it wait till old flashys put himself out of the running and then innocently propose a scheme to get my wife far away where you can cock a leg over her at leisure it was plain as a pikestaff all my dormant suspicions of this smooth tub of nigger suet came back with a rush but i kept mum while elspeth looked down the table towards me and bless her it was a doubtful look but but it would be no fun without harry says she and if ever i loved the girl it was then i i dont know what does papa say papa who appeared to be still tunnelling away at his pudding had missed nothing you may be sure but he kept quiet while solomon explained the proposal you remember sir we spoke of the possibility that you might accompany me to the east to see for yourself the opportunities of business expansion he was adding but morrison cut him short in his charming way you spoke of it no me says he busily engulfing blancmange ive mair than enough o affairs here withoot gallivantin tae china at my time o life he waved his spoon forbye husband an wife should be thegither it was bad enough when harry yonder had tae be away in india an my wee lassie near heartbroken he made a noise which the company took for a sentimental sniff myself i think it was another spoonful being pried loose na na ill need a guid reason afore ill stir forth o england and he got it to this day i cant be certain that it was contrived by solomon but ill wager it was for next morning the old hound was taken ill again i dont know if surfeit of blancmange can cause nervous collapse but by afternoon he was groaning in bed shuddering as with a fever and solomon insisted on summoning his own medico from town a dundrearylooking cove with a handle to his name and a line in unctuous gravity that must have been worth five thousand a year in mayfair he looked down solemnly at the sufferer who was huddled under the clothes like a rat in its burrow two beady eyes in a wrinkled face and his nose quivering in apprehension overstrained says the sawbones when he had completed his examination and caught the tune of morrisons whimpering the system is simply tired that is all of organic deterioration there is no sign whatever internally my dear sir you are sound as i am as i hope i am haha he beamed like a bishop but the machine while not in need of repair requires a rest a long rest is it serious docter quavers morrison internally as the quack said he might be in al trim but his exterior suggested james i dying certainly not unless you make it so says the poulticewalloper he shook his head in censorious admiration you captains of commerce you sacrifice yourselves without thought for personal health as you labour for family and country and mankind but my dear sir it wont do you know you forget that there is a limit and you have reached it could ye no gi me a line for a boatle croaks the captain of commerce and when this had been translated the medico shook his head i can prescribe says he but no medicine could be as efficacious as oh a few months in the italian lakes or on the french coast warmth sunshine rest complete rest in congenial company that is my line for you sir i wont be answerable for the consequences if you dont take it well there it was in two seconds i had foreseen what was to follow solomons recollection that he had only yesterday proposed just such a holiday the quacks booming agreement that a sea voyage in comfort was the ideal thing morrisons reluctance being eventually overborne by elspeths entreaties and the pillslingers stern admonition you could have set it all to music and sung the damned thing then they all looked at me and i said no there followed painful private scenes between elspeth and me i said if old morrison wanted to sail away with don solomon he was more than welcome she replied that it was unthinkable for dear papa to go without her to look after him it was absolutely her duty to accept don solomons generous offer and accompany the old goat if i insisted on staying at home in the army of course she would be desolate without me but why oh why could i not come anyway what did the army matter we had money enough and so forth i said no again and added that it was a piece of impudence of solomons even to suggest that she should go without me at which she burst into tears and said i was odiously jealous not only of her but of don solomons breeding and address and money just because i hadnt any myself and i was spitefully denying her a little pleasure and there could be no possible impropriety with dear papa to chaperon her and i was trying to shovel the old sod into an early grave or words to that effect i left her wailing and when solomon tried to persuade me later himself took the line that military duty made the trip impossible for me and i couldnt bear to be parted from elspeth he sighed but said he understood only too well in my shoes he said with disarming frankness hed do the same i wondered for a moment if i had wronged him for i know i tend to judge everyone by myself and while im usually not far wrong to do so there are decent and disinterested folk about here and there ive seen some old morrison by the way didnt say a word he could have forced my hand of course but being as true a presbyterian hypocrite as ever robbed an orphan he held that a wife should abide by her husbands rule and wouldnt interfere between elspeth and me so i continued to say no and elspeth sulked until the time came to put on her next new bonnet so a couple of days passed in which i played cricket for mynns side tumbling a few wickets with my shiverers and slogging a few runs meanwhile elspeth basked in admiration and the gay life solomon was the perfect host and escort old morrison sat on the terrace grumbling and reading sermons and share prices and judy promenaded with elspeth looking cattish and saying nothing then on friday things began to happen and as so often is the case with catastrophe all went splendidly at first all week id been trying to arrange an assignation with the tantalizing mrs leo lade but what with my own busy affairs and the fact that the old duke kept a jealous eye on her id been out of luck it was just a question of time and place for she was as ready as i indeed wed near got to grips on the monday after dinner when we strolled in the garden but id no sooner got her panting among the privet with her teeth halfway through my ear than that blasted minx judy came to summon us to hear elspeth sing the ash grove in the drawingroom it would be judy smiling her knowing smile telling us to be sure not to miss the treat however on friday morning elspeth went off with solomon to visit some picture gallery judy was shopping with some of the guests the house was empty except for old morrison on the terrace and mrs lade bowled up presently to say that the duke was abed with an attack of gout for shows sake we made small talk with morrison which infuriated him and then went our separate ways in leisurely fashion meeting again in the drawingroom in a fine frenzy of fumbling and escaping steam we werent new to the business either of us so i had her breasts out with one hand and my breeches down with the other while i was still kicking the door to and she completed her undressing while we were positively humping the mutton all the way to the couch which argued sound training on her part by george she was a heavy woman but nimble as an eel for all her elegant poundage i cant think offhand of a partner who could put you through as many different mountingodrills in the course of one romp except perhaps elspeth herself when she had a drink in her it was exhilarating work and i was just settling myself for the finish and thinking well have to have more of this another time when i heard a sound that galvanized me so suddenly that its a wonder the couch didnt give way rapid footsteps were approaching the drawingroom door i took stock breeches down one shoe off miles from the window or any convenient cover mrs lade kneeling on the couch me peering from behind through her feathered headdress the doorknob turning caught hopeless not a chance of escape nothing for it but to hide my face in the nape of her neck and trust that the visible side of me wouldnt be recognized by whoever came in for they wouldnt linger not in unless it was the duke and those footsteps didnt belong to a gout patient the door opened the footsteps stopped and then there was what a lady novelist would call a pregnant pause lasting about three hours it seemed to me and broken only by mrs lades ecstatic moanings i gathered she was unaware that we were observed i stole a peep through her feathers at the mirror above the fireplace and almost had convulsions for it was solomon reflected in the doorway his hand on the latch taking in the scene he never even blinked an eye then as other footsteps sounded somewhere behind him he stepped back and as the door closed i heard him saying no there is no one here let us try the conservatory dago or not he was a damned considerate host that one the door hadnt closed before i was trying to disengage but without success for mrs lades hands reached back in an instant clamping her claws into my rear her head tilting back beside mine no no no not yet gasps she chewing away at me dont go the door i explained must lock the door someone might see dont leave me she cried and i doubt if she knew where she was even for her eyes were rolling in her head and damned if i could get loose mind you i was reluctant torn two ways as it were the key i mumbled thrusting away only take a moment back directly take me with you she moans and i did heaven knows how hobbling along with all that flesh to carry fortunately it all ended happily just as my legs gave way and we collapsed at the threshold in joyous exhaustion i even managed to get the key turned whether she could dress as quickly as she stripped i cant say for she was still swooning and gasping against the panels with her feathers awry when i flung on my last garment and shinned down the ivy feverish work it had been and the sooner i was elsewhere establishing an alibi the better a brisk walk was what i needed just then anyway i had a match in the afternoon and wanted to be in trim never have i felt so guilty and yet what could i do my heart warned me when don s cut short our visit to the gallery and there were some exquisite watercolours which i would have liked to view at leisure that he had some purpose in returning early to the house what my foreboding was i cannot explain but alas it was justified and i am the most wretched creature in the world the house was quite deserted except for papa asleep on the terrace and something in don ss manner it may have been the ardent expression in his eyes led me to insist that we should seek out my dear h at once oh would that we had found him we looked everywhere but there was no one to be seen and when we came to the conservatory don s filled me with alarm and shame by declaring himself in the most forward manner for the atmosphere of the plants being extremely oppressive and my own agitation made me feel so faint that i was forced to support myself by leaning on his arm and find relief by resting my head on his shoulder in that moment of faintness picture my utter distress when he took advantage of the situation to press his lips to mine i was so affronted that it was a moment before i could find the strength to make him desist and it was only with difficulty that i at last escaped his embrace he used the most passionate expressions to me calling me his dear diana and his golden nymph and the effect was so weakening that i was unable to resist when he clasped me to his bosom yet again and kissed me with even greater force than before fortunately one of the gardeners was heard approaching and i was able to make good my retreat with my wits quite disordered my shame and remorse may be imagined and if aught could have increased them it was the sudden sight of my darling h in the garden taking his exercise he explained before his match in the afternoon the sight of his flushed manly countenance and the knowledge that he had been engaged in such a healthy innocent pursuit while i had been helpless in the heated embrace of another however much against my will were as a knife in my heart to make it worse he called me his jolly old girl and asked eagerly after the picture gallery i was moved almost to tears and when we went together to the terrace and found mrs ll i could not but remark that h paid her no more than the barest civility but was all kindness and attentiveness to me like the dear best of husbands that he is but what am ito think of don ss conduct i must try not to judge him too harshly for he is of such a warm temperament and given to passionate disclosure of it in every way that it is not to be wondered at if he is susceptible to that which he finds attractive but surely i am not to blame if through no fault of mine i have been cast by kind nature in a form and feature which the stronger sex find pleasing i console myself with the thought that it is womans portion if she is fortunate in her endowments to be adored and she has little to reproach herself with so long as she does not encourage familiarity but comports herself with proper modesty theres no doubt that a good gallop before work is the best training you can have for that afternoon i bowled the best long spell of my life for mynns casuals against the allengland xi five wickets for in eleven overs with lillywhite leg before and marsden clean bowled amongst them id never have done that on cold baths and dumbbells so you can see that what our present test match fellows need is some sporting female like mrs leo lade to look after em then wed have the australians begging for mercy the only small cloud on my horizon as we took tea afterwards in the marquee among the fashionable throng with elspeth clinging to my arm and mynn passing round bubbly in the challenge cup wed won was whether solomon had recognized me in the drawingroom that morning and if so would he keep his mouth shut i wasnt over concerned for all hed had in view was my stalwart back and buttocks heaving away and mrs lades stupefied face reflected in the mirror it didnt matter a threehapenny what he said about her and even if hed recognized me as tother coupler it wasnt likely that hed bruit it about chaps didnt in those days and there wasnt even a hint of a knowing twinkle in his eye as he came over to congratulate me all cheery smiles refilling my glass and exclaiming to elspeth that her husband was the most tearaway bowler in the country and ought to be in the allengland side himself blessed if he shouldnt a few of those present cried hear hear and solomon wagged his head admiringly the artful conniving scoundrel dye know says he addressing those nearest who included many of his house party as well as mynn and felix and ponsonbyfane i shouldnt wonder if harry wasnt the fastest man in england just now i dont say the best in deference to distinguished company and he bowed gracefully towards mynn but certainly the quickest what dyou think mr felix felix blinked and blushed as he always did at being singled out and said he wasnt sure when he was at the crease he added gravely he didnt consider miles per hour but any batter who faced mynn at one end and me at tother would have something to tell his grandchildren about everyone laughed and solomon cries lucky men indeed wouldnt tyro cricketers like himself just jump at the chance of facing a few overs from us not that theyd last long to be sure but the honour would be worth it i dont suppose he added fingering his earring and looking impish at me youd consider playing me a singlewicket match would you being cheerful with bubbly and my five for i laughed and said id be glad to oblige but hed better get himself cover from lloyds or a suit of armour why says i dyou fancy your chance and he shrugged and said no not exactly he knew he mightnt make much of a show but he was game to try after all says he tongue in cheek you aint fuller pilch as a batter you know there are moments and they have a habit of sticking in memory when lighthearted easy fun suddenly becomes dead serious i can picture that moment now the marquee with its throng of men in their whites the ladies in their bright summer confections the stuffy smell of grass and canvas the sound of the tentflap stirring in the warm breeze the tinkle of plates and glasses the chatter and the polite laughter elspeth smiling eagerly over her strawberries and cream mynns big red face glistening and solomon opposite me huge and smiling in his bottlegreen coat the emerald pin in his scarf the brown varnished face with its smiling dark eyes the carefullydressed black curls and whiskers the big delicatelymanicured hand spinning his glass by the stem just for fun says he give me something to boast about anyway play on my lawn at the house come on and he poked me in the ribs i dare you harry at which they chortled and said he was a game bird all right i didnt know then that it mattered although something warned me that there was a hint of humbug about it but with the champagne working and elspeth miaowing eagerly i couldnt see any harm very good says i theyre your ribs you know how many a side oh just the two of us says he no fieldsmen bounds of course but no byes or overthrows im not built for chasing and he patted his guts smiling couple of hands what double my chance of winning a run or two what about stakes laughs mynn cant have a match like this for just a tizzy winking at me what you will says solomon easily all one to me fiver pony monkey thou dont matter since i shant be winning it anyway now thats the kind of talk that sends any sensible man diving for his hat and the nearest doorway usually otherwise you find yourself an hour later scribbling ious and trying to think of a false name but this was different after all i was firstclass and he wasnt even thought about no one had seen him play even he couldnt hope for anything against my expresses and one thing was sure he didnt need my money hold on though says i we aint all nabob millionaires you know lieutenants halfpay dont stretch elspeth absolutely reached for her reticule damn her whispering that i must afford whatever don solomon put up and while i was trying to hush her solomon says not a bit of it ill wager the thou on my side its my proposal after all so i must be ready to stand the racket harry can put up what he pleases what dye say old boy well everyone knew he was filthy rich and careless with it so if he wanted to lose a thousand for the privilege of having me trim him up i didnt mind i couldnt think what to offer as a wager against his money though and said so well make it a pint of ale says he and then snapped his fingers tell you what ill name what your stakes to be and i promise you if you lose and have to stump up its something that wont cost you a penny whats that says i all leery in a moment are you game cries he tell us my stake first says i well you cant cry off now anyway says he beaming triumphantly its this a thou on my side if you win and if i win which youll admit aint likely he paused to keep everyone in suspense if i win youll allow elspeth and her father to come on my voyage he beamed round at the company whats fairer than that i should like to know the barefaced sauce of it took my breath away here was this fat upstart with his nigger airs who had proclaimed his interest in my wife and proposed publicly to take her jaunting while i was left cuckolded at home had been properly and politely warned off and was now back on the same tack but trying to pass it off as a jolly lighthearted game my skin burned with fury had he cooked this up with elspeth but one glance told me she was as astonished as i was others were smiling though and i saw two ladies whispering behind their parasols mrs lade was watching with amusement well well don says i deliberately easy you dont give up in a hurry do you oh come harry cries he what hope have i its just nonsense for youre sure to win doesnt he always win mrs lade and he looked at her smiling and then at me and at elspeth without a flicker of expression by god had he recognized my heaving stern in the drawingroom after all and was he daring to say accept my wager give me this chance or ill blow the gaff i didnt know but it made no odds for i realized i had to take him on for my credits sake what flashy the heroic sport back down against a mere tyro and thereby proclaim that he was jealous of his wife where this fat swaggerer was concerned no i had to play and look pleasant he had as the duke would say humbugged me by god but what was he hoping for a fluke in a million singlewickets a chancy game but even so he couldnt hope to beat me and yet he was so set on having his way like the spoiled arrogant pup he was that any chance however slim hed snatch at hed nothing to lose except a thousand quid and that was hapence to him very well then id not only beat the brute id milk him for the privilege done then says i cheerfully but since youve set my stake ill set yours if you lose itll cost you two thousand not one suit you of course he had to agree laughing and saying i drove such a hard bargain i must give him the tie as well which meant that if the scores finished even i would forfeit my stake i had to win to collect but it was a trivial thing since i was bound to drub him handsomely just to be sure though i asked felix then and there if hed stand umpire i wasnt having some creature of solomons handing him the game in a box so the match was made and elspeth had the grace not to say she hoped i would lose indeed she confided later that she thought don solomon had been just a little sharp and not quite refined in taking her for granted for you know harry i would never accompany him with papa against your wishes but if you choose to accept his wager that is different and oh it would be such fun to see india and all those splendid places but of course you must play your best and not lose on my account dont worry old girl says i climbing aboard her i shant that was before dinner by bedtime i wasnt so sure i was taking a turn about the grounds while the others were at their port and had just strolled abreast the gates when someone goes psst from the shadows and to my astonishment i saw two or three dark figures lurking in the roadway one of them advanced and i choked on my cheroot when i recognized the portly frame of daedalus tighe heskwire what the devil are you doing here i demanded id seen the brute at one or two of the games but naturally had avoided him he touched his hat glanced about in the dusk and asked for a word with me if he might make so bold i told him to go to blazes oh never that sir says he you

of ow cockahoop mr haslamll be eh itll be such a hunexpected surprise for im and with that he faded into the darkness i heard his beery chuckle as he and his bullies went down the road when id got over my indignation my first thought was that haslam was behind this but saner judgement told me he wouldnt be such a fool only young idiots like me got hooked by the likes of daedalus tighe god what a purblind ass id been ever to touch his dirty money he could make a scandal not a doubt of that and i didnt question either that he was capable of setting his roughs on to waylay me some dark night what the devil was i to do if i didnt let haslam win no by god i was shot if i would let him go fornicating round the world with elspeth while i rotted in my tin belly at st jamess not likely but if i beat him tighe would split for certain and his thugs would pulp me in some alley one fine night you can understand that i didnt go to bed in any good temper and i didnt sleep much either it never rains but it pours though i was still wrestling with my dilemma next morning when i received another blow this time through the smirking agency of miss judy the guvnors trull i had been out on the gravel watching solomons gardeners roll the wicket on the main lawn for our match smoking furiously and drumming my fingers and then took a restless turn round the house judy was sitting in one of the arbours reading a journal she didnt so much as glance up as i walked by ignoring her and then her voice sounded coolly behind me looking for mrs leo lade that was a nasty start to begin with i stopped and turned to look at her she leafed over a page and went on i shouldnt if i were you she isnt receiving this morning i fancy what the devil have i to do with her says i thats what the duke is asking i dare say says miss judy giving the journal her sly smile he has not directed his inquiries to you as yet well well all in good time no doubt and she went on reading cool as bedd while my heart went like a hammer what the hell are you driving at says i and when she didnt answer i lost my temper and knocked the paper from her hand ah thats my little man says she and now she was looking at me sneering in scornful pleasure are you going to strike me as well youd best not there are people within call and it would never do for them to see the hero of kabul assaulting a lady would it not lady says i sluts the word its what the duke called mrs lade they tell me says she and rose gracefully to her feet picking up her parasol and spreading it you mean you havent heard you will though soon enough ill hear it now says i and gripped her arm by god if you or anyone else is spreading slanders about me youll answer for it ive nothing to do with mrs lade or the duke dyou hear no she looked me up and down with her crooked smile and suddenly jerked her arm free then mrs lade must be a liar which i dare say she is what dyou mean youll tell me this instant or oh i wouldnt deny myself the pleasure says she i like to see you wriggle and mouth first though well then a little bird from the dukes hotel tells me that he and mrs lade quarrelled violently last night as i believe they frequently do his gout you know there were raised voices his at first and then hers and all manner of names called you know how these things develop im sure just a little domestic scene but im afraid mrs lade is a stupid woman because when the talk touched on his graces capabilities how it did i cant imagine she was illadvised enough to mention your name and make unflattering comparisons miss judy smiled sweetly and patted her auburn curls affectedly she must be singularly easy to please i think not to say foolish to taunt her admirer so in any event his grace was so tender as to be jealous its a damned lie ive never been near the bitch ah well no doubt she is confusing you with someone else it is probably difficult for her to keep tally however i dare say his grace believed her jealous lovers usually think the worst of course we must hope he will forgive her but his forgiveness wont include you ill be bound and shut your lying mouth cries i its all false if that slattern has been lying about me or if you are making up this malicious gossip to discredit me by god ill make you both wish youd never been born again youre quoting the duke a hottempered old gentleman it seems he spoke at the top of his voice according to a guest at the hotel of setting a prizefighter on to you it seems he is the backer of some persons called gaunt and the great gun but i dont know about such things has elspeth heard this foul slander i shouted if i thought she would believe it i would tell her myself says the malicious tart the sooner she knows what a hound she has married the better but shes stupid enough to worship you most of the time whether shell still find you so attractive when the dukes pugilists have done with you is another matter she sighed contentedly and turned away up the path dear me youre shaking harry and you will need a steady hand you know for your match with don solomon everyone is so looking forward to it she left me in a fine state of rage and apprehension as you can imagine it almost passed belief that the idiot heifer lade had boasted to her protector of her bout with me but some women are stupid enough for anything especially when tempers are flying and now that doddering vindictive old pander of a duke would sick his bullies onto me on top of tighes threats of the previous evening it was the wrong side of enough couldnt the selfish old lecher realize that his flashtail needed a young mount from time to time to keep her in running condition but here i was under clouds from all directions still undecided what i should do in my match with solomon and at that moment mynn hove up to bear me away to the pitch for the great encounter i wasnt feeling like cricket one little bit our party and a fair number of local quality riffraff were already arranging themselves on chairs and couches set on the gravel before the house the duke and mrs lade werent there thank god probably still flinging furniture at each other in the hotel but elspeth was the centre of attraction with judy at her side looking as though shed just swallowed the last of the cream tattling trollop i gritted my teeth and vowed id be even with her yet on the other sides of the lawn was the popular mob for solomon had thrown open his grounds for the occasion and had set up a marquee where free beer and refreshments were being doled out to the thirsty well if the damned showoff wanted to let em see him being thoroughly beat that was his business oh christ though was i going to beat him and to compound my confusion what should i see among a group of flash coves under the trees but the scarlet weskit and face of daedalus tighe heskwire come to oversee his great coup no doubt he had some likelylooking hard cases with him too all punishing the ale and chortling breakfast disagree with you flashy says mynn you lock a mite peaky hollo though theres your opponent all ready come along solomon was already on the lawn very businesslike in corduroys and pumps with a straw hat on his black head smiling at me and shaking hands while the swells clapped politely and the popular crowd shouted and rattled their pots i stripped off my coat and donned my pumps and then little felix spun the bat i called blade and so it was very good says i to solomon youll bat first capital cries he with a flash of teeth then may the better man win he will says i and called for the ball while solomon rot his impudence went across to elspeth and made great play of having her wish him luck he even had the gall to ask her for her handkerchief to tie in his belt for i must carry the ladys colours you know cries he making a great joke of it of course she obliged him and then catching my glare fluttered that of course i must carry her colours too to show no favouritism but she hadnt another wipe so the minx judy said she must borrow hers to give me and i finished up with that sly sluts snotrag in my belt and she sitting with her acid tongue in her cheek we went out to the wicket together and felix gave solomon guard he took his time over it too patting his blockhole and feeling the pitch before him very businesslike while i fretted and swung my arm it was spongy turf i realized so i wasnt going to get much play out of it no doubt solomon had taken that into account too much good might it do him play calls felix and a hush fell round the lawn everyone expectant for the first ball i tightened my belt while solomon waited in his turn and then let him have one of my hardest ill swear he went pale as it shot past his shins and went first bounce into the bushes the mob cheered and i turned and bowled again the spectators yelled in amazement and by george they werent alone i flung down my bat cursing solomon stared in disbelief halfdelighted halffrowning i believe you did that on purpose cries he did i says i furious id meant to hit him into the next county but aint it the way if a task is too easy we botch it often as not i could have kicked myself for my carelessness thinking like a cricketer you understand for with runs in it i might easily lose the match now the question was did i want to there was tighes red waistcoat under the trees on the other hand there was elspeth looking radiant clapping her gloved hands and crying well played while solomon tipped his hat gracefully and i tried to put on a good face by jove though it was him she was looking at no doubt picturing herself under a tropic moon already with inconvenient old flashy safely left behind no by god to the devil with tighe and his threats and blackmail i was going to win this match and be damned to everyone we had a sandwich and a glass while the swells chattered round us and the canterbury professional rubbed embrocation on solomons knee splendid game old fellow cries the don raising his lemonade in my direction ill have some more of my lobs for you directly i laughed and said i hoped they werent such twisters as his first one for it had had me all at sea and he absolutely looked pleased the bloody farmer it is so exciting cries elspeth oh who is going to win i dont think i could bear it for either of them to lose could you judy indeed not says judy capital fun just think my dear you cannot lose either way for you will gain a jolly voyage if the don wins or if harry succeeds why he will have two thousand pounds to spend on you oh i cant think of it that way cries my darling spouse it is the game that counts im sure damned idiot now then gentlemen cries felix clapping his hands weve had more eating and drinking than cricket so far your hand don and he led us out for the second innings i had learned my lesson from my first bowling spell and had a good notion now of where solomons strength and weakness lay he was quick and surefooted and his back game was excellent but id noticed that he wasnt too steady with his forward strokes so i pitched well up to him on the leg stump the wicket was getting the green off it with being played on and id hopes of perhaps putting a rising ball into his groin or at least making him hop about he met my attack pretty well though and played a hanging guard taking the occasional single on the on side but i pegged away settling him into place with the ball going into his legs and then sent one tother way he didnt come within a foot of it and his offstump went down flat hed made ten runs that hand so i had to get to win and while it aint many against a muffin of a bowler well you cant afford a single mistake and i wasnt a batter to trade however with care i should be good enough to see master solomon away if i wanted to for as i took guard i could see tighes red weskit out of the corner of my eye and felt a tremor of fear up my spine by george if i won and sent his stake money down the drain hed do his best to ruin me socially and physically no error and what was left the dukes bruisers would no doubt share between em was anyone ever in such a cursed fix but here was felix calling play and the don shuffling up to deliver his donkeydrop its a strange thing about bad bowling it can be deuced difficult to play especially when you know you have only one life to lose and have to abandon your usual swiping style in an ordinary game id have hammered solomons rubbish all over the pasture but now i had to stay cautiously back while he dropped his simple lobs on a length no twist at all but dead straight and i was so nervous that i edged some of them and would have been a goner if thered been even an old woman fielding at slip it made him look a deal better than he was and the crowd cheered every ball seeing the slogger flashy pinned to his crease however i got over my first shakes tried a drive or two and had the satisfaction of seeing him tearing about and sweating while i ran a few singles that was a thing about single wicket even a good drive might not win you much for to score one run you had to race to the bowlers end and back whereas in an ordinary match the same work would have brought you two and all his careering about the outfield didnt seem to trouble his bowling which was as bad but still as straight as ever but i hung on and got to a dozen and when he sent me a full pitch i let fly and hit him clean over the house running eight while he vanished frantically round the building with the small boys whooping in his wake and the ladies standing up and squeaking with excitement i was haring away between the wickets with the mob chanting each run and was beginning to think id run past his total when he hove in sight again trailing dung and nettles and threw the ball across the crease so that i had to leave off so there i was with runs still needed to win and both of us blowing like whales and now my great decision could be postponed no longer was i going to beat him and take the consequences from tighe or let him win and have a year in which to seduce elspeth on his confounded boat the thought of him murmuring greasily beside her at the taffrail while she got drunk on moonlight and flattery fairly maddened me and i banged his next delivery against the front door for another three runs and as i waited panting for his next ball there under the trees was the beast tighe hat down on his brows and thumbs hooked in his weskit staring at me with his cudgelcoves behind him i swallowed missed the next ball and saw it shave my bails by a whisker what the blazes should i do tighe was saying a word over his shoulder to one of his thugs and i swung wildly at the next ball and sent it high over solomons head i was bound to run and that was another two seven to get to win he bowled again and for once produced a shooter i poked frantically at it got the edge and it went scuttling away in front of the bounds for a single six to get and the spectators were clapping and laughing and egging us on i leaned on my bat watching tighe out of the corner of my eye and conjuring up nameless fears no they werent nameless i couldnt face the certainty of it being published that id taken money from a tout and having his assassins walk on my face in a haymarket alley into the bargain i must lose and if solomon rogered elspeth all over the orient well id not be there to see it i turned to look in her direction and she stood up and waved to me ever so pretty calling encouragement i looked at solomon his black hair wet with perspiration and his eyes glittering as he ran up to bowl and i roared no by god and cut him square and hard clean through a groundfloor window how they cheered as solomon thundered through the quality seats the ladies fluttering to let him by and the men laughing fit to burst he hurtled through the front door and as i completed my second run i turned to see that ominous figure in the red weskit he and his cronies were the only still silent members of that whole excited assembly damnn solomon was he going to take all day finding the bloody ball i had to run with my nerve failing again i lumbered up the pitch and there was a great howl from the house solomon was emerging dishevelled and triumphant as i made the third run only another three and the match was mine but i couldnt face it i knew i darent win after all i wasnt any too confident of elspeths virtue as it was one solomon more or less wasnt going to make all that much difference better be a cuckold than a disgraced cripple i had wobbled in intent all through the past halfhour but now i did my level best to hand solomon the game i swiped and missed but my wicket remained intact i prodded a catch at him and it fell short i played a ball to the off went for a single that i hadnt a hope of getting and the great oaf with nothing to do but throw down my wicket for victory shied wildly wide in his excitement i stumbled home with the mob yelling delightedly solomon flashy and even little felix was hopping from one leg to the other as he signalled solomon to bowl on there wasnt a whisper round the field now i waited at the crease bowels dissolving as solomon stood doubled over regaining his breath and then picked up the ball i was settled in my mind now id wait for a straight one and miss it and let myself be bowled out would you believe it his next three balls were as squint as a jews conscience he was dead beat with running labouring like a cow in milk and couldnt keep direction at all i let em go by while the crowd groaned in disappointment and when his next one looked like going wide altogether i had to play at it like it or not i scrambled across trying desperately to pull it in his direction muttering to myself if you cant bowl me for christs sake catch me out you hamfisted buttock and in my panic i stumbled took a frantic swipe and drove the confounded ball miles over his head high into the air he turned and raced to get under it and there was nothing i could do but leg it for the other end praying to god hed catch it it was still in the air when i reached the bowlers crease and turned running backwards to watch he was weaving about beneath it with his mouth open arms outstretched while the whole field waited breathless down it came down to his waiting hands he clutched at it held it stumbled fumbled and to my horror and a great shriek from the mob it bounced free he made a despairing grab measured his length on the turf and there was the bloody ball rolling across the grass away from him you oh you butterfingered b d i roared but it was lost in the tumult i had regained my crease having scored one but i was bound to try for the second winning run with solomon prostrate and the ball ten yards from him run they were yelling run flashy and poor despairing flashy couldnt do anything else but obey the match was in my grasp and with hundreds watching i couldnt be seen deliberately ignoring the chance to win it so i bounded forward again full of sham eagerness tripping artistically to give him a chance to reach the ball and run me out i went down rolling and damme the brute was still grovelling after his dropped catch i couldnt lie there forever so i went plunging on as slowly as possible like a man exhausted even so i had reached the bowlers crease before hed recovered the ball and now his only chance was to shy the thing a full thirty yards and hit my wicket as i careered back to the batters end i knew he hadnt a hope in hell at that distance all i could do was forge ahead to victory and ruin at the hands of tighe the crowd were literally dancing as i bore down on the crease three more strides would see me home and doomed and then the ground rose up very gently in front of me crowd and wicket vanished from view the noise died away into a soothing murmur and i was nestling comfortably against the turf chewing placidly at the grass thinking this is just the thing a nice peaceful rest how extremely pleasant i was staring up at the sky with felix in between peering down anxiously and behind him mynns beefy face saying get his head up give him air here a drink and a glass rattling against my teeth and the burning taste of brandy in my mouth there was the deuce of a pain in the back of my head and more anxious faces and i heard elspeths voice in distant shrill inquiry amidst a babble of chatter what what happened says i as they raised me my legs were like jelly and mynn had to hold me up its all right cries felix he tried to shy down your wicket and the ball hit you crack on the back of the skull why you went down like a shot rabbit he threw down your wicket too afterwards says mynn damn him i blinked and touched my head there was a lump growing like a football then here was solomon panting like a bellows clasping my hand and crying my dear harry are you all right my poor chap let me see he was volleying out apologies and mynn was looking at him pretty cool i noticed while felix fidgeted and the assembling mob were gaping at the sensation you mean i was out says i trying to collect my wits im afraid so cries solomon you see i was so confused when i shied the ball i didnt realize it had hit you saw you lying there and the ball loose well in my excitement i just ran in and snatched it and broke your wicket im sorry he repeated for of course id never have taken advantage if id had time to think it all happened so quickly you see he looked round at the others smiling whimsically why it was just like our accident in the first innings when flashy put me out at that the chatter broke out and then elspeth was all over me exclaiming about my poor head and calling for salts and hartshorn i quieted her while i regained my wits and listened to the debate mynn was maintaining stoutly that it wasnt fair running a chap out when he was halfstunned and felix said well according to the rules i was fairly out and anyway the same sort of thing had happened in solomons first hand which was extraordinary when he came to think of it mynn said that was different because i hadnt realized solomon was crocked and felix said ah well that was the point but solomon hadnt realized i was crocked either and mynn muttered didnt he by george and if that was the way they played at eton he didnt think much of it but who has won demanded elspeth no one says felix its a tie flashy ran one run which made the scores level at and was run out before he could finish the second so the games drawn and if you remember says solomon and although his smile was as bland as ever he couldnt keep the triumphant gleam out of his eye you gave me the tie which means and he bowed to elspeth that i shall have the joy of welcoming you my dear diana and your father aboard my vessel for our cruise im truly sorry our game ended as it did old chap but i feel entitled to claim my wager oh he was indeed and i knew it hed paid me back in my own coin for felling him in the first innings it was no consolation that id done my dirty work a sight more subtly than he had not with elspeth hopping with excitement clapping her hands exulting and trying to commiserate with me all at once taint cricket mynn mutters to me but theres nothing for it pay up look pleasant thats the damnable thing about being english and playing against foreigners they aint gentlemen i doubt if solomon heard him he was too busy beaming with his arm round my shoulders calling out that there was champagne and oysters in the house and more beer for the groundlings so hed won his bet without winning the match well at least i was clear where tighe was concerned for and then the horrid realization struck me at the very moment when i looked up and saw that red weskit on the outskirts of the crowd with the boozy scowling face above it he was glaring at me tightlipped shredding what i guessed was a bettingslip between his fingers he nodded at me twice ominously turned on his heel and stalked away for tighe had lost his bet too hed backed me to lose and solomon to win and we had tied with all my floundering indecision and bad luck id achieved the worst possible result all round id lost elspeth to solomon and his damned cruise and id cost tighe a thousand to boot hed expose me for taking his money and set his ruffians after me oh jesus and there was the duke too vowing vengeance on me for deflowering his tiger lily what a bloody pickle why are you all right old fellow cries solomon youve gone pale again here help me get him into the shade fetch some ice for his head brandy i croaked no no i mean im firstrate just a passing weakness the bump and my old wound you know i just need a moment to recover collect my thoughts horrid thoughts they were too how the deuce was i going to get out of this mess and they say crickets an innocent pastime the most famous thing has happened darling harry has consented to come with us on our voyage and i am happy beyond all telling he has even put aside the prospect of his appointment in the life guards and all for me it was so unexpected for almost as soon as the match was over and don s had claimed his prize h said very seriously that he had thought the matter over and while he was reluctant to decline the military advancement that had been offered him he could not bear to be parted from me such proof of his devotion moved me to tears and i could not forbear to embrace him which display i suppose caused some remark but i dont care don s of course was very warm in agreeing that h should come once he had satisfied himself that my dear one was quite determined don s is so good he reminded h of what a signal honour he was declining in not going to the life guards and asked was he perfectly certain he wished to come with us explaining that he would not have h make any sacrifice on our account but my darling said no thankee ill come if you dont mind in that straightforward way of his rubbing his poor head and looking so pale but determined i was overjoyed and longed to be private with him so that i might better express my deep gratification at his decision as well as my undying love but alas that is denied me for the moment for almost at once h announced that his decision necessitated his immediate departure for town where he has many affairs to attend to before we sail i offered to accompany him of course but he wouldnt hear of it so reluctant is he to interrupt my holiday here he is the dearest of husbands so considerate he explained that his business would take him about a good deal and he could not say where he would be for a day or so but would join us at dover whence we sail for the mysterious orient so he has gone not even staying to answer an invitation from our dear friend the duke to call upon him i am instructed to say to all inquiries that he is gone away on private business for of course there are always people anxious to see and solicit my darling so celebrated as he has become not only dukes and the like but quite ordinary mortals as well who hope to shake his hand i dare say and then tell their acquaintances of it afterwards in the meantime dear diary i am left alone except for the company of don s of course and dear papa to anticipate the great adventure which lies before us and await that joyous reunion with my beloved at dover which will be but the prelude i trust to our fairytale journey into the romantic unknown it was one thing to decide to go on solomons cruise but quite another to get safe aboard i had to spend ten days lurking in and about london like a gunpowder plotter starting at my own shadow and keeping an eye skinned for the dukes pluggers and daedalus tighes you may think i was overtimid and the danger none so great but you dont know what people like the duke were capable of in my young days they thought they were still in the eighteenth century and if you offended em they could have their bullies thrash you and then trust to their title to keep them clear of the consequences i was never a reform bill man myself but theres no doubt the aristocracy needed its comb cutting in any event it required no great arithmetic to decide to flee the country for a spell it was sickening to have to give up the life guards but if tighe spread a scandal about me it might well force me to resign anyway you could be an imbecile viscount with a cleft palate and still fit to command in the household brigade but if they found you were taking a bookies tin for favours heaven help you however famous a soldier you were so there was nothing for it but to lie doggo until the boat sailed and make one furtive visit to horse guards to tip uncle bindley the bad news he quivered with disbelief down the length of his aristocratic spine when i told him do i apprehend says he that you are refusing an appointment free of purchase may i remind you in the household brigade which has been specially procured for you at lord wellingtons instance in order to go junketing abroad with your wife her extraordinary father and this this person from threadneedle street he shuddered it is nothing short of commercial travelling cant be helped says i theres no staying in england just now you realize this is tantamount to refusing an honour from the throne itself that you can never again hope for any similar mark of favour i know that you are dead to most dictates of decent behaviour and common discretion but surely even you can see dammit uncle cries i ive got to go he squinted down his long nose you sound almost desperate am i right in supposing there will be some scandal if you do not yes says i reluctantly well then that is entirely different cries he why could you not say so at once i suppose it is some woman or other i admitted it and dropped a hint that the duke of was involved but that it was all a misunderstanding and bindley sniffed again and said he had never known a time when the quality of the house of peers was quite so low he would speak to wellington he said and since it was advisable for the familys credit that i should not be seen to be cutting the painter he would see if some official colour couldnt be given to my far eastern visit the result was that a day or two later at the room over the pawnshop where i was hiding out i got a note instructing me to proceed forthwith to singapore there to examine and approve the first consignment of australian horses which would be arriving next spring for the companys indian army well done old bindley he had his uses so then it was just a question of skulking down to dover for the last of the month which i accomplished arriving after dark and legging it along the crowded quay with my valise hoping to god that neither tighe nor the duke had camped out their ruffians to intercept me a boat took me out to solomons steambrig and there was a great reunion with my loved ones elspeth all over me clamouring to know where i had been she was quite distracted and old morrison grunting huh yeve come at the coos tail as usual and muttering about a thief in the night solomon seemed delighted to see me but i wasnt fooled he was just masking his displeasure that he wouldnt have a clear run at elspeth that quite consoled me to making the voyage it might be devilish inconvenient in some ways and i couldnt be quite easy in my mind at venturing east again but at least id have my flighty piece under my eye indeed when i reflected that was my prime reason for going and rated even above escaping tighe and the duke looking back from midchannel they didnt seem nearly so terrible and i resigned myself to enjoying the cruise why it might turn out to be quite fun ill give it to solomon he hadnt lied about the luxury of his brig the sulu queen she was quite the latest thing in screw vessels driven by a wheel through her keel twinmasted for sail and with her funnel well back so that the whole forward deck which was reserved for us was quite free of the belching smoke which covered the stern with smuts and left a great black cloud in our wake our cabins were underdeck aft though out of the reek and they were tiptop oak furniture screwed down persian carpets panelled bulkheads with watercolour paintings a mirrored dressingtable that had elspeth clapping her hands chinese curtains excellent crystal and a wellstocked cellarette clockwork fans and a double bed with silk sheets that would have done credit to a new orleans sportinghouse well thinks i this is better than riding the gridiron well be right at home here the rest of the appointment was to match the saloon where we dined couldnt have been bettered for grub liquor and service even old morrison whod been groaning reluctantly i gathered ever since hed agreed to come had his final doubts settled when they set his first sea meal before him he was even seen to smile which ill bet he hadnt done since he last cut the millhands wages solomon was a splendid host with every thought for our comfort he even spent the first week pottering about the coast while we got our sealegs and was full of consideration for elspeth when she discovered that she had left her toilet water behind he had her maid landed at portsmouth to go up to town for some with instructions to meet us at plymouth it was royal treatment no error and damn all expense only two things raised a prickle with me in all this idyllic luxury one was the crew there wasnt a white face among em when i was helped aboard that first night it was by two grinning yellowfaced rascals in reefer jackets and bare feet i tried em in hindi but they just grinned with brown fangs and shook their heads solomon explained that they were malays he had a few halfcaste arabs aboard as well who were his engineers and black gang but no europeans except the skipper a surly enough frog with a touch of nigger in his hair who messed in his cabin so that we never saw him hardly i didnt quite care for the allyellow crew though i like to hear a british or yankee voice in the focsle its reassuringlike still solomon was a far east trader and partbreed himself so it was perhaps natural enough he had em under his heel too and they kept well clear of us except for the chink stewards who were sleek and silent and firstrate the other thing was that the sulu queen while she was fitted like a floating palace carried ten guns which is about as many as a brig will bear i said it seemed a lot for a pleasureyacht and solomon smiled and says she is too valuable a vessel to risk in far eastern waters where even the british and dutch navies can afford little protection and bowing to us she carries a precious cargo piracy is not unknown in the islands you know and while its victims are usually defenceless native craft well i believe in being overcautious ye mean theres danger goggled morrison not says solomon with ten guns aboard and to settle old morrisons qualms and show off to elspeth he had all forty of his crew perform a gun practice for our benefit they were handy all right scampering about the whitescrubbed deck in their tunics and short breeches running out the pieces and ramming home cold shot to the squeal of the arab bosuns pipe precise as guardsmen and afterwards standing stockstill by their guns like so many yellow idols then they performed cutlassdrill and arms drill moving like clockwork and i had to admit that trained troops couldnt have shaped better what with her speed and handiness the sulu queen was fit to tackle anything short of a manofwar it is merely precaution piled on precaution says solomon my estates lie on peaceful lanes on the malay mainland for the most part and i take care never to venture where i might be blown into less friendly waters but i believe in being prepared and he went on to talk about his iron watertanks and stores of sealed food id still have been happier to see a few white faces and brown whiskers around us we were three white folk and solomon himself of course and we were outward bound after all however these thoughts were soon dispelled in the interest of the voyage i shant bore you with descriptions but im bound to say it was the pleasantest cruise of my life and we never noticed how the weeks slipped by solomon had spoken of three months to singapore in fact it took us more than twice as long and we never grudged a minute of it through the summer we cruised gently along the french and spanish coasts looking in at brest and vigo and lisbon being entertained lavishly by local gentry for solomon seemed to have a genius for easy acquaintance and then dipping on down the african coast into the warm latitudes i can look back now and say ive made that run more times than i can count in everything from an indiaman to a middle passage slaver but this was not like any common voyage why we picnicked on moroccan beaches made excursions to desert ruins beyond casablanca were carried on camels with veiled drivers strolled in berber marketplaces watched firedancers under the massive walls of old corsair castles saw wild tribesmen run their horse races took coffee with turbaned whitebearded governors and even bathed in warm blue water lapping on miles and miles of empty silver sand with palms nodding in the breeze and every evening there was the luxury of the sulu queen to return to with its snowy cloths and sparkling silver and crystal and the delicate chink stewards attending to every want in the cool dimness of the saloon well ive been a crown prince once in my wanderings but ive never seen the like of that voyage it is a fairytale elspeth kept exclaiming and even old morrison admitted it wasnt half bad the old bastard became positively mellow as why shouldnt he waited on hand and foot with two slanteyed and muscular yellow devils to carry him ashore and bear him in a palki on our excursions its daein me guid says he i can feel the benefit and elspeth would sigh dreamily while they fanned her in the shade and solomon would smile and beckon the steward to put more ice in the glasses oh aye he even had a patent icehouse stowed away somewhere down by the keel farther south along the jungly and desert coasts there was no lack of entertainment a cruise up a forest river in the ships launch with elspeth wideeyed at the sight of crocodiles which made her shudder deliciously or laughing at the antics of monkeys and marvelling at the brilliance of foliage and birdlife did i not tell you diana how splendid it would be solomon would say and elspeth would exclaim rapturously oh you did you did but this is quite beyond imagination or there would be flyingfish and porpoises and once we were round the cape where we spent a week dining out ashore and attending a ball at the governors which pleased elspeth no end there was the real deep blue sea of the indian ocean and more marvels for my insatiable relatives we began the long haul across to india in perfect weather and at night solomon would fetch his guitar and sing dago dirges in the dusk with elspeth drowsing on a daybed by the rail while morrison cheated me at йcartй or we would play whist or just laze the time contentedly away it was tame stuff if you like but i put up with it and kept my eye on solomon for there was no doubt about it he changed as the voyage progressed he took the sun pretty strong and was soon the brownest thing aboard but in other ways too i was reminded that he was at least halfdago or native instead of the customary shirt sleeves and trousers he took to wearing a tunic and sarong saying jokingly that it was the proper tropical style next it was bare feet and once when the crew were sharkfishing solomon took a hand at hauling in the huge threshing monster if you had seen him stripped to the waist his great bronze body dripping with sweat yelling as he heaved on the line and jabbering orders to his men in coast lingo well youd have wondered if it was the same chap whod been bowling slow lobs at canterbury or talking city prices over the port afterwards when he came to sit on the deck for an iced soda i noticed elspeth glancing at his splendid shoulders in a lazy sort of way and the glitter in his dark eyes as he swept back his moist black hair and smiled at her hed been the perfect family friend for months mind you never so much as a fondling paw out of place and i thought hollo hes looking dd dashing and romantic these days to make it worse hed started growing a chinbeard a sort of nigger imperial elspeth said it gave him quite the corsair touch so i made a note to roger her twice that night just to quell these girlish fancies all this reading byron aint good for young women it was the very next day that we came on deck to see a huge green coastline some miles to port jungleclad slopes beyond the beach and mountains behind and elspeth cried out to know where it might be solomon laughed in an odd way as he came to the rail beside us thats the strangest country perhaps in the whole wide world says he the strangest and the most savage and cruel few europeans go there but i have visited it its very rich you see he went on turning to old morrison gums and balsam sugar and silk indigo and spices i believe there is coal and iron also i have hopes of improving on the little trade i have started there but they are a wild terrible people one has to tread warily and keep an eye on your beached boat why don solomon cries elspeth we shall not land there surely i shall says he but not you the sulu queen will lie well off out of any possible danger what danger says i cannibals in war canoes he laughed not quite would you believe it if i told you that the capital of that country contains fifty thousand people half of em slaves that it is ruled by a monstrous black queen who dresses in the height of eighteenthcentury fashion eats with her fingers from a table laden with gold and silver european cutlery with placecards at each chair and wallpaper showing napoleons victories on the wall and having dined she will go out to watch robbers being burned alive and christians crucified that her bodyguard go almost naked but with pipeclayed cartridge belts behind a band playing the british grenadiers that her chief pleasures are torture and slaughter why i have seen a ritual execution at which hundreds were buried alive sawn in half hurled from no don solomon no squeals elspeth covering her ears and old morrison muttered about respecting the presence of ladies now the don solomon of london would never have mentioned such horrors to a lady and if he had hed have been profuse in his apologies but here he just smiled and shrugged and passed on to talk of birds and beasts such as were known nowhere else great coloured spiders in the jungle fantastic chameleons and the curious customs of the native courts which decided guilt or innocence by giving the accused a special drink and seeing whether he spewed or not the whole place was ruled by such superstitions and crazy laws he said and woe betide the outsider who tried to teach em different odd spot it must be says i what did you say it was called madagascar says he and looked at me you have been in some terrible places harry well if ever you chance to be wrecked there and he nodded at the green shore pray that you have a bullet left for yourself he glanced to see that elspeth was out of earshot the fate of any stranger cast on those shores is too shocking to contemplate they say the queen has only two uses for foreign men first to subdue them to her will if you follow me and afterwards to destroy them by the most fearful tortures she can devise playful little lady is she you think im joking my dear chap she kills between twenty and thirty thousand human beings each year she means to exterminate all tribes except her own you see when she came to the throne some years ago she had twentyfive thousand enemies rounded up forced to kneel all together in one great enclosure and at a given signal swish they were all executed at once she kept a few thousand over of course to hang up sewed in ox skins until they rotted or to be boiled or roasted to death by way of a change thats madagascar ah well says i brighton for me next year i think and youre going ashore for a few hours the governor of tamitave up the coast is a fairly civilized savage all the ruling class are including the queen bond street dresses as i said and a piano in the palace thats a remarkable place by the way big as a cathedral and covered entirely by tiny silver bells god knows what goes on in there youve visited it ive seen it but not been to tea as you might say but ive talked to those who have been inside it and whove even seen queen ranavalona and lived to tell the tale europeans some of em what are they doing there for gods sake the europeans oh theyre slaves at the time of course i suspected he was drawing the long bow to impress the visitors but he wasnt no every word hed said about madagascar was gospel true and not onetenth of the truth i know i found out for myself but from the sea it looked placid enough tamitave was apparently a very large village of yellow wooden buildings set out in orderly rows back from the shore there was a fairishsized fort with a great stockade some distance from the town and a few soldiers drilling outside it while haslam was ashore i examined them through the glass big buck niggers in white kilts with lances and swords very smart and moving in time which is unusual among black troops they werent true niggers though it seemed to me when haslam was rowed out to the ship again there was an escorting boat with a chap in the stern in what was a fair imitation of our naval rig blue frock coat epaulettes cocked hat and braid saluting away like anything he looked like a mexican if anything with his round oily black face but the rowers were dark brown and woolly haired with straight noses and quite fine features that was the closest i got to the malagassies just then and you may come to agree that it was near enough solomon seemed well satisfied with whatever business he had done ashore and by next morning we were far out to sea with madagascar forgotten behind us now i said i wouldnt weary you with our voyage so i shall do no more than mention ceylon and madras which is all they deserve anyway and take you straight away across the bengal bay past the infernal andamans south by the heel of great nicobar and into the steaming straits where the great jellyfishes swim between the mainland of malaya and the strange jungle island of sumatra with its manmonkeys down to the sea where the sun comes from and the islands lie ahead of you in a great brilliant chain that runs thousands of miles from the south china sea to australia and the far pacific on the other side of the world thats the east the islands and you may take it from one who has india in his bones theres no sea so blue no lands so green and no sun so bright as youll find beyond singapore what was it solomon had said where its always morning so it was and in that part of my imagination where i keep the best memories it always will be thats one side of it i wasnt to know then that singapore was the last jumpingoff place from civilization into a world as terrible as it was beautiful rich and savage and cruel beyond belief of land and seas still unexplored where even the mighty royal navy sent only a few questing warships and the handful of white adventurers who voyaged in survived by the speed of their keels and slept on their guns its quiet now and the law british and dutch runs from sunda strait to the solomons the coasts are tamed the last trophy heads in the longhouses are ancient and shrivelled and theres hardly a man alive who can say hes heard the war gongs booming as the great robber fleets swept down from the sulu sea well i heard em only too clearly and for all the good ive got to say of the islandsi can tell you that if id known on that first voyage what i learned later id have jumped ship at madras but i was happily ignorant and when we slipped in past the green sugarloaf islands one fine april morning of and dropped anchor in singapore roads it looked safe enough to me the bay was alive with shipping a hundred squareriggers if there was one huge indiamen under the gridiron flag tall clippers of the southern run wearing the stars and stripes british merchantmen by the bucketful ships of every nationality solomon pointed out the blue crossed anchors of russia the red and gold bars of spain the blue and yellow of sweden even a gold lion which he said was venice closer in the tubby junks and long tradingpraus were packed so close it seemed you could have walked on them right across the bay fairly seething with halfnaked crews of malays chinese and every colour from pale yellow to jet black deafening us with their highpitched chatter as solomons rowers threaded the launch through to the river quay there it was bedlam all asia seemed to have congregated on the landing bringing their pungent smells and deafening sounds with them there were coolies everywhere in straw hats or dirty turbans staggering halfnaked under bales and boxes they swarmed on the quays on the sampans that choked the river round the warehouses and godowns and through them pushed yankee captains in their short jackets and tall hats removing their cheroots from their rattrap jaws only to spit and cuss armenian jews in black coats and long beards all babbling british blue jackets in canvas shirts and ducks longmoustached chinese merchants in their round caps borne in palkis british traders from the sundas with their pistols on their hips leathery clipper men in pilot caps shouting oaths of liverpool and new york planters in wideawakes making play among the niggers with their stout canes a file of prisoners tramping by in legirons with scarletcoated soldiers herding them and bawling the step i heard english dutch german spanish and hindi all in the first minute and most of the accents of england scotland wales ireland and the american seaboards to boot god knows what the native tongues were but they were all being used at full pitch and after the comparative quiet wed been used to it was enough to make you dizzy the stink was fearful too of course waterfronts are much the same everywhere once you were away from the river out on the mayfair side of the town which lay east along beach road it was pleasant and that was where solomon had his house a fine twostorey mansion set in an extensive garden facing the sea we were installed in cool airy rooms all complete with fans and screens legions of chinese servants to look after us cold drinks by the gallon and nothing to do but rest in luxury and recover from the rigours of our voyage which we did for the next three weeks old morrison was all for it he had gluttonized to such a tune that hed put on flesh alarmingly and all he wanted to do was lie down belching and refreshing his ill nature in a hot climate elspeth on the other hand must be up and doing at once she was off almost before shed changed her shift carried in a palki by menials to pay calls on what she called the society people find out who was who and squander money in the shops and bazaars solomon pointed her in the right directions made introductions and then explained apologetically that he had weeks of work to do in his changinghouse at the quays after that he assured us we would set off on our tour of his possessions which i gathered lay somewhere on the east coast of the peninsula so there was i at a loose end and not before time i didnt know when i had been so damnably bored a cruise of wonders was all very well but id had my bellyful of solomon and his floating mansion with its immaculate appointments and unvarying luxury and everything so exactly confoundedly right and the finest foods and wines coming out of my ears i was surfeited with perfection and sick of the sight of old morrisons ugly mug and the sound of elspeths unwearying imbecile chatter and having not a damned thing to do but stuff myself and sleep id not had a scrap of vicious amusement for six months and for me thats a lifetime of going hungry well thinks i if singapore the fleshpot of the orient cant supply my urgent needs and give me enough assorted depravity in three weeks to last the long voyage home theres something amiss just let me shave and change my shirt and well stand this town on its head i took a long slant to get my bearings and then plunged in slavering there were eight crossstreets in the mayfair section where all the fine houses were and a large upland park below governors hill where society congregated in the evening and by jove wasnt it wild work though why you might raise your hat to as many as a hundred couples in two hours and when you were fagged out with this there was the frantic debauch of a gig drive along beach road to look at the ships or a dance at the assembly rooms where a married woman might even polka with you provided your wife and her husband were on hand unmarried ladies didnt waltz except with each other the daring little hussies then there were dinners at dutranquoys hotel with discussions afterwards about whether the raffles club oughtnt to be revived and how the building of the new chinese pauper hospital was progressing and the price of sugar and the latest leaderette in the free press and for the wilder spirits a game of pyramids on the hotel billiard table i played twice and felt soiled at my beastly indulgence elspeth was indefatigable of course in her pursuit of pleasure and dragged me to every soirйe ball and junket that she could find including church twice each sunday and the subscription meetings for the new theatre and several times we even met colonel butterworth the governor well thinks i this is singapore to be sure but im shot if i can stand this pace for long once i asked a likelylooking chap you could tell he was a rake he was using pomade where the less respectable entertainments were to be found supposing there were any and he coloured a bit and shuffled and said well there are the chinese processions but not many people would care to be seen looking at them i dare say they begin in the ahem native quarter you know by george says i thats bad perhaps we could look at em for just a moment though we neednt stay long he didnt care for it but i prevailed on him and we hurried down to the promenade with him muttering that it wasnt at all the thing and what penelope would say if she got to hear of it he couldnt imagine he had me in a fever of excitement and i was palpitating by the time the procession hove in view twenty chinks beating gongs and letting off smoke and whistles and half a dozen urchins dressed in tartar costumes with umbrellas all making a hell of a din is that it says i thats it says he come along do or someone will see us its its not done you know to be seen at these native displays my dear flashman im surprised the authorities allow it says i and he said the free press was very hot against it but the indian processions were even worse with chaps swinging on poles and carrying torches and hed even heard rumours that there were fakirs walking on hot coals on the other side of the river that was what put me on the right track id seen the waterfront of course with its great array of commercial buildings and warehouses but the native town that lay beyond it on the west bank had looked pretty seedy and hardly worth exploring being desperate by this time i ventured across one evening when elspeth was at some female gathering and it was like stepping into a brave new world beyond the shanties was china town streets brilliantlylit with lanterns gaming houses and casinos roaring away on every corner sideshows and acrobats hindoo firewalkers too my pomaded chum had been right pimps accosting you every other step with promises of their sister who was of course every bit as voluptuous as queen victoria and on all sides enough popsy to satisfy an army chinese girls with faces like pale dolls at the windows tall graceful kling tarts from the coromandel swaying past and smiling down their long noses saucy malay wenches giggling and beckoning from doorways popping out their boobies for inspection it was vanity fair come true but it wouldnt do of course poxed to a turn most of em they were all right for the drunken sailors lounging on the verandahs who didnt care about being fleeced and possibly knifed but id have to find better quality than that i didnt doubt that i would and quickly now that i knew where to begin but for the present i was content to stroll and look about brushing off the pimps and the more forward whores and presently walking back to the river bridge and who should i run slap into but solomon coming late from his office he stopped short at sight of me good god says he you aint been in bazaartown surely my dear chap if id known you wanted to see the sights id have arranged an escort it aint the safest place on earth you know not quite your style either id have thought well he knew better than that but if he wanted to play innocent i didnt mind i said it had been most interesting like all native towns and here i was safe and sound wasnt i sure enough says he laughing and taking my arm i was forgetting youve seen quite a bit of local colour in your time but singapores well quite a surprising place even for an old hand youve heard about our blackfaced gangs i suppose chinese you know nothing to do with the tongs or hues who are the secret societies who rule down yonder but murderous villains just the same theyve even been coming east of the river lately im told burglary kidnapping that sort of thing with their faces blacked in soot well an unarmed white civilian on his own hes just their meat if you want to go again he gave me a quick look and away let me know there are some really fine eatinghouses on the north edge of the native town the rich chinese go there and its much more genteel the temple of heavens about the best no sharking or rooking or anything of that kind and firstclass service good cabarets native dancing that order of thing you know now why i wondered was solomon offering to pimp for me for thats what it struck me he was doing to keep me sinfully amused while he paid court to elspeth perhaps or just in the way of kindness to steer me to the best brothels in town i was pondering this when he went on speaking of rich chinese you and elspeth havent met any yet i suppose now they are the most interesting folk in this settlement altogether people like whampoa and tan tock seng i must arrange that im afraid ive been neglecting you all shockingly but when ones been away for three years well theres a great deal to do as you can guess he grinned whimsically confess it youve found our singapore gaiety just a trifle tedious old butterworth prosing and logan and dyce aint quite hyde park style are they neer mind ill see to it that you visit one of old whampoas parties that wont bore i promise you and it didnt solomon was as good as his word and two nights later elspeth and i and old morrison were driven out to whampoas estate in a fourwheel palki it was a superb place more like a palace than a house with the garden brilliant with lanterns and the man himself bowing us in ceremonially at the door he was a huge fat chinese with a shaven head and a pigtail down to his heels clad in a black silk robe embroidered with shimmering green and scarlet flowers straight from aladdin except that he had a schooner of sherry in one paw it never left him and it was never empty either welcome to my miserable and lowly dwelling says he doubling over as far as his belly would let him that is what the chinese always say is it not in fact i think my home is perfectly splendid and quite the best in singapore but i can truthfully say it has never entertained a more beautiful visitor this was to elspeth who was gaping round at the magnificence of lacquered panelling goldleafed slender columns jade ornaments and silk hangings with which whampoas establishment appeared to be stuffed you shall sit beside me at dinner lovely goldenhaired lady and while you exclaim at the luxury of my house i shall flatter your exquisite beauty so we shall both be assured of a blissful evening listening to what delights us most which he did keeping her entranced beside him sipping continually at his sherry while we ate a chinese banquet in a diningroom that made versailles look like a garret the food was atrocious as chinese grub always is some of the soups and the creamed walnuts werent bad though but the servants were the most delightful little chinese girls in tight silk dresses each of a different colour even ancient eggs with seaweed dressing and carrion sauce dont seem so bad when theyre offered by a slanteyed little goer who breathes perfume on you and wriggles in a most entrancing way as she takes your hand in velvet fingers to show you how to manage your chopsticks damned if i could get the hang of it at first it took two of em to show me one either side and elspeth told whampoa she was sure id be much happier with a knife and fork there were quite a few in the party apart from us three and solomon balestier the american consul i remember a jolly yankee planter with a fund of good stories and catchick moses a big noise in the armenian community who was the decentest jew i ever met and struck up an immediate rapport with old morrison they got to arguing about interest rates and when whampoa joined in balestier said he wouldnt rest until hed made up a story which began there was a chinaman a scotchman and a jew which caused great merriment it was the cheeriest party id struck yet and no lack of excellent drink but after a while whampoa called a halt and there was a little cabaret of chinese songs and plays which were the worst kind of pantomime drivel but very pretty costumes and masks and then two chinese dancing girls exquisite little trollops but clad from head to foot alas afterwards whampoa took elspeth and me on a tour of his amazing house all the walls were carved screens in ivory and ebony which must have been hellish draughty but splendid to look at and the doors were all oval in shape with jade handles and gold frames i reckon half a million might have bought the place when we were finished he presented me with a knife inlaid with motherofpearl in the shape of a miniature scimitar to prove its edge he dropped a filmy scrap of muslin on the blade and it fell in half sheared through by its own insignificant weight to elspeth he gave a model jade horse whose bridle and stirrups were tiny jade chains all cut out of one solid block god knows what it was worth she scampered off to show it to the others calling on solomon to admire it and whampoa says quietly to me you have known mr solomon haslam for a long time i said a year or so in london and he nodded his great bald head and turned his buddhalike face to me he is taking you on a cruise round his plantations i believe that will be interesting i must ask him where they are i should much like to visit them myself some day i said i thought they were on the peninsula and he nodded gravely and sipped his sherry no doubt they are he is a man of sufficient shrewdness and enterprise i think he does business well the sound of elspeths laughter sounded from the diningroom and whampoas fat yellow face creased in a sudden smile how fortunate you are mr flashman i have in my humble way which is not at all humble you understand a taste for beautiful things and especially in women you have seen he fluttered his hand with its beastly long nails that i surround myself with them but when i see your lady elspet i understand why the old storytellers always made their gods and goddesses fairskinned and goldenhaired if i were forty years younger i should try to take her from you he sluiced down some more amontillado without success of course but so much beauty it is dangerous he looked at me and i cant think why but i felt a chill of sudden fear not of him but of what he was saying before i could speak though elspeth was back to exclaim again over her present and prattle her thanks and he stood smiling down at her like some benign sherrysoaked heathen god thank me beautiful child by coming again to my humble palace for hereafter it will truly be humble without your presence says he then we joined the others and the thanks and compliments flew as we took our leave in that glittering place and everything was cheery and happy but i found myself shivering as we went out which was odd for it was a warm and balmy night i couldnt account for it after such a jolly affair but i went to bed thoroughly out of sorts at first i put it down to foul chinese grub and certainly something gave me the most vivid nightmares in which i was playing a singlewicket match up and downstairs in whampoas house and his silky little chinese tarts were showing me how to hold my bat that part of it was all right as they snuggled up whispering fragrantly and guiding my hands but all the time i was conscious of dark shapes moving behind the screens and when daedalus tighe bowled to me it was a chinese lantern that i had to hit and it went ballooning up into the dark bursting into a thousand rockets and old morrison and the duke came jumping out at me in sarongs crying that i must run all through the house to score a single at compound interest and i set off blundering past the screens where nameless horrors lurked and i was trying to catch solomon who was flitting like a shadow before me calling out of the dark that there was no danger because he carried ten guns and i could feel someone or something drawing closer behind me and elspeths voice was calling fainter and fainter and i knew if i looked back i should see something terrible and there i was gasping into the pillow my face wet with sweat and elspeth snoring peacefully beside me it rattled me i can tell you because the last time id had a nightmare was in gul shahs dungeon two years before and that was no happy recollection in any event i didnt sleep well after whampoas party and was in a fine fit of the dismals next day as a result of which elspeth and i quarrelled and she wept and sulked until solomon came to propose a picnic on the other side of the island we would sail round in the sulu queen he said and make a capital day of it elspeth cheered up at once and old morrison was game too but i cried off pleading indisposition i knew what i needed to lift my gloom and it wasnt an al fresco lunch in the mangrove swamps with those three let them remove themselves and it would leave me free to explore china town at closer quarters and perhaps sample the menu at one of those exclusive establishments that solomon had mentioned the temple of heaven was the name that stuck in my mind why they might even have dainty little waitresses like whampoas to teach you how to use your chopsticks so when the three of them had left elspeth with her nose in the air because i wasnt disposed to make up i loafed about until evening and then whistled up a palki my bearers jogged away through the crowded streets and presently just as dusk was falling we reached our destination in what seemed to be a pleasant residential district inland from china town with big houses halfhidden in groves of trees from which paper lanterns hung all very quiet and discreet the temple of heaven was a large frame house on a little hill entirely surrounded by trees and shrubs with a winding drive up to the front verandah which was all dim lights and gentle music and chinese servants scurrying to make the guests at home there was a large cool diningroom where i had an excellent european meal with a bottle and a half of champagne and i was in capital fettle and ready for mischief when the hindoo head waiter sidled up to ask if all was in order and was there anything else that the gentleman required would i care to see a cabaret or an exhibition of chinese works of art or a concert if my tastes were musical or the whole d d lot says i for i aint going home till morning if you know what i mean ive been six months at sea so drum em up sambo and sharp about it he smiled and bowed in his discreet indian way clapped his hands and into the alcove where i was sitting there stepped the most gorgeous creature imaginable she was chinese with blueblack hair coiled above a face that was pearllike in its perfection and colour with great slanting eyes and her gown of crimson silk clung to a shape which english travellers are wont to describe as a thought too generous for the european taste but which if id been a classical sculptor would have had me dropping my hammer and chisel and reaching for the meat her arms were bare and she spread them in the prettiest curtsey smiling with perfect teeth between lips the colour of good port this is madame sabba says the waiter she will conduct you if your excellency will permit i may just about says i which ways upstairs i imagined it was the usual style you see but madame sabba indicating that i should follow led the way through an arch and down a long corridor glancing behind to see that i was following which i was breathing heavy with my eyes on that trim waist and wobbling bottom i caught her up at the end door and was just clutching a handful when i realized that we were on a porch and she was slipping out of my fond embrace and indicating a palki which was waiting at the foot of the steps whats this says i the entertainment says she is a little way off they will take us there the entertainment says i is on this very spot and i took hold of her growling and hauled her against me by george she was a randy armful wriggling against me and pretending she wanted to break loose while i nuzzled into her inhaling her perfume and munching away at her lips and face but i am only your guide she giggled turning her face aside i shall take you just to the nearest bed ducky ill do the guiding after that you like me says she playing coy while i overhauled her lustfully why then this is not suitable here we must go a little way but i believe that when you see what else is offered you will not care for sabba and she stuck her tongue into my mouth and then pulled me towards the palki come they will take us quickly if its more than ten yards itll be a wasted trip says i pawing away as we clambered aboard and pulled the curtains i was properly on the boil and intent on giving her the business then and there but to my frustration the palki was one of those double sedans where you sit opposite each other and all i could do was paw at her frontage in the dark swearing as i tried to unbutton her dress and squeezing at the delights beneath it while she kissed and fondled laughing telling me not to be impatient and the palki men jogged along bouncing us in a way that made it impossible to get down to serious work where they were taking us i didnt care what with champagne and passion i was lost to everything but the scented beauty teasing me in the dark at last i managed to get one tit clear and was nibbling away when the palki stopped and madame sabba gently disengaged herself a moment says she and i could imagine her adjusting her gown in the darkness wait here her fingers gently stroked my lips there was a glimpse of dusk as she slipped through the palki curtain and then silence i waited fretting and anticipating for perhaps half a minute and then stuck my head out for a moment i couldnt make out anything in the gloom and then i saw that the palki was stopped in a meanlooking street between dark and shuttered buildings but of the palki men and madame sabba there wasnt a sign just deserted shadow not a light anywhere and not a sound except the faint murmur of the town a long way off my blank astonishment lasted perhaps two seconds to be replaced by rage as i tore back the palki curtain and stumbled out cursing i hadnt had time to feel the first chill of fear before i saw the black shapes moving out of the shadows at the end of the street gliding silently towards me im not proud of what happened in the next moment of course i was very young and thoughtless and my great days of instant flight and evasion were still ahead of me but even so with my afghan experience and my native cowardice to boot my reaction was inexcusable in my riper years id have lost no precious seconds in bemused swearing long before those stealthy figures even appeared id have realized that madame sabbas disappearance portended deadly danger and been over the nearest wall and heading for the high country but now in my youthful folly and ignorance i absolutely stood there gaping and calling out who the devil are you and what dye want wheres my whore confound it and then they were running towards me on silent feet and i saw in a flash that id been lured to my death then at last was seen flashy at his best when it was all but too late one scream three strides and i was leaping for the rickety fence between two houses for an instant i was astride of it and had a glimpse of four lean black shapes converging on me at frightening speed something sang past my head and then i was down and pelting along the alley beyond hearing the soft thuds behind as they vaulted over after me i tore ahead full tilt bawling help at the top of my lungs shot round the corner and ran for dear life down the street beyond it was my yellow belly that saved me nothing else a hero wouldnt have stood and fought not against those odds in such a place but hed at least have glanced back to see how close the pursuit was or maybe even have drawn rein to consider which way to run next which would have been fatal for the speed at which they moved was fearful one glimpse i caught of the leader as i turned the corner a fell black shape moving like a panther with something glittering in his hand and in pure panic i went hurtling on from one street to another leaping every obstruction screaming steadily for aid but going at my uttermost every stride thats what you young chaps have got to remember when you run run full speed with never a thought for anything else dont look or listen or dither even for an instant let terror have his way for hes the best friend youve got he kept me ahead of the field for a good quarter of a mile i reckon through deserted streets and lanes over fences and yards and ditches and never a glimpse of a human soul until i turned a corner and found myself looking down a narrow alley which obviously led to a frequented street for at the far end there were lanterns and figures moving and beyond that against the night sky the spars and masts of ships under riding lights help i bawled murder assassins hell and damnation help i was pelting down the alley as i shouted and now like a fool i stole a glance back there he was like a black avenging angel gliding round the corner a bare twenty yards behind i raced on but in turning my head id lost my direction suddenly there was an empty handcart in my path left by some infernally careless coolie in the middle of the lane and in trying to clear it i caught my foot and went sprawling i was afoot in an instant ahead of me someone was shouting but my pursuer had halved the distance behind me and as i shot another panicstricken glance over my shoulder i saw his hand go back behind his head something glittered and whirled at me a fearful pain drove through my left shoulder and i went sprawling into a pile of boxes the flung hatchet clattering to the ground beside me he had me now he came over the handcart like a hurdle racer landed on the balls of his feet and as i tried vainly to scramble to cover among the wrecked boxes he plucked a second hatchet from his belt poised it in his hand and took deliberate aim behind me along the alley i could hear boots pounding and a voice shouting but they were too late for me i can still see that horrible figure in the lantern light the glistening black paint like a mask across the skulllike chinese head the arm swinging back to hurl the hatchet jingo a voice called and pat on the word something whispered in the air above my head the hatchetman shrieked his body twisted on tiptoe and to my amazement i saw clearly in silhouette that an object like a short knittingneedle was protruding from beneath his upturned chin his fingers fluttered at it and then his whole body seemed to dissolve beneath him and he sprawled motionless in the alley without being conscious of imitation i followed suit if i fainted though with pain and shock it can only have been for a moment for i became conscious of strong hands raising me and an english voice saying i say hes taken a bit of a cut here sit him against the wall and there were other voices in an astonishing jumble hows the chink dead as mutton jingo hit him full in the crop by jove that was neat i say look here though hes starting to twitch well im blessed the poisons working even though hes dead if that dont beat everything trust our little jingo cut his throat and poison him afterwards just for luck what i was too dazed to make anything of this but one word in their crazy discussion struck home in my disordered senses poison i gasped the axe poisoned my god im dying get a doctor my arms gone dead already and then i opened my eyes and saw an amazing sight in front of me was crouching a squat hideouslyfeatured native naked save for a loincloth gripping a long bamboo spear alongside him stood a huge arablooking chap in white ducks and crimson sash with a green scarf round his hawk head and a great reddyed beard rippling down to his waist there were a couple of other nearnaked natives two or three obvious seamen in ducks and caps and kneeling at my right side a young fairhaired fellow in a striped jersey as motley a crowd as ever i opened eyes on but when i turned my head to see who was poking painfully at my wounded shoulder i forgot all about the others this was the chap to look at it was a boys face that was the first impression in spite of the bronzed strong lines of it the touches of grey in the dark curly hair and long sidewhiskers the toughset mouth and jaw and the halfhealed sword cut that ran from his right brow onto his cheek he was about forty and they hadnt been quiet years but the dark blue eyes were as innocent as a tenyearolds and when he grinned as he was doing now you thought at once of stolen apples and tacks on the masters chair poison says he ripping away my bloodsodden sleeve not a bit of it chink hatchetmen dont go in for it you know thats for ignorant savages like jingo here say howdedo to the gentleman jingo and while the savage with the spear bobbed his head at me with a frightful grin this chap left off mauling my shoulder and reaching over towards the body of my fallen pursuer pulled the knittingneedle thing from his neck see there says he holding it gingerly and i saw it was a thin dart about a foot long thats jingos delight saved your life i dare say didnt it jingo of course any iban worth his salt can hit a farthing at twenty yards but jingo can do it at fifty radjun poison on the tip not fatal to humans as a rule but it dont need to be if the dart goes through your jugular does it he tossed the beastly thing aside and poked at my wound again humming softly oh say was you ever in mobile bay ascrewin cotton at a dollar a day sing johnny come down to hilo i yelped with pain and he clicked his tongue reprovingly dont swear says he just excite yourself and you wont go to heaven when you die anyway squeaking wont mend it its just a scrape two stitches and youll be as right as rain its agony i groaned im bleeding buckets no you aint either anyway a great big hearty chap like you wont miss a bit of blood mustnt be a milksop why when i got this he touched his scar i didnt even cheep did i stuart yes you did says the fair chap bellowed like a bull and wanted your mother not a word of truth in it is there paitingi the redbearded arab spat you enjoy bein hurt says he in a strong scotch accent ye gaunae leave the man lyin here a nicht we ought to let mackenzie look at him jb says the fair chap hes looking pretty groggy shock says my ministering angel who was knotting his handkerchief round my shoulder to my accompanying moans there now thatll do yes let mac sew him together and hell be ready to tackle twenty hatchetmen tomorrow wont you old son and the grinning madman winked and patted my head why was this one chasing you by the way i see hes a blackface they usually hunt in packs between groans i told him how my palki had been set on by four of them i didnt say anything about madame sabba and he stopped grinning and looked murderous the cowardly sneaking vagabonds cries he i dont know what the police are thinking about leave it to me and id clear the rascals out in a fortnight wouldnt i just he looked the very man to do it too its too bad altogether you were lucky we happened along though think you can walk here stuart help him up there now cries the callous brute as they hauled me to my feet youre feeling better already ill be bound at any other time id have given him a piece of my mind for if theres one thing i detest more than another its these hearty selfish muscular christians who are forever making light of your troubles when all you want to do is lie whimpering but i was too dizzy with the agony of my shoulder and besides he and his amazing gang of sailors and savages had certainly saved my bacon so i felt obliged to mutter my thanks as well as i could jb laughed at this and said it was all in a good cause and dutyfree and they would see me home in a palki so while some of them set off hallooing to find one he and the others propped me against the wall and then they stood about and discussed what they should do with the dead chinaman it was a remarkable conversation in its way someone suggested sensibly enough that they should cart him along and give him to the police but the fair chap stuart said no they ought to leave him lying and write a letter to the free press complaining about litter in the streets the arab whose name was paitingi ali and whose scotch accent i found unbelievable was for giving him a christian burial of all things and the hideous little native jingo jabbering excitedly and stamping his feet apparently wanted to cut his head off and take it home cant do that says stuart you cant cure it till we get to kuching and itll stink long before that i wont have it says the man jb who was evidently the leader taking heads is a beastly practice and one i am resolved to suppress mind you he added jingos suggestion by his own lights has a stronger claim to consideration than yours it is his head since he killed the fellow hollo though heres crimble with the palki in you go old chap i wondered listening to them if my wound had made me delirious either that or i had fallen in with a party of lunatics but i was too used up to care i let them stow me in the palki and lay halfconscious while they debated where they might find mackenzie who i gathered was a doctor at this time of night no one seemed to know where he might be and then someone recalled that he had been going to play chess with whampoa i had just enough of my wits left to recall the name and croak out that whampoas establishment would suit me splendidly the thought that his delectable little chinese girls might be employed to nurse me was particularly soothing just then you know whampoa do you says jb well that settles it lead on stuart by the way says he to me as they picked up the palki my names brooke james brooke known as jb youre mr i told him and even in my reduced condition it was a satisfaction to see the blue eyes open wider in surprise not the afghan chap well im blessed why ive wanted to meet you this two years past and to think that if we hadnt happened along youd have been my head was swimming with pain and fatigue and i didnt hear any more i have a faint recollection of the palki jogging and of the voices of my escort singing oh say have you seen the plantation boss with his blackhaired woman and his hightail hoss sing johnny come down to hilo poor old man but i must have gone under for the next thing i remember is the choking stench of ammonia beneath my nose and when i opened my eyes there was a glare of light and i was sitting in a chair in whampoas hall my coat and shirt had been stripped away and a burly blackbearded chap was making me wince and cry out with a scalding hot cloth applied to my wound sure enough though at his elbow was one of those almondeyed little beauties holding a bowl of steaming water she was the only cheery sight in the room for as i blinked against the light reflected from the magnificence of silver and jade and ivory i saw that the ring of faces watching me was solemn and silent and still as statues there was whampoa himself in the centre impassive as ever in his splendid gown of black silk next to him catchick moses his bald head gleaming and his kindly jewish face pale with grief brooke not smiling now his jaw and mouth were set like stone and beside him the fair boy stuart was a picture of pity and horror what the hell are they staring at i wondered for i aint as ill as all that surely then whampoa was talking and i understood for what he said made the terror of that night and the pain of my wound seem insignificant he had to repeat it twice before it sank in and then i could only sit staring at him in horror and disbelief your beautiful wife the lady elspet has gone the man solomon haslam has stolen her the sulu queen sailed from singapore this night no one knows where lost lost lost i have never been so surprised in my life one moment secure in tranquillity and affection among loving friends and relations shielded by the devotion of a constant husband and generous parent the next horribly stolen away by one that i had esteemed and trusted almost beyond any gentleman of my acquaintance shall i ever see them again what terrible fate lies ahead ah i can guess all too well for i have seen the loathsome passion in his eyes and it is not to be thought that he has so ruthlessly abducted me to any end but one i am so distracted by shame and terror that i believe my reason will be unseated lest it should i must record my miserable lot while clarity of thought remains and i can still hold my trembling pen oh alas that i parted from my darling h in discord and sulks and over the merest trifle because he threw the coffee pot against the wall and kicked the servant which was no more than that minion deserved for his bearing had been careless and familiar and he would not clean his nails before waiting upon us and i sullen wretch that i was reproved my dearest one and took that bad servants part so that we were at odds over breakfast and exchanged only the most brief remarks for the better part of the day with pouting and missishness on my unworthy part and dark looks and exclamations from my darling but i see now how forbearing he was with such a perverse and contrary creature as xmex i oh unhappy unworthy woman that i am for it was in cruel huff that i accompanied don s that viper on his proposed excursion thinking to punish my dear patient sweet protector oh it is i who am punished for my selfish and spiteful conduct all went well until our picnic ashore although i believe the champagne was flat and made me feel strangely drowsy so that i must go aboard the vessel to lie down with no thought of peril i slept and awoke to find we were under way with don s upon deck instructing his people to make all speed where is papa i cried and why are we sailing away from land see don solomon the sun is sinking we must return his face was pale despite his warm complection and his look was wild with brutal frankness yet in a moderate tone he told me i should resign myself for i should never see my dear papa again what do you mean don solomon i cried we are bidden to mrs alec middletons for dinner it was then in a voice which shook with feeling so unlike his usual controlld form of address although i could see he was striving to master his emotion that he told me there could be no going back that he was subject to an overmastering passion for me and had been from our moment of first meeting the die is cast he declared i cannot live without you so i must make you my own in the face of the world and your husband tho it means i must cut all my ties with civilized life and take you beyond pursuit to my own distant kingdom where i assure you you will rule as queen not only over my possessions but over my heart this is madness don solomon i cried i have no clothes with me besides i am a married woman with a position in society he said it was no matter for that and seizing me suddenly in his powerful embrace which took my breath away he vowed that i loved him too that he had known it from encouraging signs he had detected in me which of course was the odious construction which his feverd brain had placed on the common civilities and little pleasantries which a lady is accustomed to bestow on a gentleman i was quite overcome at the fearful position in which i found myself so unexpectedly but not so much that i lost my capacity for careful consideration for having pleaded with him to repent this madness which could lead only to shame for myself and ruin for him and even having demeaned myself to the extent of struggling vainly in his crushing embrace so brutally strong and inflexible as well as calling loudly for assistance and kicking his shins i became calmer and feigned to swoon i recollected that there is no emergency beyond the power of a resolute englishwoman especially if she is scotch and took heart from the lesson enjoined by our dominie mr buchanan at the renfrew academy for young ladies and gentlewomen ah dear home am i parted forever from the scenes of childhood that in moments of danger it is of the first importance to take accurate measurements and then act with boldness and dispatch accordingly i fell limp in my captors cruel altho no doubt he meant it to be affectionate clasp and he relaxing his vigilance i broke free and sped to the rail intending to cast myself upon the mercy of the waves and swim ashore for i was a strong swimmer and hold the west of scotland physical improvement societys certificate for saving life from drowning having been among the first to receive it when that institution was founded in or it may have been when i was still a child it was not very far to the shore either but before i could fling myself into the sea in the trust of almighty god i was seized by one of don ss hideous and smelling natives and despite my struggles i was carried below at don ss orders and am confined in the saloon where i write this melancholy account what shall i do oh harry harry darling harry come and save me forgive my thoughtless and wayward behaviour and rescue me from the clutches of this improper person i think he must be mad and yet such passionate obsessions are not uncommon i believe and i am not insensible of the regard that i have been shown by others of his sex who have praised my attractions so i must not pretend that i do not understand the reason for his horrid and ungallant conduct my dread is that before aid can reach me his beast may overpower his finer feelings and even now i cannot suppose that he is altogether dead to propriety though how long such restraint will continue i cannot say so come quickly quickly my own love for how can i weak and defenceless as i am resist him unaided i am in terror and distraction at pm the weather continues fine i blame myself says whampoa sipping his sherry for years one does business with a man and if his credit is good and his merchandise sound one clicks the abacus and sets aside the doubts one feels on looking into his eyes he was enthroned behind his great desk impassive as buddha with one of his little tarts beside him holding the amontillado bottle i knew he was not safe but i let it go even when i saw how he watched your golden lady two evenings since it disturbed me but i am a lazy stupid and selfish fool so i did nothing you shall tell me so mr flashman and i shall bow my unworthy head beneath your deserved censure he nodded towards me while his glass was refilled and catchick moses burst out not as stupid as i for gods sake and im a man of business they say yeh havent i for the past week been watching him liquidate his assets closing his warehouses selling his stock to my committee auctioning his lighters he spread his hands who cared he was a cashonthetable man so did i mind where he came from or that nobody knew him before ten years back he was in spice they said and silk and antimony and godknowswhat with plantations up the coast and somethingorother in the islands and now you tell us whampoa that no one has ever seen these estates of his that is my information in the past few hours says whampoa gravely it amounts to this he has great riches but no one knows where they come from he is a singapore middleman but he is not alone in that his name was good because he did good business and now he has done us cries catchick this in singapore under our very noses in the most respectable community in asia he steals a great english lady what will they say in the world hey wheres our reputation our good name i should like to know its gone out yonder heaven knows where aboard his accursed brig pirates theyll call us thieves and kidnappers i tell you whampoa this could ruin trade for five years in gods name man cries brooke it could ruin mrs flashman for ever oihoi cries catchick clutching his head with his hands and then he came trotting across to me and dropped his hand on my shoulder kneading away at me oh my poor friend forgive me he groans my poor friend it was just on dawn and we had been engaged in such useful conversation for two hours past at least they had i had been sitting in silence sick with shock and pain while catchick moses apostrophized and tore his whiskers whampoa reviled himself in precise grammatical terms and sank half a gallon of manzanilla balestier the american consul who had been summoned damned solomon to hades and beyond and two or three other leading citizens shook their heads and exclaimed from time to time brooke just listened mostly having sent his people out to pick up news there was a steady trickle of whampoas chinese too coming in to report but adding little to what we already knew and that was knowledge enough stark and unbelievable most of it came from old morrison who had been abandoned on the bay island where the party had picnicked he had gone to sleep he said full of drugged drink no doubt and had come to in the late evening to find the sulu queen hull down on the horizon steaming away east this was confirmed by the captain of an american clipper one waterman who had passed her as he came into port morrison had been picked up by some native fishermen and had arrived at the quay after nightfall to pour out his tale and now the whole community was in uproar whampoa had taken it upon himself to get to the bottom of the thing he had feelers everywhere of course and had put morrison to bed upstairs where the old goat was in a state of prostration the governor had been informed with the result that brows were being clutched oaths sworn fists shaken and sal volatile sold out in the shops no doubt there hadnt been a sensation like it since the last presbyterian church jumble sale but of course nothing was done at first everyone had said it was a mistake the sulu queen was off on some pleasure jaunt but when catchick and whampoa pieced it all together that wouldnt do it was discovered that solomon had been quietly selling up in singapore that when all was said no one knew a damned thing about him and that all the signs were that he was intending to clear out leaving not a wrack behind hence the loud recriminations and the dropped voices when they remembered that i was present and the repeated demands as to what should be done now only brooke seemed to have any notions and they werent much help pursuit cries he with his eyes blazing shes going to be rescued dont doubt that for a moment he dropped a hand on my uninjured shoulder im with you in this we all are and as ive a soul to save i wont rest until you have her safe back and this evil rascal has received condign punishment so there well find her if we have to rake the sea to australia and back my word on it the others growled agreement and looked resolute and sympathetic and scratched themselves and then whampoa signs to his girl for more liquor and says gravely indeed everyone supports your majesty in this it says much about my condition that i never thought twice about that remarkable form of address to an english sailor in a pea jacket and pilot cap but it is difficult to see how pursuit can be made until we have precise information about where they have gone my god that is the truth groans catchick moses they may be anywhere how many millions of miles of sea how many islands half of them uncharted two thousand five ten does anyone know even and such islands swarming with pirates cannibals headtakers in gods name my friend this rascal may have taken her anywhere and there is no vessel in port fit to pursue a steambrig its a job for the royal navy says balestier our navy boys too theyll have to track this villain run him to earth and jeesh cries catchick heaving himself up what are you saying what royal navy what navy boys where is belcher with his squadron two tousand miles away chasing the lanun brigands round mindanao where is your one american navy boat do you know balestier somewhere between japan and new zealand maybe where is seymours wanderer or hastings with the harlequin didos due from calcutta in two or three days says balestier keppel knows these seas as well as anyone and how well is that croaks catchick flapping his hands and stalking about be practical be calm it is terra incognita out yonder as we all know as everyone knows and it is vast if we had the whole royal navy american and dutch as well from all the oceans of the world they could search to the end of the century and never cover half the places where this rascal may be hiding why he may have gone anywhere dont we know his brig can sail round the world if need be i think not says whampoa quietly i have reason i fear i may have reason to believe that he will not sail beyond our indies even then havent i told you that there are ten million lurking places between cochin and java and ten million eyes that wont miss a steambrig and will pass word to us wherever she anchors snaps brooke see here and he slapped the map they had unrolled on whampoas desk the sulu queen was last seen heading cast according to bully waterman very well he wont double back thats certain sumatras no use to him anyway and i dont see him turning north thats either open sea or the malay coast where wed soon have word of him south perhaps but if he runs through karamata well hear of it so ill stake my head hell stay on the course hes taken and that means borneo oihoi cries catchick between derision and despair and is that nothing then borneo where every river is a pirate nest where every bay is an armed camp where even you dont venture far jb without an armed expedition at your back and when you do you know where you are going not like now when you might hunt forever ill know where im going says brooke and if i have to hunt forever well ill find him sooner or later catchick shot an uneasy glance across at me where i sat in the corner nursing my wound and i saw him pluck at brookes sleeve and mutter something of which i caught only the words too late by then at that they fell silent while brooke pored over his map and whampoa sat silent sipping his damned sherry balestier and the others talked in low voices and catchick slumped in a chair hands in pockets the picture of gloom you may wonder what i was thinking while all this hot air was being expelled and why i wasnt taking part as a bereaved and distracted husband should wild cries of impotent rage and grief prayers to heaven vows of revenge and all the usual preliminaries to inaction the fact was i had troubles enough my shoulder was giving me gyp and having not recovered from the terror id faced myself that night i didnt have much emotion left to spare even for elspeth once the first shock of the news had worn off she was gone kidnapped by that halfcaste scum and what feelings i had were mostly about him the slimy twisting insinuating hound had planned all this over months it was incredible but he must have been so infatuated with her that he was prepared to steal her make himself an outcast and outlaw put himself beyond the bounds of civilization for good just on her account there was no sense in it no womans worth that why as i sat there trying to take it in i knew i wouldnt have done it not for elspeth and a pound of tea not for aphrodite herself and ten thousand a year but im not a rich spoiled dago of course even so it was past belief dont misunderstand me i loved elspeth pretty well no error still do if being used to having her about the place is anything to go by and missing her if shes too long gone but there are limits and i was suddenly aware of them now on the one hand she was a rare beauty the finest mount id ever struck and an heiress to boot but on tother i hadnt wed her willingly wed spent most of our married life apart and no harm done and i couldnt for the life of me work up a frenzy of anxiety on her account now after all the worst that could happen to her was that this scoundrel would roger her if he hadnt done it already while my back was turned well that was nothing new to her shed had me and enjoyed it and i hadnt been her only partner i was certain so being rattled stupid by solomon would be no fate worse than death to her if i knew the little trollop shed revel in it beyond that well if he didnt tire of her hed probably look after her well enough he wasnt short of blunt and could no doubt support her in luxury in some exotic corner of the world shed miss england of course but taking the long view her prospects werent unendurable it would make a change for her but that was only one side of it of course her side which shows since ive put it first that i aint so selfish after all what did twist my innards with fury was shame and injured pride here was my wife the beloved of the heroic flashy stolen from him by a swarthy treacherous lecherous etonian nigger whod be bulling her all over the shop and what the deuce was i to do about it he was cuckolding me by god as he might well have done twenty times already by george there was a fine thought who was to say she hadnt gone with him willingly but no idiot and flirt that she was she knew better than that either way though i looked damned ridiculous and there wasnt a thing to be done oh there would have to be racing and chasing after her and solomon to no avail in those first hours you see i was certain that she was gone for good catchick was right we hadnt a hope of getting her back what then there would still have to be months perhaps years of fruitless searching for forms sake expensive confounded risky and there id be at the end of it going home and when people asked after her saying oh she was kidnapped dont you know out east no never did discover what happened to her jesus id be the laughingstock of the country flashy the man whose wife was pinched by a halfbreed millionaire close friend of the family too well they say she was pinched but who knows probably tired of old flash what felt like some oriental mutton for a change haha i ground my teeth and cursed the day id ever set eyes on her but above all i felt such hatred of solomon as ive never felt for any other human being that hed done this to me there was no fate too horrible for the greasy rat but precious little chance of inflicting it so far as i could see at the moment i was helpless while that bloody wop steamed off with my wife i could just picture him galloping away at her while she pretended maiden modesty and the world roared with laughter at me and in my rage and misery i must have let out a muffled yowl for brooke turned away from his map strode across dropped on one knee beside my chair gripped my arm and cries you poor chap what must you be feeling it must be unbearable the thought of your loved one in the hands of that dastard i can share your anguish he went on for i know how i should feel if it were my mother we must trust in god and our own endeavours and dont you fret we shall win her back he absolutely had tears in his eyes and had to turn his head aside to hide his emotions i heard him mutter about a captive damosel and blue eyes and golden hair of hyacinthine flow or some fustian of that sort then having clasped my hand he went back to his map and said that if the bugger had taken her to borneo hed turn the place inside out an unexplored island the size of europe says catchick mournfully and even then you are only guessing if he has gone east it may as well be to the celebes or the philippines he burns wood doesnt he says brooke then hell touch borneo and thats my bailiwick let him show his nose there and ill hear of it but you are not in borneo my friend i will be though within a week of keppels getting here in dido you know her eighteen guns two hundred blue jackets and keppel would sail her to the pole and back on a venture like this he was fairly glittering with eagerness he and i have run more chases than you can count catchick once we get this foxs scent he can double and turn till hes dizzy but well get him aye he can sail to china needle in a haystack says balestier and catchick and the others joined in some supporting brooke and others shaking their heads while they were at it one of whampoas chinese slipped in and whispered in his masters ear for a full minute and our host put down his sherry glass and opened his slit eyes a fraction wider which for him was the equivalent of leaping to his feet and shouting great scott then he tapped the table and they shut up if you will forgive my interruption says whampoa i have information which i believe may be vital to us and to the safety of the beautiful mrs flashman he ducked his head at me a little time ago i ventured the humble opinion that her abductor would not sail beyond the indies waters i had developed a theory from the scant information in my possession my agents have been testing it in the few hours that have elapsed since this deplorable crime took place it concerned the identity of this mysterious don solomon haslam whom singapore has known as a merchant and trader for how long ten years or thereabouts says catchick he came here as a young man in about whampoa bowed acknowledgement precisely that accords with my own recollection since then when he established a warehouse here he has visited our port only occasionally spending most of his time where no one knows it was assumed that he was on trading ventures or on these estates about which he talked vaguely then three years ago he returned to england where he had been at school he returns now with mr and mrs flashman and mr morrison well well cries catchick we know all this what of it we know nothing of his parentage his birth or his early life says whampoa we know he is fabulously rich that he never touches strong drink and i gather from conversation i have had with mr morrison that on his brig he commonly wore the sarong and went barefoot he shrugged these are small things what do they indicate that he is halfcaste we know i suggest the evidence points to his being a muslim although there is no proof that he ever observes the rituals of that faith now then a rich muslim who speaks fluent malay the islands are full of em cries brooke what are you driving at who has been known in these waters for ten years except for the last three when he was in england and his name is solomon haslam to which he attaches the spanish honorific don they were still as mice listening whampoa turned his expressionless yellow face surveying them and tapped his glass which the wench refilled this suggests nothing to you not to you catchick mr balestier your majesty this to brooke who shook his head it did not to me either whampoa continued until i considered his name and something stirred in my poor memory another name your majesty knows i am sure the names of the principal pirates of the borneo coast for several years back could you recall some of them to us now pirates cries brooke youre not suggesting if you please says whampoa why well then lets see brooke frowned theres jaffir at fort linga sharif muller of the skrang nearly cornered him on the rajang last year then theres pangeran suva out of brunei suleiman usman of maludu but no ones heard of him for long enough sharif sahib of patusan ranu he broke off for catchick moses had let fly one of his amazing hebrew exclamations and was staring at whampoa who nodded placidly you noticed catchick as i did i ask myself why i did not notice five years ago that name and he looked at brooke and sipped his sherry suleiman usman of maludu but no one has heard of him for long enough he repeated i think indeed i know that no one has heard of him for precisely three years suleiman usman solomon haslam he put down his sherry glass for a moment there was stupefied silence and then balestier burst out but that cant be what a coast pirate and you suggest he set up shop here amongst us as a trader and carried on business and went apirating on the side thats not just too rich its downright crazy what better cover for piracy wonders whampoa what better means of collecting information but damn it this fellow haslams a public school man cries brooke isnt he he attended eton college says whampoa gravely but that is not in itself necessarily inconsistent with a later life of crime but consider cries catchick if it were as you say would any sane man adopt an alias so close to his own name wouldnt he call himself smith or brown or or anything not necessarily says whampoa i do not doubt that when his parent or whoever it was arranged for his english education he entered school under his true name which might well be rendered into english as solomon haslam the first name is an exact translation the second an english name reasonably close to usman and there is nothing impossible about some wealthy borneo raja or sharif sending his child to an english school unusual yes but it has certainly happened in this case and the son following in his fathers footsteps has practised piracy which we know is the profession of half the population of the islands at the same time he has developed business interests in england and singapore which he has now decided to cut and stolen another mans wife to carry her off to his pirate lair scoffs balestier oh but this is beyond reason hardly more unreasonable than to suppose that don solomon haslam if he were not a pirate would kidnap an english lady says whampoa oh but youre only guessing cries catchick a coincidence in names and in times solomon haslam went to england three years ago and suleiman usman vanished at the same time that silenced them and then brooke says slowly it might be true but if it was what difference does it make after all some i think for if it is true you need look no farther than borneo for the sulu queens destination maludu lies north beyond the papar river in unexplored country he may go there or take cover among his allies on the seribas river or the batang lupar if he does hes done for cries brooke excitedly i can bottle him there or anywhere between kuching and serikei point whampoa sluiced down some more sherry it may not be so easy suleiman usman was a man of power his fort at maludu was accounted impregnable and he could draw at need on the great pirate fleets of the lanun and balagnini and maluku of gillalao you have fought pirates your majesty i know but hardly as many as these id fight every searobber from luzon to sumatra in this quarrel says brooke and beat em and swing suleiman usman from the didos foretop at the end of it if he is the man you are looking for says catchick whampoa may be wrong undoubtedly i make frequent mistakes in my poor ignorance says whampoa but not i think in this i have further proof no one among us i believe has ever seen suleiman usman of maludu or met anyone who has no however my agents have been diligent tonight and i can now supply a brief description about thirty years old over two yards in height of stout build unmarked features is it enough it was enough for one listener at any rate why not it was no more incredible than all the rest of the events of that fearful night indeed it seemed to confirm them as whampoa pointed out i would suggest also says he that we need look no further for an explanation of the attack by blackfaces on mr flashman and they all turned to stare at me tell me sir you dined at a restaurant before the attack the temple of heaven as i understand by god i croaked it was haslam who recommended it whampoa shrugged remove the husband and the most ardent pursuer is disposed of such an assassination might be difficult to arrange for an ordinary singapore merchant but to a pirate with his connections with the criminal community it would be simple the cowardly swine cries brooke well his ruffians were out of luck werent they the pursuers ready for the chase aint you flashman and between us well make this scoundrel usman or haslam rue the day he dared to cast eyes on an englishwoman well smoke him out and his foul crew with him oh let me alone for that i wasnt thinking that far ahead i confess and i didnt know james brooke at this moment for anything but a smiling madman in a pilotcap with an odd taste in friends and followers if id known him for what he truly was id have been in an even more agitated condition when our discussion finally ended and i was helped up whampoas staircase to a magnificent bedchamber and tucked in between silk sheets bandaged shoulder and all by his stewards and dr mackenzie i hardly knew where i was my mind was in a perfect spin but when theyd left me and i was lying staring up at the thin rays of sunlight that were breaking through the screens for it was now full day outside there broke at last the sudden dreadful realization of what had happened elspeth was gone she was in the clutches of a nigger pirate who could take her beyond the maps of europeans to some horrible stronghold where shed be his slave where we could never hope to find her my beautiful idiot elspeth with her creamy skin and golden hair and imbecile smile and wonderful body lost to me forever i aint sentimental but suddenly i could feel the tears running down my face and i was muttering her name in the darkness over and over alone in my empty bed where she ought to have been all soft and warm and passionate and just then there was a scratching at my door and when it opened there was whampoa bowing from his great height on the threshold he came forward beside the bed his hands tucked into his sleeves and looked down at me was my shoulder he asked giving me great pain i said it was agony but no greater says he than your torment of mind that too nothing can alleviate the loss you have suffered of the loveliest of companions is a deprivation which cannot but excite compassion in any man of feeling i know that nothing can take the place of the beautiful golden lady and that every thought of her must be a pang of the most exquisite agony but as some small poor consolation to your grief of mind and body i humbly offer the best that my poor establishment provides he said something in chinese and through the door to my amazement glided two of his little chink girls one in red silk tother in green they came forward and stood either side of the bed like voluptuous little dolls and began to unbutton their dresses these are white tigress and honeyandmilk says whampoa to offer you the services of only one would have seemed an insulting comparison with the magic of your exquisite lady therefore i send two in the hope that quantity may be some trivial amend for a quality which they cannot hope to approach triflingly inadequate as they are their presence may soothe your pains in some infinitesimal degree they are skilful by our mean standards but if their clumsiness and undoubted ugliness are offensive you should beat them for their correction and your pleasure forgive my presumption in presenting them he bowed retreating and the door closed behind him just as the two dresses dropped to the floor with a gentle swish and two girlish giggles sounded in the dimness you must never refuse an orientals hospitality you know it doesnt do or they get offended you just have to buckle to and pretend its exactly what you wanted whether you like it or not for four days i was confined in whampoas house with my gashed shoulder recuperating and ive never had a more blissfully ruinous convalescence in my life it would have been interesting had there been time to see whether my wound healed before whampoas solicitous young ladies killed me with their attentions my own belief is that i would have expired just about the time the stitches were ready to come out as it was my confinement was cut short by the arrival and swift departure of hms dido commanded by one keppel rn willynilly i had to sail with her staggering aboard still weak with loss of blood et cetera clutching the gangway not so much for support as to prevent my being wafted away by the first puff of breeze you see it was taken for granted that as a devoted husband and military hero i was in a sweat to be off in quest of my abducted spouse and her pirate ravisher that was one of the disadvantages of life on the frontiers of empire in the earlies that you were expected to do your own avenging and recovering with such assistance as the authorities might lend not my style at all left to old flash it would have been a case of tooling round to the local constabulary reporting a kidnapped wife leaving my name and address and letting em get on with it after all its what theyre paid for and why else was i stumping up sevenpence in the pound income tax i said as much to old morrison thinking it was the kind of view that would appeal to him but all i got for my pains was tears and curses youre tae blame whimpers he for he was far too reduced to bawl he looked fit to pass away his eyes sunk and his cheeks blenched but still full of spite against me if you had been daein your duty as a husband this would never have happened oh goad ma puir wee lamb my wee bit lassie and you where were ye whoorin away in some hoose o ill fame like enough while nothing of the sort cries i indignantly i was at a chinese restaurant at which he set up a great wail burying his head in the bedclothes and bawling about his wee bairn yell bring her back he croaks presently yell save her youre a military man wi decorations an shes the wife o your boozum so she is say yell bring her back tae her puir auld faither aye yell dae that yere a guid lad harry yell no fail her and more in the same nauseating vein interspersed with curses that he had ever set foot outside glasgow no doubt it was very pitiable and if id been less disturbed myself and hadnt despised the little swine so heartily i might have felt sorry for him i doubt it though i left him lamenting and went off to nurse my shoulder and reflect gloomily that there was no help for it i would have to be first in the field when the pursuit got under way the fellow brooke who for reasons that i couldnt fathom just then seemed to have taken on himself the planning of the expedition obviously took it for granted that i would go and when keppel arrived and agreed at once to put dido and her crew into the business there was no hanging back any longer brooke was in a great lather of impatience to be away and stamped and ground his teeth when keppel said it would be at least three days before he could sail he had treasure from calcutta to unload and must lay in stores and equipment for the expedition itll be river fighting i dare say says he yawning he was a dry likelylooking chap with blazing red hair and sleepy humorous eyes cutting out jungle work ambushes that sort of thing yees well we know what happens if you rush into it at halfcock remember how belcher ripped the bottom out of samarang on a shoal last year ill have to restow didos ballast for one thing and take on a couple of extra launches i cant wait for that cries brooke i must get to kuching for news of this villain suleiman and to get my people and boats together i hear harlequins been sighted ill go ahead in her hastings will take me when i tell him how fearfully urgent it is we must run down this scoundrel and free mrs flashman without a moments delay youre sure itll be borneo then says keppel it has to be cried brooke no ship from the south in the last two days has sighted him depend upon it hell either run for maludu or the rivers it was all greek to me and sounded horribly active and risky but everyone deferred to brookes judgement and next day off he sailed in harlequin because of my wound i was to rest in singapore until dido sailed two days later but perforce i must be down at the quay when brooke was rowed out with his motley gang by harlequins boat crew he seized my hand at parting by the time you reach kuching well be ready to run up the flag and run out the guns cried he youll see and dont fret yourself old fellow we shall have your dear lady back safe and sound before you know it just you limber up that swordarm and between us well give these dogs a bit of your afghan sauce why in sarawak we do this sort of thing before breakfast dont we paitingi eh mackenzie i watched them go brooke in the stern with his pilotcap tipped at a rakish angle laughing and slapping his knee in eagerness the enormous paitingi at his elbow the blackbearded mackenzie with his medical bag and the other hardcases disposed about the boat with the hideous little jingo in his loincloth nursing his blowpipe spear that was the fancydress crowd that i was to accompany on what sounded like a most hairraising piece of madness it was a dreadful prospect and on the heels of my apprehension came fierce resentment at the frightful luck that was about to pitch me headlong into the stew again damn elspeth for a harebrained careless wanton ogling little slut and damn solomon for a horny thief who hadnt the decency to be content with women of his own beastly colour and damn this officious bloodthirsty lunatic brooke who the devil was he to go busybodying about uninvited dragging me into his idiot enterprises what right had he and why did everyone defer to him as though he was some mixture of god and the duke of wellington i found out the evening dido sailed after i had taken my fond farewells whining and shouting with morrison stately and generous with the hospitable whampoa and ecstatically frenzied in the last minute of packing with my dear little nurses i went aboard almost on my hands and knees as ive said with stuart helping me for he had stayed behind to bear me company and execute some business for brooke it was while we were at the stern rail of the corvette watching the singapore islands sinking black into the fiery sunset sea that i dropped some chance remark about his crazy commander as you know i still had precious little idea who he was and i must have said so for stuart started round staring at me whos jb he cried you cant mean it whos jb you dont know why hes the greatest man in the east thats all youre not serious bless me how long have you been in singapore not long enough evidently all i know is that he and you and your ah friends rescued me mighty handy the other night and that since then hes very kindly taken charge of operations to do the same for my wife he blessed himself again heartily and enlightened me with frightening enthusiasm jb his royal highness james brooke is the king of sarawak thats who he is i thought the whole world had heard of the white raja why hes the biggest thing in these parts since raffles bigger even hes the law the prophet the grand panjandrum the tuan besar the whole kitboodle hes the scourge of every pirate and brigand on the borneo coast the best fighting seaman since nelson for my money he tamed sarawak which was the toughest nest of rebels and headhunters this side of papua hes its protector its ruler and to the natives its saint why they worship him down yonder and more power to em for hes the truest friend the fairest judge and the noblest whitest man in the whole wide world thats who jb is my word im glad he happened along says i i didnt know we had a colony in sarawak dyou call it we havent its not british soil jb is nominal governor for the sultan of brunei but its his kingdom not queen victorias how did he get it why he sailed in there four years ago after the dmfool company army pensioned him off for overstaying his furlough hed bought this brig the royalist you see with some cash his guvnor left him and just set off on his own account he laughed shaking his head god we were mad there were nineteen of us with one little ship and six sixpounder guns and we got a kingdom with it jb delivered the native people from slavery drove out their oppressors gave em a proper government and now with a few little boats his loyal natives and those of us whove survived hes fighting singlehanded to drive piracy out of the islands and make them safe for honest folk very commendable says i but isnt that the east india companys job or the navys bless you they couldnt even begin it cries he theres barely a british squadron in all these enormous waters and the pirates are numbered in tens upon tens of thousands ive seen fleets of five hundred praus and bankongs those are their warboats cruising together crammed with fighting men and cannon and behind them hundreds of miles of coastline in burning ruin towns wiped out thousands slaughtered women carried off as slaves every peaceful vessel plundered and sunk i tell you the spanish main was nothing to it they leave a trail of destruction and torture and abomination wherever they go they set our navy and the dutch at defiance and hold the islands in terror they have a slavemarket at sulu where hundreds of human beings are bought and sold daily even the kings and rajas pay them tribute when they arent pirates themselves well jb dont like it and he means to put a stop to it hold on though what can he do if even the navys powerless hes jb says stuart simply with that drunk smug look you see on a childs face when his father mends a toy of course he gets the navy to help why we had three navy vessels at murdu in february when he wiped out the sumatra robbers but his strength is with the honest native peoples some of em were once pirates themselves and headhunters like the sea dyaks until jb showed em better he puts spirit into them bullies and wheedles the rajas gathers news of the pirates and when they least expect it takes his expeditions against their forts and harbours fights em to a standstill burns their ships and either makes em swear to keep the peace or else thats why everyone in singapore jumps when he whistles why how long dyou think it would have taken them to do anything about your missus months years even but jb says go and dont they just and if id gone along beach road this morning looking for people to bet that jb couldnt rescue her good as new and destroy this swine suleiman usman well id not have got a single taker at a hundred to one hell do it all right youll see but why says i without thinking and he frowned i mean i added he hardly knows me and hes never even met my wife but the way hes gone about this youd think we were well his dearest relatives well thats his way you know anything for a friend and with a lady involved of course that makes it all the more urgent to him hes a bit of a knighterrant is jb besides he likes you what he dont even know me dont he though why i remember when we got the news of the great deeds youd done at kabul b talked of nothing else for days read all the papers kept exclaiming over your defence of pipers fort thats the man for me he kept saying by jingo what wouldnt i give to have him out here wed see the last pirate out of the china sea between us well now hes got you i shouldnt wonder if he doesnt move heaven and earth to keep you you can guess how this impressed me i could see of course that jb was just the man for the task in hand if anyone could bring elspeth off more or less undamaged it was probably he for he seemed to be the same kind of desperate stickatnothing adventurer id known in afghanistan wild men like georgie broadfoot and sekundar burnes the trouble with fellows like those is that theyre d d dangerous to be alongside it would be capital if i could arrange it that brooke went off arescuing while i stayed safe in the rear hallooing encouragement but my wound was healing nicely blast it and the outlook was disquieting it was a question which was still vexing me four days later when the dido under sweeps came gliding over a sea like blue glass to the mouth of the kuching river and i saw for the first time those brilliant golden beaches washed with foam the low green flats of mangrove creeping to the waters edge among the little islands the palmfringed creeks and in the distant southern haze the mountains of borneo paradise exclaims stuart breathing in the warm air and i dont give a damn if i never see dover cliffs again look at it half a million square miles of the loveliest land in the world unexplored except for this little corner sarawaks where civilization begins and ends you know go a days march in yonder he pointed towards the mountains and if youre still alive youll be among headhunters whove never seen a white man aint it capital though i couldnt say it was the river as we went slowly up it was broad enough and the land green and fertile but it had that steamy look that spells fever and the air was hot and heavy we passed by several villages some of them partly built over the water on stilts with long primitive thatched houses the water itself was as warm with canoes and small boats manned by squat ugly grinning little men like jingo i dont suppose one of them stood more than five feet but they looked tough as teak they wore simple loincloths with rings round their knees and headcloths some had black and white feathers in their hair the women were fairer than the men although no taller and decidedly goodlooking in an impudent pugnosed way they wore their hair long down their backs and went naked except for kilts swinging their bums and udders in a way that did your heart good to see sea dyaks says stuart the bravest cheeriest folk youll ever see fight like tigers cruel as the grave but loyal as swiss listen to em jabber thats the coast lingua franca part malay but with portuguese french dutch and english thrown in amiga sua cries he waving to one of the boatmen that i learned means my friend which gives you some notion sarawak as stuart said might be the civilized corner of borneo but as we drew closer to kuching you could see that it was precious like an armed camp there was a huge log boom across the river which had to be swung open so that dido could warp through and on the low bluffs either side there were gun emplacements with cannon peeping through the earthworks there were cannon too on the three strange craft at anchor inside the boom they were like galleys with high stern and forecastles sixty or seventy feet long with their great oars resting in the water like the legs of some monstrous insect war praus cries stuart by jove theres something up those are lundu boats j bs mustering his forces with a vengeance we rounded a bend and came in sight of kuching proper it wasnt much of a place just a sprawling native town with a few swiss cottages on the higher ground but the river was jammed with ships and boats of every description at least a score of praus and barges light sailing cutters launches canoes and even a natty little paddlesteamer the bustle and noise were tremendous and as dido dropped anchor in midstream she was surrounded by swarms of little boats from one of which the enormous figure of paitingi ali came swinging up to the deck to present himself to keppel and then come over to us aye weel says he in that astonishing accent which sounded so oddly with his occasional pious muslim exclamations he was right again the praise tae the one what dye mean cries stuart a spyboat came in frae budraddin yesterday a steambrig which cannae be any other than the sulu queen put into batang lupar four days ago and went upriver budraddins watching the estuary but theres nae fear shell come out again for the word along the coast is that the great suleiman usman is back and has gone up tae fort linga tae join sharif sahib hes in there a richt a we have tae do is gang in an tak him huzza roars stuart capering and seizing his hand good old jb borneo he said it would be and borneo it is he swung to me you hear that flashman it means we know where your lady is and that kidnapping rascal too jb guessed exactly right now do you believe that hes the greatest man in the east will ye tell me how he does it growled paitingi if i didnae ken he was a guid protestant id say he was in league wi shaitan come awa hes up at the hoose gey pleased wi himsel bismillah perhaps when hes told you in person hell be less insufferable but when we went ashore to brookes house the grove as it was called the great man hardly referred to paitingis momentous news i discovered later that this was delicacy on his part he didnt want to distress me by even talking about elspeths plight instead when we had been conducted to that great shady bungalow on its eminence commanding a view of the teeming river and landingplaces he sat us down with glasses of arrack punch and began to talk of all things about roses im goin to make em grow here if it kills me says he imagine that slope down to the river below us covered with english blooms think of warm evenings in the dusk and the perfume filling the verandah by george if i could raise norfolk apples as well that would be perfect great red beauties like the ones that grow on the roadside by north walsham what you can keep your mangoes and pawpaws stuart what wouldnt i give for an honest old apple this minute but i might manage the roses one day he jumped up come and see my garden flashman i promise you wont see another like it in borneo at any rate so he took me round his place pointing out his jasmine and sundals and the rest exclaiming about their night scents and suddenly snatching up a trowel and falling on some weeds these confounded chinese gardeners cries he id be better served by red indians i believe but i suppose its asking too much to expect he cries trowelling away that a people as filthy ugly and ungraceful as the chinks should have any feeling for flowers mind you theyre industrious and cheery but that aint the same he chattered on pointing out how his house was built carefully on palm piles to defy the bugs and damp and telling me how he had come to design it wed had the deuce of a scrap with lundu headhunters just across the river yonder and were licking our wounds in a dirty little kampong waiting for em to attack again it was evening and we were out of water altogether and pretty used up down to our last ounces of powder too and i thought to myself what you need jb my boy is an easy chair and an english newspaper and a vase of roses on the table it seemed such a splendid notion and i resolved that id make myself a house with just those things so that wherever i went in borneo it would always be here to return to he waved at the house and there she is all complete except for the roses ill get those in time it was true enough his big central room with the bedrooms arranged round it and an opening on to his front verandah was for all the world like a mixture of drawingroom and gunroom at home except that the furniture was mostly bamboo there were easy chairs and old copies of the times and post neatly stacked couches polished tables an axminster flowers in vases and all manner of weapons and pictures on the walls if ever i want to forget wars and pirates and fevers and ongongongs thats my own word for anything malay you know i just sit down and read about how it rained in bath last year or how some rascal was jailed for poaching at exeter assizes says he even potato prices in lancashire will do oh i say id meant to put that away id stopped to look at a miniature on the table of a most peachy blonde girl and brooke jumped up and reached out towards it i seemed to know the face why says i thats angie coutts surely you know her cries he and he was pink to the gills and right out of countenance for once i have never had the honour of meeting her he went on in a hushed stuffed way but i have long admired her for her enlightened opinions and unsparing championship of worthy causes he looked at the miniature like a contemplative frog tell me is she as as well ah as her portrait suggests shes a stunner if thats what you mean says i for like every other grown male in london i too had admired little angie though not entirely for her enlightened opinions more for the fact that she had a superb complexion tits like footballs and two million in the bank really id taken a loving fumble at her myself during blindmansbuff at a party in stratton street but shed simply stared straight ahead of her and dislocated my thumb wasteful little prude perhaps one of these days when i return to england you will present me says he gulping and shovelled her picture into a drawer well well thinks i whod have thought it the mad piratekiller and rosefancier spoony on angie couttss picture ill bet that every time he contemplates it the local dyak lasses have to scamper for cover i must have said something to this effect in my tasteful way that same evening to stuart no doubt with my lewd flashy nudge and leer but he was such an innocent that he just shook his head and sighed deeply miss burdettcoutts says he poor old jb he has told me of his deep regard for her although hes a very secret man about such things i dare say theyd make a splendid match but it cant be of course even if he realized his ambition to meet her why not says i hes a likely chap and just the kind to fire a romantic piece like young angie why theyd go like duck and green peas kindly old matchmaker flash you see impossible says stuart and then he went red in the face and hesitated you see its a shocking thing but jb can never marry it wouldnt do at all hollo thinks i he aint one of the dicks hatband brigade surely id not have thought it it is never mentioned of course says stuart uncomfortably but it is as well you should know in case in conversation you unwittingly made any reference that might well be wounding it was in burma you see when he was in the army he received an incapacitating injury in battle it was put about that it was a bullet in the lung but in fact well it wasnt good god you dont mean to say cries i genuinely appalled that he got his knocker shot off lets not think about it says he but i can tell you i went about wincing for the rest of the evening poor old white raja i mean im a callous chap enough but there are some tragedies that truly wring the heart mad about that delectable little bouncer angie coutts despot of a country abounding with the juiciest of dusky flashtails just itching for him to exercise the droit de seigneur and there he was with a broken firingpin i dont know when ive been more deeply moved still if jb was the first man in to rescue elspeth shed be safe enough it was an appropriate thought for that same evening after dinner at the grove we held the council at which brooke announced his plan of operations it followed a dinner as formal in its way as any ive ever attended but that was brooke all over when we had our pegs on the verandah beforehand he was laughing and skylarking playing leapfrog with stuart and crimble and even the dour paitingi the bet being that he could jump over them one after another with a glass in one hand and not spill a drop but when the bell sounded everyone quieted down and filed silently into his great room i can still see it brooke at the head of the table in his big armchair stiff in his white collar and carefullytied black neckercher with black coat and ruffled cuffs the eager brown face grave for once and the only thing out of place his untidy black curls he could never get em to lie straight on one side of him was keppel in full fig of uniform dress coat and epaulette with his best black cravat looking sleepy and solemn stuart and i in the cleanest ducks we could find charlie wade keppels lieutenant paitingi ali very brave in a tunic of dark plaid trimmed with gold and with a great crimson sash and crimble another of brookes lieutenants who absolutely had a frock coat and fancy weskit there was a malay steward behind each chair and over in the corner silent but missing nothing the squintfaced jingo even he had exchanged his loincloth for a silver sarong with hornbill feathers in his hair and decorating the shaft of his sumpitan standing handy against the wall i never saw him without it or the little bamboo quiver of his beastly darts i dont remember much of the meal except that the food was good and the wine execrable and that conversation consisted of brooke lecturing interminably like most active men he had all the makings of a thoroughgoing bore there shant be a missionary in borneo if i can help it i remember him saying for there are only two kinds bad ones and americans the bad ones ram christianity down the natives throats and tell them their own gods are false which they are says keppel quietly of course but a gentleman doesnt tell em so says brooke the yankees have the right notion they devote themselves to medicine and education and dont talk religion or politics and they dont treat natives as inferiors thats where weve gone wrong in india says he wagging his finger at me as though i had framed british policy weve made them conscious of their inferiority which is a great folly after all if youve a weaker younger brother you encourage him to think he can run as fast as you can or jump as far without a race dont you he knows he cant but that dont matter in the same way natives know theyre inferior but theyll love you all the better if they think you are unconscious of it well you may be right says charlie wade who was irish but i dont for the life of me see how you can ever expect em to grow up at that rate or achieve any selfrespect at all you cant says brooke briskly no asiatic is fit to govern anyway and europeans are says paitingi snorting only to govern asiatics says brooke a glass of wine with you flashman but ill give you this paitingi you can rule asiatics only by living among them you cannot govern them from london or paris or lisbon aye but dundee now says paitingi stroking his red beard and when the roar of laughter had died down brooke cries why you old heathen you have never been nearer to dundee than port said observe says he to me that in old paitingi you have the ultimate flowering of a mixture of east and west an arabmalay father and a caledonian mother ah the cruel fate of the halfcaste he has spent fifty years trying to reconcile the kirk with the koran theyre no that different says paitingi an at least theyre baith highly superior tae the book o common prayer i was interested to see the way they railed at each other as only very close friends do brooke obviously had an immense respect for paitingi ali however now that the talk had touched on religion he began to hold forth again on an interminable prose about how he had recently written a treatise against article of the oxford tracts whatever they were which lasted to the end of the meal then with due solemnity he proposed the queen which was drunk sitting down navy fashion and while the rest of us talked and smoked brooke went through a peculiar little ceremony which i suppose explained better than anything else the hold he had on his native subjects all through the meal a most curious thing had been happening while the courses and wine had come with all due ceremony and we had been buffing in id noticed that every few minutes a malay or dyak or halfbreed would come into the room touch brookes hand as they passed his chair and then go to squat near the wall by jingo no one paid them any notice they seemed to be all sorts from a nearnaked beggarly rascal to a welldressed malay in gold sarong and cap but they were all armed i learned later that it was a great insult to come into the white rajas presence without your krees which is the strange wavybladed knife of the people in any event while the rest of us gassed brooke turned his chair beckoned each suppliant in turn and talked with him quietly in malay one after another they came to hunker down beside him putting their cases or telling their tales while he listened leaning forward with elbows on knees nodding attentively then he would pronounce quietly and they would touch hands again and go the rest of us might as well not have been there when i asked stuart about it later he said oh thats jb ruling sarawak simple aint it when the last native had gone brooke sat in a reverie for a moment or two and then swung abruptly to the table no singing tonight says he business lets have that map crimble we crowded round the lamps were turned up shining on the ring of sunburned faces under the wreath of cigar smoke and brooke tapped the table i felt my belly muscles tightening we know whats to do gentlemen cries he and ill answer that the task is one that strikes a spark in the heart of every one of us a fair and gentle lady the beloved wife of one here is in the hands of a bloody pirate she is to be saved and he destroyed by gods grace we know where the quarry lies not sixty miles from where we sit on the batang lupar the greatest lair of robbers in these islands save mindanao itself look at it his finger stabbed the map first sharif jaffir and his slaver fleet at fort linga beyond him the great stronghold of sharif sahib at patusan farther on at undup the toughest nut of all the fortress of the skrang pirates under sharif muller was ever a choicer collection of villains on one river add to em now the archdevil suleiman usman who has stolen away mrs flashman in dastardly fashion she is the key to his vile plan gentlemen for he knows we cannot leave her in his clutches an hour longer than we must he gave my shoulder a manly squeeze everyone else was carefully avoiding my eye he realizes that chivalry will not permit us to wait you know him flashman is this not how his scheming mind will reason i didnt doubt it and said so hes made a fortune in the city too and plays a d d dirty game of singlewicket i added and brooke nodded sympathetically he knows i dare not delay even if it means going after him with only the piecemeal force i have here fifty praus and two thousand men a third of which i must leave to garrison kuching even so usman knows i must take at least a week to prepare a week in which he can muster his praus and savages outnumbering us ten to one and make ready his ambushes along the lupar confident that well stumble into them halfarmed and illprepared stop it before i start wishin i was on their side mutters wade and brooke laughed in his conceited fashion and threw back his black curls why hell wipe us out to the last man cries he thats his beastly scheme that he smiled complacently round at us is what suleiman usman thinks paitingi sighed but of course hes wrong the puir heathen says he with heavy sarcasm yell tell us how you may wager the bank to a tinkers dam hes wrong cries brooke his face alive with swank and excitement he expects us in a week he shall have us in two days he expects us with twothirds of our strength well well show him all of it ill strip kuching of every man and gun and leave it defenceless ill stake everything on this throw he beamed at us bursting with confidence surprise gentlemen thats the thing ill catch the rascal napping before hes laid his infernal toils what dyou say i know what id have said if id been talking just then id never heard such lunacy in my life and neither had the others by the look of them paitingi snorted yere mad itll no do i know old fellow grins brooke what then yeve said it yersel theres a hundred mile o river between skrang creek and the sea every yard o it hotchin wi pirates slavers natahutan an heidhunters by the thousand every sidestream crawlin wi warpraus an bankongs tae say nothin o the forts surprise says you by eblis i ken wholl be surprised weve done oor share o riverfightin but this he waved a great red hand withoot a wellfitted expedition in strength man its fatal folly hes right jb says keppel anyway even the poor force weve got couldnt be ready in two days yes it can though in one if necessary well even then you might catch fort linga unprepared but after that theyll be ready for you upriver not at the speed ill move cries brooke the messenger of disaster from linga to patusan will have us on his heels well carry all before us all the way to skrang if need be but kuching stuart protested why the balagnini or those beastly lanun could sweep it up while our back was turned never brooke was exultant they wont know its naked and suppose they did why wed just have to begin all over again wouldnt we you talk about the odds against us on the lupar were they a whit better at seribas or murdu were they any better when you and i george took all sarawak with six guns and a leaky pleasureyacht i tell you gentlemen i can have this thing over and done in a fortnight dyou doubt me have i ever failed and will i fail now when there is a poor weak creature crying out for rescue and i a briton hear that cry when i have the stout hearts and good keels that will do the thing and crush this swarm of hornets too before they can scatter on their accursed errands what i tell you all the queens ships and all the queens men could not bring such a chance together again and i mean to take it id never seen it before although ive seen it more times than i care to count since one man mad as a hatter and drunk with pride sweeping sane heads away against their better judgement chinese gordon could do it and yakub beg the kirghiz so could j e b stuart and that almighty maniac george custer they and brooke could have formed a club i can see him still erect head thrown back eyes blazing like the worst kind of actor mouthing the agincourt speech to a crowd of yokels in a tent theatre in the backwoods i dont believe he convinced them stuart and crimble perhaps but not keppel and the others certainly not paitingi but they couldnt resist him or the force that beat out of him he was going to have his way and they knew it they stood silent keppel i think was embarrassed and then paitingi says aye yell want me to have charge o the spyboats i suppose that settled it and at once brooke quieted down and they set to earnestly to discuss ways and means while i sat back contemplating the horror of the whole thing and wondering how i could weasel out of it plainly they were going to catastrophe lugging me along with them and not a thing to be done about it i turned over a dozen schemes in my mind from feigning insanity to running away finally when all but brooke had hurried off to begin the preparations which were to take them all night and the following day i had a feeble shot at turning him from his harebrained purpose perhaps i suggested diffidently it might be possible to ransom elspeth id heard of such things being done among the oriental pirates and old morrison was stiff with blunt which hed be glad what cries brooke his brow darkening treat with these scoundrels never i should not contemplate such ah but i see what it is he came over all compassionate and laid a hand on my arm you are fearful for your dear ones safety when battle is joined you need have no such fear old fellow no harm will come to her well it was beyond me how he could guarantee that but then he explained and i give you my word that this is what he said he sat me down in my chair and poured me a glass of arrack first it is natural enough flashman that you should believe this pirates motives to be of the darkest kind where your wife is concerned indeed from what i have heard of her grace and charm of person they are such as might well excite ah that is they might awaken well unworthy passion in an unworthy person that is he floundered a bit and took a pull at his glass wondering how to discuss the likelihood of her being rogered without causing me undue distress at last he burst out he wont do it i mean that is i cannot believe she will be illused in any way if you follow me i am confident that she is but a pawn in a game which he has planned with machiavellian cunning using her as a bait to destroy me that says this swollenheaded lunatic smugly is his true purpose for he and his kind can know no safety while i live his design is not principally against her of that i am certain for one thing he is married already you know oh yes i have gleaned much information in the past few days and its true five years ago he took to wife the daughter of the sultan of sulu and while muslims are not of course monogamous he went on earnestly there is no reason to suppose that their union was not a a happy one he took a turn round the room while i gaped stricken speechless so im sure your dear lady is perfectly safe from any any anything like that anything he waved his glass sloshing arrack broadcast anything awful you know well that is what he said as i hope to die i couldnt credit my ears for a moment i wondered if having his lovemuscle shot off had affected his brain then i realized that in his utterly daft way he was simply talking all this rubbish to reassure me possibly he thought i was so distraught that id be ready to believe anything even that a chap with one wife would never think of bulling another maybe he even believed it himself she will be restored to you he searched for a suitable word and found one unblemished you may be sure indeed i am certain that her preservation must be his first concern for he must know what a terrific retribution will follow if any harm should come to her either in the violence of battle or in any other way and after all says he apparently quite struck with the thought he may be a pirate but he has been educated as an english gentleman i cannot believe that he is dead to all feelings of honour whatever he has become here let me fill your glass old chap we must remember that there was a time when he was well one of us i think you can take comfort in that thought what i am now beyond hope and utterly desolate in my captivity like the prisoner of chillon except that he was in a dungeon and i am in a steamship which i am sure is a thousand times worse for at least in a dungeon one stays still and is not conscious of being carried away far beyond the reach of loving friends a week have i been in durance nay it seems like a year i can only pine my lost love and await in terror whatever fate is in store for me at the hands of my heartless abductor my knees tremble at the thought and my heart fails me how enviable does the lot of the prisoner of chillon seem for no such dread hung over his captivity and at least he had mice to play with laying their wrinkly wee noses in his hand in sympathy although to be sure i dont like mice but no more than i dont like the odious native who brings my food which i cannot endure to eat anyway although there have been some pleasant fruits added to my diet the last day or two when we came in sight of land as i saw from my porthole is this strange and hostile tropic shore to be the scene of my captivity shall i be sold on indian soil oh dear father and kind noble generous h thou art lost to me forever yet even such loss is no worse than the suspense which wracks my brain since the first dreadful day of my abduction i have not seen don s which at first i supposed was because he was so a prey to shame and remorse that he could not look me in the eye i pictured him restless on his prow torn by pangs of conscience gnawing at his nails and oblivious of his sailors requests for directions as the vessel plowed on heedless over the waves oh how well deserved his torment and yet it is extremely strange after his passionate protestations that he should restrain himself for seven whole days from seeing me the object of his madness i dont understand it for i dont believe he feels remorse at all and the affairs of his boat cannot take all his time surely why then does the cruel wretch not come to gloat over his helpless prey and jeer at her sorry condition for my white taffeta is now quite soiled and so oppressively hot in the confines of my cabin that i have perforce discarded it in favour of some of the native dresses called sarongas which have been provided by the creeping little chinese woman who waits upon me a sallow creature and not a word of english tho not as handless as some ive known i have a saronga of red silk which is i think the most becoming and another in blue and gold embroidery quite pretty but of course they are very simple and slight and would not be the thing at all for european wear except in dйshabillй but to these am i reduced and the left heel of my shoe broken so i must put them both off and no proper articles for toilette and my hair a positive fright don s is a brute and beast first to wrench me away and then so heartlessly to neglect me in this sorry condition pm he came at last and i am distraught while i was repairing as best i might thexravagesx slight disorders in my appearance which my cruel confinement has wrought and trying how my saronga might fold most elegantly for it is an excellent rule that in all circumstances a gentlewoman should make the best of things and strive to present a collected appearance i was of a sudden aware of his presence to my startled protest he replied with an insinuating compliment on how well my saronga became me and such a look of ardent yearning that i at once regretted my poor discarded taffeta fearing the base ardour that the sight of me in native garb might kindle in him to my instant and repeated demands that i be taken home at once and my upbraidings for his scandalous usuage and neglect of me he replied with the utmost composure and odiously solicitous inquiries for my comfort i replied with icy disdain restore me instantly to my family and keep your tiresome comforts he received this rebuff quite unabashed and said i must put such hopes from my mind forever what i cried you will deny me even some suitable clothing and proper toilet articles and a change of bed linen every day and a proper variety in diet instead of roast pork of which i am utterly tired and a thorough airing and cleaning of my accommodation no no he protested these things you shall have and whatever else your heart desires but as for returning to your family it is out of the question for the die is cast we shall see about that my lad i cried masking the terror which his grim and unrelenting manner inspired in my quaking bosom and presenting a bold front at which to my astonishment he dropped to his knees and taking my hand but with every sign of respect he spoke in so moving and pleading a manner protesting his worship and vowing that when i returned his love he would make me a queen indeed and my lightest whim instantly obeyed that i could not but be touched seeing me weaken he spoke earnestly of the kindness and companionship which we had shared at which despising my own frailty i was moved to tears why oh why don s did you have to spoil it all by this thoughtless and ungenteel behaviour and after such a jolly cruise i cried it is most disobliging of you i could not bear the torture of seeing you possessed by another cried he i asked why who do you mean don s your husband cries he but by heaven he shall be your husband no longer and springing up he cried that my spirit was as matchless as my beauty which he praised in terms that i cannot bring myself to repeat although i daresay the compliment was kindly intended and adding fiercely that he should win me at whatever cost despite my struggles and reproaches and feeble cries for an aid which i knew could not be forthcoming he repeatedly subjected me to the assault of his salutes upon my lips so fervently that i fainted into a merciful oblivion for between five and ten minutes after which by the intervention of heaven he was called on deck by one of his sailors leaving me with repeated oaths of his fidelity in a state of perturbed delicacy there is still no sign of pursuit by h which i had so wildly hoped for am i then forgotten by those dearest to me and is there no hope indeed am i doomed to be carried off forever or will don s yet repent the intemperate regard for me nay for my mere outward show which drove him to this inconsiderate folly i pray it may be so and hourly i lament nay i curse that fairness of form and feature of which i was once so vain ah why could i not have been born safe and plain like my dearest sister agnes or our mary who is even less favoured altho to be sure her complection is none too bad or oh sweet sisters three gone beyond hope of recall could you but know and pity me in my affliction where is h don s has sent down a great posy of flowers to my cabin jungle blossoms pretty but quite gaudy end of extract which passes belief for shamelessness hypocrisy and unwarranted conceit g de r at this point a heavy deletion of two lines occurs in the manuscript doubtless to excise some unflattering reference to lady flashmans third sister grizel de rothschild who edited the journal we dropped down kuching river on the evening tide of the day following a great convoy of illassorted boats gliding silently through the opened booms and down between banks dark and feathery in the dusk to the open sea how brooke had done it i dont know i daresay you can read in his journal and keppels how they armed and victualled and assembled their ramshackle war fleet of close on eighty vessels loaded with the most unlikely crew of pirates savages and lunatics and launched them on to the china sea like a damned regatta i dont remember it too clearly myself for all through a night and a day it had been bedlam along the kuching wharves in which being new to the business id borne no very useful part i have my usual disjointed memories of it though i remember the long warpraus with their steep sheers and forests of oars being warped one after another into the jetty by sweating squealing malay steersmen and the rajas native allies pouring aboard a chattering halfnaked horde of dyaks some in kilts and sarongs others in loincloths and leggings some in turbans some with feathers in their hair but all grinning and ugly as sin loaded with their vile sumpitanpipes and arrows their kreeses and spears all fit to frighten the french then there were the malay swordsmen who filled the sampans big flatfaced villains with muskets and the terrible straightbladed kampilan cleavers in their belts the british tars in their canvas smocks and trousers and straw hats their red faces grinning and sweating while they loaded didos pinnace singing whisky johnny as they stamped and hauled the silent chinese cannoneers whose task it was to lash down the small guns in the bows of the sampans and longboats and stow the powder kegs and matches the slim oliveskinned linga pirates who manned paitingis spyboats astonishing craft these for all the world like varsity racingshells slim frail needles with thirty paddles that could skim across the water as fast as a man can run they darted among the other vessels the long stately praus the didos pinnace the cutters and launches and canoes the long sloop jolly bachelor which was brookes own flagship and the flower of our fleet the east india paddlesteamer phlegethon with her massive wheel and platform and her funnel belching smoke they all packed the river in a great tangle of oars and cordage and rubbish and over it rang the constant chorus of curses and commands in half a dozen languages it looked like a watermans picnic gone mad the variety of weapons was an armourers nightmare aside from those ive mentioned there were bows and arrows every conceivable kind of sword axe and spear modern rifled muskets pepperpot revolvers horsepistols needleguns fantasticallycarved chinese flintlocks sixpounder naval guns and stands of congreve rockets with their firingframes mounted on the forecastles of three of the praus god help whoever gets in the way of this collection thinks i noting especially a fine comparison on the shore a british naval officer in tailcoat and waterproof hat testing the hairtriggers of a pair of mantons his blue jackets sharpening their brasshilted cutlasses on a grindstone and within a yard of them a jabbering band of dyaks dipping their langa darts in a bubbling cauldron of the beastly white radjun poison lets see you puff your popgun johnny cries one of the tars and they swung a champagne cork on a string as a target twenty yards off one of the grinning little brutes slipped a dart into his sumpitan clapped it to his mouth and in a twinkling there was the cork jerking on its string transfixed by the footlong needle christ says the blue jacket reverently dont point that bloody thing at my backside will you and the others cheered the dyak and offered to swap their gunner for him so you can see the kind of army that james brooke took to sea from kuching on the morning of august and if like me you had shaken your head in despair at the motley ragbag confusion of it as it assembled by the wharves you would have held your breath in disbelief as you watched it sweeping in silent disciplined order out on to the china sea in the breaking dawn ill never forget it the dark purple water ruffled by the morning wind the tangled green mangrove shore a cables length to our right the first blinding rays of silver turning the sea into a molten lake ahead of our bows as the fleet ploughed east first went the spyboats ten of them in line abreast a mile long seeming to fly just above the surface of the sea driven by the thin antennae of their oars then the praus in double column their sails spread and the great sweeps thrashing the water with the smaller sampans and canoes in tow the didos pinnace and the jolly bachelor under sail and last shepherding the flock the steamer phlegethon her big wheel thumping up the spray with brooke strutting under her awning monarch of all he surveyed discoursing to the admiring flashy theres something better than inspecting stirrup straps on horse guards cries he gaily flourishing a hand at our fleet driving over the sunlit sea what more could a man ask eh a solid deck beneath the old flag above stout fellows alongside and a bitter foe ahead thats the life my boy it seemed to me it was more likely to be the death but of course i just grinned and agreed that it was capital and a good cause to fight in he went on wrongs to punish sarawak to defend and your lady to rescue of course aye itll be a sweeter cleaner coast by the time weve done with it i asked him if he meant to devote his life to chasing pirates and he came all over solemn gazing out over the sea with the wind ruffling his hair it may well be a lifes work says he you see what our people at home will not understand is that a pirate here is not a criminal in our sense piracy is the profession of the islands their way of life just as trading or keeping shop is with englishmen so it is not a question of rooting out a few scoundrels but of changing the minds of whole nations and turning them to honest peaceful pursuits he laughed and shook his head it will not be easy dyou know what one of them said tome once and this was a welltravelled intelligent headman he said i know your british system is good tuan besar i have seen singapura and your soldiers and traders and great ships but i was brought up to plunder and i laugh when i think that i have fleeced a peaceful tribe right down to their cookingpots now what dyou do with such a fellow hang him says wade who was sitting on the deck with little charlie johnson one of brookes people playing main chatter that was makota wasnt it yes makota says brooke and he was the finest of em one of the stoutest friends and allies i ever had until he deserted to join the sadong slavers now he supplies labourers and concubines to the coast princes who are meant to be our allies but who deal secretly with the pirates for fear and profit thats the kind of thing we have to fight quite apart from the pirates themselves why dyou do it i asked for in spite of what stuart had told me i wanted to hear it from the man himself i always suspect these buccaneercrusaders you see i mean you have sarawak dont that keep you busy enough its a duty says he as one might say it was warm for the time of year i suppose it began with sarawak which at first seemed to me like a foundling which i protected with hesitation and doubt but it has repaid my trouble i have freed its people and its trade given it a code of laws encouraged industry and chinese immigration imposed only the lightest of taxes and protected it from the pirates oh i could make a fortune from it but i content myself with a little im either a man of worth you see or a mere adventurer after gain and god forbid i should ever be that but im well rewarded says he blandly for all the good that i do ministers to my satisfaction pity you couldnt set it to music and sing it as an anthem thinks i old arnold would have loved it but all i said was that it was undoubtedly gods work and it was a crying shame that it went unrecognized worth a knighthood at least id have said titles cries he smiling theyre like fine clothes penny trumpets and turtle soup all of slight but equal value no no im too quiet to be a hero all my wish is for the good of borneo and its people ive shown what can be done here but it is for our government at home to decide what means if any they put at my disposal to extend and develop my work his eyes took on that glitter that you see in campmeeting preachers and company accountants ive only touched the surface here i want to open the interior of this amazing land to exploit it for the benefit of its people to correct the native character to improve their lot but you know our politicians and departments they dont care for foreign ventures and theyre jolly wary of me i can tell you he laughed again they suspect me of being up to some job or other for my own good and what can i tell em they dont know the country and the only visits i ever get are brief and official well what can an admiral learn in a week if id any sense id vamp up a prospectus get a board of directors and hold public meetings borneo limited what thatd interest em all right but it would be the wrong thing you see and itd only convince the government that im a filibuster myself blackbeard teach with a clean shirt on no no it wouldnt do he sighed yet how proud i should be some day to see sarawak andail borneo under the british flag for their good not ours it may never happen mores the pity but in the meantime i have my duty to sarawak and its people im their only protector and if i leave my life in the business well i shall have died nobly well ive seen pureminded complacency in my time and done a fair bit in that line myself when occasion demanded but jb certainly beat all mind you unlike most arnoldian hypocrites i think he truly believed what lie said at least he was fool enough to live up to it so far as i could see which is consistent with my conclusion that he was off his head and when you remember that he excited the wrath of gladstone well that speaks volumes in a chaps favour doesnt it but at the time i was just noting him down as another smug lying psalmsmiter devoted to prayer and profit when he went and spoiled it all by bursting into laughter and saying mind you if its in a good cause its still the greatest fun i dont know that id enjoy the protection and improvement of sarawak above half if it didnt involve fighting these piratical headtaking vagabonds its just my good luck that duty combines with pleasure maybe im not so different from makota and the rest of these villains after all they go aroving for lust and plunder and i go for justice and duty its a nice point dont you think youll think me crazy i dare say he little knew how right he was but sometimes i think that rascals like sharif sahib and suleiman usman and the balagnini seawolves are the best friends ive got perhaps our radical mps are right and im just a pirate at heart well you look enough like one jb says wade getting up from the board main chatter sheikh matter its my game charlie he came to the rail and pointed laughing at the dyaks and malay savages who were swarming on the platform of the prau just ahead of us they dont look exactly like a sunday school treat do they flashman pirates if you like flashman hasnt seen real pirates yet says brooke hell see the difference then i did too and before the day was out we cruised swiftly along the coast all day before the warm breeze while the sun swung over and dropped like a bloodred rose behind us and with the cooler air of evening we came at last to the broad estuary of the batang lupar it was miles across and among the little jungly islands of its western shore we disturbed an anchorage of squalid sailorfolk in weatherbeaten sampans orang laut the malays called them seagipsies the vagrants of the coast who were always running from one debtcollector to another picking up what living they could paitingi brought their headman a dirty bedraggled savage to the phlegethon in one of the spyboats and after brooke had talked to him he beckoned me to follow him down into paitingis craft saying i should get the feel of a spyboat before we got into the river proper i didnt much care for the sound of it but took my seat behind him in the prow where the gunwales were tight either side and you put your feet delicately for fear of sending them clean through the light hull paitingi crouched behind me and the linga lookout straddled above me a foot on either gunwale dont like it altogether says brooke those bajoos say there are villages burning up towards the rajang and that aint natural when all thats sinful should be congregated up the lupar getting ready for us well take a sniff about give way the slender spyboat shot away like a dart trembling most alarmingly under my feet with the thirty paddlers sweeping us silently forward we threaded through the little islands brooke staring over towards the far shore which was fading in the gathering dusk there was a light mist coming down behind us concealing our fleet and a great bank of it was slowly rolling in from the sea ghostly above the oily water it was dead calm now and the dank air made your flesh crawl brooke checked our pace and we glided under the overhanging shelter of a mangrove bank where the fronds dripped eerily i saw brookes head turning this way and that and then paitingi stiffened behind me bismillah jb he whispered listen brooke nodded and i strained my ears staring fearfully across that limpid water at the fog blanket creeping towards us then i heard something at first i thought it was my heart but gradually it resolved itself into a faint regular throbbing boom coming faintly out of the mist growing gradually louder it was melodious but horrible a deep metallic drumming that raised the hairs on my neck paitingi whispered behind me wargong bide you dont even breathe brooke gestured for silence and we lay hidden beneath the mangrove fronds waiting breathlessly while that hish booming grew to a slow thunder and it seemed to me that behind it i could hear a rushing as of some great thing flying along my mouth was dry as i stared at the fog waiting for some horror to appear and then suddenly it was upon us like a train rushing from a tunnel a huge scarlet shape bursting out of the mist i only had a glimpse as it swept by but the image is stamped on my memory of that long gleaming red hull with its towering forecastle and stern the platform over its bulwark crowded with men flat yellow faces with scarves round their brows lank hair flowing down over their sleeveless tunics the glitter of swords and spearheads the ghastly line of white bobbing globes hanging like a horrible fringe from stem to stern beneath the platform skulls hundreds of them the great sweeps churning the water the guttering torches on the poop the long silken pennants on the upper works writhing in the foggy air like coloured snakes the figure of a halfnaked giant beating the oarstroke on a huge bronze gong and then it was gone as swiftly as it had come the booming receding into the mist as it drove up the batang lupar the sweat was starting out on me as we waited while two more praus like the first emerged and vanished in its wake then brooke looked past me at paitingi thats inconvenient says he i made em lanun the first two the third one maluku what dye think lagoon pirates from mindanao says paitingi but what the heli are they doin here he spat into the water theres an end tae our expedition jb theres a thousand men on each o those devilcraft more than we muster all told and and theyve gone to join usman says brooke he whistled softly to himself scratching his head beneath the pilotcap tell you what paitingi hes taking us seriously aint he just aye so lets pay him the same compliment if we beat back tae kuching in the mornin we can put oursels in a state o defence at least because by gods beard were goin tae have such a swarm roond oor ears not us says brooke them his teeth showed white in the gathering dark he was quivering with excitement dye know what old un i think this is just what we wanted now i know what we can expect ive got it all plain now just you watch aye weel if we get home wi all speed home nothing says brooke were going in tonight give way there for a moment i thought paitingi was going to have the boat over he exploded in a torrent of disbelief and dismay and expostulations concerning scottish old testament fiends and the hundred names of allah flew over my head brooke just laughed fidgeting with impatience and paitingi was still cursing and arguing when our spyboat reached phlegethon again a hasty summons brought the commanders from the other vessels and brooke who looked to me as though he was in the grip of some stimulating drug held a conference on the platform by the light of a single storm lantern nows the time i know it says he those three lagoon praus will be making for linga theyve been butchering and looting on the coast all day and theyll never go farther tonight well find em tied up at linga tomorrow dawn keppel youll take the rocketpraus burn those pirates at their anchorage land the blue jackets to storm the fort and boom the linga river to stop anything coming down youll find precious little fight in jaffirs people or im much mistaken meanwhile the rest of us will sweep past upriver making for patusan thats where well find the real thieves kitchen well strike it as soon as keppels boats have caught us up youll leave no one at linga says keppel suppose more praus arrive from mindanao they wont says brooke confidently and if they do well turn in our tracks and blow them all the way back to sulu his laugh sent shivers down my spine mind keppel i want those three praus destroyed utterly and every one of their crews killed or scattered drive em into the jungle if they have slaves or captives bring em along paitingi youll take the lead to linga with one spyboat we dont need more while the rivers still wide now then what time is it it may have been my army training or my experience in afghanistan where no one even relieved himself without a staff conferences approval but this haphazard neckornothing style appalled me we were to go careering upriver in the dark after those three horrors that id seen streaking out of the mist i shuddered at the memory of the evil yellow faces and that hideous skull fringe and tackle them and whatever other cutthroat horde happened to be waiting at this linga fort he was crazy whipped into a drunken enthusiasm by his own schoolboy notions of death or glory why the devil didnt keppel and the other sane men take him in hand or drop him overboard before he wrecked us all but there they were setting their watches hardly asking a question even suggesting improvisations in an offhand way that made your hair curl no one so much as hinting at a written order and brooke laughing and slapping keppel on the back as he went down into his longboat and mind now paitingi he cries cheerily dont go skedaddling off on your own as soon as those praus are well alight i want to see your ugly old mug heading back to phlegethon dyou hear look after him stuart hes a poor old soul but im used to him the spyboat vanished into the dark and we heard the creak of the longboats oars as they dispersed brooke rubbed his hands and winked at me nows the day and nows the hour says he charlie johnson pass my compliments to the engineer and tell him i want steam up well have fort linga for our chota hazri it sounded like madmans babble at the time but as i look back it seems reasonable enough for being jb he got what he wanted he spent all night in the phlegethons wheelhouse poring over maps and sipping batavia arrack issuing orders to johnson or crimble from time to time and as we thrashed on into the gloom the spyboats would come lancing out of the misty darkness hooking on and then gliding away again with messages for the fleet strung out behind us one of them kept scuttling to and fro between phlegethon and the rocketpraus which were somewhere up ahead how the deuce they kept order i couldnt fathom for each ship had only one dark lantern gleaming faintly at its stern and the mist seemed thick all round there was no sign in that clammy murk of the riverbanks a mile either side of us and no sound except the steady thumping of phlegethons engines the night was both chill and sweating at once and i sat huddled in wakeful apprehension in the lee of the wheelhouse drawing what consolation i could from the knowledge that phlegethon would be clear of the mornings action she had a grandstand seat though when dawn came pale and sudden we were thrashing full tilt up the oily river a hare halfmile from the junglecovered bank to starboard and nothing ahead of us but one spyboat loitering on the river bend even as we watched here there was a distant crackle of musketry from up ahead and from the spyboat a blue light shot into the foggy air barely visible against the pale grey sky keppels there yells brooke full ahead charlie and right on the heels of his words came a thunderous explosion that seemed to send a tremor across the swirling water phlegethon tore down on the spyboat and then as we rounded the bend i saw a sight ill never forget a mile away on the righthand shore was a great clearing with a big native village sprawling down to the shore and behind it on the fringe of the forest a stockaded fort on a slight rise with a green banner waving above its walls there were twists of smoke early cookingfires rising above the village but down on the riverbank itself there was a great pall of sooty cloud rising from the glittering red warprau which i recognized as one of those we had seen the previous evening there was orange flame creeping up her steep side beyond her lay the two other praus tied up to the bank and swinging gently in the current keppels praus were standing in towards them in line ahead like ghost ships floating on the morning mist which swirled above the rivers surface there was white smoke wreathing up from keppels own prau and now the prau behind rocked and shuddered as fire blinked on her maindeck and the white trails of the congreves went streaking out from her side you could see the rockets weaving in the air before they smashed into the sides of the anchored vessels at pointblank range orange balls of fire exploded into torrents of smoke with debris broken sweeps and spars flying high into the air and then across the water came the thunder of the explosions seconds later there were human figures swarming like ants on the stricken pirate vessels dropping into the river or scattering up the shore another salvo of rockets streaked across the smoking water and as the reek of the explosions cleared we could see that all three targets were burning fiercely the nearest one a flaming wreck already sinking in the shallows from each of keppels craft a longboat was pulling off for the shore and even without the glass i could make out the canvas shirts and straw hats of our salts as the boats pulled past the blazing wrecks and touched shore keppels rockets began firing at higher elevation towards the stockaded fort but at that range the rockets weaved and trailed all over the place most of them plunging down somewhere in the jungle beyond brooke handed me his glass thats cost the sultan of sulu a penny or two says he hell think twice before he sends his skullfanciers this way again i was watching our seamen landing through the glass there was wades burly figure leading them at a fast trot through the village towards the fort the cutlasses glittering in the early light behind the boat crews were hauling their bowchasers ashore manhandling them on to wheeled sledges to run them forward so that they could be brought to play against the fort others were trailing bamboo ladders and from one of the boats there were landing a group of malay archers with firepots it was beginning to dawn on me that for all his bullatagate style brooke or someone knew his business they had all the right gear and were moving like clockwork keppels praus must have rounded the bend and come in sight of the town at the precise minute when there was light enough to shoot by any later and their approach might have been seen and the pirates been on the qv wonder if sharif jaffirs awake yet what brooke was striding about the platform grinning like a schoolboy what dyou bet charlie hell be scampering out of the fort this minute taking to the jungle we can leave it to keppel now i think full ahead while we had been watching the rest of our fleet had passed by and was surging upriver the sweeps going like billyoh and the square sails of the praus set to catch the light seabreeze a spyboat was scooting out towards us from keppels prau the burly figure of paitingi in the bow beyond him the village was halfhidden by the smoke from the pirate praus which were burning down to the waterline and the rockets were firing again this time against the smaller praus which were assembled farther up near the linga river mouth i watched until my eye ached and just before the phlegethon rounded the next bend a couple of miles upstream cheering broke out from the vessels around us i turned my glass and saw that the green flag on the distant fort was coming down and the union jack was running up in its place well i was thinking if its as easy as this we dont need to break much sweat with any luck youll have a quiet passage flash my boy and at that very moment brooke was at my elbow tame work for you says he dont you fret old fellow youll get a swipe at them presently when we come to patusan therell be some capital fun there youll see and just to give me the idea he took me below and offered me the choice of some jersey revolvers with barrels as long as my leg and a cutlass of course says he youll feel naked without that he little knew that i could feel naked in a suit of armour in the bowels of a dreadnought being attacked by an angry bumboatwoman but one has to show willing so i accepted his weapons with a dark scowl and tried a cut or two with the cutlass for display muttering professionally and praying to god id never have the chance to use it he nodded approvingly and then laid a hand on my shoulder thats the spirit says he but i say flashman i know you feel youve got a lot to repay and the thought of that dear sweet creature of yours well i can see from your face the rage that is in you and i dont blame you mind but dyou know what whenever i go to battle i try to remember that our saviour when he had laid out those moneychanging chaps in the temple felt remorse didnt he for having got in such a bait so i try to restrain my anger and temper justice with mercy not a bad mixture what god bless you old chap and off he went no doubt for another gloat over the burning praus he baffled me but then so many good christians do probably because im such a d d bad one myself and not having much of a conscience im in no position to judge those that are apparently made of indiarubber not that i gave a rap how many pirates hed roasted before giving me his cautionary pi jaw as it turned out not many when keppel caught us up he reported that the fort had fallen without a shot sharif jaffir having legged it for the jungle with most of the lanun pirates in tow those remaining had thrown in their hand when they saw their vessels destroyed and the size of our fleet so that was all good business and what pleased brooke most was that keppel had brought along three hundred women whom the lanuns had been carrying off as slaves he visited them on keppels prau patting their heads and promising them theyd soon be safe home again id have consoled some of em more warmly than that myself good taste those lanun pirates had but of course there was none of that under our peckerless leader thereafter he had a quick look at the pirates and slavers whod been taken prisoner and ordered the execution of two of them on the spot one of them was the renegade makota i think at any rate he and brooke conversed earnestly for about five minutes while the squat little villain grinned and shuffled his bare feet looking bashful according to stuart he was confessing to indescribable tortures which he and his pal had inflicted on some of the women prisoners the previous evening keppels party had found the grisly evidence in the village finally when brooke told him his course was run the horrid fellow nodded cheerfully touched hands and cries salaam tuan besar the hovering jingo slipped a mosquito net and a rope over his head and pfft one quick jerk and that was makota off to the happy headhunting grounds the other condemned chap kicked up a frightful row at this exclaiming krees krees and eyeing the rope and mosquito net as though they were port being passed to the right what his objection to strangulation was im not certain but they humoured him taking him ashore so as not to make a mess i watched from the rail he stood up straight his toadlike face impassive while jingo laid his krees point delicately inside the clavicle on the left side and thrust down hard the fellow never even twitched a sorry business says brooke but before such atrocities i find it hard to remain composed after that it was all aboard the skylark again bound for patusan which lay about twenty miles farther upstream theyll stand and fight there where the river narrows says keppel two hundred praus i dare say and their junglemen peppering us with blowpipes from the trees that dont matter says brooke itll be a case of bursting the booms and then run up and board handtohand its the forts that count five of em and you may be sure therell be a thousand men in eachwe must smoke em out with rockets and cannon and then charge home in the old style thatll be your innings charles as usual says he to wade and to my horror he added well take flashman with us make use of your special talents what and he grinned at me as though it were my birthday couldnt be better cries wade slapping me on the back sure an well show you some pretty mixed scrappin old son better than afghanistan and you may lay to that ill wager ye didnt see many praus rammed in the khyber pass or have obligin paythans droppin treetrunks on you what the devil though as long as ye can run swim scale a bamboo wall an keep your swordarm swingin yell soon get the hang of it like trafalgar an waterloo rolled into one with a row in a silver street pub thrown in they all crowed at this delightful prospect and stuart says remember seribas last year when they dropped the booms behind us my stars that was a go our ibans had to shoot em out of the trees with sumpitans an buster anderson got shot in the leg when he boarded that bankong the one that was sinkin cries wade an buster had to swim for it wi the pirates one side of him an crocodiles on tother an he comes rollin ashore plastered wi mud an gore yellin anyone seen me baccy pouch its got me initials on it they roared again and said buster was a rare card and wade recalled how hed gone ploughing through the battle performing prodigies in search of his pouch the best of it was says he spluttering buster didnt smoke this tickled them immensely of course and keppel asked where old buster was these days alas we lost him at murdu says brooke same cuttingout party i got this he tapped his scar and a slug in the bicep balagnini jumped on him as he was scrambling up their sterncable busters pistol misfired he was the most confounded careless chap imaginable with firearms you know and the balagnini took the dear old chaps head almost clean off with his parang bad business they shook their heads and agreed it was a damned shame but cheered up presently when someone recalled that jack penty had settled the balagnini with a lovely backhand cut soon after and from this they passed to recalling similar happy memories of old pals and enemies most of em deceased in the most grisly circumstances apparently just the kind of thing i like to hear before breakfast but dyou know i learned from brooke afterwards that theyd absolutely been trying to raise my spirits forgive their levity says he it is kindly meant charlie wade sees you are quite down in the dumps fretting about your lady and he tries to divert you with his chatter about battles past and brave actions ahead well when the warhorse hears the trumpets he dont think about much else does he if you just give your mind to whats to do and i know youre itching to be at it youll feel ever so much better he muttered something else about my heart being tender enough to suffer but tough enough not to break and tooled off to see that we were still headed in the right direction by this time i was ready to bolt but thats the trouble with being afloat you can only run in circles there was land not far off of course if one could have reached it through water that was no doubt wellstocked with crocodiles and was prepared to wander in unexplored jungle full of headhunters and the prospect got worse through that steaming fevered day the river twisted and got narrower until there was a bare few hundred yards of sluggish water either side of the vessels with a solid jungle wall hemming us in whenever a bird screamed in the undergrowth i almost had a seizure and we were tormented by mosquito clouds which added their unceasing buzzing to the monotonous throb of phlegethons engines and the rhythmic swish of the praus sweeps worst of all was the stench the farther we went on the closer the jungle loomed in on us the more unbearable became that rotten musky choking atmosphere stifling in its steaming intensity it conjured up nightmares of corpses decaying in loathsome swamps i found the sweat which bathed me turning to ice as i watched that hostile green forest wall conjuring up hideous faces in its shadows imagining painted horrors lurking in its depths waiting if day was bad night was ten times worse dark found us still a few miles from patusan and the mist came with the dusk as we swung at anchor in midstream there was nothing to be seen but pale white wraiths coming and going in the festering gloom with all engines stopped you could hear the water gurgling oozily by even above the devils chorus of screams and yells from the darkness i was new to jungle and had no conception of the appalling din with which it is filled at night i stayed on deck about ten minutes in which time i saw at least half a dozen skullladen praus crammed with savages starting to emerge from the shadows at which point they dissolved into shadows themselves after that i decided i might as well turn in which i did by plumbing the depths of that sweltering iron tub finding a hole in the corner of the engineroom and crouching there with my colt in my fist listening to the evil whispers of headhunters congregating on the other side of the halfinch plate and barely ten days before id been unbuttoning in that singapore chophouse bursting with best meat and drink and running a lascivious eye over madame sabba now thanks to elspeths wantoning i was on the eve of death or worse if i get out of this thinks i ill divorce the bitch thats flat id been a fool ever to marry her and brooding on that i must have dozed for i could see her in that sunny field by the river golden hair tumbled in the grass cheeks moist and pink from the ecstasy of our first acquaintance smiling at me that lovely white body and then like a black shadow came the recollection of the hideous fate of those captive women at linga those same bestial savages had elspeth at their mercy even now she might be being ravished by some filthy dacoit or suffering unmentionable agonies i was awake gasping drenched on the cold iron they shant hurt you old girl i was absolutely croaking in the dark they shant ill ill what would i do rush to her rescue like dick dauntless against the kind of human ghouls id seen on that pirate prau i wouldnt dare it wasnt a question id even have asked myself normally for the great advantage to real trueblue cowardice like mine you see was that id always been able to take it for granted and no regrets or qualms of conscience it had served its turn and id never lost a wink over hudson or old iqbal or any of the other honoured dead whod served me as steppingstones to safety but elspeth and to haunt me in that stinking stokehold came the appalling question suppose it was my skin or hers would i turn tail then i didnt know but judging by the formbook i could guess and for once the alternative to suffering and death was as horrible as death itself i even found myself wondering if there was perhaps a limit to my funk and that was such a fearful thought that between it and the terrors ahead i was driven to prayer along the lines of oh kind god forgive all the beastly sins ive committed and a few that ill certainly commit if i get out of this or rather pay no attention to em heavenly father but turn all thy grace on elspeth and me and save us both but if its got to be one or tother of us for christs sake dont leave the decision to me and whatever thy will dont let me suffer mutilation or torment if itll save her you can even blot me out suddenly so that i dont know about it no hold on though better still take brooke the bastards been asking for it and hell adore a martyrs crown and be a credit to thy company of saints but save elspeth and me too for ill get no benefit from her salvation if im dead which was all wasted piety if you like since elspeth was presumably snug in solomons bed aboard the sulu queen and a damned sight safer than i was but theres nothing like the fear of violent death for playing havoc with reason and logic i dare say if socrates had been up the batang lupar that night he might have put my thoughts in order not that hed have had much chance hed have had a colt thrust into his fist and been pushed over the side with instructions to lay on like fury look out for a blonde female in distress and give me a shout when the coast was clear as it was having no counsel but my own i went to sleep an extremely uncomfortable night oppressive heat and much plagued by insects the noise of the natives is too much to be borne why should they beat their gongs after dark no doubt it has some religious purpose if so it is trying to a degree i despair of sleep even in natures garb so intense is the heat and drumliness of the air it is with difficulty that i pen even these few lines the paper is quite damp and blots most provokingly no sign of don s since this morning when i was allowed briefly on deck for air and exercise almost forgot my pitiful condition in the interest of what i saw of which i have rough notes and a few modest sketches the colours of the forest blooms are most exquisite but pale to nothing before the extravagance of the natives themselves so many splendid and barbaric galleys adorned with streamers and flags like corsairs of yore manned by swarthy crews many of repulsive appearance but others quite commanding as i stood in the bows one such galley swept by on the bosom of the stream urged on by the oars plied by dusky argonauts and at the back of the boat plainly its chief a tall and most elegantly shaped young barbarian clad in a saronga of shimmering gold with many ornaments on his exposed arms and legs really a most noble carriage and quite handsome for a native who inclined his head to me and smiled pleasantly very respectfully yet with a natural dignity not at all yellow but quite pale of skin as i had imagined an aztec god his name as i discovered by discreet inquiry of don s is sheriff saheeb and i suppose from this title that he is at least a justice of the peace i believe he would have come aboard our vessel but don s spoke to him from the gangway which i confess was a disappointment for he seemed a personage of some gentility if one may use the word of a heathen and i should have liked time to sketch him and try if i could not capture some of that savage nobility of his bearing however i have not passed my time in idle staring but recollecting what lord fitzroy somerset told me at the guards ball have made careful count of all the armaments i have seen and the disposition of the enemys strength which i have noted separately both the number of large guns and ships or galleys there seem to be a vast host of these people on land and water which fills me with dread how can i hope to be delivered but i shall not waste my pen on that or other vain repining a diverting occurrence which i should not record i know i am a sadly undutiful daughter among the animals and birds i have seen was a most droll ape on one of the native boats where i guess he is a pet creature a most astonishing pug for never was anything more like a human quite as tall as a small man and covered with an overcoat of red hair of remarkable luxuriance he had such a melancholy expression but with so appealing a glint tae his een and the aspect of a dour wee old man that i was greatly amused and his captors seeing my interest made him perform most divertingly for he had the trick of perfect imitation and even essayd to kindle a fire as they did putting together twigs to himself but poor pug they did not take light by themselves as he expected they would he was quite cast down and annoyd and it was when he mouthed his discontent and scattered his twigs in temper that i saw he was the speaking likeness of dear papa even to the way he screwed up his eyes almost i expected him to express himself with a round deil tak it what a preposterous fancy to see a resemblance in that brute to ones parent but he did look exactly like papa in one of his tantrums but this awoke such poignant memories that i could not look long so to my prison again and forebodings which i put resolutely from me i am alive so i hope and will not be cast down don s continues attentive though i see little of him he tells me the name of my ape is man of the forest i close this day with a prayer to my merciful father in heaven oh let him send my h soon to me i was back in patusan just a few years ago and its changed beyond belief now past the bend of the river there is a sleepy warm little village of bamboo huts and booths hemmed in by towering jungle trees drowsing in the sunlight fowls scratching in the dirt women cooking and no greater activity than a child tumbling and crying however much i walked round and squinted at it from odd angles i couldnt match it to my memory of bristling stockades along the banks with five mighty wooden forts fringing the great clearingthe jungle must have been farther back then and even the river has changed it is broad and placid now but i remember it narrow and choppy and everything more cramped and enclosed even the sky seems farther away nowadays and theres a great peace where once there was pandemonium of smoke and gunfire and rending timber and bloody water they were waiting for us when we swept round the bend in line abreast phlegethon and the rocketpraus leading with our spyboats lurking under the counters waiting to strike although it was broad dawn you couldnt see the water at all there was a blanket of mist a yard deep on its surface cutting off not only sight but sound so that even the phlegethons wheel gave only a muffled thump as it hit the water and the splash of the sweeps was a dull continuous churning as we ploughed the fog there was a huge logboom just visible above the mist fifty yards ahead and beyond it a sight to freeze your blood from bank to bank a line of great warpraus swarming with armed men pennants hanging from their masts skullfringes bobbing and as we came into view a hideous yell going up from every deck the wargongs booming and that devils horde shaking their fists and brandishing their weapons it was taken up from the manned stockades on the right bank and the wooden forts behind and then the fort guns and the praus bowchasers belched smoke and the air was thick with screaming shot whining overhead driving up jets of water from the misty surface or crashing home into the timbers of our craft the rocketpraus fired back and in a moment the still air was crisscrossed with the smoky vapour trails and the pirate battleline shuddered under the pounding of the congreves shattering explosions on their decks bursts of flame and smoke men diving from their upper works and then their cannon roaring back again turning the narrow river into an inferno of noise and destruction spyboats away bawls brooke from the phlegethons rail and out from under the counters raced half a dozen of paitingis shells darting in towards the boom only the rowers visible above the mist so that each crew was just a line of heads and shoulders cleaving through that woolly blanket just beyond the boom the foggy water was thick with enemy canoes their musketeers firing raggedly at our spyboats i saw heads vanish here and there as the shots took effect but the spyboats forged on and now the pirates were closing on the boom itself scrambling on to the huge logs swords and parangs in hand to deny our men a foothold and above both sides the great gun duel continued between our praus and theirs in one continuous hlish din of explosion and crashing timber punctuated by screams of wounded men and bellowed commands you couldnt hear yourself think but at such times its best not to anyway i was at brookes elbow straining every nerve to keep his body between mine and the enemys fire without being too obvious about it now he was directing our musketeers fire from the phlegethons bow to cover our spyboatmen who were fighting furiously to drive the pirates from the boom so that the great bindingropes could be cut and the boom broken to give our vessels passage i flung myself down yelling nonsense between two of our riflemen seizing a piece myself and making great play at loading it brooke on his feet was walking from man to man pointing out targets that one in the yellow scarf lively now got him the big fellow with the spear the malay beyond paitingi there now the fat one in the stern of yon canoe blaze away boys theyre failing go on stuart get the axes going on those cables come on flashman off we go he slapped me on the shoulder just when id got myself nice and snug behind the sandbags too and perforce i had to tumble after him over the phlegethons side into the jolly bachelor which was bobbing alongside packed with didos men i heard a shot clang on the phlegethons plates just above my head as i went sprawling into the sloop and then hands were hauling me upright and a bearded tar was grinning and yelling ere we go sir twice round the lightouse for a penny i plunged after brooke stumbling over the cursing cheering men who squatted on the deck and fetched up beside him near the bowchaser where he was trying to make himself heard above the din and pointing ahead we were driving in towards the boom under a canopy of rocketsmoke and now the gunfire was dispersing the mist and you could see the oily water already littered with broken timbers and even a body here and there rolling limp on the boom it was a handtohand melйe between the pirate canoes and our spyboatmen a slippering slashing dogfight of glittering parangs and thrusting spears with crashing musketry at pointblank range over the logs i saw paitingi erect on the boom laying about him with a broken oar stuart holding off a naked pirate with his cutlass shielding two chinese who were swinging their axes at the great rattan cables securing the boom even as i watched the cables parted and the logs rolled sending friend and foe headlong into the water the jolly bachelor gave a great yell of triumph and we were heading for the gap into the smoke while from our bow a blue light went up to signal the praus there was a frantic five minutes while we backed water in the space between the broken sides of the boom brooke and the bowchaser crew spraying grape ahead of us and the rest of us banging away at anything that looked like a hostile shape either on the boom itself or in the canoes beyond i used my colt sparingly crouched down by the bulwark and keeping as well snuggled into the mob of tars as possible once when a canoe came surging out of the smoke with a great yellow devil in a quilted tunic and spiked helmet in the prow brandishing a barbed lance i took a steady sight and missed him twice but my third shot got him clean amidships as he was preparing to leap for our rail and he tumbled into the water bravo flashman cries brooke here come up beside me and there i was again red in the face with panic stumbling up beside him as he leaned over the side helping to haul stuart out of the water hed swum from the broken boom and was gasping on the deck sodden wet with a trickle of blood running from his left sleeve steady all roars brooke ready oarsmen every musket primed right hold on there wait for the praus beyond the tangle of wreckage and foundering canoes beyond the struggling swimmers and floating bodies the two ends of the boom were now a good fifty yards apart drifting slowly behind us on the current the spyboats had done their work and our praus were moving ahead under their sweeps coming up into line half a dozen on either side while the rocketpraus farther back were still cannonading away at the pirate line perhaps two cables lengths ahead three or four of them were burning furiously and a great reek of black smoke was surging down river towards us but their line was still solid and their bow guns fired steadily sending up clouds of water round our praus and battering their upper works between them and us their canoes were in retreat scurrying for the safety of the larger craft brooke nodded with satisfaction so far so good cries he and standing up in the bows he waved his hat now then you fellows put your backs into it two blue lights there signal the advance cutlasses and small arms everyone tallyho the bluejackets yelled and stamped and as the blue lights went up the cheering spread along our line and on either side the praus drove forward bowchasers blazing away musketeers firing from the platforms the crews crowding forward to the bows as our line steadied the gunfire rose to a new crescendo we were crouching down as the shot whined above us and suddenly there was an appalling smash a chorus of shrieks and i found myself sodden with blood staring in horror at two legs and half a body thrashing feebly on the deck in front of me where an instant before a seaman had been ramming shot into the bowchaser i sat down heavily pawing at the disgusting mess and then brooke had me on my feet again yelling to know if i was all right and i was yelling back that the corn on my big toe was giving me hell god knows why one says these things but he gave a wild laugh and pushed me forward to the bow rail i crouched down shuddering and ready to vomit helpless with fear but who would have recognized it then suddenly the cannonading died and for a few seconds there was a silence in which you could hear the water chuckling under the jolly bachelors forefoot as she went gliding forward then the musketry crashed out again as our sharpshooters on the praus poured their fire into the pirate line and the pirates gave us back volley for volley thank god the jolly bachelor was too low and too close now for them to get at us with cannon but as we drove in towards them the water either side was boiling with their small shot and behind me there were cries and oaths of men hit our whole line was charging across the water praus on the flanks jolly bachelor in the centre towards the pirate vessels they were barely fifty yards off and i could only stare in horror at the nearest one dead ahead the platform which jutted out from her rails crowded with savage howling faces brandished steel and smoking barrels theyll shoot us to pieces well founderjesus loves me someone was shouting but nobody heard me in that fearful din a seaman at my elbow screamed and stood up tearing at a sumpitan dart in his arm as i dived for the cover of the rail another stood quivering in a cable a foot from my face brooke leaned over grinning snapped it off tossed it away and then did an unbelievable thing i didnt credit it then and scarcely do now but its a fact he stood up full height in the bows one foot on the rail threw away his straw hat and folded his arms staring straight ahead at that yelling grimacing death that was launching shot steel and poisoned arrows at us in clouds he was smiling serenely and seemed to be saying something get down you mad bugger i shouted but he never even heard and then i realized that he wasnt speaking he was singing above the crash of musketry the whistle and thump of those horrid darts the screams and the yells you could hear it come cheer up my lads tis to glory we steer to add something new to this wonderful year he was turning now one hand on a stay for balance thumping the time with his other fist his face alight with laughter roaring to us to sing and from the mob behind it came thundering out heart of oak are our ships jolly tars are our men we always are ready steady boys steady well fight and well conquer again and again the jolly bachelor shuddered in the water as we scraped under the platform of the pirate prau and then shrieking slashing figures were dropping among us i went sprawling on the deck with someone treading on my head and came up to find myself staring into a contorted screaming yellow face i had an instants glimpse of a jade earring carved like a halfmoon and a scarlet turban and then he had gone over the side with a cutlass jammed to the hilt in his stomach i fired at him as he fell slipped in the blood on the deck and finishing up in the scuppers glaring about me in panic the deck was in turmoil resolving itself into knots of bluejackets each killing a struggling pirate in their midst and heaving the bodies overside the prau we had scraped was behind us now and brooke was yelling steady oarsmen pull with a will theres our quarry you chaps straight ahead he was pointing to the right bank where the stockade hit by rocket fire was collapsed in smouldering ruin beyond it lay one of the forts its stockade blazing fiercely with figures scattering away and a gallant few trying to douse the flames behind us was an unbelievable carnage our praus and the pirates locked together in a bloody handtohand struggle and through the gaps our longboats surging in the wake of the jolly bachelor loaded with malay swordsmen and dyaks the water was littered with smoking wreckage and struggling forms men were falling from the platforms and our boats were picking them up when they were friends or butchering them in the bloody current if they were pirates smoke from the burning praus was swirling in a great pall above the infernal scene i remembered that line about a deathshade round the ships and then someone was shaking my arm and brooke was shouting at me pointing ahead to the nearing shore and the smoking breach in the stockade take that fort he was yelling lead the bluejackets charge in dye hear no covering no halting just tear in with the cutlass watch out for women and kids and prisoners chase em flashy good luck to you i inquired tactfully if he was bloody mad but he was ten yards away by then plunging through the shallows as our boat scraped into the shelving bank he scrambled up the shore waving to the other longboats to close on him they were turning at his signal and there was i revolver in shaking fist staring horrified over the bows at the charred ruins of the stockade and beyond it a good hundred yards of hardbeaten earth already littered with cannon casualties and beyond that again the blazing barrier of the forts outer wall christ knew how many slashing fiends were waiting in there ready to blast us with musketry and then rip us up at close quarters if we ever got that far i looked round at the jolly bachelor crammed with yelling sailors straw hats bearded faces white smocks glaring eyes cutlasses at the ready waiting for the word and the word no doubt about it was with old flash well whatever you may say of me i know my duty and if there was one thing afghanistan had taught me it was the art of leadership in a trice i had seized a cutlass thrust it aloft and turned to the maddened crew behind me ha ha you fellows i bellowed here we go then wholl be first after me into yonder fort i sprang to the bank waved my cutlass again and bawled follow me they came tumbling out of the boat on my heels yelling and cheering brandishing their weapons and as i stood shouting on on rule britannia they went pouring up the shore scattering the embers of the stockade i advanced with them of course pausing only to encourage those in the rear with manly cries until i reckoned there were about a score in front of me then i lit out in pursuit of the vanguard not leading from behind exactly more from the middle really which is the safest place to be unless youre up against civilized artillery we charged across the open space howling like hounds as we ran i saw that on our right flank brooke was directing the malay swordsmen towards another fort they were drawing those dreadful kampilans with the hairtufts on their hilts and behind them came a second wave from the boats of halfnaked iban carrying their sumpitan spears and screeching dyak dyak as they ran but none of em matched the speed and fury of my tars who were now almost up to the blazing fort stockade just as they reached it the whole thing by great good luck fell inwards with a great whooshing of sparks and smoke and as the foremost leaped through the burning rubbish i was able to see how wise id been in not leading the charge myself there in a ragged double line was a troop of pirate musketeers presenting their pieces out crashed their volley knocking over one or two of our first fellows and then the rest were into them cutlasses swinging with old flash arriving full of noble noise at the point where our chaps were thickest it seemed to me that i could employ my best efforts picking off the enemy with my colt and this gave me the opportunity to watch something which is worth going a long way to see provided you can find a safe vantage the terrible cutandthrust shoulder to shoulder of british blue jackets in a body i daresay the navy has been teaching it since blakes day and mr gilbert who never dreamed what it was like makes great fun of it nowadays but ive seen it and i know now why weve been ruling the oceans for centuries there must have been a hundred pirates to our first line of twenty but the tars just charged them in a solid wedge cutlasses raised for the backhand cut stamp and slash then thrust stamp and slash then thrust stampslashthrust and that pirate line melted into a fallen tangle of gashed faces and shoulders through which the sailors ploughed roaring those pirates who still stood turned tail and fairly pelted for the fort gates with our chaps chasing and damning em for cowardly swabs made me quite proud to be british i can tell you i was fairly close up with the front rank by now bellowing the odds and taking a juicy swipe at any wounded who happened to be looking tother way the defenders had obviously hoped their musketeers would hold us beyond the gate but we were in before they knew it there was a party of pirates trying to swing a great gun round to blast us at the entrance one of em was snatching at a linstock but before he could touch it off there were half a dozen thrown sheathknives in his body and he sprawled over the gun while the others turned and fled we were in and all that remained was to ferret out every pirate for the place to be ours this presented no difficulty since there werent any for the simple reason that the cunning bds had all sneaked out the back way and were even now scurrying round to take us in the rear at the gate i didnt know this of course at the time i was too busy despatching armed parties under petty officers to overrun the interior which was like no fort id ever seen in fact it was sharif sahibs personal bamboo palace and headquarters a great labyrinth of houses some of em even three storeys high with outside staircases connecting walkways verandahs and screened passages everywhere we had just begun to ransack and loot and had discovered the sharifs private wardrobe an astonishing collection which included such varying garments as clothofgold turbans jewelled tiaras toppers and morning dress when all hell broke out from the direction of the main gate and there was a general move in that direction general but not particular while the loyal tars surged off in search of further blood i was skipping nimbly out of sharif sahibs wardrobe in the opposite direction i didnt know where it would lead but it was at least away from the firing id seen enough gore and horror for one day and i sped quickly across a bamboo bridge into the adjoining house which appeared to be deserted there was a long passage with doors on one side and i was hesitating over which would be the safest bolthole when one of them shot open and out rushed the biggest man ive ever seen in my life he was at least seven feet tall and as hideous as he was big a great yellow globular face set on massive shoulders with a tasselled cap on top staring popeyes and a great sword clutched in his pudgy hands he screamed at the sight of me backing down the passage in a strange waddling run and then he swung his sword back over his head squealing like a steamwhistle overbalanced and vanished with a rending crash down a steep flight of stairs by the sound of it he must have carried away two floors with him but i wasnt waiting about for any more like him i leaped through the nearest door and stopped dead in my tracks unable to believe my eyes i was in a great room full of women i closed my eyes and opened them wondering if i was dreaming or having hallucinations after my trying day it was still there like something out of burtons arabian nights the illustrated one that you can only get on the continent silken hangings couches carpets cushions a stink of perfume coming at you in waves and the ladies a round score of them beautifully round i realized and evidently proud of it for there wasnt clothing enough among the lot of ern to cover one body respectably a few sarongs wisps of silk bangles satin trousers a turban or two but not worth a damn when it came to concealing those splendid limbs shapely hips plump buttocks and pouting tits i could only gape disbelieving and tear my eyes from the bodies to the faces every shade from coffee and beige to honey and white and all beautiful red lips parted and trembling dark kohlfringed eyes wide with terror i wondered for a moment if id been killed in the fight and transported to some delightful paradise but celestial or earthly i couldnt pass up a chance like this and the thought must have shown in my expression for with one accord the whole gorgeous assembly screamed in unison and turned to flee mind i dont blame em for flashy leering in your doorway covered in blood and grime pistol in one hand and bloody cutlass in tother aint quite the vicar dropping in to tea they ran pellmell falling over cushions blundering into each other scrambling for the other doors in the room and it seemed only common sense to grab for the nearest a voluptuous little thing whose entire wardrobe was a necklace and gauzy trousers it may have been my hand on her ankle or her topheavy bosom that made her overbalance either way she fell through a curtained alcove and slithered headlong down a narrow stairway scrambling and shrieking with flashy in hot pursuit she fetched up against a screen wall at the bottom i seized her joyfully and in that moment i was recalled to a sense of my true position by a sound that drove all carnal thoughts from my mind a deafening volley of musketry crashed in the street just outside the flimsy housewall there was a clash of steel a jabber of native voices pirates for certain and in the distance an english voice bawling orders to take cover it seemed a capital notion i pinned the wriggling wench to the floor brandished my pistol and mouthed at her to be silent she lay shuddering in my grip her face working with terror lovely little face it was part chinkindianmalay probably great eyes filled with tears short nose plump little lips and by george she was handsomely built too more by instinct than apurpose i found myself taking an appraising fondle and she trembled under my hand but had sense enough to keep her mouth shut i listened fearfully the pirates were moving just beyond our screen wall and then suddenly they were blazing away again yelling and cursing or crying out in agony feet running and shots whining horribly near i clapped a hand over her mouth and gripped her close terrified that she would scream and bring some bestial savage cleaving through the flimsy wall to fillet me we lay there in the stuffy dimness of the stairfoot with the noise of battle pounding by not six feet away and once during a seconds lull in the tumult i heard the sounds of squealing and wailing somewhere overhead the other young ladies of the patusan finishing school waiting to be ravished and murdered presumably i found i was hissing hysterically in her ear quiet quiet quiet for gods sake and to my astonishment she was whimpering tearfully back amiga sua amiga sua stroking my sweating face with her hand a look of terrified entreaty in her eyes she was even trying to smile too a pathetic little grimace straining to bring her slobbering lips up to mine making little moaning noises well ive seen women in the grip of terror often enough but i couldnt account for this passionate frenzy until i realized that my shuddering was of a curiously rhythmic nature that i had a quivering tit in one hand and a plump thigh in the other that our nether garments seemed to have come adrift somehow and that my innards were convulsing with another sensation besides fear i was so startled i nearly broke stride id never have believed that i could gallop a female without realizing i was doing it yet here we were thundering away like king hal on honeymoon after all id been through that day and with battle murder and sudden death raging around us it just shows how your better instinct will prevail in a crisis some fall to prayer others cry upon queen and country but heres one im proud to say who instinctively fornicated in the jaws of death gibbering with fright and reckless lust but giving of his best for when you realize it may be your last ride you make the most of it and dyou know it may well be true that perfect love casteth out fear as dr arnold used to say leastways i doubt if i can ever have been in finer tupping trim for in the last ecstatic moment my partner fainted clean away and you cant do better by em than that they were still going at it hammer and tongs outside but after a while the action seemed to move along and when presently i heard in the distance the unmistakable sound of a british cheer i judged it was safe to venture forth again my wench had come to and was lying limp and blubbering too scared to stir i had to lay the flat of my sword across her rump to drive her up the stairs and then after a cautious prowl i sallied out it was all over by then my blue jackets who didnt seem to have missed me had driven off the pirate attack and were busy emptying the fort of its valuables before it was burned for brooke was determined to destroy the pirate nests utterly i told em that during the fighting id heard the cries of women in one of the buildings and that the poor creatures must be sought out and treated with all consideration i was very stern about that but when they went to look it appeared that the whole gaggle had decamped into the jungle there wasnt a living soul left in the place so i went off to find brooke and report outside the fort it was a nightmare the open space down to the river was littered with enemy corpses most of them headless for the victorious dyaks had been busy at their ghastly work of collecting trophies and the river itself was just a mess of smoking wreckage the pirate praus had either been burned in the battle or had fled upriver fewer than a quarter of them had escaped scores of their crews had been killed or driven into the jungle and great numbers of wounded and prisoners had been herded into one of the captured forts all five of them had been taken and two of them were already alight when night came down on patusan it was still as bright as day from the orange flare of the burning buildings the heat was so intense that for a time we had to retire to our boats but all through the night the work had to go on prisoners to be guarded and fed our own wounded to be cared for the loot of the forts assessed and shipped our vessels repaired stores replenished fresh weapons and ammunition issued dead counted and the whole sickening confusion restored to some sort of order ive seen the aftermath of battle fifty times if ive seen it once and its heil but through all the foulness and exhaustion theres always one cheery thought im here sick and sore and weary perhaps but at least alive and sound with a place to lie down and id had a good if somewhat alarming rattle into the bargain the one snag was that thered been no sign of the sulu queen so the whole filthy business would have to be gone through again which was not to be contemplated i said as much to brooke in the faint hope that i might get him to give up of course i played it full of manly anguish torn between love of elspeth and concern at what her rescue had already cost taint right raja says i looking piously constipated i cant ask this kind of of sacrifice from you and your people god knows how many lives will be lost how many noble fellows no it wont do shes my wife and well its up to me dont you see it was dreadful humbug hinting id take on the job singlehanded in some unspecified fashion given the chance id have legged it for singapore that instant sent out reward notices and sat back out of harms way from which you may gather that a busy day among the borneo pirates had quite dissipated the conscientious lunacy which had temporarily come over me in the stokehold the previous night but i was wasting my time of course he just gripped my hand with tears in his eyes and cried do you truly think theres a man of us who would fail you now well win her back at any cost besides and he gritted his teeth there are these pirate rascals to stamp out still weve won the decisive battle thanks to valour such as yours but we must give em the coup de grace so you see id be bound to go on even if your loved one were not in their foul hands he gripped my shoulder youre a white man flashman and i know youd go on alone if you had to well you can count on jb to blazes and beyond so there that was what id been afraid of we were another two days at patusan waiting for news from brookes spies and keeping to windward of the dyaks funeral pyres on the riverbank before word came that the sulu queen had been sighted twenty miles farther upstream with a force of enemy praus but when we cruised up there on the th the birds had flown to sharif mullers fort on the undup river so for two more days we must toil after them plagued by boiling heat and mosquitoes the stream running stronger all the time and our pace reduced to a struggling crawl the phlegethon had to be left behind because of the current and snags to which the pirates had added traps of treetrunks and sunken rattan nets to trammel our sweeps every few minutes there would have to be a halt while we cut our way loose hacking at the creeper ropes and then hauling on drenched with sweat and oily water panting for breath eyes forever turning to that steaming olive wall that hemmed us in either side waiting for the whistle of a sumpitan dart that every now and then would come winging out of the jungle to strike a paddler or quiver in the gunwales beith keppels surgeon was up and down the fleet constantly digging the beastly things out of limbs and cauterizing wounds fortunately they were seldom fatal but i reckoned we were suffering a casualty every halfhour it wouldnt have been too bad if id still had the phlegethons iron sheets to skulk behind but i had been assigned to paitingis spyboat which was as often as not in the lead only at night did i go back aboard the jolly bachelor with brooke and that wasnt much comfort huddled up for sleep at the foot of her ladder after the tintacks had been scattered on her deck against night attack sweating in the cramped dark filthy and unkempt listening to the screaming noise of the jungle and the occasional distant throb of a wargong doom doom doom out of the misty dark drum away muller brooke would say well be playing you a livelier tune presently just you wait well see some fun then eh flashy by his lights i suppose that what happened on the third day along the undup was fun a dawn attack on mullers fort which was a great stockaded bamboo castle on a steep hill the rocketpraus pounded it and the remnants of the pirate fleet in their anchorage and then didos men and the dyaks swarmed ashore the latter wardancing on the landingground before the assault leaping shaking their sumpitans and yelling dyak poor charlie wade was killed storming the fort i heard later hed been shot while carrying a malay child to shelter which shows what christian charity gets you the only part i took in the fight though was when a prau broke free from the pirate anchorage and made off upriver sweeps going like blazes and wargong thundering paitingi danced up and down roaring in scotch and arabic that he could see mullers personal banner on her so our spy set off in pursuit the prau foundered burning from rocketfire but muller a persevering big villain in quilted armour and black turban took to a sampan we overhauled it banging away and i was having the horrors at the thought of boarding when the sensible chap dived overboard with his gang at his heels and swam for it we lost him near the jungleedge and paitingi tore his beard cussing as only an arab can come back and fight ye sonofamalaybitchcries he shaking his fist istagfurallah is it thus that pirates prove their courage aye run to the jungle ye port said pimp you by the seven heroes i shall give thy head to my lingas yet thou uncircumcised carrion ach burn his grandmither hes awa wi it so he is by this time the fort was taken and we left it burning and the dead unburied for it had been discovered from a prisoner that our principal quarry suleiman usman with the sulu queen and presumably my errant wife had taken refuge up the skrang river with a force of praus so it was back down the undup again a good deal faster than we had come up to the mainstream where phlegethon was guarding the junction you cant run much farther now usman my son says brooke skrangs navigable for a few miles at most if he takes sulu queen any distance up hell ground her hes bound to stand and fight why hes still got more men and keels than we have and while weve been chasing muller hes had time to put em in order he must know were pretty used up and thinned out too that was no lie either the faces round the table in phlegethons tiny wardroom were puffy and holloweyed with fatigue keppel the spruce naval officer of a week ago looked like a scarecrow with his unshaven cheeks and matted hair his uniform coat cut and torn and the epaulette burned away charlie johnson with his arm in a bloodstained sling was dozing and waking like a clockwork doll even stuart normally the liveliest of fellows was sitting tuckered out with his head in his hands his halfcleaned revolver on the table before him only brooke was still as offensively chipper as ever cleanshaven and alert for all that his eyes looked like streaky bacon he glanced round at us and i could guess that he was thinking this pack cant follow much longer however says he grinning slyly we aint as used up as all that are we i reckon theres three days energy left in every man here and four in me i tell you what he squared his elbows on the table im going to give a dinnerparty tomorrow night full dress for everyone of course on the eve of what is going to be our last fight against these rascals bismillah id like tae believe that says paitingi well our last on this expedition anyway cries brooke its bound to be either we wipe them up or they finish us but that aint going to happen not after the drubbings weve given em already ive got a dozen of champagne down below and well crack em to our crowning success eh wouldnt it be better to keep em for afterwards says keppel but at this stuart raised his head and shook it smiling wearily might not all be here by then this way everyones sure of a share beforehand thats what you said the night before we went in against the lingas in the old royalist aint it jb remember the nineteen of us five years ago theres no drinking after death by jove though there aint many of the nineteen left plenty of new chums though says brooke quickly and theyre going to sing for their supper just the way we did then and have done ever since he shoved charlie johnsons nodding head to and fro wake up charlie its singing night if you want your dinner tomorrow come on or ill shove a wet sponge down your back sing laddie sing george has given you the lead johnson blinked and stammered but brooke gave tongue with heres a health to the king and a lasting peace thumping the table and charlie came in croaking on the lines so let us drink while we have breath for theres no drinking after death and carried on solo to the end goggling like an owl while brooke beat the table and cried good boy charlie sick em pup the others looked embarrassed but brooke rounded on keppel badgering him to sing keppel didnt want to at first and sat looking annoyed and sheepish but brooke worked away at him full of high spirits and what else was the chap to do so he sang spanish ladies he sang well im bound to say in a rolling bass and by this time even the tiredest round the table were grinning and joining in the chorus with brooke encouraging and keeping time and watching us like a hawk he sang the arethusa himself and even coaxed paitingi who gave us a psalm at which charlie giggled hysterically but keppel joined in like thunder and then brooke glanced at me nodding quietly so i found myself giving em drink puppy drink and they stamped and thumped to make the cabin shiver it was a shameful performance so forced and false it was disgusting this jolly lunatic putting heart into his men by making em sing and everyone hating it but they sang youll notice and me along with em and at the finish brooke jumps up and cries come thats none so bad well have a choir yet spyboats will lead tomorrow am sharp then didos pinnace the two cutters gig jolly bachelor then the small boats dinner at seven prompt good night gentlemen and off he went leaving us gawking at each other then keppel shook his head smiling and sighed and we dispersed feeling pretty foolish i dare say i found myself wondering why they tolerated brooke and his schoolboy antics which were patently pathetic why did they humour him for that is what it was it wasnt fear or love or even respect i suspect they felt it would somehow be mean to disappoint him and so they fell in with every folly whether it was charging a pirate prau in a jollyboat or singing shanties when they ought to have been nursing their wounds or crawling away to sink into an exhausted sleep yes they did humour him god only knows why mind you mad and dangerous as he was im bound to say he was difficult to refuse in anything i managed it later that night though admittedly not to his face i was snug under the jolly bachelors ladder when the pirates came sneaking silently out of the mist in sampans and tried to take us by surprise they were on the deck and murdering our lookouts before we were any the wiser and if it hadnt been that the deck was littered with tacks to catch their bare feet that would have been the end of the ship and everyone aboard including me as it was there was the deuce of a scrap in the dark with brooke yelling for everyone to pitch in i burrowed closer into cover myself clutching my pistol until the hurroosh had died down when i scuttled up quickly and blundered about glaring and letting on that id been there all the time i did yeoman work helping to heave dead pirates overside and then we stood to until daylight but they didnt trouble us again next day it began to rain like fury and we set off up the skrang into a perfect sheet of water which cut visibility almost to nothing and pitted the river like smallshot all day we toiled slowly into the murk with the river narrowing until it was a bare furlong wide and devil an enemy did we see i sat sodden in paitingis spyboat reduced to the nadir of misery baling constantly until my whole body cried out with one great ache by dark i was dropping with fatigue and then when we anchored damn my skin if we didnt have to shave and wash and dig out clean duds for brookes dinnerparty on the jolly bachelor looking back i cant imagine why i put up with it i dont attempt to fathom the minds of the others they all dressed in their best soaking wet and i couldnt show unwilling could i we assembled in the jolly bachelors cabin steaming and dripping and there was the table laid for dinner silver glass and all with brooke in his blue swallowtail and brass buttons welcoming us like a bloody governorgeneral taking wine with keppel waving us to our seats and frowning because the turtle soup was cold i dont believe this is happening thinks i its all a terrible nightmare and stuart isnt sitting opposite me in his black broadcloth with his stringcravat tied in a fancy bow and this aint real champagne im drinking by the light of reeking slushlamps with everyone crowded round the board in the tiny cabin and theyre not listening breathlessly while i tell em about getting alfred mynn legbefore at lords there arent any pirates really and were not miles up some stinking creek in borneo drinking the loyal toast with the thunder bellowing outside and the rain gushing down the companion and brooke clipping cigars and passing them round while the malay steward puts the port on the table i couldnt bring myself to believe that all round us was a fleet of sampans and spyboats loaded with dyaks and blue jackets and other assorted savages and that tomorrow we would be reliving the horror of patusan all over again it was all too wild and confused and unreal and although i must have accounted for a bottle of warm champagne and about a pint of port i got up from that table as sober as i sat down it was real enough in the morning though the morning of that last dreadful day on the skrang river the weather had cleared like magic just before dawn and the narrow waterway ahead was gleaming brown and oily in the sunlight between its olive walls of jungle it was deathly hot and for once the forest was comparatively silent but there was an excitement through the fleet that you could almost feel beating in waves through the muggy air it wasnt only that brooke had predicted that this would be the last battle i believe there was a realization too that if we didnt reach conclusions with the pirates lurking somewhere ahead our expedition would come to a halt through sheer exhaustion and there would be nothing for it but to turn downriver again it bred a kind of wild desperation in the others stuart was shivering with impatience as he dropped beside me into paitingis spyboat drawing his pistol and shoving it back in his belt then doing the same thing over again even paitingi in the bow was taut as a fiddlestring snapping at the lingas and twitching at his red beard my own condition i leave you to guess our boy hero of course was his usual jaunty self he was perched in the jolly bachelors bows as our spyboat shoved off straw hat on head issuing his orders and cracking jokes fit to sicken you theyre there old un cries he to paitingi all right i dare say you cant smell em but i can well fetch up with them by afternoon at latest probably sooner so keep a sharp lookout and dont get more than a pistolshot ahead of the second spy dyou hear aye aye says paitingi i dont like it jb its gey quiet suppose theyve taken to the sidecreeks scattered and hid sulu queen cant hide calls brooke shes bound to hold to the mainstream and thats going to shoal on her before long shes the quarry mind take her and the snakes head is cut clean off here have a mango he threw the fruit to paitingi never you mind the sidecreeks the instant you sight that steambrig up with a blue light and hold your station well do the rest paitingi muttered something about ambush in the narrow water and brooke laughed and told him to stop croaking remember the first chap you ever fought against cries he well whats a parcel of pirates compared to him off you go old lad and good luck he waved as we shot away the paddles skimming us into midstream and up to the first bend with the other spies lining out in our wake and the didos pinnace and jolly bachelor leading the heavier craft behind i asked stuart what brooke had meant about the first chap paitingi had fought and he laughed that was napoleon didnt you know paitingi was in the turkish army at the battle of the pyramids werent you gaffer aye growls paitingi and got weel beat for my pains but i tell ye stuart i felt easier that day than i do this he fidgeted in the bow leaning on the carronade to stare upriver under his hand theres something no canny i can feel it listen we strained our ears above the swish of the paddles but except for the cries of birds in the forest and the hum of the insect clouds close inshore there was nothing the river was empty and by the sound of it the surrounding jungle was too dont hear anything out o the way says stuart precisely says paitingi no wargongs yet weve heard them every day for this week past what ails them dunno says stuart but aint that a good sign ask me this evening says paitingi i hope ill be able to tell ye then his uneasiness infected me like the plague for i knew he had as good a nose as any fightingman id ever struck and when such a one starts to twitch look out i had lively recollections of sergeant hudson sniffing trouble in the bleak emptiness of the jallalabad road by god hed been right against all the signs and here was paitingi on the same tack cocking his head frowning standing up from time to time to scan the impenetrable green glancing at the sky tugging his whiskers it got on my nerves and stuarts too yet there wasnt sight nor smell of trouble as we glided up the silent river in the bright sunshine slow mile after slow mile through the brilliant bends and reaches and always the stream brown and empty as far as we could see ahead the air was empty and still the sound of a mugger slipping with its heavy splash off a sandbank had us jumping up reaching for our pistols then a bird would screech on the other shore and we would start round again sweating cold in that steamy loneliness i dont know any place where you feel as naked and exposed as an empty jungle river with that vast hostile ageold forest all about you just like lords but no pavilion to run to paitingi stood it for a couple of hours and then lost patience he had been using his glass to rake the mouths of the little overhung sidecreeks that we passed every now and then dim silent tunnels into the wild now he glowered back at the second spyboat a hundred yards in our wake andsnapped an order to the paddlers to increase their stroke the spy surged ahead trembling beneath us stuart looked back anxiously at the widening gap j b said not more than a pistolshot ahead says he and paitingi rounded on him if jb has his way well spring the trap wi our whole fleet then wherell he be dye think he kens more about handling a spyboat than i do but were to hold steady till we come up with the sulu queen shaitan take the sulu queen shes lying up in one o these creeks whatever jb likes tae think theyre not ahead of us i tell ye theyre either side sit doon damn ye he snaps at me stuart pass the word port paddles be ready to back water at my signal keep the stroke going well win him a halfmile of water to manoeuvre in if were lucky steady and wait for my word i couldnt make anything of this but it was plainly dreadful news by what he said we were inside the jaws of the trap already and the woods full of hidden fiends waiting to pounce and he was forging ahead to spring the ambush before the rest of our boats got well inside i sat gagging with fear staring at that silent wall of leaves at the eddies swirling round the approaching bend at paitingis broad back as he crouched over the prow the river had narrowed sharply in the last mile to a bare hundred paces or so the banks were so close i imagined i could see through the nearest trees into the dark shadows beyond was there something stirring there could i hear some awful presence the spyboat was fairly flying round the bend and behind us the river was empty for a couple of furlongs we were alone far ahead now roars paitingi dropping to his knees and clutching the gunwales and as the port paddlers backed water the spyboat spun crazily on her heel her bow rearing clear out of the water so that we had to cling like grim death to avoid being hurled out for an awful instant she hung suspended at a fearful angle with the water a good six feet beneath my left elbow then she came smashing down as though she would plunge to the bottom wallowed with the water washing over her sides and we were round and driving downriver with paitingi yelling to us to bale for our lives the water was ankle deep as i scooped at it with my hat dashing it over the side the paddlers were gasping like leaky engines the current helping to scud us along at a frightening pace and then there was a yell from paitingi i raised my head to look and saw a sight that froze me in my seat a hundred yards ahead downriver something was moving from the tangle of the bank a raft poling slowly out on the bosom of the stream crowded with men at the same moment there was a great rending tearing noise from the jungle on the opposite bank the forest seemed to be moving slowly outward and then it detached itself into one huge tree a mass of tangled green falling ponderously with a mighty splash to block a third of the stream on our port bow from the jungle either side came the sudden thunderous boom of wargongs behind the first raft another was setting out there were small canoes sprouting like black fingers from the banks ahead each loaded with savages where a moment since the river had been silent and empty it was now vomiting a horde of pirate craft baying their warcries their boats alive with steel and yelling cruel faces cutting us off swarming towards us there were others on the banks on our beams archers and blowpipemen the whistwhistwhist of shafts came lancing towards us there ye see roars paitingi whaurs your clever jb now stuart sulu queen says he aye weel hes got clear water tae work in small thanks to himsel these sons o eblis looked to trap a fleet theyve got one wee spyboat and he stood up roaring with laughter and defiance drive for the gap steersman on on charge there are moments in life which defy description in my black moods they seem to have occurred about once a week and i have difficulty distinguishing them the last minutes at balaclava the moment when the welsh broke at little hand rock and the zulus came bounding over our position the breaching of pipers fort gate the neckornothing race for renos bluff with the sioux braves running among the shattered rabble of custers seventh ive stretched my legs in all of those knowing i was going to die and being damned noisy at the prospect but in paitingis spyboat running was impossible so depressingly was surrender i observed those flat evil faces sweeping down on us behind their glittering lanceheads and kampilans and decided they werent open to discussion there was nothing for it but to sit and blaze away in panic and then a redhot pain shot through my left ribs and i looked down bewildered to see a sumpitan shaft in my side yellow it was with a little black tuft of lint on its butt and i pawed at it whimpering until stuart reached over and wrenched it clear to my considerable discomfort i screamed twisted and went over the side i dare say it was that that saved me although im blessed if i know how i took a glance at the official account of the action before i wrote this and evidently the historian had a similar difficulty in believing that anyone survived our little waterparty for he states flatly that every man jack of paitingis crew was slaughtered he notes that they had got too far ahead were cut off by a sudden ambush of rafts and praus and by the time brookes fleet had come storming up belatedly to the rescue paitingi and his followers had all been killed theres a graphic account of twenty boats jammed together in a bloody melйe of thousands of pirates yelling on the bank of the stream running crimson with headless corpses wreckage and capsized craft drifting downstream but never a word about poor old flashy struggling halffoundered dyeing the water with his precious gore spluttering wait you callous bastards im sinking quite hurtful being ignored like that although i was glad enough of it at the time when i saw how things were shaping it was ive since gathered touch and go that brookes whole fleet wasnt wiped out indeed if it hadnt been for paitingis racing ahead sacrificing his spyboat like the gallant idiot he was the pirates would have jumped the whole expedition together but as it was brooke had time to dress his boats into line and charge in good order it was a horrid nearrun thing though keppel confessed later that when he saw the fighting horde that was waiting for him for a moment i was at a loss what steps to take and there was one chap treading water upstream with a hole in his belly and roaring for succour who shared his sentiments exactly i was viewing the action from tother side so to speak but it looked just as confused and interesting to me as it did to keppel i was busy of course holding my wounded guts with one hand and clutching at a piece of wreckage with the other trying to avoid being run down by boats full of illdisposed persons with swords but as i came up for the tenth time i saw the last seconds of paitingis spyboat crashing into the heart of the enemy its bowgun exploding to tear a bloody cleft through the crew of a raft then the pirate wave swept over them i had a glimpse of stuart stuck like a pincushion with sumpitan darts toppling into the water of a linga swordsman clearing a space with his kampilan swinging in a shining circle round his head of another in the water stabbing fiercely up at the foes above him of the steersman on hands and knees on the raft being hacked literally into bits by a screaming crowd of pirates of paitingi a bristling red giant his turban gone roaring allahilallah with a pirate swung up in his huge arms and then there was just the shell of the spyboat overturned in the swirling bloody water with the pirate boats surging away from it turning to meet the distant unseen enemy downstream i didnt have time to see any more the water was roaring in my ears i could feel my strength ebbing away through the tortured wound in my side my fingers slipping from their grip on the wreckage the sky and treetops were spinning slowly overhead and across the surface of the water something a boat a raft was racing down on me with a clamour of voices air and water were full of the throbbing of wargongs and then i was hit a violent blow on the head something scraped agonizingly over my body forcing me down choking with water my ears pounding lungs bursting and then as old wild bill would have said why boys i drowned for a moment i thought i was back in jallalabad in that blissful awakening after the battle there was a soft bed under me sheets at my chin and a cool breeze i opened my eyes and saw that it came from a porthole opposite me that wasnt right though no portholes in the khyber country i struggled with memory and then a figure blocked the light a huge figure in green sarong and sleeveless tunic with a krees in his girdle and fingering his earring as he stared down at me his heavy brown face as hard as a curlingstone you should have died says don solomon haslam just what an awakening invalid needs of course but it brought the nightmare flooding back the reeking waters of the skrang the overwhelmed spyboat the dart in my side i was conscious of a dull ache in my ribs and of bandages but where the devil was i in the sulu queen sure enough but even in that dizzy moment of waking i was aware that her motion was a slow steady heave there were no jungle noises and the air blowing from the port was salt i tried to speak and my voice came in a parched croak what what am i doing here surviving says he for the moment and then to my amazement he thrust his face into mine and snarled but you couldnt die decently could you oh no not you hundreds perished in that river but you survive every man of paitingis good men lingas who fought to the last paitingi himself who was worth a thousand all lost but not you blubbering in the water where my men found you they should have left you to drown i should have bah he wheeled away fuming well i hadnt expected him to be pleased to see me but even in my confused state so much passion seemed a mite unreasonable was i delirious but no i felt not bad and when i tried to ease myself up on the pillows i found i could do it without much discomfort one doesnt care to be raved at lying down you understand a hundred questions and fears were jumbled in my mind but the first one was how long have i been here two weeks he eyed me malevolently and if you wonder where the sulu queen is approximately ten south seventy east heading westsouwest then bitterly what the devil else was i to do once those fools had hauled you from the water let you die of gangrene treat you as you deserved ha that was the one thing i could not do being still halfstupid with prolonged unconsciousness i couldnt make much of this the last time id seen him wed been booncompanions more or less but since then hed tried to murder me kidnapped my wife and turned out to be the archpirate of the orient which shed a different light on things i tried to steady my whirling thoughts but couldnt anyway he was obviously in a fearful wax because hed felt obliged god only knew why not to let me perish of blowpipe poison difficult to know what to say so i didnt you can guess why you are alive says he it is because of her whose husband you were for a dreadful second i thought he meant she was dead then my mind leaped to the conclusion that he meant he had taken her from me and done the dirty deed on her and at the very thought of my little elspeth being abused by this vile nigger pirate this scum of the east my confusion and discretion vanished together in rage you bloody liar i am her husband shes my wife you kidnapped her you filthy pirate and kidnapped saved you mean his eyes were blazing rescued her from a man no from a brute who wasnt fit to kiss her feet oh no its not kidnapping to take a pearl from a swine who fouls her with his very touch who treats her as a mere concubine who betrays her its a lie i didnt i see you with my own eyes coupling with that slut in my own library drawingroom that harlot lade isnt your name a byword in london for debauchery and vice for every kind of lewdness and depravity not every kind i never a rake a cheat a bully and a whoremonger thats what i rescued that sweet brave woman from i took her from the hell of life with you youre mad i croaked she never said it was hell she loves me curse you as i love her his hand swept across my face knocking me back on my pillow and i had sense enough to stay there for he was a fearsome sight shaking with fury his mouth working what did you ever know of love cries he let me hear that word on your lips again and ill have them sewn together with a scorpion in your mouth well when he put it like that i saw there was no point in arguing i lay there quaking while he mastered himself and went on more quietly love is not for animals like you love is what i felt for the first time on an afternoon at lords when i saw her i knew then as surely as i know there is one god that there could be no other woman that i should worship her for life a life that would be death without her yes i knew then what love was he let out a great breath and he was trembling by george thinks i weve got a maniac here he means it he heaved a minute and then went on like a poet on opium she filled my life from that moment there was nothing el e but it was a pure love she would have been sacred to n e had she been married to a husband truly worthy of her e it when i saw the truth that she was shackled to the basest kind of brute he shot me a withering look i asked why my life and hers should be ruined by a stupid convention which after all meant nothing to me oh i was a gentleman trained in the english way at an english school but i was also a prince of the house of magandanu descended from the prophet himself and i was a pirate as you of the west know the word why should i respect your customs when i could offer her a destiny as high above life with you as the stars are above the slime why should i hesitate i could make her a queen instead of the chattel of a drunken licentious bully who had only married her at pistol point that aint fair she was damned glad to get me and if that poxy little varmint morrison says other dont hit me im wounded not by one word by one gesture did she complain her loyalty like everything else about her is perfect even to a worm like you but i knew and i determined to save her for a love worthy of her so i worked carefully patiently for both our sakes it was torture to impose on that sweet innocence but i knew that in time she would bless me for the subterfuge i was ready to sacrifice anything millions what were they to me i who was half of the east half of the west was prepared to put myself beyond the law beyond civilization for her sake i would give her a throne a fortune and true love for i still have my kingdom of the east and she shall share it with me well you wont want me as british ambassador thinks i but i kept mum tactfully he paced about the cabin looking masterful as he prated on so i took her and i fought for her in the face of that vicious madman brooke oh hell come too often to borneo that one with his lying piety and promises he that is the bloodiest pirate of us all no doubt he made a fine pretext of rescuing her so that he could come again and harry and burn us butcher our people he was working into a fine froth now waving his hands whats it to him how we live what sacred right has he to war on us and our ways id have eaten his fleet alive on the skrang but for paitingi as it was i slipped him in the creeks and came downriver with this one vessel he thinks hes finished suleiman usman does he let him come to maludu when i return there he paced some more chewing over brooke and then rounded on me but he doesnt matternot now you do youre here and youre inopportune he paused considering me yes you should have died i wished to god hed stop harping on that you could see where it was going to lead this wasnt don solomon of brook street any longer not so youd notice this was a beastly aborigine who went plundering about in ships festooned with skulls and i was an inconvenient husband nuff said in addition he clearly had more screws loose than a drunk sapper all that moonshine about worshipping elspeth not being able to live without her making her a queen well it would have been laughable if it hadnt been true after all when a man kidnaps a married woman and fights a war over her it aint just a passing fancy but one thing was plain his wooing hadnt prospered or id have been overside long ago with a bag of coal round my ankles why the hell couldnt he have rattled her in london and got tired of it and wed have been spared all this but here we were in a pickle whose delicacy made my flesh crawl i considered took a deep breath and tried not to talk shrill well now don solomon says i i take note of what youve said and ah im glad weve had this little prose together you know and youve told me um what you think yes youve put it very fair and while i cant but deplore what youve done mind well i understand your feelings as any man of sensibility must and im that i hope and i see you were deeply affected by well by my wife and i know what its like of course i mean shes a little stunner we agree heavens yes i babbled on while he gaped in bewilderment small blame to him but youve got it quite wrong you know were a devoted couple elspeth mrs flashman and i ask anyone never a cross word sublimely happy and that whore lade he snarled is that your devotion why my dear chap the merest accident i mean that i noticed her at all pure jealousy at seeing my wife flattered by your attentions a man of your address i mean polished manners charming stinking rich no no i mean i found myself quite cut out and mrs lade well heat of the moment you know yourself how one can be carried away it was touch and go that he didnt savage me on the bed considering the drivel i was talking but it sometimes works rubbish with a ring of sincerity when youre stuck with a hopeless case it didnt here he strode to the bed seized me by the shoulder and drew back his great fist you infernal liar cries he dyou think you can gammon me with your snivelling im not i bawled i love elspeth and she loves me and you know it she dont want you id done it now i could see so i went roaring on thats why you wish id died because you know if you harm me now your last hope of winning her is gone dont im an invalid my wound his fingers bit my shoulder like a vice suddenly he flung me back and straightened up with an ugly laugh so thats what youre counting on why you miserable toad she doesnt even know youre here i could drop you overboard and shed never know aye you go pale at i dont believe you if that were true youd have done me in already you tried it in singapore rot you with your foul black gangsters he stared at me ive no notion what youre talking about and he sounded sincere curse him i dont expect you to understand it flashman but the reason youre still alive is that im a man of honour when i take her to her throne and i shall it will be with a clean hand not one fouled with a husbands blood even a husband like you that was reassuring enough to banish my immediate terrors i even recovered sufficiently for a cautious sneer talks cheap solomon honour says you but you aint above wifestealing and cheating at cricket oh aye breaking a chaps wicket when youve laid him out foul if youre such a man of honour i taunted him youd let elspeth choose for herself but you darent cos you know shed plump for me warts and all he stood stock still just looking at me without expression fingering his earring again then after a moment he nodded slowly yes says he quietly it must come to that must it not very well he threw open the door and barked an order glancing oddly at the while we waited feet sounded and i felt my heart begin to thump uncontrollably as i sat up in bed god knows why but i was suddenly dizzy and then she was there in the doorway and for a moment i thought it was someone else this was some eastern nymph in a clinging sarong of red silk her skin tanned to the gold of honey whereas elspeths was like milk her blonde hair was bleached almost white by the sun and then i saw those magnificent blue eyes round with bewilderment like her lips and i heard a sob coming out of me elspeth she gave a little scream and stumbled in the doorway putting her hand to her eyes and then she was running to my arms crying harry oh harry flinging herself at me her mouth against mine clutching my head in wild hands sobbing hysterically and i forgot solomon and the ache of my wound and fear and danger as i pressed that lovely softness against me and kissed and kissed her until she went suddenly limp and slid from my arms to the floor in a dead faint it was only then as i scrambled out clutching my bandaged side that i realized the door was closed and solomon was gone i tried to haul her up to the bed but i was still weak as a kitten from my wound and confinement and couldnt manage it so i had to be content with pawing and fondling until her eyes fluttered open and then she clung to me muttering my name and after we had babbled thankfully for a few minutes and exchanged our news so to speak we got down to the reunion in earnest and in the middle of it while i was just wondering if my wound was about to come asunder she suddenly pulled her mouth free of mine and cried harry what is mrs leo lade to you hey i yelped what what dye mean whos she i mean you know her very well the dukes companion who paid you such singular attention what is between you good god at a time like this elspeth my dear what has mrs lade to do with anything that is what i am asking no desist don solomon said hinted of an attachment is this true you wouldnt credit it here she was on a pirate ship having been abducted shanghaied round half the east through war ambush and confounded headhunters reunited with her longlost spouse and just as he was proving his undying affection at grievous risk to his health her jealous little peabrain was off on another tack altogether unbelievable and most unflattering but i was equal to the occasion solomon cries i that viper has he been trying to poison your mind against me with his lies i might have guessed it not content with stealing you the villain traduces me to you dont you see hell stop at nothing to win you away from me oh she frowned up at me god she was lovely if halfwitted you mean he oh how could he be so base oh harry and she began to cry trembling all down her body in a way that almost brought me to the boil all the rest i could bear the fear and shame and and all of it but the thought that you might have been untrue as he suggested ah that would have broken my heart tell me it wasnt so my love course it wasnt good lord that raddled pudding lade how could you think it i despise the woman and as though i could even look at her or any other when i have my own perfect angelic aphrodite i tried a couple of cautious thrusts as i saw the suspicion dying in her eyes but since attacks the best form of defence i suddenly stopped frowning thunderously that foul kite solomon he will stoop to any depth oh dearest i have been mad these past weeks the thought of you in his clutches i gulped in manly torment tell me in your ordeal did he i mean well did he the scoundrel she was flushed with my attentions anyway but at this she went crimson and moaned softly those innocent eyes brimming with tears oh how can you ask would i be alive now if if oh harry i cannot believe it is you holding me safe oh my love well that was that settled and mrs lade disposed of at least until we had finished the business in hand and were lying talking in the growing dusk of the cabin naturally elspeths story came flooding out in an excited stream and i was listening with my mind in a great confusion what with my weakened state the crazy shock of our reunion and the anxiety of our predicament and suddenly in the middle of describing the rations theyd fed her during her captivity she suddenly said harry you are sure you have not been astride mrs lade i was so amazed she had to say it twice eh good god girl what dyou mean have you mounted her i cant think how ive kept my sanity talking to that woman for sixty years of course at this time wed only been married for five and i hadnt plumbed the depths of her eccentricity i could only gargle and exclaim dammit ive told you i havent and where on earth it is shocking to use expressions of that kind why you use them i heard you at lady chalmers when you were talking to jack speedicut and you were both remarking on lottie cavendish and whatever her husband could see in such a foolish creature and you said you expected he found her a good mount i dare say i was not meant to hear i should think not and i can have said no such thing and anyway ladies aint meant to understand such such vulgar words the ladies who get mounted must understand them they aint ladies why not lottie cavendish is so am i and you have mounted me lots of times she sighed and nestled close god help us well i have not done any such thing with mrs lade so there im so glad says she and promptly fell asleep now ive told you this partly because its all of the conversation that i remember of that reunion and also to let you understand what a truly impossible scatterhead elspeth was and still is theres something missing there always has been and it makes her senselessly unpredictable shed been through an ordeal that would have driven most women out of their wits not that she had many to start with but now she was back with me safe as she supposed she seemed to have no notion of the peril in which we both stood why when solomons malays took her away to her own quarters that first night she was more concerned about the sunburn shed taken and if it would spoil her complexion than about the fate solomon might have in store for us what can you do with a woman like that mind you there was a dead weight off my heart at having seen her and knowing shed come to no bodily harm at least her captivity hadnt changed hercome to think of it if shed wept and raved about her sufferings or sat numb and shocked or been terrified of her situation like a normal woman she wouldnt have been elspeth and that would have been worse than anything somehow for the next two days i was confined to my cabin and didnt see a living soul except the chink steward who brought my food and he was deaf to all my demands and questions id no notion what was happening or where we were going i knew from what solomon had said that we were in the south indian ocean and the sun confirmed that we were westering steadily but that was all what did solomon intend the one thing that grew on me was that he wasnt likely to do me in praise god not now that elspeth had seen me for that would have scuppered any hopes he had of winning her and that was the nub of it you see lunatic though his behaviour had been the more i thought about it the more i believed him the blighter was really mad about her and not just to board and scuttle her either but with all the pure romantic trimmings like shelley or one of those chaps astonishing well i love her myself always have but not to put me off my food but solomon had it to the point of obsession where hed been willing to kidnap and kill and give up civilization for her and hed believed that in spite of his behaving like a bloody barbary corsair he could eventually woo and win her given time but then hed seen her run to my arms sobbing and had realized it was no go shocking blow it must have been hed probably been gnawing his futile passion ever since realizing that hed bought outlawry and the gallows for nothing but what was he to do now unless he chopped us both it seemed to me he had no choice but to set us free with apologies and sail away griefstricken to join the foreign legion or become a monk or an american citizen why hed as good as thrown up the sponge in letting elspeth and me spend hours together alone hed never have done that if he hadnt given up all hope of her surely he was in no hurry to repeat his generosity however on the third day a little chink doctor visited me with the steward but he didnt have a word of english and busied himself impassively examining the sumpitanwound in my guts which was fairly healed and barely ached while remaining deaf to my demands to see solomon in the end i lost patience and made for the door roaring for attention but at this two of the malay crew appeared all bulging muscles and evil phizzes and indicated that if i didnt hold my tongue theyd hold it for me so i did until theyd gone and then i set about the door with my boots bawling for elspeth and calling solomon every name i could think ofindulging my natural insolence if you like since i figured it was safe enough by george wasnt i young and innocent though the response to that was nil and an icy finger of fear traced down my back for the past two days with my belly still in a sling it had seemed natural enough to be in the cabin but now that the doctor had been and seemed satisfied why werent they letting me out or why at least wasnt solomon coming to see me why werent they letting me see elspeth why werent they letting me take exercise it didnt make sense to keep me cooped here if he was going to let us go and if he was going to let us go it suddenly rushed in on me that that was pure assumption probably brought on by my blissful reunion with elspeth which had been paradise after the weeks of peril and terror suppose i was wrong i dont know anyone who despairs faster than i do mind you ive had cause and the hours that followed found me in the depths i didnt know what to think or believe my fears mounted steadily and by next morning i was my normal self in a state of abject funk i was even drawing sinister significance from the fact that this cabin i was in was obviously in the forward part of the vessel with the engines between me and the civilized quarters where elspeth and solomon would be god was he ravishing her now that he knew he could never seduce her was he bargaining with her for my life threatening to feed me to the sharks unless she buckled to with him that was it for certain its what id have done in his place and i tore my hair at the thought that like as not shed defy him she was forever reading trashy novels in which proud heroines drew themselves upright and pointed to the door crying do your worst sinister man my husband would die rather than be the price of my dishonour would he by jingo surrender you stupid bitch if thats all he wants i found myself muttering whats another more or less charming husband aint i well why not honours all very well but life matters besides id do the same to save elspeth if any lustful woman threatened me they never do though with such happy thoughts in a torture of uncertainty i passed the days that followed how many im not sure but i guess about a week in all that time no one came near me except the steward with a malay thug to back him up i was alone hour after hour night after night in that tiny box alternating between shivering panic and black despair not knowing that was the worst of it i didnt even know what to be afraid of and by the end of the week i was ready for anything if it would only end my misery its a dangerous state to be in as i know now that im old and experienced i didnt realize then that things can always get worse then i saw the american ship by chance as i paced past my porthole she was maybe half a mile off a sleek black southern run clipper with old glory at her jackstaff the morning sun was shining like silver on her topsails as they flapped from the reefs and were sheeted home now im no shellback but id seen that setting a score of times when a vessel was standing out from port god were we near some harbour of civilization where the big ships ran i hallooed for all i was worth but of course they were too far off to hear and then i was rummaging feverishly for matches to start a fire anything to attract attention and bring that yankee to my rescue but of course i couldnt find any i nearly broke my neck trying to squint out of the port in search of land but there was nothing but blue rollers and the yankee dwindling towards the eastern horizon all day i sat fretting wondering and then in midafternoon i saw little native craft from my port and a low green mainland beyond them gradually a beach came into view and a few huts and then wooden houses with steep roofs no flags and nothing but niggers in loincloths no there was a uniform an unmistakable navy coat black with gold braid and a cocked hat among a group on a little jetty but there was the rumble of the sulu queens cable we were anchoring a good quarter of a mile out never mind that was close enough for me i was in a fever of excitement as i tried to figure where it might be wed been westering southern indian ocean and here was a small port still important enough for a yankee clipper to touch it couldnt be the cape with that coastline port natal surely we werent that far west i tried to conjure up the map of that huge sea east of africa of course mauritius the navy coat the niggers the arabilooking small craft they all fitted and mauritius was british soil i was trembling as i took stock what the devil was solomon thinking of putting into mauritius wood and water hed probably had no chance of either since bolting from the skrang and with me cooped tight and elspeth probably likewise what had he to fear but it was my chance thered never be another like it i could swim the distance easily and the lock scraped in my door at that moment there are split seconds when you cant afford to plan i watched the steward setting down my tray and without making a conscious decision i turned slowly towards the door where the malay thug was hovering beckoned him and pointed frowning to the corner of the cabin he advanced a pace squinting up where i was pointing and the next instant his courting tackle was halfway up inside his torso impelled by my right boot he was flying across the cabin screaming and flashy was out and racing where there was a ladder but i ducked past it instinctively and tore along a short passage the chinese steward squealing in my rear round the corner and there was a piece of open deck malays coiling rope and iron doors flung wide to the sunshine and sea as i ploughed through the startled malays scattering them i had a glimpse of small craft between me and the shore a distant jetty and palms and then i was through those doors like a hot rivet in an enormous dive hitting the water with an almighty splash gliding to the surface and then striking out head down for dear life towards the distant land i reckon it took about ten seconds from my cabin to the water and as many minutes before i was alongside the piles of the wharf i was halfconscious with the exertion of my swim and had to cling to the slimy wood while curious niggers in small boats drew up to gape at me chattering like magpies i looked back at the sulu queen and there she was riding peacefully with a few native craft round her i looked landward there was the beach and a fairsized native town behind it and a big building with a verandah and a flagpole it was a deuced oddlooking flag striped and blazoned some shipping line perhaps i hauled myself wearily along the piles found a ladder dragged myself up it and lay panting and sodden on the wooden jetty conscious of a small crowd forming round me they were all niggers in loincloths or white robes some pretty arablooking by their noses and headgear but there was the navy coat pushing towards me and the crowd falling back i tried to pull myself up but couldnt and then the navy trousers stopped beside me and their owner was bending down towards me i tried to control my panting im a british army officer i wheezed escaped from that ship pirate i raised my head and the words died on my lips the fellow bending towards me was in full navy rig right enough even to the hat and epaulette the green sash looked strange though but that wasnt the half of it the face beneath the cocked hat was jet black i stared at him and he stared back then he said something in a language i couldnt understand so i shook my head and repeated that i was an army officer where was the commandant he shrugged showed his yellow teeth in a grin and said something and the crowd giggled damn your eyes cries i struggling up what the hells going on here wheres the harbourmaster im a british army officer captain flashman and i was stabbing him on the chest with my finger and now to my utter amazement he struck my hand angrily aside and snapped something in his heathen lingo right in my face i fell back appalled at the brutes effrontery and then there was a commotion behind and i looked to see a small boat ploughing up at the seaward end of the jetty and solomon of all people springing from her bows and striding towards us along the planking a massive figure in his tunic and sarong with a face like thunder right my hearty thinks i this is where you receive your ration allowance once these people realize youre a bloody pirate and i flung out a hand to denounce him to my epauletted nigger but before i could get a word out solomon had seized me by the shoulder and spun me round you infernal fool cries he what have you done you can be sure i told him a trifle incoherently at the top of my voice drawing the niggers attention to the fact that here was the notorious pirate and brigand suleiman usman delivered into his hands and would he mind arresting him and his ship and restoring me and my wife to liberty and you can swing till the crows peck you you kidnapping tyke i informed solomon youre done for in gods name where dyou think you are his voice was shrill mauritius aint it mauritius he suddenly pulled me aside you booby this is tamitave madagascar well that startled me i admit it explained the nigger in uniform i supposed but i couldnt see it made much difference i was saying so when the nigger stepped up and addressed solomon pretty sharp and to my amazement the don shrugged apologetically as though it had been a white official and replied in french but it was his abject tone as much as the language that bewildered me your pardon excellency a most unfortunate mistake this man is one of my crew a little drunk you understand with your permission i shall take him balderdash i roared youll take me nowhere you lying dago i swung to the nigger you speak french do you well so do i and im no more one of his crew than you are hes a damned pirate who has abducted me and my wife be quiet you clown cries solomon in english thrusting me aside youll destroy us leave him to me and he began to patter to the black again in french but the other silenced him with a flap of his hand silence says he as if he were the bloody duke the commandant approaches sure enough there was a file of soldiers coming from the landward end of the jetty strapping blacks in white loincloths and bandoliers with muskets at the shoulder and behind them carried by coolies in an open sedan came an unbelievable figure it is solemn truth he was black as your boot and he wore a turban on his head a flowered red and yellow shirt and a nd highlanders kilt he had sandals on his feet a sabre at his hip white gloves and a rolled brolly in his hand ive gone mad thinks i its been the strain or the sun that thing cant be real solomon was hissing urgently in my ear dont say a word your one chance is to pretend to be one of my crew are you mad says i after what youve done you please and unless my ears deceived me he was pleading you dont understand i intend you no harm you shall both go free mauritius if i can do it safely i swear you swear dyou imagine id trust you for an instant and then the blacks voice speaking harsh french cut across his reply you he was pointing at me you say you were a prisoner on that ship and you are english is it so i looked at the commandant leaning forward from his sedan in that ludicrous halloween rig his great ebony head cocked on one side bloodshot eyes regarding me as i nodded in reply to the officers question the commandant took a peeled mango from one of his minions and began to cram it into his mouth juice spurting over his gloved hand and over his ridiculous kilt he tossed the stone away wiped his hand on his shirt and said in careful french in a croaking rasp and your wife you say is also a prisoner of this man pardon excellency solomon pushed forward this is a great misunderstanding as i have tried to explain this man is of my ships company and is covered by my safeconduct and trading licence from her majesty i beg you to allow he denies it croaked the commandant he cleared his throat and spat comprehensively hitting one of the soldiers on the leg he swam ashore and he is english he shrugged shipwrecked oh christ muttered solomon licking his lips the commandant wagged a finger the size of a black cucumber peering at solomon he is plainly not covered by your licence or safeconduct nor is his wife that licence monsieur suleiman does not exempt you from malagassy law as you should know it is only by special favour that you yourself escape the fanompoana what you call corvйe he gestured at me in his case there is no question what the dooce is he talking about says i to solomon wheres the british consul ive had enough theres no such thing you fool solomon was positively wringing his hands suddenly he was a fat frightened man excellency i implore you to make an exception this man is not a castaway i can swear he intended no harm in her majestys dominions he will do none says the commandant and jabbered curtly at the officer he is lost a phrase whose significance escaped me just then the coolies lifted the sedan and away it swayed the officer barked an order and a file of his soldiers trotted past us their leader bawling to one of the boatmen summoning his craft to the jetty no wait solomons face was contorted with anguish you idiot he shrieked at me and then he started first this way and that calling to the commandant and then running down the jetty after the file of soldiers the black officer laughed indicated me and snapped an order to two of his men it wasnt till they grabbed my arms and began to run me off the jetty that i came to my senses i roared and struggled bawling for solomon shouting threats of what would happen to them for laying their filthy hands on an englishman i lashed out and a musketbutt sprawled me halfconscious on the planking then they dragged me up and one of them his great black face blasting foul breath all over me snapped shackles on my wrists they seized the chain and hauled me headlong up the street with the blacks eyeing me curiously and children running alongside squealing and laughing that was how i became a captive in madagascar as you know or rather you dont but if youre intelligent youll have guessed im a truthful man at least where these memoirs are concerned ive got nothing to lie for any longer who lied so consistently and successfully all my life but every now and then in writing i feel i have to remind you and myself that what i tell you is unvarnished fact there are things that strain belief you see and madagascar was one of them so i will only say that if at any point you doubt what follows or think old flash is telling stretchers just go to your local libraries and consult the memoirs of my dear old friend ida pfeiffer of the elasticsided boots or messrs ellis and oliver or the letters of my fellowcaptives laborde of bombay and jake heppick the american shipmaster or hastie the missionary then youll realize that the utterly unbelievable things i tell you of that hellish island straight out of gulliver are simple sober truth you couldnt make em up now i wont bore you by describing the shock and horror i experienced either at the beginning when i realized i had escaped from solomons fryingpan into something infinitely worse or later as further abominations unfolded ill just recount what i saw and experienced as plain as i can my first thoughts when they threw me chained and battered into a stuffy godown at tamitave were that this must be some bad dream from which i should soon awake then my mind turned to elspeth from what had passed on the jetty it had seemed that theyd been going to drag her ashore too for what fate i could only guess you see i was at a complete nonplus quite out of my depth once id had my usual little rave and blubber to myself i tried to remember what solomon had told me about madagascar on the voyage out which hadnt been much and what i recalled was far from comforting wild and savage beyond description hed said weird customs and superstitions half the population in slavery a shemonster of a queen who aped european fashions and held ritual executions by the thousand a poisonous hatred of all foreigners well my present experience confirmed that all right but could it truly be as awful as solomon had painted it i hadnt believed him above half but when i thought of that frightful nigger commandant in his bumbee tartan kilt and brolly well fortunately for my immediate peace of mind i didnt know one of the worst things about madagascar which was that once you were inside it you were beyond hope of rescue even the most primitive native countries in my young days were at least approachable but not this one its capital antananarivo might as well have been on the moon there was no appeal to outside or even communication no question of pam or the frogs or yanks sending a gunboat or making diplomatic representations even you see no one knew about madagascar hardly barring a few pirates like kidd and avery in the old days and a handful of british and french missionaries whod soon been cleared out or massacred no one had visited it much except heeledandready traders like solomon and they walked damned warily and did their business from their own decks offshore wed had a treaty with an earlier malagassy king sending him arms on condition that he stopped slavetrading but when queen ranavalona came to the throne in shed broken off all traffic with the outside world forbidden christianity and tortured all converts to death revived slavery on a great scale and set about exterminating all tribes except her own she was quite mad of course and behaved like messalina and attila the hun either of whom would have taken one look at her and written to the times protesting to give you some notion of the kind of bloodstained bedlam the country was shed already slaughtered onehalf of her subjects say a million or so and passed decrees providing for a wall round the whole island to keep out foreigners four gigantic pairs of scissors to be set up on the approaches to her capital to snip invaders in two and the building of massive iron plates from which the cannonshots of european ships would rebound and sink them eccentric what of course all this was unknown to me when i landed i began to find out about it painfully when they hauled me out of the cooler next morning still in my innocence protesting and demanding to see my lawyer my frenchspeaking officer had disappeared so all my entreaties earned was blows and kicks id had no food or drink for hours but now they gave me a stinking mess of fish beans and rice and a leafspoon to eat it with i gagged it down with the help of their vile brown ricewater and then despite my objections i and a gang of other unfortunates all black of course were herded up through the town heading inland tamitaves not much of a settlement it has a fort and a few hundred wooden houses some of them quite large with the highpitched malagassy thatches at first sight it looks harmless enough like the people theyre black but not negro id say perhaps a touch of malay or polynesian wellbuilt not badlooking lazy and stupid the folk i saw at first were poorerclass peasants slaves and provincials both men and women wearing simple loincloths or sarongs but occasionally we encountered one of the betteroff being toted about in a sedan no rich or aristocratic malagassy will walk a hundred yards and theres a multitude of slaves bearers and couriers to carry em the nobs wore lambas robes not unlike roman togas although in antan itself their clothing was sometimes of the utmost outlandish extravagance like my commandant thats the extraordinary thing about madagascar its full of parodies of the european touch gone wrong and their native culture and customs are bizarre enough to start with god knows for example they have their markets at a distance from their villages and towns nobody knows why they hate goats and pigs and will lay babies out in the street to see if their births are fortunate or not they are unique i believe in the whole world in having no kind of organized religion no priests no shrines or temples but they worship a tree or a stone if they feel like it or personal household gods called sampy or charms like the famous idol rakelimalaza which consists of three dirty little bits of wood wrapped in silk ive seen it yet theyre superstitious beyond belief even to the extent of dispraising those things they value most to avert jealous evil spirits and believing that when a man is dying you must stuff his mouth with food at the last minute mind you that may be because theyre the most amazing gluttons and drunkards too but as with so many of their practices you sometimes feel they are just determined to be different from the rest of the world i noticed that the soldiers who escorted our chaingang were of a different stamp from the rest of the people tall narrowheaded fellows who marched in step to a mixture of english and french words of command they were brutes who thrashed us along if we lagged and treated the populace like dirt i learned later they were from the queens tribe the hovas once the pariahs of the island but now dominant by reason of their cunning and cruelty ive endured some horrible journeys in my time kabul to the khyber crimea to middle asia for a couple but i cant call to mind anything worse than that march from tamitave to antan it was miles and it took us eight days of blistered feet and chafing chains trudging along at for food the hovas just kicked them aside to add to the horrors we passed occasional gallows on which victims were hung or crucified or simply tied to die by inches one abomination ill never forget five staggering skeletons yoked together at the neck by a great iron wheel they put them in it and turn them loose wandering together until they starve or break each others necks the queens procession had passed by long before up the rough rockpaved furrow of the road which ran straight as a die through forest and over mountain she had twelve thousand troops with her i learned later and since the malagassy army has no system of supply or rations they had just picked the country clean so in addition to the slaves thousands of peasants starved to death as well you may wonder why they endured it well they didnt always over the years thousands had fled in whole tribes and communities to escape her tyranny and the jungles were full of these people living as brigands she sent regular expeditions against them as well as against those distant tribes who werent hovas ive heard it reckoned that the slaughter of fugitives criminals and those whom her majesty simply disliked amounted to between twenty and thirty thousand annually and i believe it in the meantime id little sympathy to spare my own case as we finally approached antan after more than a week of tortured tramping was deplorable my shirt and trousers were in rags my shoes were worn out i was bearded and foul but strangely enough having plumbed the depths i was beginning to perk up a trifle i wasnt dead and they werent bringing me all this way to kill me i was even feeling a touch of lightheaded recklessness probably with hunger i was lifting my head again and my recollections of the end of the march are clear enough we passed a great lake along the road and the guards made us shout and sing all the way past it i later heard it was to placate the ghost of a dissolute princess buried nearby dissolute female royalty being madagascars strong suit evidently we crossed a great river the mangaro and steaming geysers bubbling out of pools of boiling mud before we came out on a level grass plain and beyond it on a great hill we beheld antananarivo it took my breath away of course i didnt even know what it was then but it was like nothing youd expect in a primitive nigger country there was this huge city of houses perhaps two miles across walled and embattled in wood and dominated by a hill on the top of which stood an enormous wooden palace four storeys high with another building alongside it which seemed to be made of mirrors for it shimmered bright as a burningglass in the sunlight i stared at it until i was almost blinded but i couldnt make out what it was and in the meantime there were other wonders closer at hand for as we approached the city across the plain which was dotted with huts and crowded with village people i thought i must be dreaming in the distance i could hear a military band playing horribly flat but there could be no doubt that the tune was the young may moon and here sure enough came a regiment in full fig red tunics shakos arms at the shoulder bayonets fixed and every man jack of them black as satan i stood and fairly gaped past they went in column throwing chests and shaping dooced well and at their head god help me half a dozen officers on horseback dressed as arabs and turks i was beyond startling now when a couple of sedans draped in velvet passed by bearing black women done up in empire dresses and feathered hats i didnt even give em a second glance they and the rest of the crowds were moving across the front of the city and that was the way our guards drove us so that we skirted the city wall until we came presently to a great natural amphitheatre in the ground dominated by a huge cliffambohipotsy they call it and there can be no more accursed place on earth there must have been close on a quarter of a million people thronging the slopes of that great hollow below the cliff certainly more than ive ever seen in one congregation this great tide of black humanity was gazing down to the foot of the cliff our guards brought us up short and pointed grinning and looking down that vast slope of people i saw that in a clear space long narrow pits had been dug and in the pits were scores of human beings tied to stakes at the end of each pit huge cauldrons were fixed above roaring fires and even as we watched a gong boomed out the enormous chattering crowd fell silent and a gang of black fiends tilted the first of the cauldrons slowly slowly while the poor devils in the pits shrieked and writhed boiling water slopped over the cauldrons lip first in a small stream then in a scalding cascade surging down into the pit with a horrible sizzling cloud of steam that blotted out the view when it cleared i saw to my horror that it only filled the pit waist deep the victims were boiling alive by inches while the onlookers bayed and cheered in a tumult of sound that echoed across that ghastly amphitheatre of death there were six pits they filled them one by one that was the main performance you understand after that figures appeared at the top of the cliff which was three hundred feet up and the luckier condemned were thrown off the crowd giving a great rising whistle as each struggling body took flight and a mighty howl when it struck the ground below there was particular applause if one landed in the waterpits which were still steaming mistily with the contorted figures hanging from their stakes they didnt just throw the condemned people down the cliff by the way they suspended em first by ropes to let the mob have a good look and then cut them free to drop i make no comment myself because as i watched this beastly spectacle i seemed to hear the voice of my little newgate friend in my ear interesting isnt it and see again the yelling gloating audience outside the magpie and stump they were much the same i suppose as their heathen brethren and if you tell me indignantly that hanging is a very different thing from boiling alive or burning flaying flogging sawing impaling and live burial all of which ive seen at ambohipotsy i shall only remark that if these spectacles were offered in england it would be a case of standing room only for the first few shows anyway however if the relation of such atrocities nauseates you i can only say that i swore to tell the truth of what i saw and any qualms you may suffer were as nothing to poor old flashys mental distress as we were herded away from the scene of execution ill swear we were only there because our guards didnt want to miss it and through one of the massive gates into antan town proper its name by the way means city of a thousand towns and it was as impressive at first hand as it had been from a distance wide clean streets were lined by fine wooden buildings some of them two and three storeys high and starved and shaken with terror as i was i could not but marvel at the air of richness there was about the place wellstocked booths shady avenues neatlyrobed folk bustling about their business expensivelycarved and painted sedans swaying through the streets carrying the better sort some in halfeuropean clobber others in splendid sarongs and lambas of coloured silk there was no making sense of it on the one hand the horrors i had just watched and on the other this pleasant airy civilizedlooking city with captain harry flashman and friends being kicked and flogged through the middle of it and no one giving us more than a casual glance oh aye every building had a european lightning conductor they locked us in an airy reasonably clean warehouse for the night took off our fetters and gave us our first decent meal for a week a spicy mutton stew bread and cheese and more of their infernal ricepiddle we scoffed it like wolves a dozen woolly niggers snuffling over their bowls and one english gentleman dining with refinement i dont think but if it did something for my aching filthy body it did nothing for my spirits this nightmare of existence seemed to have endured forever and it was mad incredible out of all reason but i must hang on i had played cricket once and bowled felix i had been to rugby and horse guards and buckingham palace i had an address in mayfair i had dined at whites as a guest granted and strolled on pall mall i wasnt just a lost soul in a lunatic black world i was harry flashman exth hussars four medals and thanks of parliament however undeserved i must hang on and surely in the city id seen there must be some civilized person in authority who spoke french or english to whom i could state my case and receive the treatment that was my due as a british officer and citizen after all they werent real savages not with streets and buildings like these a touch colourful in the way they disposed of malefactors no doubt and no poor relief worth a damn but no societys perfect i must talk to someone the difficulty was who when they turned us out next morning we were taken in charge by a couple of black overseers who spoke nothing but jabber they thrust us along a narrow alley and out into a crowded square in which there was a long platform railed off to one side with guards stationed at its corners to keep the mob back it looked like a public meeting there were a couple of black officials on the platform and two more seated at a small table before it we were pushed up a flight of steps to the platform and made to stand in line i was still blinking from the sunlight wondering what this might portend as i looked out over the crowd blacks in lambas and robes for the most part a few knots of officers in comicopera uniforms plenty of sedans with wealthy malagassies sitting under striped umbrellas i scanned the faces of the officers eagerly those would be the frenchspeakers and i was just about to raise a halloo to attract their attention when a face near the front of the crowd caught my eye like a magnet and my heart leaped with excitement he was a tall man wideshouldered but lean wearing a bright embroidered shirt under a blue broadcloth coat and with a silk scarf tied like a cravat he and his neighbour a portly sambo resplendent in sarong and cocked hat were taking snuff in the local fashion the lean chap accepting a pinch from the others box on the palm of his hand and engulfing it with a quick flick of his tongue he grimaced and raised his eyes they met mine and stared they were bright blue eyes in a face burned brown under a mane of greying hair but there was no doubt of it he was a white man you i roared you sir monsieur parlezvous francais anglais hindi latin bloody greek even listen to me i must talk to you one of the guards was striding forward to thrust me back but the lean man was pushing his way through the mob to my unutterable relief and at a word from him to the officials he was allowed to approach the platform he looked up at me frowning as i knelt down to be close to him francais says he im english a prisoner from a boat that came in at tamitave in gods name how can i get out of this no one listens to me theyve been dragging me all over the bloody country for weeks i must gently gently says he and at the sound of the english words i could have wept then smile monsieur smile what is the word broadly laugh if you can but converse quietly it is for your own good now who are you i didnt understand but i forced a ghastly grin and told him who i was what had happened and my total ignorance of why id been brought here he listened intently those vivid eyes playing over my face motioning me to speak softly whenever my voice rose which as you can imagine it tended to do all the time he was plainly avoiding glancing at my guards or the officials but he was listening for them when i had finished he fingered his cravat nodding as though id been telling him the latest for punch and smiling pleasantly eh bien says he now attend and not interrupt if my english she is not perfect i use french but better not no whatever i say betray no amaze do you see smile if you please good i am jean laborde once of the emperors cavalry i have been here thirteen years i am a citizen you do not know madagascar i shook my head and he put back his head and laughed softly plainly for the onlookers benefit they detest all europe and english especially since you land without permission they treat you as naufragй how you call shipwreck castaway by their law please to smile monsieur very much all such persons must be made slaves this is a slavemarket they make you a slave forever the smiling brown face with its blue eyes swam in front of me i had to hold on to the edge of the platform laborde was speaking again quickly and the smile had vanished say nothing wait wait do not despair i will make inquiry i see you again only wait dont despair now my friend forgive me on the heels of the last word he suddenly shouted something in what i took to be malagassy gesturing angrily heads came round my guard stooped and wrenched at my shoulder and laborde struck me full in the face with his open hand scelйrat he cried canaille he swung angrily on his heel and pushed his way back into the grinning crowd while the guard kicked me upright and thrust me back into line i tried to call to laborde but i was choked with horror and my own tears and then one of the officials mounted a rostrum shouting an announcement the chatter of the crowd died away the first of our coffle was pushed forward and the bidding began no one who has not stood on the block can truly understand the horror of slavery to be thrust up in public before a crowd of leering niggers waiting your turn while your fellowunfortunates are knocked down one by one to the highest bidder and you stand like a beast in a pen all dignity manhood even humanity gone aye its hell its even worse when nobody buys you i couldnt credit it not even an opening bid imagine it heres flashy gentlemen young and in prime fettle no previous owners guaranteed of sound wind no heelbug highly recommended by superiors and ladies of quality well setup when hes shaved talks like a book and a bugger to ride wholl say a hundred fifty twenty come come gentlemen the hair on his heads worth more than that do i hear ten five then three for a capital bargain with years of wear in him do i hear one not for a fellow who dismissed felix pilch and mynn in three deliveries oh well ikey put him back on the shelf and tell the knackers to come and collect him it was downright humiliating especially with the bidding for my black companions as brisk as a morning breeze mind you the thought of being bought by one of those disgusting malagassies was revolting still i couldnt but feel disgruntled when they shoved me back in the warehouse alone the selling plater nobody wanted it was night before i found out the reason for night brought laborde past bribed officials and guards with soap a gourd of water a razor and enough bad news co last a lifetime it is simple says he when he had slipped a coin to the sentry and we were locked in alone he spoke french now which hed been afraid to do in public for fear of eavesdroppers i had no time to tell you the other slaves were being sold for debt or crime you as a castaway are in effect crown property your display on the block was a mere formality for no one would dare to bid you belong to the queen as i did when i was shipwrecked years ago but but you aint a slave cant you get away no one gets away says he flatly and it was now i learned a good deal of what ive told you already of the monstrous tyranny of queen ranavalona her hatred of foreigners which had caused madagascar to be quite cut off from the world of the diabolical practice of losing which is their word for enslaving all strangers for five years i served that terrible woman laborde concluded i am an engineer you will have seen my lightning rods on the houses i am also skilled in the making of armaments and i cast cannon for her my reward was freedom he laughed shortly but not freedom to leave i shall never escape nor will you unless he broke off and then hurried on but refresh yourself my friend wash and shave at least while you tell me more of your own misfortune we have little time he glanced towards the door the guards are safe for the moment but safety lasts a short while in madagascar so i told him my tale in full while i washed and shaved by the flickering light of his lantern and sponged the filth from the shreds in which i was clothed while i talked i got a good look at him he was younger than id thought about fifty and almost as big as i a handsome decentlooking cove fast and active but plainly as nervous as a cat he was forever starting at sounds outside and when he talked it was in an urgent whisper i shall inquire about your wife says he when id done they will have brought her ashore almost certainly they lose no chance of enslaving foreigners this man solomon i know of he trades in guns and european goods in exchange for malagassy spices balsam and gums he is tolerated but he will have been powerless to protect your lady i shall find out where she is and then we shall see it may take time you understand it is dangerous they are so suspicious these people i run great risk by coming to see you even then why dyou do it says i for im inclined to be leery of gifts brought at peril to the giver i was nothing to him after all he muttered something about befriending a felloweuropean and the comradeship of menatarms but i wasnt fooled kindness might be one of his motives but there were others too that he wasnt telling about or i was much mistaken however that could wait whatll they do with me i asked and he looked me up and down and then glanced away uneasily if the queen is pleased with you she may give you a favoured position as she did with me he hesitated it is for this reason i help you to make yourself presentable you are very large and personable since you are a soldier and the army is her great passion it is possible that you will be employed in its instruction drilling manoeuvring that kind of thing you have seen her soldiers so you are aware that they have been trained by european methods there was a british bandmaster here many years ago under the old treaty but nowadays such windfalls are rare yes he gave me that odd wary glance again your future could be assured but i beg of you as you value your life be careful she is mad you see if you give the least offence in any way or if she suspects you even the fact that i a fellowforeigner have spoken to you could be sufficient which is why i struck you publicly today he was looking thoroughly scared although i felt instinctively he wasnt a man who scared easy if you displease her then it will be the perpetual corvйe the forced labour perhaps even the pits which you saw yesterday he shook his head oh my friend you do not even begin to understand that happens daily here rome under nero it was nothing but in gods name can nothing be done why dont they make away with her havent you tried to escape even you will see says he and please do not ask such questions do not even think them not yet he seemed to be on the point of saying more but decided not to i will speak of you to prince rakota he is her son and as great an angel as his mother is a devil he will help you if he can he is young but he is kind if only he but there now what can i tell you the queen speaks a little french a few of her courtiers and advisers also so when you encounter me hereafter as you will remember that if you have anything secret to say speak english but not too much or they will suspect you what else when you approach the queen advance and retire right foot first address her in french as god ma dieu you understand or as great glory or great lake supplying all water you must give her a gift or rather two gifts they must always be presented in pairs see i have brought you these and he handed me two silver coins mexican dollars of all things if in her presence you happen to notice a carved boars tusk with a piece of red ribbon attached to it it maybe on a table or somewhere fall down prostrate before it i was gaping at him and he stamped froglike with impatience you must do these things they will please her that tusk is rafantanka her personal fetish as holy as she is herself but above all whatever she commands do it at once without an instants hesitation betray no surprise at anything do not mention the numbers six or eight or you are finished never on your life say of a thing that it is as big as the palace what else he struck his forehead oh so many things but believe me in this lunatic asylum they matter they may mean the difference between life and horrible death my god says i sitting down weakly and he patted me on the shoulder there my friend i tell you these things to prepare you so that you may have a better chance to to survive now i must go try to remember what ive said meanwhile i shall find out what i can about your wife but for gods sake do not mention her existence to another living soul that would be fatal to you both and do not give up hope he looked at me and for a second the apprehension had died out of his face he was a tough steadylooking lad when he wanted to be if i have frightened you well it is because there is much to fear and i would have you on guard so far as may be he slapped my arm bien dieu vous garde then he was at the door calling softly for the guard but even as it opened he was back again catfooted whispering one other thing when you approach the queen remember to lick her feet as a slave should it will tell in your favour but not if they are dusted with pink powder that is poison he paused on second thoughts if they are so dusted lick them thoroughly it will certainly be the quickest way to die a bientot if i had my head in my hands do you wonder it couldnt be true where i was what id heard what lay ahead but it was and i knew it which was why i plumped down on my knees blubbering and prayed like a drunk methodist just on the offchance that there is a god after all for if he couldnt help me no one else could i felt much worse for it probably arnold was right and insincere prayers are just so much blasphemy so i had a good curse instead but that didnt serve either whichever way i tried to ease my mind i still wasnt looking forward to meeting royalty at least they didnt keep me in suspense at the crack of dawn they had me out a file of soldiers under an officer to whom i tried to suggest that if i was going to be presented so to speak id be the better for a change of clothes my shirt was reduced to a wisp and my trousers no better than a ragged loincloth with one leg but he just sneered at my signlanguage slashed me painfully with his cane and marched me off uphill through the streets to the great palace of antan which i now saw properly for the first time i wouldnt have thought anything could have distracted my attention at such a time but that palace did how can i describe the effect of it except by saying that its the biggest wooden building in the world from its towering steepled roof to the ground is a hundred and twenty feet and in between is a vast spread of arches and balconies and galleries for all the world like a venetian palazzo made of the most intricatelycarved and coloured wood its massive pillars consisting of single trunks more than one hundred feet long the largest of them im told took five thousand men to lift and they brought it from fifty miles away all told fifteen thousand died in building the place but i guess thats small beer to a malagassy contractor working for royalty even more amazing though is the smaller palace beside it it is covered entirely in tiny silver bells so that when the sun is on it you cant even look for the blinding glare as the breeze changes so does the volume of that perpetual tingling of a million silver tongues its indescribably beautiful to see and hear like something in a fairytale and yet it housed the cruellest gorgon on earth for thats where ranavalona had her private apartments id little time to marvel though before we were inside the great hall of the main palace itself with its soaring arched roof like a cathedral nave it was thronged with courtiers bedecked in such a fantastic variety of clothing that it looked like a fancydress ball with nothing but black guests there were crinolines and saris sarongs and state gowns muslins and taffetas of every period and colour i recall one spindly female in white silk with a powdered wig on her head a la marie antoinette talking to another who seemed to be entirely hung in coloured glass beads the contrast and confusion was bewildering mantillas and loincloths bare feet and highheeled shoes long gloves and barbaric feather headdresses it would have been exotic but for the unfortunate fact that malagassy women are damned ugly for the most part tending to be squat and squashed like black russian peasants if you can imagine mind you i saw a lissom backside in a sari here and there and a few pairs of plumptious bouncers hanging out of low corsages and thought to myself theres a few here whod repay care and attention and theyd probably be glad of it too for a more sawnoff and runty collection than their menfolk i never did see its curious that the male nobility are far poorer specimens than the common men dago blood somewhere i suspect they were got up as fantastically as the women though in the usual hotchpotch of uniforms with knee breeches buckled shoes and even a stovepipe hat thrown in there was a nigger orchestra pumping away abominably somewhere and the whole throng were chattering like magpies as malagassies always do bowing and scraping and leering and flirting in the most grotesque caricature of polite society i couldnt help thinking of apes that id seen at the circus in childhood decked out in human clothes a white man in rags cut no ice at all and no one spared me more than a glance as i was marched up a side staircase along a short passage and into a small anteroom here to my astonishment i was left alone they shut the door on me and that was that steady flash thinks i whats this it looked an innocent room enough overcrowded with artisticallycarved native furniture large pots containing reeds some fine ornaments in ivory and ebony and on the walls several prints depicting niggers in uniform which i wouldnt have given houseroom to myself i stood listening and through a large muslinscreened inner window heard the murmur and music of the great hall by standing on a table i could just peep over the sill and through the muslin observe the assembly below my window was in a corner and from beneath it a broad gallery ran clean across the top end of the hall high above the crowd there were a dozen hova guardsmen in sarongs and helmets ranged along the balcony rail somewhere deep in the palace a bell rang and at once the chatter and music died and the whole crowd below turned to stare up at the balcony there was the wailing of what sounded like a native trumpet and a figure stepped out on to the balcony almost directly beneath me a stalwart black in a gold metal headdress and leopardskin loincloth with massive muscular arms stretched out before him carrying a slender silver spear in ceremonial fashion the assembled cream of malagassy society gave him a good hand and as he stepped aside four young girls in flowered saris appeared carrying a kind of threesided tent of coloured silk but with no roof to it then to the accompaniment of clashing cymbals and a low sonorous chanting that made my hair stand on end there came out a couple of old coves in black robes fringed with silver swinging little packets on the ends of strings but not making much of it they stood to one side and to a sudden thunderous yell from the crowd of manjaka manjaka four more wenches trooped out carrying a purple canopy on four slender ivory poles beneath it walked a stately figure enveloped in a scarlet silk cloak but i couldnt see the face at all for it was hidden by a tall sugarloaf hat of golden straw bound under the chin by a scarf so this is her nibs thinks i and despite the warmth i found myself shivering she paced slowly to the front of the balcony and the sycophantic mob beneath went wild clapping and calling and stretching out their hands then she stepped back the girls with the silk tent contraption carried it round her shielding her from all curious eyes except the two that were goggling down unsuspected from above i waited breathless and two more girls went in beside her and slipped the cloak from her shoulders and there she was stark naked except for her ridiculous hat well even from above and through a muslin screen there was no doubt that she was female and no need for stays to make the best of it either she stood like an ebony statue as the two wenches began to bathe her from bowls of water some vulgar lout grunted lasciviously and realizing who it was i shrank back a trifle in sudden anxiety that id been overheard they splashed her thoroughly while i watched enviously and then clapped the robe round her shoulders again the screen was removed and she took what looked like an inlaid ebony horn from one of her attendants and stepped forward to sprinkle the crowd they fairly crowed with delight and then she withdrew to a great shout of applause and i scrambled down from my window thinking by george weve never seen little vicky doing that from the balcony at buck house but then she aint quite equipped the way this one is what id seen you may care to know was the public part of the annual ceremony of the queens bath the private proceedings are less formal although mind you i can speak with authority only for or as it is doubtless known in malagassy court circles flashys year the procedure is simple her majesty retires to her reception room in the silver palace which is the most astonishing chamber containing as it does a gilded couch of state gold and silver ornaments in profusion an enormous and luxurious bed a piano with selections from scarlatti on the music stand and off to one side a sunken bath lined with motherofpearl there are also pictures of napoleons victories round the walls between silk curtains there she concludes the ceremony by receiving homage from various officials who grovel out backward and then with several of her maids still in attendance turns her attention to the last item on the agenda the foreign castaway who has been brought in for her inspection and who is standing with his bowels dissolving between two stalwart hova guardsmen one of her maids motions the poor fool forward the guardsmen retire and i tried not to tremble took a deep breath looked at her and wished i hadnt come she was still wearing the sugarloaf hat and the scarf framed features that were neither pretty nor plain she might have been anywhere between forty and fifty rather roundfaced with a small straight nose a fine brow and a short broadlipped mouth her skin was jet black and plump and then you met the eyes and in a sudden chill rush of fear realized that all you had heard was true and the horrors youd seen needed no further explanation they were small and bright and evil as a snakes unblinking with a depth of cruelty and malice that was terrifying i felt physical revulsion as i looked at them and then thank god i had the wit to take a pace forward right foot first and hold out the two mexican dollars in my clammy palm she didnt even glance at them and after a moment one of her girls scuttled forward and took them i stepped back right foot first and waited the eyes never wavered in their repellent stare and so help me i couldnt meet them any longer i dropped my gaze trying feverishly to remember what laborde had told me oh hell was she waiting for me to lick her infernal feet i glanced down they were hidden under her scarlet cloak no use grubbing for em there i stood my heart thumping in the silence noticing that the silk of her cloak was wet of course they hadnt dried her and she hadnt a stitch on underneath my stars but it clung to her limbs in a most fetching way my view from on high had been obscured of course and i hadnt realized how strikingly endowed was the royal personage i followed the sleek scarlet line of her leg and rounded hip noted the gentle curve of waist and stomach the fullblown poonts outlined in silk my goodness though she was wet catch her death one of the female attendants gave a sudden giggle instantly smothered and to my stricken horror i realized that my indecently torn and ragged trousers were failing to conceal my instinctive admiration of her majestys matronly charms oh jesus youd have thought quaking fear and my perilous situation would have banished randy reaction but love conquers all you see and there wasnt a damned thing i could do about it i shut my eyes and tried to think of crushed ice and vinegar but it didnt do the slightest good i darent turn my back on royalty had she noticed hells bells she wasnt blind this was lesemajeste of the most flagrant order unless she took it as a compliment which it was maam i assure you and no disrespect intended far from it i stole another look at her my face crimson those awful eyes were still on mine then slowly inexorably her glance went down her expression didnt change in the least but she stirred on her couch which did nothing to quell my ardour and without looking away muttered a guttural instruction to her maids they fluttered out obediently while i waited quaking suddenly she stood up shrugged off the silk cloak and stood there naked and glistening i gulped and wondered if it would be tactful to make some slight advance grabbing one of em for instance it would take both hands better not though let royalty take precedence so i stood stock still for a full minute while those wicked clammy eyes surveyed me then she came forward and brought her face close to mine sniffing warily like an animal and gently rubbing her nose to and fro across my cheeks and lips starters gun thinks i one wrench and my breeches were a rag on the floor i hooked into her buttocks and kissed her full on the mouth and she jerked away spitting and pawing at her tongue her eyes blazing and swung a hand at my face i was too startled to avoid the blow it cracked on my ear i had a vision of those boiling pits and then the fury was dying from her eyes to be replaced by a puzzled look she put her face to mine again touching my lips cautiously with her own her mouth tasted of aniseed she licked me tentatively so i nuzzled her a moment and then kissed her in earnest and this time she entered into the spirit of the thing like a good un then she reached down and led me across the room to the bath undid her scarf and hat and tossed them aside revealing long straight hair tied tight to her head and heavy silver earrings that hung to her shoulders she slipped into the bath which was deep enough to swim in and motioned me to follow which i did nearly bursting by this time but she swam and played about in the water in a most provoking way teasing and rubbing noses and kissing but never a smile or a word or the least softening of those basilisk eyes and then suddenly she clapped her long legs round me and we were away rolling and plunging like damnation one moment on the surface the next three feet under she must have had lungs like bellows for she could stay under an agonizing time working away like a lecherous porpoise and then surfacing for a gasp of air and down again for more ecstatic heaving on the bottom well it was novel and highly stimulating the only time ive completed the carnal act while somersaulting with my nose full of water was in ranavalonas bath afterwards i clung to the edge gasping while she swam lazily up and down turning those ugly glinting eyes on me from time to time with her face like stone yet the most startling event was still to come when she had got out of the bath and i had followed obediently she crossed to the bed and disposed herself on it contemplating me sullenly while i stood hesitant wondering what to do next i mean usually one gives em a slap on the rump by way of congratulation whistles up refreshments and has a cosy chat but i could guess this wasnt her style she just lay there stark all black and shiny staring at me while i tried to shiver nonchalantly and then she grunted something in malagassy and pointed to the piano i explained humbly that i didnt play she stared some more and three seconds later i was on the piano stool my wet posterior clinging uncomfortably to the seat picking out drink puppy drink with one finger my audience didnt begin to throw things so i ventured on the other half of my repertoire god save the queen but a warning growl sent me skittering back to drink puppy drink once more i played it for about ten minutes conscious of that implacable stare on the back of my neck and then by way of variety began to sing the verse i heard the bed creak and desisted another growl and i was giving tongue lustily again and the silver palace of antananarivo reechoed to heres to the fox with his den among the rocks and heres to the trail that we follooow and heres to the hound with his nose upon the ground an merrily well whoop and hollooo and then the chorus with vim its a rousing little ditty as you probably know and i bellowed it until i was hoarse just as i was thinking my voice would crack blowed if she didnt glide up at my elbow glowering without expression from my face to the keys what the devil thinks i in for a penny in for a pound so while pounding away with one hand i pulled her on to the stool with the other squeezing lustfully and bawling hell grow into a hound so well pass the bottle round and after a moments impassive staring she began to accompany me in a most disconcerting way this time though we repaired to the bed for the serious business and i received a mighty shock for as i was waiting for her to assume the supine position she suddenly picked me up bodily flung me down and began galloping me with brutal abandon grunting and snarling and even drumming on me with her fists it was like being assailed by a horny gorilla but i gather she enjoyed it not that she smiled or gave maidenly sighs but at the end she stroked her nose against mine and growled a malagassy word in my ear several times zanahary zanahary wonderful which i later discovered was complimentary so that was my first encounter with queen ranavalona of madagascar the most horrible woman ive ever met bar none unfortunately it was by no means the last for although she never ceased to regard me with that gorgon stare the took an unquenchable fancy to me possibly it was my pianoplaying for normally she went through lovers like a rat through cheese and i was in constant dread in the weeks that followed that shed tire of me as she had of laborde and several hundred others he had merely been discarded but as often as not her usedup beaux were subjected to the dreadful ordeal of the tanguin test and then sent to the pits or dismembered or sewn up in buffalo hides with only their heads out and hung up to rot no pleasuring queenie wasnt a trade you could settle to and to make it worse she was a brutally demanding lover i dont mean that she enjoyed inflicting pain on her men like dear lola with her hairbrush or the elfin mrs mandeville of mississippi who wore spurred riding boots to bed or aunt sara the mad bircher of the steppes my ive known some little turtle doves in my time havent i just no ranavalona was simply an animal coarse and insatiable and you ached for days afterwards i suffered a cracked rib a broken finger and god knows how many strains and dislocations in my six months as stallionentitre which gives you some idea but enough of romance suffice to say that my initiation was successful and i was taken on the strength of her establishment as a foreign slave who might be useful not only as a paramour but also in view of my army experience as a staff officer and military adviser there was no question about this in the minds of the court officials who assigned me to my duties no thought that i might demur or wish to be sent home or count myself anything but fortunate to be so honoured by them i had come to madagascar and here i would stay until i died that was flat it was their national philosophy madagascar was the world and perfect and there could be no greater treachery than to think otherwise i got an inkling of this the same afternoon when i had been dismissed the royal presence considerably worn and shaken and was conducted to an interview with the queens private secretary he proved to be a jolly little black butterball in a blue cutaway coat with brass buttons and plaid trousers who beamed at me from the depths of an enormous collar and floored me by crying mr flashman what pleasure to see you i being mr fankanonikaka very personal and special secretary to her majesty queen ranavalona the great cloud shading the world aint i just though not above half i dont think he rubbed his little black paws chortling at my dumbstruck look and went on how i speak english much perfect so as to astonish you i being educated in london at highgate school highgate confounded in year of christ seven years reigning good queen bess i say please sitting there exactly and attending then to me i being an old boy and he bowed me to a chair i was learning to accept anything in this extraordinary country and why not in my time ive seen an oxford don commanding a slaveship a professor of greek skinning mules on the sacramento stage run and a welshman in a top hat leading a zulu impi even a threadneedle street nigger acting as secretary to the queen of madagascar aint too odd alongside that lot but hearing english even his amazing brand of the language took me so aback that i almost committed the indiscretion of asking how the blazes i was to escape from this madhouse and that could have been fatal in a country where one wrong word usually means death by torture fortunately i remembered labordes warning in time and asked cautiously how he k new my name haha we are knowing all manner no humbuggery or gammon please cries he his fat face shining like boot polish you coming ashore from ship of suleiman usman we speaking of him maybe finding much he cocked his head button eyes considering me you telling me now of personal life yourself where coming from what trade so to speak my old covey so i did at least that i was english an army officer and how id fallen into usmans hands again remembering laborde i didnt mention elspeth although i was consumed with anxiety about her he nodded pleasantly and then said you coming madagascar you knowing someone here right enough i assured him he was wrong and he stuck out a fat finger and says msieur laborde whos he says i playing innocent and he grinned and cries msieur laborde talking you in slave place hitting you punch in face but then coming you cheepcheep quiet with dollars for give queen razor for shaving how peculiaring aint it he giggled and waved a hand but not mattering since you being old boy laborde old boy and european chum my stars much shake hand hollo old fellow i understanding being old boy also highgate like and not mattering since queen may she live thousand year liking you so much good gracious times much jiga jig jig and jolly muttons cries this jackanapes making obscene gestures much pleasure hurrah maybe you slave five six year pleasing queen his eyes rounded eagerly perhaps giving boy child with rogerings what anyway five year you not being lost no more being free marrying any fine lady being great person like me or someone else all from queen liking he beamed happily he had my future nicely in hand it seemed but you slave now lost he added sternly must working hard not only jigajig soldier working much needed keeping army best in world spit and polish damne no mistake you liking that staying madagascar making fine colonel maybe sergeantmajor shouting soldiers leftrightleft pick em up farting about like horse guards quick march just fine style i being highgate long time seeing guns hyde park when little boy at school the smile faded from his face and he looked crestfallen little black boy seeing soldiers big guns horses tantara and galloping he sniffed and knuckled his eye in london still raining not half much tuckshop footballing jolly times he sighed i speaking queen making you great soldier knowing latest dodges keeping army smart like hector and lysander bangup tiptop hey yes l speaking queen you may say that was how i joined the malagassy army and if mr fankanonikaka was a dooced odd recruiting agent he was also an uncommon efficient one before night fell i was on the ration strength with the unique rank of sergeantgeneral which i suspect was fankanonikakas own invention and not inappropriate as it turned out they quartered me in two rooms at the back of the main palace with an orderly who spoke a little french and there i sat down and wept with my head spinning trying to figure out what to do next what for that matter could i do in this nest of intrigue and terror where my life depended on the whim of a diabolical despot who was undoubtedly mad fickle dangerous and fiendishly cruel i could only wait helpless for laborde and pray that he might have some news of elspeth and bring me hope of escape from this appalling pickle and i was just reconciling myself to this unhappy prospect when who should walk in but the man himself i was amazed overjoyed and terrified all in the space of two heartbeats he was smiling but looking pale and breathing heavy like a man who has just had a nasty start and survived it which he had i have just come from the queen says he and he spoke in french pretty loud my dear friend i congratulate you you have pleased her as i hoped you would when i was summoned i confess he laughed with elaborate nonchalance i thought there had been some misunderstanding about my visit to you last night that it had been reported and false conclusions drawn frankathingammybob knew all about it says i he told me for gods sake is there any news he cut me off with a grimace and a jerk of his head towards the door i believe it was on the suggestion of her majestys secretary that i was called to audience says he clearly he was much impressed by your qualifications and wished me as a loyal servant of the queens to add my recommendations to his own i told her what i could that you were a distinguished officer in the british service which does not compare of course to the glorious army of madagascar and that you were full of zeal to serve her in a military capacity he winked heavily at me nodding and i cottoned on but of course cries i ringing tones it is my dearest ambition has been for years i dont know how many times the duke of wellingtons said to me flash old son you wont be a soldier till youve done time with the malagassies god help us if boney had had a battalion of them at waterloo and im beside myself with happiness at the thought of serving a monarch of such graciousness magnanimity and peerless beauty if some eavesdropper was taking notes for the awful black bitchs benefit i might as well lay it on with a shovel i would gladly lay down my life at her feet there was a fair chance of that too if we had many gallops like that afternoons laborde looked satisfied and launched into raptures about my good fortune and how blessed lucky we were to have such a benevolent ruler he couldnt say enough for her and of course i joined in writhing with impatience to hear what news he might have of elspeth he knew what he was doing though for while he talked he fiddled with a gourd on the table and when he took his hand away there was a slip of paper under the vessel i waited five minutes after hed gone in case of prying eyes palmed it and read it surreptitiously as i stretched out on the bed she is safe in the house of prince rakota the queens son he has bought her have no fear he is only sixteen and virtuous you shall see her when it is safe meanwhile say nothing as you value her life and your own destroy this message instantly so i ate the damned thing speculating feverishly on the thought of elspeth helpless in the hands of a nigger prince who had probably been covering every woman within reach since he was eight virtuous eh just like his dear mama if he was such a bloody paragon why had he bought her to iron his linen laborde must be off his head why when i was sixteen i know what id have done if id seen elspeth in a shop window with a sale ticket on her it was too horrible to contemplate so i went to sleep instead after i i i whatever was happening to elspeth id had a trying day myself i extract from the diary of mrs flashman october madagaskar is the most singular and interesting isle and i count myself most fortunate to have been so kindly received here which is due entirely to the sagacity and energy of my darling h who somehow contrived most cleverly to slip ashore from don ss ship and make arrangements for our enlargement and reception oh happy happy deliverance i know not how he accomplished it for i have not seen my brave hero since we landed but my love and admiration for him know no hounds as i shall make plain to him when once again i know the rapture of being enfolded in his arms i am at present residing in the palace of prince rakoota in the capital city having been brought here yesterday after a journey of many starts and adventures i was brought ashore from don ss ship by some black gentlemen so i must call them for they are people of consequence and indeed everybodys black here don s protested most violently and became quite distracted so that the black soldiers had to restrain him but i was not much moved for his importunities of late had been most marked and his conduct quite wild and i was heartily sick of him he has behaved odiously for despite his protestations of devotion to me he has put me to the greatest inconvenience very selfishly and dear h also who received a horrid graze on his person i shall say no more of don s except that i am sorry so refined and agreeable a gentleman should have proved so wanting in behaviour and been a deep disappointment to me but while glad to be shot of him i was a trifle uneasy with our black hosts the chief of whom i did not like at all he was so gross and offhand and stared at me in a horrid familiar fashion and even forgot himself so far as to handle my hair growling to his friends in their language so i addressed him in that tongue and said your behaviour to a gentlewoman is not becoming sir especially in one who wears the tartan of the nd but im sure i suspect you have no right to it for my uncle dougal was in the rd and i never heard from him that any persons of your colour were mustered in the highland brigade not in glasgow in any event but if i am wrong im sure i apologize i am very hungry and where is my husband this being received in discourteous silence they put me in a sedan or palankeen and brought me into the country although i objected strenuously and spoke quite sharply but to no avail i was in such distress of mind at having no word of dearest h or knowing where i was being taken and the people we passed came to stare at me which was disagreeable although they seemed to be in some awe and i decided that it was that they had never seen a lady of fair hair and complexion before they are that primitive but i bore this insolence with dignity and reserve and boxed one of them over the lugs after which they kept a more respectful distance to help compose my fears i gave myself into tranquil contemplation of the marvels i saw en route the scenery being beyond description the flowers of brilliant colours and the animal life of boundless variety and interest especially a darling little beastie called the eyeeye which is halfmonkey halfrat with the drollest wistful eyes which i suppose is why they call it eyeeye and they wont kill it its antics are diverting however i shall write later at leisure on the attractions of this singular countryside when the descriptive muse is upon me also about the great city of madagaskar and my introduction to his rh prince rakoota by a french resident m la board who is on terms of intimacy with the prince from him i learnt that dear h has been engaged on military business of importance by no less a personage than hm the queen of madagaskar and i jalouse that my darling very cleverly offered them his services in exchange for our reception here they naturally would be eager to avail themselves of so distinguished an officer which doubtless explains the haste with which he left from the coast without even seeing me which caused me some pique although i am sure he knows best i dont quite understand it but m la board impressed on me the delicate nature of the work and since he and the prince are insistent that nothing must prejudice it i resign myself with good humour and composure to wait and see as a good wife should and only hope my hero will soon be spared from his duties to visit me i am v comfortable in the princes delightful palace and receive every consideration and kindness the prince is just a laddie but speaks good french with a pretty hesitation and is all amiability he is v black wellgrown and handsome smiling readily and i flatter myself he is more than a little fetched by me but he is so young and boyish that an expression of admiration which might be thought a little forward in a person more mature may be excused in him as a natural youthful gallantry he is a little shy and has a wistful regard i could wish that i had my proper wardrobe for i am in some hope that when dearest h returns he may take me to visit the queen who seems from all i have heard to be a remarkable person and held in great esteem however if i am so honoured i shall make do with what i have and rely on my natural breeding and appearance to uphold my countrys credit among these people for as our beloved bard has it the rank is but the guinea stamp and im sure that an english lady may move unashamed in any society especially if she has the grace and looks to carry it off its been my experience that however strange or desperate the plight you may find yourself in if theres nothing else for it you just get on with the business in hand as though it was the most natural thing in the world by various quirks of fate ive landed up as an indian butler a crown prince a cottonfield slavedriver a gamblinghell proprietor and god knows what besides all occupations from which id have run a mile if id been able but i couldnt so i made the best of em and before i knew it i was fretting about silver polish or court precedent or how we were to get the crop in by november or whether the blackjack dealer was holding out and almost forgetting that the real world to which i rightly belonged was still out there somewheres selfdefence i suppose but it keeps you sane when by rights you ought to be sinking into madness and despair so when they gave me the army of madagascar to drill and train i simply shut my mind to the horrors of my situation and went at it like frederick the great with a wasp in his pants i believe it saw me through one of the blackest periods of my life a time so confused when i look back that i have difficulty in placing the events of those first few weeks in their proper order or even making much sense of them i knew so little then about the place and that little was so strange and horrid that it left the mind numb only gradually did i come to have a clear picture of that savage mockcivilized country with its amazing people and customs and understand my own peculiar station in it and begin trying to scheme a way out at first it was just a frightening turmoil in which i could only do what i had to do but ill describe it as best i can so that you may learn about it as i did and have the background to the astonishing events that followed i had the army then to reform and instruct and if you think that an uncommon responsible job for the newest arrived foreign slave remember that it was europeanmodelled but that they hadnt seen a white instructor in years there was another good reason too for my appointment but i didnt find out about that until much later anyway there it was and im bound to say the work was as near to being a pleasure as anything could be in that place for they were absolutely firstclass and as soon as i saw this when i had the regiments reviewed on the great plain outside the city i thought to myself right my boy perfection is our ticket theyre good but theres nothing easier than spending ten hours a day hounding their commanders to make em better and thats what i did fankanonikaka had told me i had a free hand he came down with me to that first review when the five regiments stationed at antan and the palace guard marched past under my critical eye like changing guard left right boomboom mighty fine cries he being best soldiers in world not half eh right turning shouldering arms altogether haha he beamed at the comic opera generals and colonels who were standing with us puffed up with pride as they watched their battalions you liking greatly sergeantgeneral flashman i just grunted had them halted and plunged straight in among the ranks looking for the first fault i could find there was a black face badly shaven so i stamped and swore and raved as though theyd just lost a battle while the staff stared and shook and little fankanonikaka was ready to burst into tears soldiers i bellowed look at that slovenly brute tripping over his blasted beard has he shaved today has he ever shaved stand still you mangy bastards or ill flog every second man slouch in front of me will you with your chins like a monkeys backside ill show you my pretties oh yes well take note of this mr fankanonikaka i thought you spoke to me of an army you werent referring to this mouldy rabble i suppose of course it put them into fits there were generals gaping and protesting and falling over their sabres while i strode about hazing right and leftdull buttons unpolished leather whatever i could find but i wouldnt let em touch the offending soldier ah no i degraded his section commander on the spot ordered his colonel into arrest and scarified the staff thats the way to get em hopping and when id done roaring i had the whole outfit officers and all marched and wheeled and turned across that square for three solid hours and then when they were fit to drop i made em stand for forty minutes stockstill at the present while i ranged among them sniffing and growling with fankanonikaka and the staff trotting miserably at my heels i was careful to snarl a word of praise here and there and t hen i singled out the unshaven chap slapped him told him not to do it again pinched his ear a la napoleon and said i had high hopes of him after that it was plain sailing they realized they were in t ile grip of a mad martinet and went crazy perfecting their drill and turnout with their officers working em till they dropped while flashy strolled about glaring or sat in his office yelling for lists and returns of everything under the sun with my ready ear for languages i picked up a little malagassy but for the most part transmitted my orders in i tench which the bettereducated officers understood i built a fearsome reputation through stickling over trivialities and set the seal on it by publicly flogging a colonel at the first of the great fortnightly reviews which the queen and court attended this shocked the officers entertained the troops and delighted her majesty if the glitter in her eye was anything to go by she sat like a brooding black idol most of the time in her red sari and ceremonial gold crown under the striped brolly of state but as soon as the lashing started i noticed her hand clenching at every stroke and when the poor devil began to squeal she grunted with satisfaction its a great gift knowing the way to a womans heart i was careful though in my disciplinary methods i soon got a notion of who the important and influential senior officers were and toadied em sickening in my bluff soldierly way while oppressing their subordinates most damnably and keeping the troops in a state of terrified admiration given time i dare say id have ruined the morale of that army for good and all since most of the leading aristocrats held high military rank and took their duties seriously in a pathetically incompetent way i gradually became acquainted not to say friendly with the governing class and began to see how the land lay in court camp city and countryside it was simple enough for society was governed by a rigid caste system even stricter than that of india although there was no religious element at all there were eleven castes starting at the bottom with the black malagassy slaves above them in tenth place were the white slaves of whom there werent many apart from me and i was special as ill explain but aint that interesting that a black society held white superior to black in the slave line we were of course but it didnt make much odds since all of us were far below the ninth caste which consisted of the general public who had to work for a living and included everyone from professional people and merchants right down to the free labourers and peasantry then there were six castes of nobles from the eighth to the third and what the differences were i never found out except that they mattered immensely the malagassy upper crust are fearful snobs and put on immense airs with each other a thirdrank count or baron will be far more civil to a slave than to a sixthrank nobleman and the caste rules governing them are harsher even than for the lower orders for example a male noble cant marry a woman of superior caste he can marry beneath himself but he mustnt marry a slave if he does hes sold into slavery himself and the woman is executed simple says you they just wont marry slaves then but the silly bastards do quite often because theyre crazy like their infernal country the second caste consisted of the monarchs family poor souls and at the top came the first caste an exclusive group of one the queen who was divine although quite what that meant wasnt clear since they dont have gods in madagascar what was certain though was that she was the most absolute of absolute tyrants governing solely by her own whim and caprice which since she was stark mad and abominably cruel made for interesting times all round that much you have probably gathered already from my description of her and of the horrors id seen but you have to imagine what it was like to be living at the mercy of that creature day in day out without hope of release fear spread from her like a mist and if her court was a proper little vipers nest of intrigue and spying and plotting it wasnt because her noble and advisers were scheming for power but for sheer survival they went in terror of those evil snake eyes and that flat grunting voice so rarely heard and then usually to order arrest torture and horrible death those are easy words to write and you probably think theyre an exaggeration theyre not that beastly slaughter id witnessed under the cliff at ambohipotsy was just a piece of the regular ritual of purge and persecution and butchery which was everyday at antan in my time her appetite for blood and suffering was insatiable and all the worse because it was unpredictable it wouldnt have seemed so horrible perhaps if madagascar had been some primitive nigger tribal state where everyone ran about naked chanting mumbojumbo and living in huts well i remember my old chum king gezo of dahomey sitting slobbering like a beast before his deathhouse tucking into his luncheon while his fighting women chopped prisoners into bloody gobbets within a yard of him but he was an animal and looked like one ranavalona wasnt quite she had not bad taste in clothes for example and knew enough to hang pictures on the walls and have her banquets laid with knives and forks just so and placecards i mean she had carpets and silk sheets and a piano and her nobles wore trousers and frock coats and addressed their womenfolk as mamselle my god havent i seen a couple of her comtesses sitting at a palace dinner chattering like civilized women with silver and crystal and linen before them ignoring the cutlery and gobbling food with their fingers and then one turning to tother and twittering permittezmoi chйrie and proceeding to delouse her neighbours hair that was madagascar savagery and civilization combined into a horrid comicopera a world turned upside down and at the head of the table she would sit in a fine yellow satin gown from paris a feather boa stuck through her crown pearls on her black bosom and in her long earrings chewing on a chicken leg holding up her goblet to be refilled and getting drunker and drunker for when it came to lowering the booze she could have seen a sergeants mess under the table it didnt show in her face the plump black features never changed expression only the eyes glittered in their piercing uncanny stare she wouldnt smile her talk would be an occasional growl to the terrified sycophants sitting beside her and when she rose at last wiping her sullen mouth everyone would spring up and bow and scrape while two of her generals perspiring would escort her down the room and out on to the great balcony lending her an arm if she staggered and over the great crowd waiting in the courtyard below would fall a terrible silence the silence of death ive seen her leaning on that verandah with her creatures about her gazing down on the scene below the ring of hova guardsmen the circle of torches flaming over the archways the huddled groups of unfortunates male and female from mere striplings to old decrepit folk cowering and waiting they might be recaptured slaves or fugitives hunted out of the forests and mountains or criminals or nonhova tribesmen or suspected christians or anyone who under her tyranny had merited punishment she would look down for a long time and then nod at one group and grunt burning and then at another crucifixion and at a third boiling and so on through the ghastly list starvation or flaying alive or dismembering or whatever horror occurred to her monstrous taste then she would go inside and next day the sentences would be carried out at ambohipotsy in front of a cheering mob sometimes she attended herself watching unmoved and then going home to the palace to spend hours praying to her personal idols under the paintings in her reception room while most of her cruelties were practised on common folk and slaves her court was far from immune i remember at one of her levees at which i was in humble attendance with the military she suddenly accused a young nobleman of being a secret christian ive no idea whether he was or not but there and then he was submitted to ordeal they have any number of ingenious forms of this including swimming rivers infested by crocodiles but in his case they boiled up a cauldron of water right in front of her seat and she sat staring fixedly at his face as he tried to snatch coins out of the bubbling pot plucking and screaming while the rest of us watched trying not to be sick he failed of course i can still see that pathetic figure writhing on the floor clutching his scalded arm before they carried him out and sawed him in half not quite what were accustomed to at balmoral youll agree but at least ranavalona didnt go in for tartan carpets her wants were simple just give her an ample supply of victims to mutilate and gloat over and she was happy not that youd have guessed it to look at her and indeed ive heard some say that she was just plain mad and didnt know what she was doing thats an old excuse which ordinary folk take refuge in because they dont care to believe there are people who enjoy inflicting pain hes mad theyll say but they only say it because they see a little of themselves in the tyrant too and want to shudder away from it quickly like wellbred little christians mad aye ranavalona was mad as a hatter in many ways but not where cruelty was concerned she knew quite what she was doing and studied to do it better and was deeply gratified by it and thats the professional opinion of kindly old dr flashy whos a timeserved bully himself so you see what a jolly carefree life it was for her court of whom i suppose i was one in my capacity of mount of the moment it was a privileged position as i soon realized you recall i told you how i took pains to curry favour with the top military nobles well i soon discovered that the compliment was returned slave though i was officially they toadied me something pitiful those black sweating faces and trembling paws in gaudy uniforms they assumed you see that i only had to whisper the word in her ear and theyd be off to the pits and the cross they neednt have fretted i never knew one of em from tother hardly and anyway i was too alarmed for my own safety to do anything with her damned black ear but chew it lovinglike you may wonder how i stuck it out or how i could bring myself to make love to that female beast well ill tell you if its a choice between romping and being boiled or roasted you can bring yourself to it believe me she wasnt badlooking beneath the neck after all and she seemed to like me which always helps you may find it difficult to believe but there were even moments on warm silent afternoons when we would be drowsing on the bed or by her bath and i would steal a glance along the pillow at that placid black face comely enough with the eyes closed and feel even a touch of affection for her you cant hate a woman you sleep with i suppose mind you once that black eyelid lifted and that eye was on you it was another story one thing though i feel inclined to say in her defence having said so much ill of her and rightly at least some of her excesses especially in the persecution of christians were inspired by her idolkeepers ive said there was no religion in her country which is true their superstition was not on an organized basis but there were these fellows who read omens and looked after the stones and sticks and lumps of mud which passed for household gods well the idolkeepers had helped her to the throne when she was a young woman after her husband the king died and his nephew the rightful heir had been all set to ascend the throne the idolkeepers in their role as augurs had said the omens favoured ranavalona instead and since she at the same time was busily organizing a coup detat slaughtering the unlucky nephew and all her other immediate relatives you couldnt say the idolkeepers were wrong theyd picked the winner they obtained such influence with her that they even persuaded her to kill off the lovers who had helped her coup and she relied on them for guidance ever after i was always very civil to them myself with a cheery good morning and a dollar or two mangy brutes though they were shuffling through the palace with their bits of rag and string and ribbon which were probably idols of terrific potency if id only known they helped ranavalona determine her policy by throwing beans on a kind of chessboard and working out the combinations which usually resulted in massacre for someone just like a cabinet decision she would admit them at all times of day ive seen her sitting on her throne with her girls helping her try on french slippers while the lads crouched alongside mumbling over their beans and she would nod balefully at their pronouncements take a squint at her bottle or tusk for reassurance and pronounce sentence they once walked in when she and i were having a bath together deuced embarrassing it was performing while they cast the bones but ranavalona didnt seem to mind a bit if there was any other influence in her life apart from the mumbo jumbo men and her own mad passions it was her only son prince rakota the chap to whom laborde had managed to steer elspeth he was the heir to the throne although he wasnt the old kings son but the offspring of one of her lovers whom shed later had pulled apart naturally however under malagassy law any children a widow may have legitimate or not are considered sons of her dead husband so rakota was next in line and my impression was that madagascar couldnt wait to cry long live the king you see despite my misgivings when id first heard about him he was the complete opposite of his atrocious mother a kindly cheerful goodnatured youth who did what he could to restrain his bloodthirsty parent it was common knowledge that if he happened along as they were about to butcher someone on her instructions and he told them to let the chap go they would and mama never said a word about it hed have had to spend all his time sprinting round the country shouting lay off to make much impression on the slaughter rate but he did what he could and the populace blessed and loved him as youd expect why ranavalona didnt do away with him i couldnt fathom some fatal weakness in her character i suppose however mention of rakota advances my tale for about three weeks after id taken up my duties i met him and was reunited if only briefly with the wife of my bosom id seen laborde once or twice beforehand when hed figured it was safe to approach me and pestered him to take me to elspeth but hed impressed on me that it was highly dangerous and would have to wait on a favourable opportunity it was like this you see laborde had told rakota that elspeth was my wife and pleaded with him to look after her and keep her tucked away out of sight for if the queen ever discovered that her new buck and favoured slave had a wife within reach well it would have been good night mrs flashman and probably young harry as well jealous old bitch rakota being a kindly lad had agreed so there was elspeth snug and well cared for not treated as a slave at all but rather as a guest while i mark you was having to pleasure that insatiable female baboon for my very lifes sake they hadnt told elspeth that thank god but jollied her along with the tale that i had taken up an important military post which was true enough a strange state of affairs youll allow but nothing out of the way for madagascar and no more incredible than some of the things that ive known and heard of in my time i was so bemused with what had happened over the past few months anyway that i just accepted the bizarre situation only two things worried and puzzled me how had the queen who found out everything through her system of spies which was directed by mr fankanonikaka failed to get word of the goldenhaired slave in her sons palace and why this was the real conundrum were laborde and prince rakota in such a sweat to help elspeth and me what was i to them after all im a suspicious brute you see and dont put much stock in altruistic virtue there was something up here i was right too laborde presented me to the prince on an afternoon when ranavalona was safely out of the way watching a bullfight which was her prime hobby it was a byword that the lighting bulls were the only living things she had any feelings for the only times she was known to weep was when one of them died or was badly gored in the ring so it was deemed safe for me to take an hour off from parade and with fankanonikaka laborde and a leading general named count rakohaja i was borne out to the princes garden palace in the suburbs of antan rakota received me in his throne room where i was graciously permitted to prostrate myself before him and his princess they were tiny folk he wasnt more than five feet tall and dressed like a spanish matador in gold tunic and breeches buckled shoes and a mexican sombrero he was about sixteen lively and smiling all over his round olive face he had the beginnings of a moustache his wife was much the same a dumpy little bundle in yellow silk if anything her moustache was further along than his they spoke good french and when id clambered upright rakota said he had brilliant reports of the way i was training the troops especially the royal guardsmen sergeantgeneral flashman has worked wonders with the men and the best officers agreed count rakohaja he was a big lean hova aristocrat with a scar on his cheek dressed in a coat and trousers which would have been perfect st jamess if they hadnt been made of bright green velvet your highness will be enchanted to learn that he has already won the loyalty of all under his command and has shown himself a most dependable and trustworthy officer which was doing it rather too brown but the prince beamed on me most gratifying says he winning the confidence of the troops is the first essential in a leader as commanderinchief under the sublime authority of her majesty the great cow who nourishes all the world with her milk of course i congratulate you sergeantgeneral and assure you that your zeal and loyalty will be amply rewarded it seemed a trifle odd i wasnt a commander but a glorified drill instructor and everyone knew it however i responded politely that i didnt doubt the troops would follow me from hell to huddersfield and back which seemed to please his highness for he ordered up chocolate and we stood about sipping it from silver bowls twohanded it seemed to me that prince and princess were slightly nervous he kept darting glances at rakohaja and fankanonikaka and his little chubby consort whenever she caught my eye smiled timidly and bobbed like a charwoman seeking employment the prince asked me a few more questions in an offhand way about the quality of the lowerrank commanders the equipment of palace pickets the standard of marksmanship and so on which i answered satisfactorily noting that he seemed specially interested in the household troops then he took one last gulp and belch at his chocolate wiped his moustache on his sleeve and says to me with a little smile and wave you are permitted to withdraw to the other end of the room and began to talk in malagassy to the others mystified i bowed and retreated a door at the far end opened and there was elspeth smiling radiantly and dressed in the worst possible taste in a gardenparty confection of purple taffeta purple on a blonde god help us tripping towards me with her arms out in a moment madagascar was forgotten with its queen and horrors and dressedup mountebanks i had her in my arms kissing her and she was murmuring endearments in my ear then propriety returned and i glanced round at the others they were ignoring us all except fankanonikaka who was having a sly peep so i enfolded her again inhaling her perfume while she prattled her delight at seeing me for it has been so long and while their highnesses have been kindness itself i have been yearning for you night and day my love do you like my new dress her highness chose it for me herself and we think it most becoming and it is so heavenly to have proper clothes again after those dreadful sarongas but we will not talk of that and the hateful separation and the odious behaviour of that that man don solomon but now we are rid of him and safely here and it is such fun if it were not that your duties keep you from me oh harry must they but i must be a good wife as i always promised and not put myself forward where your duty is concerned and indeed i know the separation is as cruel for you as for me and oh i do miss you here she embraced me again and drew me down on to a settle the others were deep in their own conversation although the dumpy little princess fluttered her fingers at us shyly and elspeth must rise to curtsey even black royalty was just nuts to her obviously before resuming her headlong discourse i never got a word in edgeways as usual but i doubt if id have been coherent anyway for to my amazement elspeth seemed to have not a care in the world well ive always known she had a slate loose and was incapable of seeing farther than her pretty nose which reminded me to kiss it tenderly but this was beyond belief we were prisoners in this heathen hellhole and to hear her you might have imagined it was a holiday at brighton slowly it dawned on me that she had no true notion of the ghastliness of our plight or even of what madagascar was like at all and as she babbled i began to understand why of course i should like to see more of the country for the people seemed not disagreeable but the prince informs me that the position of foreigners here is delicate and it is not advisable for me to be seen abroad for you of course it is different since you are employed by her majesty oh tell me harry what she looks like and what she says how does she dress shall i be presented is she young and wellfavoured i should be so jealous for she cannot fail to be attracted by the handsomest man in england oh harry i much admire your uniform it is quite the style id taken advantage of the custom of the country to wear all red with a black sash pretty raffish i admit elspeth fairly glowed at me but i have so much to tell you for the prince and princess have been so good and i have the prettiest rooms and the garden is so beautiful and there is some very select company in the evenings all black of course and a leetle outre but most agreeable and considerate i am most happy and interested but when shall we go home to england harry i hope it is not too long for i sometimes feel anxiety for dear papa and while it is very pleasant here it is not quite the same but i know you will not detain us here longer than must be for you are the kindest of husbands but i am sure your work here will be of the greatest service to you for it is sure to be a valuable experience i only wish her lip suddenly trembled despite her efforts to smile that we could be together again in the same house oh harry darling i miss you so and the little clothhead began piping her eye leaning on my shoulder as though she had anything worth weeping about it was a damned letdown for id been looking forward to pouring out my woes and complaints to her bemoaning my lot describing the horrors of my plight the respectable bits anyway and generally making her flesh creep with my anxieties but there seemed no point now in alarming her shed just have done something idiotic and with the others almost in earshot the less i said the better so i just patted her shoulder to cheer her up now then old girl says i dont be a fool whatll their highnesses think of your bleating and bawling wipe your nose youre a lot better off than some you know i know i am very foolish says she sniffing and presently when the prince and princess withdrew she was all smiles again curtseying like billyho and kissing me a tender farewell i remarked to laborde as we returned to the palace that my wife seemed happily ignorant of my predicament and he turned his steady eyes on me it is as well is it not she could be a great danger to you to both of you the less she knows the better but in gods name man shell have to find out sooner or later what then what when she realizes that she and i are slaves in this frightful country that theres no hope no escape i grabbed his arm we had left our sedans at the entrance to my quarters at the rear of the palace fankanonikaka having parted from us at the main gate for the love of heaven laborde there must be a way out of this i cant go on drilling niggers and piling into that black slut for the rest of my life your life will last no time at all if you dont control yourself snaps he pulling loose he glanced round anxiously then took a deep breath look you i will do whatever i can in the meantime you must be discreet i do not know what can be achieved but the prince was pleased with you today that may mean something we shall see now i must go and remember be careful do your work say nothing who knows he hesitated and tapped me quickly on the arm we may drink cafe au lait on the champs elysees yet a bientot and he was off leaving me staring mystified but with something stirring inside me that i hadnt felt in months hope it didnt stir for long of course it never does you hear news or a rumour or an enigmatic remark like labordes and your imagination takes wing with wild optimism and then nothing happens and your spirits plunge only to revive for a spell and then down again and up and down while time slips away almost unnoticed im glad i aint one of these cool hands who can take a balanced view for any logical appraisal of my situation in madagascar would have driven me to suicide as it was my alternate hopes and glooms were probably my salvation as the months went by for it was months six of them although looking back its hard to believe it was more than a few weeks memory may hold on to horrid incidents but its a great obliterator of dull protracted misery especially if you help it with heavy drinking theres a fine potent aniseed liquor on madagascar and i sopped it up like a country parson so between sleep and stupor i dont suppose i was in my wits more than half the time and as ive remarked when needs must you just carry on with the work in hand so i drilled and bullied my troops and attended the queen when called upon and warily enlarged my circle of acquaintances among the senior military and cultivated mr fankanonikaka and found out everything i could that might serve when the time came if it ever did but it must it must for while with every passing week my servitude in madagascar began to seem more natural and inevitable there would be moments of sudden violent reaction as when id just seen elspeth or been appalled by some new atrocity of the queens or the muskywood and dust smell grew unbearable in my nostrils and then there was nothing for it but to walk out alone on the parade ground before antan and stare at the distant mountains and tell myself fiercely that lords was still over there somewhere with felix bowling his slow lobs while the crowd clapped and the rooks cawed in the trees there would be green fields and english rain parsons preaching yokels ploughing children playing cads swearing virgins praying squires drinking whores rogering peelers patrolling that was home and there must be a road to it so i kept my eye skinned and learned that tamitave while it had taken days to cover on the slavemarch was a bare hundred and forty miles away that foreign ships put in about twice a month for fankanonikaka whose office i visited a good deal used to receive notice of them the samson of toulon the culebra of havana the alexander hamilton of new york the mary peters of madras i saw the names and my heart would stop they might only anchor in the roads to exchange cargo but if i could time my bolt from antan precisely and reach tamitave when a foreign vessel was in id swum ashore i could swim aboard then let em try to get me on their cursed land again how to reach tamitave though ahead of pursuit the army had some horses poor screws but theyd do one to ride three to lead for changes oh god elspeth i must get her away too mustnt i unless i escaped and came back for her in force by jove brooke would jump at the chance of crusading against ranavalona if brooke was still alive no i couldnt face another of his campaigns damn elspeth and so my thoughts raced only to return to the dusty heat and grind of antan and the misery of existence there were some slight blessings though i became interested in my army work and enjoyed putting the troops through their manoeuvres teaching them complicated wheels in line slow marches and so forth i became quite friendly with senior men like rakohaja who began more and more to treat me as an equal and even entertained me at their homes the patronizing monkeys fankanonikaka noted this and was pleased doing much fine what dining nibs much grub happy boozing like hell tiptop society howdedo so pleased to meet you hey i seeing you count rakohaja baron andriama chancellor vavalana other best swells watching vavalana careful however sly dog peeping or tittletattling for queen so looking sharp thats the ticket for soup rotten rascal vavalana him hating old boy fankanonikaka hating you too much jealousing you mounting queen happying her much boomboom not above half maybe getting boy child i dont know vavalana not liking that mischief you if possible watch out him i telling you meantime you pleasing queen all while hearty lovings she admiring aint she just though haha and the dirty little rascal would tap his pug nose and chortle i wasnt so sure myself for as time went by ranavalonas demands on me slowly diminished and while it was a relief in one way for at first when i had been summoned to the palace almost every day on her majestys service it was so exhausting i darent wave my hand for fear i floated away it was worrying too was she tiring of me it was a dreadful thought but i was reassured by the fact that she still seemed to like my company and even began to talk to me not that it was elevating chat how were the troops was the ration of jaka sufficient why did i never wear a hat were my quarters comfortable why did i never kill soldiers by way of punishment had i ever seen the english queen you must imagine her either sitting on her throne in a european gown with one of her girls fanning her or reclining on her bed in her sari propped up on one elbow slowly grunting out her questions fingering her long earring and never taking those black unblinking eyes from mine unnerving work it was for i was in constant dread that id say something to offend it didnt help that i never discovered how informed or educated she was for she volunteered no information or opinions only questions and no answers seemed either to please or displease her she would just brood silently and then ask something else in the same flat muttered french it was impossible to guess what she thought or even how her mind worked well to give you an example i was alone with her one day standing by obediently while she sat on the bed gazing at manjakatsiroa and mumbling to herself when she looked up at me slowly and growled does this dress please you it was a white silk sarong in fact and became her not too badly but of course i went into raptures about it she listened sullenly fidgeted a moment and then got up stripped the thing off and says it is yours well it wasnt my style at all but of course i grovelled gratefully and said i couldnt do it justice but id treasure it forever make it my household idol in fact splendid idea she paid not the slightest attention but sauntered over bare as the back of my hand to her great mirror and stared at herself then she turned to me slapped her belly thoughtfully two or three times put her hands on her hips stared bleakly at me and says do you like fat women if the hairs on my neck crawled dyou wonder for if you can think of a tactful answer i couldnt i stood tonguetied the sweat starting out on me as visions of boiling pits and crucifixion flitted across my mind and i couldnt restrain a moan of despair which i immediately had the motherwit to turn into a lustful growl as i advanced on her grappling amorously and praying that actions would speak louder than words since she didnt press the point i gather my answer was the right one another anxiety of course during those long weeks was that she would get word of elspeth or that my dear little wife herself would get restive and commit some folly which would attract attention she didnt though and on the occasional visits i was allowed to make to the princes palace she seemed as cheerful as ever i still dont understand this although ill admit that elspeth has an unusually serene and stupid disposition which can make the best of anything she bemoaned the fact that we were kept apart of course and never ceased to ask me when we would be going home but since we were never left alone together there was no opportunity to tell her the fearful truth and it would have served no good purpose anyway so i jollied her along and she seemed content enough it was on the last visit i paid her that i saw the first signs of distress and guessed it had at last penetrated into that beautiful fat head that madagascar wasnt quite the holiday she imagined she was pale and looked as though shed been crying but for once we had no opportunity of a private teteatete for the occasion was a teaparty given by the princess and i was held in military small talk by the prince and rakohaja throughout only when i was leaving did i have a brief word with elspeth and she didnt say much except to grip my hand tight and repeat her eternal question about going home i couldnt guess what had upset her but i could see the tears werent far away so i startled her out of her glooms in the only way i know how whats this old girl says i looking thunderous have you been flirting with that young prince then she looked blank but her dismals vanished at once why harry what can you mean what a question to ask is it though says i grimly i dont know i can see he has more than an eye to you the presumptuous young pupyes and you aint discouraging him exactly are you im not well pleased my lady just because i cant be here all the time is no reason for you to go setting your cap at other feilows oh yes i saw you fluttering at him when he spoke to you and a married man too anyway i whispered youre far too pretty for him she was pink by this time not with guilty confusion mark you but with pleasure at the thought that shed stirred the passion in yet another male breast if there was one thing that could divert the little trollops attention it was male admiration shed have stood preening herself in the track of a steam road roller if someone had so much as winked at her i saw by her blushing protests how delighted she was and that her unhappiness whatever it was had been quite forgotten but now i was being called to the prince with rakohaja at his elbow no doubt we shall see you tonight sergeantgeneral at her majestys ball says his highness and it seemed to me his voice was unduly shrill and his smile a trifle glassy it is to be a very splendid occasion i knew about the queens dances and parties of course although id never been to one being officially a slave you see however much authority i had in the army i occupied a curious social position but rakohaja put my doubt at rest sergeantgeneral flashman will be present highness he turned his big scarred face to stare at me i shall bring him in my own party excellent twitters the prince looking everywhere but at me excellent that will be ah most agreeable i bowed myself away wondering what this portended i didnt have long to wait to find out the queens galas were famous affairs they took place every two or three months on the anniversaries of her birth accession marriage or the jubilee of her first massacre i shouldnt wonder and were attended by the flower of malagassy society all in their fanciest costumes crowding into the great courtyard before the palace where they danced ate drank and revelled all through the night proper orgies from all id heard so i was ready prompt enough in full fig when rakohaja came for me early in the evening there was a great crowd of the commonalty waiting at the palace gates as we passed through peeping to get a look at their betters who were already whooping it up to some tune the whole vast courtyard was ablaze with chinese lanterns slung on chains potted palms and even whole trees and flowerbeds had been brought in for decoration the arches of the palace front were twined with rammage and cords of tinsel a fountain had been specially constructed in the centre of the yard the water playing over glass jars in which were imprisoned clusters of the famous malagassy fireflies brilliant little emerald green jewels which winked and fluttered through the spray with dazzling effect among the trees and arbours which lined the square long tables were set piled with delicacies especially the local beef rice which is consumed in honour of the queen dont ask me why because its mere coarse belly fodder the military band were on hand pounding away at auprиs de ma blonde and getting most of the notes wrong i noticed they were all halftipsy their black faces grinning sweatily and their uniform collars undone while their bandmaster resplendent in tartan dressinggown and bowler hat was weaving about cackling and losing his silverrimmed spectacles he grovelled on the ground hunting for them and waving his baton crazily but the band played on undaunted falling off their seats and the row was deafening mind you if they were drunk you could see where theyd got the idea there must have been several hundred of the upper crust present already each one with about a gallon of raw spirit aboard to judge by their antics i counted four fellows in the fountain when we arrived and any number staggering about the greater number were standing unsteadily in groups of anything from six to sixty making polite conversation at the tops of their voices yelling and backslapping seizing glasses from the loaded trays which the servants passed among them bawling toasts spilling liquor all over each other apologizing elaborately tumbling down and acting quite civilized on the whole there was the usual fantastic display of fashion men in arab turkish spanish and european costume or mixtures of all of them women in every conceivable colour of sarong sari elaborate gown and party frock there was abundance of uniform too velvet brocade superfine and broadcloth with crusts of silver and gold braid but i noticed there was more of a spanish note than usual black swallowtails cummerbunds funnel pants and sashes among the men mantillas high heels flounced skirts lace fans and flowers among the women the reason i discovered was that it was rakotas coming of age and since he favoured dago fashion the revellers were decked out in his honour the heat from that shouting swaying celebrating throng came at you like a wave with the band crowning the bedlam of noise with its incessant pounding the dinner has not yet begun says rakohaja to me shall we anticipate the others he led the way under the trees where the waiters stood most of em pretty flushed and waved me and his aides to chairs there was fine china and glass on the tables but rakohaja simply uncorked a bottle pulled up his sleeve scooped up a huge handful of beef rice and proceeded to stuff it into his face taking occasional pulls of liquor to help it down not wishing to be thought ignorant i used my fingers on a whole chicken and the aides of course ploughed in like cannibals halfway through our collation the more sober of the palace attendants cleared the guests from the main square and there was terrific plunging tripping swearing and profuse apologizing as they staggered to seat themselves at the surrounding buffets whole tables were overturned chaps fell into the undergrowth women shrieked tipsily and had to be helped crockery crashed and glass shattered all to the accompaniment of cries of ah mamselle pardon my absurd clumsiness permit me sir to assist you to your feet hola garcon place a chair beneath madame beneath her posterior you clumsy rascal delightful is it not mamselle bomfomtabellilaba such select company exquisite taste and decoration forgive me madame i am about to vomit a while and so forth eventually to a chorus of cries smashing retching and polite whispers they were all down at various levels and the cabaret began this consisted of a hundred dancing girls in white saris with green fireflies bound in their hair undulating in perfect time across the courtyard to weird nigger music ugly little squirts for the most part but drilled like guardsmen and ive never seen a pantomime chorus to equal them they swayed and weaved among each other like clockwork in the most complex patterns and the mob in the intervals of stuffing and swilling rose to them in drunken appreciation flowers and ribbons and even plates of food were thrown fellows clambered on the tables to applaud and yell the ladies scattered change from their purses and in the middle of it the military band regained consciousness as one man and began to play auprиs de ma blonde again the bandmaster fell into the fountain to prolonged cheering one of the aides at our table subsided face down in a dish of curry general rakohaja lit a cheroot about twenty chaps ran in among the dancinggirls and began an impromptu waltz the prince and princess made their entrance in sedans draped with clothofgold and borne shoulderhigh by hova guardsmen the whole assembly raved and staggered in loyal greeting and at the next table a slanteyed yellow gal with slim bare shoulders glanced lingeringly in my direction lowered her eyelids demurely and stuck out her tongue at me behind her fan before i could respond with a courtly inclination of my head there was a sudden blare of trumpets drowning out the hubbub it rose in a piercing fanfare and as it died away the entire congregation staggered to its feet with a renewed clattering of overturned chairs breaking of dishes subdued swearing and apology and stood more or less silent leaning on each other and breathing stertorously on the centre of the first balcony of the palace lanterns were blazing guardsmen were forming and a brazenlunged majordomo was shouting commands handmaidens appeared bearing the striped umbrella cymbals clashed a couple of idolkeepers scurried out with their little bundles the silver spear was borne forward and here came the founder of the feast the guest of honour the captain of the side imperial in her crimson gown and golden crown to be greeted by a roar of acclamation which beat everything that had gone before the wave of adulation beat up and echoed against the towering walls manjaka manjaka ranavalona ranavalona as she moved slowly forward to the balcony her stately progress marred only by the obvious fact that she too was drunker than davids sow she swayed dangerously as she stood looking down a couple of guardsmen lending a discreet elbow on either side and then the band in a triumph of instinct over intoxication burst into the national anthem may the queen live a thousand years rendered with heroic enthusiasm by the diners most of whom seemed to be accompanying themselves by beating spoons on plates it ended in a furore of cheering and her majesty retired about five seconds id say before collapsing in a heap we hallooed her out of sight and now that the loyal toast was drunk so to speak the party began in earnest there was a concerted rush into the square in which i found myself carried along willynilly and with the band surpassing itself a frenzied polka was danced i found myself partnering an enormously fat hippo of a woman in crinoline who used me as a batteringram to drive a way through the press screaming like a steam whistle as she did so i may say that in keeping with the spirit of the evening i had taken a fairish cargo of drink aboard myself and it was making me feel reckless for i kept craning over the heads of the throng in the hope of a sight of the yellow gal who had been eyeing me which was madness of course but even the thought of a jealous ranavalona aint proof against several pints of aniseed liquor and malagassy champagne besides after months of galloping royalty i was crying out for a change and that slender charmer would supply it splendidly there she was with a froglike black partner clinging to her for support she caught my glance as the dance swept her past and opened her eyes invitingly at me it was the work of a moment to kick my partners massive legs from under her and thrust her squawking under the feet of the prancing throng i fought my way to the sidelines scooping the yellow gal out of her partners drunken embrace en route and he blundered on blindly while i bore off the prize with one arm round her lissom waist she was shrieking with laughter as i swept her into the undergrowth it was bedlam in there too for it seemed that the accepted way of sitting out a dance in antan was to crawl into the hushes and fornicate half the guests appeared to be there before us black bottoms everywhere but i found a clear space and was just settling down choking lustfully in the waves of scent which my lady affected when some brute kicked me in the ribs and there was rakohaja standing over us i was about to damn his eyes heartily but he just jerked his head and moved behind a tree and since my yellow gal chose that moment to be sick i lost no time in joining him cursing my luck just the same i was pretty unsteady on my feet but i realized that he was cold sober the lean black face was grim and steady and there was something about the way he glanced either side at the hullabaloo of the dance and the dim forms grunting and gasping in the shadows about us that made me check my angry protest he drew on his cheroot a moment then pitching it away he took my arm and ushered me under the trees along a narrow path and so by a dimlylighted passage into a little open garden space which i guessed must be to the side of the palace proper it was moonlight and the little space was full of shadows i was about to demand to know what the dooce this was all about when i realized that there were at least two men halfhidden in the gloom but rakohaja paid them no attention he crossed to a little summerhouse with a chink of light showing beneath its door and tapped i stood trying to get my head clear suddenly scared faintly in the distance i could hear the sounds of music and drunken revelry and then the door was opened and i was being ushered inside blinking in the lanternlight as i stared round panic mounting in my throat there were four men seated there looking at me to my left in dark shirt breeches and boots his face vulpine in the lanternray was laborde next to him solemn for once his fat chops framed in his high collar was fankanonikaka to the right slimly elegant in his full court dress was one of the young malagassy nobles whom i knew by sight although id hardly spoken to him baron andriama and in the centre his handsome young face tense and strained was prince rakota himself his glance went past me as the door closed no one saw you his voice was a hoarse whisper no one says rakohaja behind me it is safe to begin i doubted that i really did drunk or not i can smell a conspiracy when its pushed under my nose and the presence of royalty and several of madagascars most eminent citizens notwithstanding i knew at once that there was mischief brewing here but rakohajas hand was on my shoulder firmly guiding me to a seat and any lingering doubt was dispelled as the prince nodded to laborde who addressed me there is very little time says he so i shall be brief do you wish to return to england in safety with your wife the honest answer to that was high treason and the knowledge must have shown in my face for little fankanonikaka broke in quickly it was a sign of his agitation that he spoke not in fluent french but in his bastard english not frightening no alarms alls well flashman friends here liking you telling truth like old boys aint we if the queens own son and her secretary and most trusted minister were in it whatever it was there could be no point in lying yes says i and the prince sighed with relief and broke into a torrent of malagassy but laborde cut him short pardon highness we must not delay he turned to me again the time has come to depose the queen all of us whom you see here are agreed on that we are not alone there are others trusted friends who are in the plot with us we have a plan simple effective and involving no bloodshed by which her majesty will be removed from power and his highness crowned in her place he will give you his royal word that in return for your faithful service in this he will set you and your wife at liberty and return you to your homeland he paused his words had come out in a swift incisive rush but now he spoke slowly will you join us could it be a trap some devilish device of ranavalonas to test my loyalty she was fiend enough to be capable of it labordes face said nothing fankanonikaka was nodding at me as though willing me to agree i glanced at the prince and the almost wistful expression in the fine dark eyes convinced me nearly i was sober enough now and as frightened as any decent coward has any right to be it might be dangerous to agree but just the feel of rakohajas grim presence at my elbow told me it would be downright fatal to refuse what dyou want me to do i said for the life of me i couldnt see why they needed me at all unless they wanted me to strangle the black slut in her bath the mind shuddered at the thought no it couldnt be that no bloodshed laborde had said we need someone laborde went on as though hed been reading my mind who is in the queens confidence entirely above suspicion yet with the power so to dispose of the armed forces that they will be unable to protect her someone who can ensure that when the moment comes her hova guard regiment will not be able to intervene those guards within the palace can be dealt with easily provided there is no reinforcement to assist them that is the key to the whole plan and you hold the key so many thoughts and terrors were jumbling in my mind by now that i couldnt give them coherent utterance for a moment the prospect of freedom of escape from that monstrous poppaea and her ghastly country i shivered with excitement at the thought but laborde must be crazy for what could i do about her infernal soldiers i might be god almighty on the drillground telling them where to put their clodhopping feet but id no authority beyond that their plot might be al and i was all for it provided i was safe out of harms way but the thought of doing anything one hint of suspicion in those terrible eyes how can i do that i stuttered i mean ive no power general rakohaja here he could order not possible queen not liking all thinking bad of general chop undoubtedly fankanonikaka waved his hands and rakohajas deep voice sounded behind me if i or any other noble attempted to move the hova guards more than a mile from the city the queens suspicions would be instantly aroused and i do not have to tell you what follows on her suspicions it has been tried once before and general betimseraba lingered in agony for days without arms or legs or eyes hanging in a buffalo skin at ambohipotsy he was plotting as we are but not so carefully he forgot that the queen has spies in every corner spies that even fankanonikaka does not know about yet all he did was try to detach two companies of the guard to tamitave nothing was proved but he failed the tanguin and died but but i cant move the guards you have done so twice already it was andriama speaking for the first time did you not give them training marches one of two days the other of three nothing was said the queen was undisturbed what would excite immediate suspicion if done by a noble of whom the queen is jealous and she is insanely jealous of all of us may be easily accomplished by the sergeantgeneral who is only a slave and well beloved by the queen fankanonikaka was nodding eagerly his lips seemed to be framing the words jiga jiga jig i was going faint at the thought of the risk id already run quite unawares dont you understand says laborde dont you see from the moment i saw you in the slavemarket months ago we have been scheming fankanonikaka and i to bring you to the position where you could do this thing the queen trusts you because she has no reason to suspect you who are only a lost foreigner she thinks of you only as the slave who drills her troops and as a lover you know how cautiously we have proceeded so that no hint of suspicion could attach to you his highness has kept your wife in safety even beyond the eyes and ears of his mothers spies we have waited and waited oh long before you came to madagascar this is not the first time we have plotted in secret she is mad the prince burst out you know she is mad and terrible a woman of blood she is my mother and and he was shaking twisting his hands together i do not seek the throne for greed or for power i do it to save this country to save all of us before she destroys us utterly or brings down the vengeance of the world upon us and she will she will the powers will not stand by forever he stared from laborde to rakohaja and back again you know it we all know it i couldnt fathom this until laborde explained you are not alone flashman only last month a brig named the marie laure was driven ashore near tamitave her master one jacob heppick an american was taken and sold into slavery like you i had him bought through friends of mine he snorted suddenly there are five european slaves whom i have bought secretly this year to save them from worse castaways unfortunates like you and your wife they are hidden with my friends but there have been inquiries from their governments inquiries which the queen has answered with insults and threats she has even been foolish enough to abuse the few foreign traders who put in here men have been taken from their vessels put to forced labour virtually enslaved how long will france and england and america endure this even now he leaned forward tapping my knee there is a british warship in tamitave roads whose commander has sent protests to the queen she will reject them as she always does and burn another hundred christians alive to show her contempt of foreigners how long before that one british warship is a squadron landing an army to march on antan and pull her from her throne does she think london and paris will endure her forever and what the devil i nearly burst out is wrong with that i never heard such splendid stuff in all my lifegod to think of british regiments and blue jackets storming into her beastly capital blowing her lousy hova rascals to blazes stringing her up with any luck and then it occurred to me that these malagassy gentlemen might not view the prospect with quite as much enthusiasm they wouldnt relish being another british or french dominion no but let good king rakota mount the throne and behave like a civilized being and the powers would be happy enough to leave him and his country alone so that was why they were in such a sweat to get rid of mama before she provoked an invasion but why should laborde care he wasnt a malagassy no but he was a conniving frog and he didnt want the union jack over antan any more than the others did i wasnt in the political service for nothing you know she will destroy us rakota cries again she will bring us to war and in her madness there is no horror she will not no highness says rakohaja she will not for we will not let her this time we shall succeed you understand says laborde eyeing me what is to be done you must send the guards on a march to the ankay a mere thirty miles away nothing more than that a training march lasting three days under their subordinate commanders as usual that will leave the teklave and antaware regiments at antan says rakohaja they will do nothing their generals will be with us as soon as our coup is seen to be successful we shall strike on the second night after the guards have gone says andriama i shall be in attendance on the queen i shall have thirty men in the palace at a given signal they will take the queen prisoner and dispose of her guards within the palace if that is necessary general rakohaja will summon the commanders of the lesser regiments and with mr fankanonikaka will proclaim the new king it will be done within an hour and when word of the coup reaches the hova guards at ankay it will be too late the enthusiasm of the people will ensure our success they will rally to me says rakota earnestly they will see why i do this thing that i will be a liberator and yes highness says rakohaja you may trust us to see to all that i couldnt help noticing that they used rakota pretty offhand for their future monarch who would rule madagascar i couldnt help wondering but that was small beermy mind was racing over this thunderclap that theyd burst on me they werent laggard conspirators these lads and id hardly had time to get my breath they had it all pat but by jingo it was an appalling risk suppose something went wrong as it had done before apparently the mere thought of the vengeance ranavalona would take set my innards quiveringand id be in the middle of the stew too i could have wept at the thought that there was a british warship this very minute not four days ride away to the eastward was there any way i could no that wasnt on the cards suppose laborde could bring it off suppose the queen got wind of it she had spies i even found myself looking at fankanonikaka and wondering who knew she might have penetrated this conspiracy already she might be gloating up yonder biding her time i thought of those awful pits and the fellow screaming before her throne with his arm parboiled then you are with us says laborde and i realized they were all staring at me fankanonikaka roundeyed eager but scared the prince almost appealing andriama and rakohaja grimly laborde with his head back weighing me in the silence of the little summerhouse i could still hear faintly the sounds of the distant music there was a foolish useless question in my mind but funk that i was i had to ask it although the answer wouldnt settle my terrors a bit youre sure the queen doesnt suspect already says i ive heard of thirty men wholl do the thing how dye know there isnt a spy among em those two sentries outside one of the sentries says andriama is my brother the other my oldest friend the thirty whom i shall lead are men from the forests outlaws brigands men under sentence of death already they can be trusted for if they betrayed us they would join us in the pits neither the queen nor chancellor vavalana suspects says rakota quickly i am certain of it he fidgeted and looked at me smiling hopefully when will my wife and i be free to leave says i looking him in the eye but it was laborde who answered three days from now for you must send the guards to ankay tomorrow and we will strike on the night of the day following from that moment you are free if im still alive thinks i i knew i was red in the face which is a sure sign that im paralysed with fear but what could i do but accept hadnt they cut it fine though not giving old flash much time to play em false if hed been so minded the cunning scoundrels even so they felt it would do no harm to drop a reminder in my ear for when the prince had said a few wellchosen words to wind up our little social gathering and we had dispersed quietly into the dark and i was making my way tremulously back to the courtyard where they were still racketing fit to wake the dead rakohaja suddenly surged up at my elbow a moment sergeantgeneral if you please he had a cheroot going again he glanced around drawing on it before continuing i was watching you i do not think you are a calm man heaven alone knew what could have given him that impression to demonstrate my sangfroid i uttered a falsetto moan of inquiry calm is necessary says the big bastard laying a hand on my arm a nervous man in your situation might give way to fear he might conceive foolishly that his interest would be best served by betraying our plot to her majesty i started to babble but he cut me short that would be fatal any gratitude which the queen might feel supposing she felt any at all would be more than outweighed by her jealous rage on discovering that her lover had been unfaithful mamselle bomfomtabellilaba is an attractive woman as you are aware you seemed to be finding her so when i summoned you earlier this evening the queen would be most displeased with you if she heard of it he took my arm as we approached the courtyard i remember one of her earlier favourites who was indiscreet enough only to smile at one of her majestys waitingwomen he never smiled again at least i do not think he did but it is difficult to tell after a mans skin has been removed inch by inch in one piece shall we find something to eat i am quite famished while i can lie and dissemble with the best as a rule im not much hand at conspiracy youre too dependent on knavery other than your own mind you they seemed a steady enough gang and the one blessing was that there was little time left for anything to go wrong if id had to wait days or weeks i dont doubt my nerve would have cracked or id have given myself away when i went on parade next dawn having had not a wink of sleep i was twitching like a landed fish id even started guiltily when my orderly brought my shavingwater what was behind it eh wasnt it suspicious that his behaviour was exactly the same as it had been for months did he know something by the time i got to my office and issued my orders of the day to my small staff of instructors i was seeing spies everywhere and behaving like a nervous actor in macbeth the shocking problem as i stared at the impassive black faces of my staff and tried to keep my hands still was to devise a sufficient excuse for sending the guards off to ankay god how had i got into this i couldnt just order em off that would excite comment for certain they didnt need the exercise theyd been behaving well on parade i couldnt see any way but i had them mustered in case trusting the lord would provide and he did the men were steady and wellturned out as usual but their junior officers had been at the queens party all night and came on parade halfsoused seeing my chance i set em to drill their columns and in five minutes that muster looked like the battle of borodino with hovas walking into each other whole companies going astray and little drunk officers staggering about shrieking and weeping in happy inspiration i had the band paraded to accompany the drill and since most of them were still crosseyed and blowing into the wrong end of their instruments the shambles was only increased at this i flew into a frightful passion placed the drunker officers under arrest harangued the parade at the top of my voice and told them they could damn well march in full kit until they were sober and respectable again ankay was the place i said they could camp out on the plain without tents or blankets and if one of em dared to get fever id flog him stupid it must have sounded convincing and presently off they went led by the band playing three different marches at once i watched them fade into the dusty haze and thought well thats my part well done and if the whole plot goes agley i can still plead that my actions have been perfectly normal but thats small comfort to a conscience like mine i was a prey to increasing terror all day fretting about what laborde and the others might be doing there was another day and night for word of the plot to leak out and i started at every voice and footfall fortunately no one seemed to notice no doubt they attributed my jumps like their own to the excesses of the previous night there was no word from the palace no hint of anything untoward evening came and i prepared to turn in early with a bottle of aniseed to quiet my dark hours i lay there listening to the distant sounds of the palace sucking at my flask and telling myself for the thousandth time there was no reason why all shouldnt be well why given luck in two days elspeth and i would be riding down in style to tamitave with rakotas blessing then the first english ship and home and safety far from this hellish place it mightnt be so bad of course with ranavalona out of the way might be financial advantage to be had rich country new market trading ventures expert advice to city merchants in return for ten per cent of the profits not to be sneezed at wonder what theyd do with good queen randy exile to the southern province likely with a platoon of hova bucks to keep her warm serve her right the knock on my door sounded thunderously and i came bolt upright sweating i heard my orderlys voice and here he was as i scrabbled for my boots and behind him the ominous figures of hova guardsmen bandoliers and all their bare chests gleaming black in the lamplight there was an underofficer summoning me to the royal apartments the words pierced my drowsy brain like drops of acid oh christ i was done for i had to hold on to the edge of my cot as i pulled on my breeches what could she want at this hour and why should she send a guard of soldiers unless the worst had happened the gaff was blown it must be steady though it might be nothing after all i must keep a straight face whatever it was panic shook me should i try a bolt no that would be fatal and my legs wouldnt answer it was all they could do to walk steady as the officer led the way round to the front of the palace past the broad steps was it imagination that there seemed to be more sentries than usual and across the court to the silver palace gleaming dimly under the rising moon its million bells tinkling softly in the night air up the stairs along the broad corridor with my legs like jelly and the hova boots pounding stolidly behind me i wasnt happy about those boots i remembered id toyed with the idea of trying em in sandals but hadnt been sure how theyd stand up to long marching ye gods what a thing to think about with my life in the balance and now the great doors were opening the officer was waving me in and here in a blaze of light was the reception room and i was striding in and bowing automatically while the picture was emblazoned in my mind she was there black and still on her throne it must be midnight surely but damne if she wasnt wearing a taffeta afternoon dress all blue flounces and a hat with an ostrich plume i came up from my bow feeling the chill stare but i couldnt bring myself to look at her a couple of her girl attendants alongside then the lean robed figure of vavalana the chancellor his head cocked looking at me out of his crafty eyes fankanonikaka i struggled for composure but his bland black face told me nothing and then my heart leaped sickeningly and i almost cried out to one side between two guardsmen stood baron andriama his shirt was torn his face contorted and his hands were bound he seemed barely able to stand there was a filthy mess on the floor near him and the word shot into my mind tanguin she knew then it was all up out of the corner of my eye i could see her watching me her hand at her earring then she muttered something and vavalana shuffled forward his staff tapping his grizzled head and skinny black face looked curiously birdlike he blinked at me like a cheeky old robin speak before the queen says he and his voice was a gentle croak why did you send the guards to ankay i tried to look slightly puzzled and to keep my voice steady may the queen live a thousand years i sent the guards on a punishment march because they were drunk and slovenly so was the band i frowned at him and spoke louder they were not fit to be seen i have five of their officers in arrest fifty miles in full kit is what they need to teach em to behave like soldiers and when they come back ill send them out again if they havent learned their lesson it sounded well i think the right touch of puzzled indignation and martial severity although how i managed it god alone knows vavalana was studying me and behind him that black face and beady eyes beneath the ostrich plume were as fixed as a stone idols i must not falter or betray fear they were not sent away on the orders of that man says vavalana and his scrawny hand pointed at andriama sagging between his guards baron andriama says i bewildered he has no authority over the troops why does he say he ordered me he has never shown any interest in their training hes not a soldier even i dont understand chancellor but you knew cries vavalana his finger stabbing at me you knew he plotted against the life of the great lake supplying water why else should you remove her shield her trusted soldiers i let my jaw drop in amazement then i laughed right in his face and for the first time saw ranavalona startled she jumped like a jerked puppet for i dont suppose anyone had ever laughed aloud in her presence before a plot you say is this a joke chancellor if so its in poor taste i stopped laughing and scowled seeing the doubt in his eyes nows your chance my boy i thought rage and indignation carry it off for all youre worth bluff loyal old harry who would dare plot against her majesty or say that i knew of it i almost shouted the words red in the face and vavalana absolutely fell back a step then enough ranavalona took her hand from her earring come here i stepped forward forcing myself to look into those hypnotic eyes my mouth dry with fear had the bluff worked did she believe me the glazed frozen pupils surveyed me for a full minute then she reached out and took my hand my spirits leaped as she held it and then she grunted one word tanguin my heart lurched and i almost fell for it meant she didnt believe me or at least wasnt sure which was just as bad she was holding my hand sentencing me to trial by ordeal that horrible lunatic test of madagascar which gave barely a chance of survival i heard my own teeth chattering and then i was grovelling and pleading protesting my loyalty swearing she was the darlingest loveliest queen who ever was only the blind certainty that confession meant sure and unspeakable death stopped me from whimpering out the whole plot for at least the tanguin gave me a slender chance and i suppose i knew it the sullen face didnt change she let go my hand and gestured to the guards i could only crouch there while they made their beastly preparations aware of nothing except the black muscular hands holding the little tanguin stone and scraping it with a knife so that the grey powdery flakes fell on to the platter on which lay the three dried scraps of chickenskin there it was my poisoned death one of the guards jerked me roughly to my feet gripping my arms behind me the other advanced lifting the plate up to my face he seized my jawand then paused as the queen spoke but it wasnt a reprieve she was signing to one of her maids and everything must wait me with my eyes popping at that venomous offal i was going to have to swallow while the girl scurried away and came back with a purse from which the queen solemnly counted twentyfour dollars into vavalanas hand at that final callousness that obscene adherence to the letter of their heathen ritual my nerve broke no i screamed let me go ill tell i swear ill tell by the grace of god i shouted in english which no one except fankanonikaka understood mercy they made me do it ill tell my jaw was wrenched cruelly open bestial fingers were holding it and i choked as my mouth filled with the filthy odour of the tanguin i struggled gagging but the scraps of chicken were thrust cruelly to the back of my mouth then muscular hands clamped my jaws shut and pinched my nostrils i struggled and heaved trying not to swallow my throat was on fire with that vile dust i was choking horribly my lungs bursting but it was no use i gulped agonizingly and then i was staggering free sobbing and trying to retch glaring round in panic knowing i was dying yet even then aware of the curiosity in the watching eyes of vavalana and the guards and the blank indifference of the creature motionless on the throne i screamed again and again clutching at my burning throat while the room spun giddily round me and then the guards had seized me once more little fankanonikaka was jabbering at me while they forced a bowl to my lips buvez buvez drinking quickly and a torrent of ricewater was being poured into me filling my mouth and nostrils soaking my whole head my very lungs seemed to be filling with the stuff i swallowed and swallowed until i felt i must burst feeling the relief as that corrosive pain was washed from my mouth and then an agonizing convulsion gripped my stomach and then another and another i was on hands and knees crawling blindly oh god if this was death it was worse than anything id imagined i opened my mouth to scream and in that moment i spewed as never before again and again and collapsed in a shuddering heap wailing feebly and all but dead to the world while the spectators gathered round to take stock this is the interesting part of the tanguin ordeal you see will the victim vomit properly its true thats the test they force that deadly poison into you douse you with ricewater to help digestion and await events but it aint enough just to be sick you know you must bring up the three pieces of chicken skin as well and if you do its handshakes all round and a tanner from the poor box if you dont then youve failed the test your guilt is established and her majesty has endless fun disposing of you delightful aint it and just about as logical as the proceedings of our police courts if rather more upsetting to the accused at least you dont have to wait in suspense while they sift the evidence for youre too racked and exhausted to care i lay coughing and whining with my eyes blurred with tears of pain until someone seized my hair and jerked me upright and there was vavalana solemnly surveying three sodden little objects on his palm and fankanonikaka beaming relief at his elbow nodding at me and i was still too dazed to take it in as the guards thrust me forward on to my knees snuffling and blubbering before the throne then followed the most astonishing thing of all ranavalona held out her hand and vavalana carefully placed eight dollars in her palm she passed them to her maid and he then gave her another eight which she held out to me i was too used up to recollect that this was the token that id survived the ordeal successfully but then she made it abundantly clear when i took the money she closed her hand round mine and leaned forward from her throne until our faces were almost touching and to my utter disbelief i saw that there were tears in those dreadful snake eyes very gently she rubbed her nose against mine and touched my face with her lips then she was upright again turning her glare on the unfortunate andriama and hissing something in malagassy she may have been reminding him to wear wool next his skin but i doubt it for he shrieked with terror and flung himself grovelling in front of her nuzzling at her feet while the guards fell on him and dragged him writhing towards the doors my hair stood up shuddering on my scalp as his screams died away a less comprehensive spew and that would have been me wailing fankanonikaka was at my elbow and taking my cue from him i bowed unsteadily backing out of the presence as the doors closed on us ranavalona was still seated the ostrich plume nodding as she muttered to her bottle idol her maids were starting to mop the floor in a disconsolate way much touching queen loving you greatly so pleased you puking pretty much happy tanguin not dying fankanonikaka was absolutely snivelling with sentiment as he hurried she never loving so deep except royal bulls which arent human being but now hurrying much danger still for you for me for all when andriama telling plots he thrust me along the passages and so to his little office where he shot the bolt and stood gasping what about andriama what happened he rolled his eyes who knowing someone betraying awful humbug vavalana maybe spy keyholing hearing somethings queen suspicioning andriama giving tanguin he puking no good not like you i not there in time no helping like for you with salt littlelittle cascara in ricewater making mighty sickings jolly happy all right and tight i say no wonder id been sick i could have kissed the little blighter but he was fairly twitching with alarm andriama telling soon awful torturings now worse from spanish inquizzing burnings and cutting away private participles he shuddered his hands over his face he crying about plot me you rakohaja laborde for gods sake talk french everything be knowing to vavalana and queen maybe little time yet then clink for us torturings too then tyburn jig ill wager only hope making plot now tonight guards not here marching ankay leftright must telling rakohaja laborde queen suspicioning andriama blowing gaff soon he babbled on while i tried desperately to think he was right of course malagassies are brave and tough as teak but andriama would never stand the horrors that ranavalonas beauties were probably inflicting on him while we stood talking hed break and soon and wed be dead men by george though she fancied me didnt she just piping her eye when i survived the tanguin the tenderhearted little bundle aye and no doubt shed weep into her pillow after id been flayed alive for treason too if we could reach laborde or rakohaja could they bring off the coup at once where were andriamas thirty villains did rakota know what had been happening rakota dear god elspeth what would become of her i pounded my fist in a fury of despair while fankanonikaka twittered in malagassy and pidgin english and suddenly i saw that there was only one way and a slender hope at that but it was that or unspeakable death the flashman gambit when in doubt run look fankanonikaka says i leave this to me ill find laborde and rakohaja but if im to move quickly i must have a horse can you give me an order on the royal stables they wont let me take a beast without authority come on man i cant run all over bloody antan on foot wait though i may need more than one write me an order for a dozen horses so that i can give em to laborde or rakohaja theyll have to assemble those men of andriamas somehow he goggled at me in consternation but what reason if order say taking all horse someone suspicioning crying fire and bow street say theyre for the guards officers i sent marching to ankay say the queens sorry for em and they can ride back any damned excuse will do hurry man andriamas probably crying uncle this instant that decided him he grabbed a quill and scribbled as i hovered at his shoulder shuddering with impatience the minutes were flying and with every one my chances were growing dimmer i pocketed the order there was one more item i must have have you a pistol a sword then i must have a weapon in case i hoped to heaven thered be no in case about it but i couldnt go unarmed he scurried about and found one in a nearby drawingroom only a ceremonial rapier with a curved ivory hilt and no guard but it would have to do as i took it an appalling thought struck me why not cut upstairs and kill the black bitch where she sat or sick fankanonikaka on to do it he fairly squealed with alarm and indignation no no no bloodings gentle deposings only great queen poor lady oh so barmy if only she peace and quiet ourselves not needing damn plottings not above half now all to smash kicking up rows arrests and cruellings ile wrung his hands you hurrying laborde fastly i waiting sentry oh my stars someone maybe nabbing or queen suspicioning not a bit of it says i tell you what though youre a sharp hand at slipping things into chaps drinks aint you well try and find a way of sending poor old andriama some refreshment put him out of his misery before he blabs what and dont fret fankanonikaka we all old boys jolly times together floreat highgate and to hell with the bluecoat school hey then i was off leaving him twittering forcing myself to walk slowly as i descended the great staircase past the incurious palace guardsmen across the court and out into the street beyond it was the small hours but there was plenty of traffic about for in the royal district of antan society folk kept late hours and there was sure to be much diningout and discussing of last nights orgy at the palace they delight in scandal you know just like their civilized brethren and sisters the streets were welllit but no one paid me any heed as i made my way past the strolling pedestrians and the sedans jogging under the trees i had got a long cloak from fankanonikaka to wear over my boots and breeches and to cover my sword for slaves didnt ought to have such things and apart from my white face and whiskers i was just like any other passerby the stables were only five minutes walk and i lounged about in a fever of nonchalance while the underofficer laboriously spelled out fankanonikakas note and looked surly he didnt have much french but i supplemented the written order as best i could and since he recognized me as the sergeantgeneral he did what he was told two horses for me says i and the other dozen for the guards officers out at ankay send em out now with a groom and tell him to follow the guards track but not to hurry i dont want the cattle worn out dyou see no grooms says he sulkylike then get one says i or ill mention you to the queen may she live a thousand years been out to ambohipotsy lately have you youll find yourself observing it from the top of the cliff unless you look sharp and put a waterbottle filled with each horse and plenty of jaka in the saddlebags i left him as pale as only a scared nigger can be and rode at a gentle pace in the direction of prince rakotas palace leading the second horse i darent hurry for a mounted man was rare enough in antan at any time and a hastening rider in the middle of the night would have had them hollering peeler this is the worst of all when every seconds precious but you have to dawdle i think of strolling terrified through the pandy lines at lucknow with campbells message or that nerveracking wait on the steamboat wharf at memphis with a disguised slavegirl on my elbow and the catchers at our very heels you must idle along carelessly with your innards screaming had andriama talked yet did the queen know it all by now was fankanonikaka perhaps already shrieking under the knives were the city gates still open they never closed em as a rule if i found them shut that would be a sure sign that the caper was blown heaven help us then rakotas place in the suburbs stood well apart from the other houses behind a stockade approached through a belt of small trees and bushes i left the horses there out of sight breathed a silent prayer that malagassy hacks knew enough not to stray or neigh and set forward boldly for the front gate there was a porter dozing under the lantern but he let me in ready enough they dont care much these folk and presently i was kicking the jiggerdubber awake on the front steps boldly announcing myself from the silver palace with a message for his royal highness this presently produced a butler who knew my face but when i demanded instant audience he cocked his frosty head disdainfully their highnesses are not returned ah sergeantgeneral they are dining with count potrafanton you can wait on the porch that was a blow i hadnt a moment to spare i hesitated and then saw there was nothing for it but the high hand its no matter porter says i briskly my message is that the foreign woman who is here is to be sent to the silver palace immediately the queen wishes to see her if my nerves hadnt been snapping i dare say id have been quite entertained at the expressions which followed each other across his wrinkled black face i was only tenthcaste foreign rubbish a mere slave he was thinking on the other hand i was sergeantgeneral with impressive if undefined power and much more to the point i was the queens current favourite and ridingmaster as all the world knew and i brought a command ostensibly from the throne itself all this went through the woolly head how much hed been told by his master about the need to keep elspeths presence secret i couldnt guess but eventually he saw which way wisdom and ambohipotsy lay i shall inform her says he stiffly and arrange an escort that wont be necessary says i harshly i have a sedan waiting beyond the gates butlers are the bloody limit he was ready to argue so eventually i just blazed at him and threatened if he didnt have her down and on parade in a brace of shakes id march straight back to the palace and tell the queen her sons butler had said snooks and slammed the door on me he quivered at that more in anger than sorrow and then marched off all black dignity to fetch her you could see he was wondering what things were coming to nowadays i waited chewing my knuckles pacing the porch and groaning at the recollection of how long it took the bloody woman to dress ten to one she was peering at herself in the glass patting her curls and making moues while andriama was probably blabbing and plot alarm and arrest were breaking out with a vengeance ranavalonas tentacles might be reaching out through the city this moment in search of me i stamped and cursed aloud in a fever of impatience and then strode through the open door at the sound of a female voice sure enough there she was in cloak and bonnet prattling her way down the stairs and the butler carrying what looked like a hatbox of all things she gave a little shriek at the sight of me but before i could frown her into silence another sound had me wheeling round hackles rising my hand starting towards my swordhilt through the open door i could see down the long drive to the main gate it was dim down yonder under the flickering lantern but some kind of commotion was going on there was a clatter of metal a voice raised in command a steady tread advancing and into my horrified view their steel and leather glittering in the beams cast by the front door lamps came a file of hova guardsmen i may not be good for much but if i have a minor talent its for finding the back door when coppers creditors and outraged husbands are coming in the front i had the advantage of having my pants up and my boots on this time and even hampered by the need to drag elspeth along i was going like a rat to a drainpipe before the butler even had his mouth open elspeth gave one shriek of astonishment as i bundled her along a passage beneath the stairs harry where are you going we have left my bandbox damn your bandbox i snapped keep quiet and run i whirled round a corner there was a corridor obviously leading to the back and i pounded along it my protesting helpmeet clutching her bonnet and squeaking in alarm a startled black face popped out of a sidedoor i hit it in panic and elspeth screamed the corridor turned at right angles i swore and plunged into an empty room a glimpse of a long table and dining chairs in the silent dark and beyond french windows i hurtled towards them hauling her along and wrenched them open we were in the garden dim in the moonshadows i cocked an ear and heard nothing harry she was squealing in my ear what are you about leave go my arm i wont be hustled do you hear youll either be hustled or dead i hissed silence we are in deadly danger do you understand they are coming to arrest us to kill us for your lifes sake do as i tell you and shut up there was a path running between high hedges we sped along it she demanding in breathless whispers to know what was happening at the end i got my bearings we were to the side of the building in shrubbery with the front drive round to our left and from the hidden front door i could hear a harsh voice raised in malagassy unfortunately but i caught enough words to chill my blood sergeantgeneral arrest search i groaned softly and elspeth began babbling again oh my dress is torn harry it is too bad what are you why are we ow i had clapped a hand over her mouth be quiet you silly mort i whispered were escaping there are soldiers hunting us the queen is trying to kill me she made muffled noises and then got her mouth free how dare you call me that horrid word what does it mean let me go this instant you are hurting my wrist harry what is this absurd nonsense about the quee the shrill torrent was cut off as i imprisoned her mouth again for gods sake woman theyll hear us i pulled her in close to the wall keep your voice down will you i took my hand away unwisely but why at least she had the wit to whisper why are we oh i think you are gammoning me well it is a very poor joke harry flashman and i please elspeth i implored shaking my fist in her face hts true i swear if they hear us were dead my grimacing frenzy may have halfconvinced her at least her pretty mouth opened and closed again with a faint oh and then as i crouched straining my ears for any sound of the searchers came the tiniest whisper but harry my bandbox i glared her into silence and then ventured a peep round the angle of the wall there was a hova trooper on the porch leaning on his spear i could hear faint sounds of talk from the hall that damned butler giving the game away no doubt suddenly from behind us in the dark towards the hack of the house came the crash of a shutter and a harsh voice shouting elspeth squeaked i jumped and the hova on the porch must have heard the shout too for he called to the hall and here to my horror came an underofficer bounding down the porch steps sword in hand and running along the front of the house towards our corner there was only one thing for it i seized elspeth and thrust her down on her face in the deep shadow at the foot of the wall sprawling on top of her and hissing frantically to her to keep quiet and lie still we were only in the nick of time he rounded the angle of the house and came to a dead stop almost on top of us his boots spurning the gravel within a yard of elspeths head for a terrible instant i thought hed seen us the great black figure towered above us silhouetted against the night sky the sword glittering in his hand but he didnt move and i realized he was staring towards the back of the house listening i could feel elspeth palpitating beneath me her turned face a faint white blur just beneath my own oh christ i prayed dont let him look down suddenly he bawled something in malagassy and took a halfstep forward my blood froze as his boot descended within inches of elspeths face but right on top of her hand she started violently beneath me and then he must have shifted his weight for as in a nightmare i heard a tiny crack and her whole body shuddered paralysed i waited for her scream he must glance down now but a voice was shouting from the back of the house his was bellowing right above us in reply he plunged forward his leg brushing my curls and then he was gone striding away down the path behind us into the dark and elspeths breath came out in a little shivering moan i was afoot in an instant hauling her upright halfcarrying her into the denser shrubbery on the lawn knowing we hadnt an instant to lose bundling her along and hoping to heaven she wouldnt faint if we could get quickly through the shrubbery unobserved moving parallel with the drive and so come to the gate would they have left a sentry there fortunately the shrubbery screened our blundering progress entirely we plunged through the undergrowth and fetched up gasping beneath a great clump of ferns not ten yards from the gate far back to our left the hova was still on the house porch beneath the lamp through the bushes ahead i could make out the faint gleam of the gatelantern but no sound except from far behind us where there were distant voices at the back of the house were they coming nearer i peered cautiously through the fringe of bushes towards the gate oh god there was a damned great hova not five yards away his spear held across his body looking back towards the house the light gleamed dully on his massive bare arms and chest on his gorilla features and gleaming spearhead my innards quailed at the sight i couldnt hope to pass that not with elspeth in tow and at that moment my loved one decided to give voice again harry she was hissing in my ear that man that man stood on my hand im sure my finger is broke i recall noting that it must have been indignation rather than complaint for she added a word which frankly i didnt think she knew ssht i had my lips against her ear i know well well mend it presently theres a guard on the gate must get past him the voices at the back of the house were growing louder it was now or never can you walk of course i can walk it is my poor finger sssht for christs sake look old girl we must distract his attention dyou see the chap on the gate dammit i wouldnt have thought i could yammer and whisper simultaneously but then i wouldnt have thought id be stuck in the bushes in madagascar plotting escape with a blonde imbecile whose mind ill swear was divided evenly between her wounded finger and her lost bandbox yes hes out there now listen you must count to five five you know and then stand up and walk out on to the drive can you dearest just walk out theres a good girl nod curse you his own rush driving it into his body his fall wrenched the hilt from my hand and then i was hightailing after elspeth turning her into the trees where the horses still stood patiently cropping at the grass i heaved her bodily on to one of them her skirts riding up any old how vaulted aboard the other and with a hand to steady her forced the beasts out on to the road beyond there was a tumult of hidden voices by the gate but i knew we were clear if she didnt fall she was always a decent horsewoman and was clinging to the mane with her good hand we ploughed off knee to knee in a swaying canter that took us to the end of one road and down the next and then i eased up no sounds behind and if we heard any we could gallop at need i clasped her to me swearing with relief and asked how her hand was oh it is painful cries she but harry what does it mean those dreadful people i thought i should swoon and my dress torn and my finger broke and every bone in my body shaken oh she shuddered violently those fearful black soldiers did you did you kill them i hope so says i looking back fearfully here take my cloak muffle your head as well if they see what you are were sunk but who why are we running what has happened i insist you tell me directly where are we going theres an english ship on the coast were going to reach her but weve got to get out of this hellish city first if the gates are closed i dont but why cries she like a damn parrot sucking her finger and trying to order her skirts which wasnt easy since she was astride oh this is so uncomfortable why are we being pursued why should they oh her eyes widened what have you done harry why are they chasing you have you done some wrong oh harry have you offended the queen not half as much as shes offended me i snarled shes a a monster and if she lays hands on us were done for come on confound it but i cannot believe it why of all the absurd things when i have been so kindly treated i am sure whatever it is if the prince were to speak to her i didnt quite tear my hair but it was a nearrun thing i gripped her by the shoulders instead and speaking as gently as i could with my teeth chattering impressed on her that we must get out of the city quickly that we must proceed slowly by back streets to the gates but there we might have to ride for it i would explain later very good says she you need not raise your voice if you say so harry but it is all extremely odd ill say that for her once she understood the urgency of the situation and even that peabrain must have apprehended by now that something unusual was taking place she played up like a good un she didnt take fright or weep or even plague me with further questions ive known clever women and plenty like lakshmibai and the silk one who were better at rough riding and desperate work but none gamer than elspeth when the stakes were on the blanket she was a soldiers wife all right pity she hadnt married a soldier but if she was cool enough i was in a ferment as we picked our way by backroads to the city wall and followed it round towards the great gates by this time there were hardly any folk about and although the sight of two riders brought some curious looks no one molested us but i was sure the alarm must have gone out by now i wasnt to know that malagassy bandobast being what it was the last thing theyd have thought to do was close the gates they never had so why bother now i could have shouted with relief when we came in view of the gatetowers and saw the way open with only the usual lounging sentinels and a group of loafers round a bonfire we just held steadily forward letting em see it was the sergeantgeneral they stared at the horses but that was all and with my heart thumping we ambled through under the towers and then trotted forward among the scattered huts on the antan plain ahead of us the sky was lightening in the summer dawn and my spirits with it we were clear free and away and beyond those distant purple hills there was a british warship and english voices and christian vittles and safety behind british guns four days at most if the horses id sent to ankay were waiting ahead of us in that snailpace country where any pursuit was sure to be on foot no one could hope to overtake us no alarm could outstrip us i was ready to whoop in my saddle until i thought of that menacing presence still so close that awful city crouching just behind us and i shook elspeths bridle and sent us forward at a handgallop but our luck was still with us we sighted the change horses just before dawn raising the dust with the groom jogging along on the leader and i never saw a jollier sight they werent the pick of the light cavalry but they had fodder and jaka in their saddlebags and i knew theyd see us there if we spelled em properly thirty miles is as far as any beast can carry me but that would be as much as elspeth could manage at a stretch in any event i dismissed the bewildered groom and on we went at a good round trot a small horseherd aint difficult to manage if youve learned your trade in afghanistan my chief anxiety now was elspeth shed ridden steady and commendably silent until now but as we forged ahead into the empty downland i could see the reaction at work she was swaying in the saddle eyes halfclosed fair hair tumbling over her face and although i was in a sweat to push on i felt bound to swing off into a little wood to rest and eat i lifted her out of the saddle beside a stream and blow me if she didnt go straight off to sleep in my arms for three hours she never stirred while i kept a weather eye on the plain but saw no sign of pursuit she was all demands and chatter again though when she awoke and while we chewed our jaka and i bathed her finger which wasnt broke but badly bruised i tried to explain what had happened dyou know of all the astonishing things that had occurred since wed left england i still feel that that conversation was the most incredible of all i mean explaining anything to elspeth is always middling tough but there was something unreal as i look back about sitting opposite her in a madagascar wood while she stared roundeyed in her torn soiled evening dress with her finger in a splint listening to me describing why we were fleeing for our lives from an unspeakable black despot whom id been plotting to depose not that i blame her for being sceptical mind you it was the form her scepticism took which had me clutching my head at first she just didnt believe a word of it it was quite contrary she said to what she had seen of madagascar and to prove the point she produced from the recesses of her underclothing a small and battered notebook from which she proceeded to read me her impressions of the country so help me it was all about bloody butterflies and wild flowers and malagassy curtain materials and what shed had for dinner it was at this point that it dawned on me that the conclusion id formed on my visits to her at rakotas palace had been absolutely sound shed spent six months in the place without having any notion of what it was really like well i knew she was muttonheaded but this beat all and so i told her i cannot see that says she the prince and princess were all politeness and consideration and you assured me that all was well so why should i think otherwise i was still explaining and being harangued when we took the road again and for the best part of the day which took us to the eastern edge of the downs near angavo where we camped in another wood by that time i had finally got it into her head what a hell of a place madagascar was and what a hideous fate we were escaping youd have thought that would have reduced her to terrified silence but then you dont know my elspeth she was shocked not a bit scared apparently just plain indignant it was deplorable and ought not to be allowed was how she saw it why had we taken no steps to prevent such misgovernment and what was the church thinking about it was quite disgusting i just sat munching jaka but i couldnt help listening to her being reminded of that old harridan lady sale tapping her mittened fingers while the jezzail bullets whistled round her on the kabul retreat and demanding acidly why something was not done about it aye its comical in its way and yet when youve seen the memsahibs pursing their lips and raising indignant brows in the face of dangers and horrors that set their menfolk shaking you begin to understand why theres all the pink on the map its vicarage morality nursery discipline and a thorough sense of propriety and sanitation that have done it and when theyve gone and the memsahibs with them why the map wont be pink any longer the one thing elspeth couldnt accept though was that the outrageous condition of madagascar was ranavalonas fault queens in her conception of affairs did not behave in that way at all the mother of prince rakota would never have countenanced such things no it could only be that she was badly advised and kept in ignorance no doubt by her ministers she had been civil enough to me surely this was asked in an artless way which i knew of old i said well she was pretty plain and illnatured from the little id seen of her but of course id hardly exchanged a word with her elspeth sighed contentedly at this and then after a moment said softly have you missed me harry looking at her sitting in the dusk with the green leaves behind her in her dusty gown with the tangled gold hair framing that lovely face so serene in its stupidity i suddenly realized there was only one sensible way to answer her what with the shock and haste and fear of our flight it absolutely hadnt occurred to me until that moment and afterwards lying in the grass while she stroked my cheek it seemed the most natural thing as if this wasnt madagascar at all with dreadful danger behind and unknown hardship before in that blissful moment i dreamed of the very first time under the trees by the clyde on just such a golden evening and when i spoke of it she began to cry at last and clung to me you will bring us there again home says she you are so brave and strong and good and keep me safe do you know she wiped her eyes looking solemn i never saw you fight before oh i knew to be sure from the newspapers and what everyone said that you were a hero i mean but i did not know how it was women cannot you know now i have seen you sword in hand you are rather terrible you know harry and so quick she gave a little shiver not many women are lucky enough to see how brave their husbands are and i have the bravest best man in the whole world she kissed me on the forehead her cheek against mine i thought of her finger under that crushing boot of the way shed stood up in the bushes and walked straight out of the bruising ride from antan of all shed endured since singapore and i didnt feel ashamed exactly because you know it aint my line but i felt my eyes sting and i lifted her chin with my hand old girl says i youre a trump oh no says she wideeyed i am very silly and weak and and not a trump at all feckless papa says but i love to be your old girl she snuggled her head down on my chest and to think that you like me a little too better than you like the horrid queen of madagascar or mrs leo lade or those chinese ladies we saw in singapore or kitty stevens or my dearest whatever is the matter who the hell roars i is kitty stevens oh do you not remember that slim dark girl with the poor complexion and soulful eyes she thinks so becoming although how she supposes that mere staring will make her attractive i cannot think you danced with her twice at the cavalry ball and assisted her to negus at the buffet we were off again before dawn crossing the angavo pass which leads to the upland ankay plain going warily because i knew the hova guard regiment which id sent out couldnt be far away i kept casting north and we must have outflanked them for we saw not a soul until the mangaro ford where the villagers turned out in force to stare at us as we crossed the river with our little herd it was level going then until the jungle closed in and the mountains began but we were making slower time than id hoped for it began to look like a fiveday trek instead of four but i wasnt much concerned all that mattered was that we should keep ahead of pursuit the frigate would still be there i was sure of this because it was bound to wait for an answer to the protest which according to laborde had only reached the queen a couple of days ago her answer even if shed sent it at once would take more than a week to reach tamitave so if we kept up our pace wed be there with time in hand i kept telling myself this on the third day when our rate slowed to a walk with the long twisting climb up the red rutted track that led into the great mountains here we were walled in by forest on either hand with only that tortuous path for a guide i knew it because id been flogged over it in the slavecoffle and i had to gulp down my fears as we approached each bend suppose we met someone in this place where we couldnt take to our heels where to stray ten yards from the path would be certain death by wandering starvation suppose the path petered out or had been overgrown suppose swift hova runners overtook us i was in a fever of anxiety not made any easier by the childish pleasure elspeth seemed to be taking in our journey she was forever clapping her hands and exclaiming at the saucereyed white monkeys who peered at us or the laceplumed birds that fluttered among the creepers even the hideous watersnakes which cruised the streams with their heads poking out excited her she barred the spiders though great marbled monsters as big as my hand scuttling on webs the size of blankets and once she fled in terror from a sight which had our horses neighing and bucking in the narrow way a troop of great apes bounding across the path in leaps of incredible length both feet together we watched them crash into the undergrowth and not for the first time i cursed the luck that i hadnt even a claspknife with me for defence for god knew what else might be lurking in that dark cavernous forest elspeth wished she had her sketchbook theres forty miles of that forest but thanks to good queen ranavalona we didnt have to cross it all as you would today the jungle track runs clear across towards andevoranto whence you travel up the coast to tamitave but in there was a shortcut the queens buffalo road cut straight through the hilly jungle to the coastal plain this was the track hacked out by thousands of slaves which id seen on the way up we reached it on the fourth day a great avenue through the green with the mountain mist hanging over it in wraiths it was eerie and foreboding but at least it was flat and with half our beasts already abandoned in exhaustion i was glad of the easier going its strange as i look back on that remarkable journey that it wasnt nearly as punishing as it might have been elspeth still swears that she quite enjoyed it i dare say if i hadnt been so apprehensive about our beasts foundering or losing our way if the mist settled down or being overtaken by pursuers or how we were going to make our final dash to the frigate i might have marvelled that we came through it so easily but we did our luck held through hill and jungle we hardly saw a native the whole way and on the fourth afternoon we were trotting down through the strange little conical hillocks that line the sandy coastal plain with nothing ahead of us but a few scattered villages and easy level going until we should come to tamitave of course i should have been on my guard i should have known it had gone too smooth i should have remembered the horror that lay no great way behind and the mad hatred and bloodlust of that evil woman i should have thought of the soldiers first rule to put yourself in the enemys shoes and ask what you would do if id been that terrible bitch and my ingrate lover had tried to ruin me cut up my guardsmen and lit out for the coast what would i have done given unlimited power and a maniacs vengeance to slake sent out my fleetest couriers over plain and jungle and mountain to carry the alarm rouse the garrisons cut off escape thats what id have done how far can good runners travel in a day forty miles over rough going say four days perhaps five from antan to the coast we were approaching tamitave on the evening of the fourth day aye i should have been on my guard but when youre within the last lap of safety when all has gone far better than youd dared hope when youve seen the tamitave track and know that the coast is only a few scant miles away over the low hills when you have the gamest loveliest girl in the world riding knee to knee with you that eager idiot smile on her face and her tits bouncing famously when the dark terrors have receded behind you above all when youve hardly slept in four nights and are fit to topple from the saddle with sheer weariness then hope can fuddle your wits a little and you let the last of your rations slip from your hand and the dusk begins to swim round you and your head is on the turf and you slip down the long slide into unconsciousness until someone miles away is shaking you and yelping urgently in your ear and you come awake in bleary alarm staring wildly about you in the dawn harry oh harry quickly look look she had me by the wrist tugging me to my feet where was i yes this was the little hollow wed camped in there were the horses the first ray of dawn was just peeping over the low downs to the east but elspeth was pulling me tother way to the lip of the hollow pointing look harry yonder who are those people i stared back rubbing the sleep out of my eyes the distant mountains were in a wall of mist and on the rolling land between there were long trails of fog hanging on the slopes nothing else no there was movement on the crest a mile behind us figures of men coming into plain view a dozen twenty perhaps in an irregular line abreast i felt an awful clutch at my heart as i stared disbelieving what i saw for they were advancing at a slow trot in an ominously disciplined fashion i recognized that gait even as i took in the first twinkle of steel along the line and made out the white streaks of the bandoliers id taught em how to advance in skirmishing order myself hadnt i but it was impossible it cant be i heard my voice cracking theyre hova guardsmen if any confirmation were needed it came in the faint wailing yell drifting on the dawn air as they came jogging down the slope to the plain i thought i had better rouse you harry elspeth was saying but by then i was leaping for the horses yelling to her to get aboard she was still babbling questions as i bundled her up bareback and flung myself on to a second mount i slashed at the three other beasts remaining to us and as they fled neighing from the hollow i spared another wild glance back threequarters of a mile away the skirmishing line was coming steadily towards us cutting the distance at frightening speed god how had they done it on foot in the time where had they come from for that matter interesting questions to which i still dont know the answer and they didnt occupy me above a split second just then in the nick of time i stifled my cowards instinct to gallop wildly away from them and surveyed the ground ahead of us two perhaps three miles due east across rolling sandy plain was the crest from which i was pretty sure wed look down on the shore there was the tamitave track a mile or so to our right with a few villagers already on it i struggled to clear my wits if we rode straight ahead we ought to come out just above the tamitave fort north of the town proper the frigate would be lying in the roads christ how were we going to reach her for thered be no time to stop and scheme with these devils on our heels i looked again they were well out on the plain by now and coming on fast i gripped elspeths wrist follow me close ride steady watch your footing and for gods sake dont slip they cant catch us if we keep up a round canter but if we tumble were done she was pale as a sheet but she nodded and for once didnt ask me who these strange gentlemen were or what they wanted or if her hair was disarranged i wheeled and set off down the slope with her close behind and the yell as they saw us turn was clear enough now a savage hunting cry that had me digging in my heels despite myself we drummed down the hill and i forced myself not to look back until wed crossed the little valley and come to the next crest wed gained on them but they were still coming and i gulped and gestured furiously to elspeth to keep up id have to count up all the battles ive been in to tell you how often ive fled in panic and ive made a few other strategic withdrawals too but this was as horrid as any there was the time scud east and i went tearing along the arrow of arabat in a sled with the cossacks behind us and the jolly little jaunt i had with colonel sebastian moran in the ammunition cart after isandhlwana with the udloko zulus on our tail and couldnt they cover the ground just but in the present case the snag was that very shortly we were going to reach the sea and unless our embarkation went smoothly god the frigate must be there i stole another look over my shoulder we were a clear mile ahead now surely but there they were still just appearing on a crest and streaming over it in fine style i took a look at our horses they werent labouring but they werent fit to enter the st leger either would they last suppose one went lame why the blazes hadnt i thought to drive the spare beasts ahead but it was too late now come on says i and elspeth gave me a trembling look and kicked in her heels clinging to the mane the last slope was half a mile ahead as we dropped our pace for the ascent i looked back again but there was nothing in sight for a good mile well do it yet i shouted and we covered the last few yards to the top through slippery sand the sun blazed in our eyes as we reached the crest the breeze was suddenly stiff in our faces and there below us down a long sandy slope was the spreading panorama of beach and blue water with the surf foaming not a mile away far off to the right was tamitave town the smoke rising in thin trails above the thatched roofs closer but still to the right was the fort a massive circular stone tower with its flag aflutter and its outer wooden palisade there were whitecoated troops about a platoon strong marching towards it from the town and looking down from our point of vantage i could see great activity in the central square of the fort itself and round the gun emplacements on its wall the sun was shining straight towards us out of a blue cloudless sky the rays coming over a thick bank of mist which mantled the surface of the sea a mile offshore a beautiful sight the coral strand with its palms the gulls wheeling the gentle roll of bright blue sea there was only one thing missing from golden beach to pearly bank of mist from pale clear distance in the north to the vague smokiness of the town waterfront to the south the sea was as bare as a misers table there was no british frigate in tamitave roads there wasnt even a blasted bumboat and behind us as i turned my frantic gaze in their direction the hovas were just coming in sight on the hillside a scant mile away i cant recall whether i screamed aloud or not i may well have done but if i did it was a poor expression of the sick despair that engulfed me in that moment i know the thought that was in my mind as i pounded my knee with my fist in an anguish of rage fear and disappointment was but it must be there it has to wait for her message and then elspeth was turning solemn blue eyes on me and asking but harry where is the ship you said it would be here and then putting two and two together i suppose she added whatever shall we do now it was a question which had occurred to me as i stared palsied from the empty sea in front to our pursuers behind they had halted on the far crest which was an irony if you like they could crawl on their bellies towards us now for all it mattered we were trapped helpless with nothing to do but wait until they came up with us at their leisure to seize and drag us back to the abominable fate that would be waiting for us in antan i could picture those snakelike eyes the steaming pits at ambohipotsy the bodies turning in the air from the top of the cliff the bloodcurdling shriek of the mob i realized i was babbling out a flood of oaths as i stared vainly round for an escape which i knew wasnt there elspeth was clutching my hand whitefaced and then because it was the only way to go i was urging her down the slope to our left towards a long grove of palms which began about two furlongs from the fort and ran away into the distance along the coastline northwards thats one thing about a sound cowardly instinct it turns you directly to cover however poor and useless it may be theyd find us there in no time but if we could reach the trees undetected from the fort we might at least be able to flee north to what there was nothing for us yonder except blind flight until we dropped from exhaustion or our horses foundered or those black hounds came up with us and i knew it but it was better than stopping where we were to be run down like sheep oh harry elspeth was wailing in my rear as we thundered down the slope but i didnt check another minute would have us in the shelter of the grove if no one in the fort saw us first crouched over my beasts neck i stole a look down towards the stone battlements at the foot of the hill elspeths voice behind me rose in a sudden scream i whirled in my seat and to my amazement saw that she was hauling in her mount by the mane i yelled to her to ride cursing her for an idiot but she was pointing seaward crying out and i wrestled my brute to a slithering halt staring where she pointed and dyou know i couldnt blame her out in the roads something was moving in that rolling bank of mist at first it was just a shadow towering in the downy radiance of the fog then a long black spar was jutting out and behind it masts and rigging were taking shape in disbelief i heard the faint unmistakable squeal of sheaves as she came into view a tall slim ship under topsails drifting slowly out of the mist turning before my eyes showing her broad whitestriped side her ports were up there were guns out men moving on the decks and from her mizzen trailed a flag blue white red dear god she was a frog warship and there to her right another shadow was breaking clear another ship turning as the first had done another frenchie guns colours and all elspeth was beside me i was hugging her almost out of her seat as we watched them spellbound our flight the fort pursuit all forgotten she yelped in my ear as a third shadow loomed up in the wake of the ships and this time it was the real thing no error and i found myself choking tears of joy for that was the dear old union jack at the truck of the frigate which came gliding out on to the blue water i was shouting god knows what and elsepth was clapping her hands and then a gun boomed suddenly from the fort only a few hundred yards away and a white plume of smoke billowed up from the battlements the three ships were standing in towards the fort the leading frog tacked with a cracking of canvas and suddenly its whole side exploded in a thunder of flame and smoke there was a series of tremendous crashes from the fort as the broadsides struck home and here came her two consorts each in turn letting fly while sea and sky echoed to the roar of their cannonade a mighty pall of grey smoke eddying around them as they put about and came running in again it was a badlyaimed shot screaming overhead that reminded me we were in the direct line of fire i yelled to elspeth and we careered down to the trees crashing into the thickets and sliding from our mounts to stare at the extraordinary scene being played out in the bay harry why are they shooting do you suppose they are come to rescue us she was clutching my hand all agog will they know we are here should we not wave or light a fire or some such thing will you not call to them my love this with forty guns blazing away not a quarter of a mile off for the fort was firing back as well the leading frog was almost at pointblank range clouds of dust and smoke surged up from the fort wall the frog seemed to stagger in the water and elspeth shrieked as his foretop sagged and then fell slowly into the smoke with a wreckage of sail and cordage in came the second ship letting off her broadside any old how in lubberly garliceating fashion and the fort thumped her handsomely in reply serve her right my god thinks i are the crapauds going to be beat for the second frog lost her mizzen top and sheered away blind with the spars littering her poop and then in came the british frigate and while i aint got much use for our navy people as a rule ill allow that she showed up well in front of the foreigners for she ran in steady and silent biding her time while the fort hammered at her and the splinters flew from her bulwarks through the clear air we could see every detail the leadsman in the chains swinging away the whiteshirted tars on her decks the bluecoated officers on the quarterdeck even a little midshipman in the rigging with his telescope trained on the fort silently she bore in until i was sure she must run aground and then a voice called from the poop there was a rush of men and a flapping of canvas she wore round and every gun crashed out as one in a deafening inferno of sound the wave of the broadside hit us in a blast of air the fort battlements seemed to vanish in smoke and dust and flying fragments but when all cleared there the fort still stood and her guns banging irregularly in reply the frigate was tacking away neatly but neither she nor the injured frogs looked like coming in again the appalling thought struck me that they might be sheering off and i couldnt restrain myself at such cowardly behaviour come back you sons of bitches i roared fairly dancing up and down damnation theyre only a parcel of niggers lay into them rot you its what youre paid for but see harry squeaks elspeth pointing look my love they are coming see the boats sure enough there were longboats creeping out from behind the frogs and another from the british ship as the three vessels stood to again firing at the fort the smaller boats came heading in for the shore packed with men they were going to storm the fort under the covering guns of the squadron i found i was dancing and blaspheming with excitement for this must be our chance we must run to them when they got ashore i ploughed back through the fronds staring at the hill behind to see how our hova friends were doing and there they were dropping down from the crest beind us making for the landward side of the fort they were running any old how but an underofficer was shouting in the rear and it seemed to me he was pointing towards our grove yes some of the hovas were checking he was sending them in our direction damn the black villain didnt he know where his duty lay with foreign vessels attacking his by island what shall we do harry elspeth was at my elbow should we not hasten to the beach it may be dangerous to linger she aint quite the fool she looks you know but fortunately neither am i the boats were into the surf only a moment from the shore the temptation to run towards them was almost more than a respectable poltroon could bear but if we broke cover too soon with three hundred yards of naked sand between us and the spot where the nearest frog boat would touch wed be within easy musketshot from the fort to our right we must lie up in the grove until the landingparty had got up the beach and rushed the fort that would keep the black musketeers busy and it would be safe to race for the boats waving a white flag i was tearing away at elspeths petticoat hushing her squeals of protest peering back through the undergrowth at the approaching hovas there were three of em trotting towards the grove with their officer far behind waving them on the leading one was almost into the trees looking stupid turning to seek instructions from his fellows then the flat brutal face turned in our direction and he began to pick his way into the grove his spear balanced his face turning this way and that i hissed to elspeth and drew her towards the seaward side of the grove under a thicket listening for everything at once the steady boom and crash of gunfire the faint shouts from the fort walls the slow crunch of the hovas feet on the floor of the grove he seemed to be moving away north behind us and then elspeth put her lips to my ear and whispered oh harry do not move i pray there is another of those natives quite close i turned my head and almost gave birth on the other side of our thicket visible through the fronds was a black shape not ten yards away and at that moment the first hova gave a startled yell there was a frantic neighing jesus id forgotten our horses and the brute must have walked into them the black shape through the thicket began to run away from us mercifully a crackle of musketry sounded from the beach and i remembered my dear little womans timely suggestion and decided we should linger no longer run i hissed and we broke out of the trees and went haring for the shore there was a shout from behind a whisp in the air overhead and a spear went skidding along the soft sand before us elspeth shrieked we raced on the boats were being beached and already armed men were charging towards the fort frog sailors in striped jerseys with a little chap ahead waving a sabre and making pronouncements about la gloire no doubt as the grape from the walls kicked up the sand among him and his party help i roared stumbling and waving elspeths shift were friends halloo mes amis nous sommes anglais pour lamour de dieu dont shoot vive la france they didnt pay us the slightest heed being engaged by that time in hacking a way through the forts outer wooden palisade we stumbled out of the soft sand to firmer going making for the boats all of which were beached just above the surf i looked back but the hovas were nowhere to be seen clever lads i pushed elspeth and we veered away to be out of shot from the fort the beach ahead was alive with running figures by now french and british storming ahead and cheering there was the dooce of a dogfight going on at the outer palisade white and striped jerseys on one side black skins on tother cutlasses and spears flashing musketry crackling from the inner fort and being answered from our people farther down the beach then there were sounds of british cheering and cries of excited frogs and through the smoke i could see they were up to the inner wall clambering up on each others shoulders popping away with pistols obviously racing to see which should be up first french or british good luck to you my lads thinks i for im tired at the same moment elspeth cries oh harry harry darling harry and clung to me do you think she whispered faintly that we might sit down now with that she went into a dead swoon and we sank to the wet sand in each others arms between the boats and the landing party i was too tuckered and dizzy to do anything except sit there holding her while the battle raged at the top of the beach and i thought by jove were clear at last and soon ill be able to sleep you sir cries a voice yes you what are you about sir great scott is that a woman you have there a party of british sailors carrying empty stretchers were racing across our front to the fort and with them this redfaced chap with a gold strip on his coat whod checked to pop his eyes at us he was waving a sword and pistol i yelled to him above the din of firing that we were escaped prisoners of the malagassies but he only went redder than ever whats that you say youre not with the landing party then get off the beach sir get off this minute youve no business here this is a naval operation whats that bosun im coming blast you on you men he scampered off brandishing his weapons but i didnt care i knew i was too done to carry elspeth down to the boats a hundred yards off but we were out of effective musket shot of the fort so i was content to sit and wait until someone should have time to attend to us they were all busy enough at the moment in all conscience the ground before the palisade was littered with dead and crawling wounded and through the breaches theyd broken i could see them spiking the guns while the scaling parties were still trying to get up the thirtyfoot wall behind they had ladders crowded with tars and matelots their steel flashing in the smoke at the top of the wall where the defenders were slashing and firing away above the crashing musketry there was a sudden cheer the big blackandwhite malagassy flag on the fort wall was toppling down on its broken staff but a malagassy on the battlements caught it as it fell the fighting boiled around him but at that moment a returning stretcher party charged across my line of vision bearing stricken men back to the boats so i didnt see what happened to him still no one paid any mind to elspeth and me we were slightly out of the main traffic up and down the beach and although one party of frog sailors stopped to stare curiously at us they were soon chivvied away by a bawling officer i tried to raise her but she was still slumped unconscious against my breast and i was labouring away when i saw that the landing party were beginning to fall back from the fort the walking wounded came hobbling first supported by their mates and then the main parties all jumbled up together british and french with the petty officers swearing and bawling orders as the men tried to find their right divisions they were squabbling and jostling in great disorder the british tars cursing the frogs and the frogs grimacing and gesticulating back i called out for assistance but it was like talking in a madhouse and then over all the trampling and babble the distant guns from the ships began to boom again and shot whistled overhead to crash into the fort for our rearguard was clear now skirmishing away in goodish order exchanging musket fire with the battlements which theyd failed to overcome all they seemed to have captured was the malagassy flag in among the retiring skirmishers with the enemy shot peppering them a disorderly mob of french and english seamen were absolutely at blows with each other for possession of the confounded thing with cries of ah voleurs and belay you sod the frogs kicking and the britons lashing out with their fists while two of their officers tried to part them finally the english officer a great lanky fellow with his trouser leg half torn off and a bloody bandage round his knee succeeded in wrenching the banner away but the frog officer who was about four feet tall grabbed an end of it and they came stumbling down in my direction yelling at each other in their respective lingoes with their crews joining in you shall not have it cries the frog render it to me monsieur this instant sheer off you greasy halfpint roars john bull you take your paw away directly or youll get what for sacred english thief it fell to my men i tell you it is a prize of france will you leave off you frogeating ape damme if you and your cowardly jackanapes had fought as hard as you squeal wed have had that fort by now let go dye hear ah you resist me do you cries the frog who came about up to the englishmans elbow it is sufficient this release it this flag or i shall pistol you give over rot you they were almost on top of us by now the sturdy saxon holding the flag above his head and the tiny frog clinging to it and hacking at his shins ill cast anchor in you you prancing swab if good god thats a woman his jaw dropped as he caught sight of me at his feet with elspeth in my arms he stared speechless oblivious of the frenchman who was now drumming at his chest with tiny fists eyes tight shut if youve a moment says i id be obliged if youd assist my wife to your boats were british and weve escaped from captivity in the interior i had to repeat it before he took it in with a variety of oaths while the frog who had stopped drumming glared suspiciously what does he say then cries he does he conspire the rascal ah but i shall have the flag death of the devil what is this a woman beneath our feet then i explained to him in french and he goggled and removed his hat a lady an english lady incredible but a lady so beautiful by example and in a condition of swoon ah but the poor little medecinmajor narcejac medecinmajor narcejac come quickly and do you sir be calm he was fairly dancing in agitation attend you others and guard madame they were all crowding round gaping and while a frog sawbones knelt beside elspeth whose eyelids were fluttering a couple of tars helped me up and the english officer demanding to know who i was i told him and he said not flashman of afghanistan surely and i said the very same and he said well he was damned and he was kennedy second of the frigate conway and proud to meet me during this the little frog officer was hopping excitedly informing me that he was lieutenant boudancourt of the zelee that madame would receive every comfort and sal volatile that the entire french marine was at her service name of a name and he boudancourt who spoke would personally supervise her tranquil removal without delay avast there crapaud roars kennedy whats he saying jenkins russell the ladys british an shell come in a british boat by god can you walk marm elspeth supported by the frog doctor was still so faint either from fatigue or all this male attention that she could only gesture limply and boudancourt squawked his indignation at kennedy do not raise the voice above the half if you please ah but see you have returned madame to a decline shut your trap cries kennedy and then to a seaman who was tugging at his sleeve what the hell is it now beggin your pardon sir mister heseltines compliments an the blacks is makin a sally looks like sir he was pointing up the beach sure enough black figures in white loincloths were emerging through the broken palisade braving the shot from the ships and our rearguards musketry some of them were firing towards us there was the alarming swish of bullets overhead hell and damnation cries kennedy frogs women an niggers its too bad mister cliff ill be obliged if youll get those men off the beach cover em sharpshooters russell run to the boat tell mister partridge to load the twopounder with grape and let em have it if they come within range fall back there get off the beach boudancourt was yelling similar instructions to his own people among them the mйdecinmajor and a matelot were helping elspeth down to the nearest boat well go with her you fool cries kennedy to me you know what these bloody frogs are like dont you he was limping along on his injured leg the malagassy flag trailing from his hand little boudancourt snapping at his heels ah but a moment monsieur you forget i think that you still carry that which is the rightful property of madame la republique be pleased to yield me that flag ill be damned if i do villain do you defy me still you shall not leave this shore alive shove off you little squirt i could hear their squabbling above the din as i reached the gunwale of the french boat with men floundering about her kneedeep in water elspeth was being helped to the sternsheets through a jabbering groaning shouting crowd of frenchmen some were standing in the bows firing up the beach others were preparing to shove off there were wounded crying or lying silent against the thwarts a midshipman was yelling shrill orders to the men at the sweeps there was a deafening explosion as the british cutter nearby fired her bowgun the malagassies were streaming out of the fort in numbers now skirmishing down the beach taking potshots theyd be forming up for a charge in a moment and kennedy and boudancourt the last men off the beach were splashing through the shallows tugging at the flag and yelling abuse at each other let go god rot your boots english bully you shall not escape i think of them sometimes when i hear idiot politicians blathering about entente cordiale kennedy shaking his fist boudancourt blue in the face with that dirty useless piece of calico stretched taut between them and im proud to think that in that critical moment with confusion all around and disaster imminent my diplomatic skill asserted itself to save the day for i believe theyd have been there yet if i hadnt snatched a knife from the belt of a matelot beside me and slashed at the flag cursing hysterically it didnt do more than tear it slightly but that was enough the thing parted with a rending sound kennedy swore boudancourt shrieked and we scrambled aboard as the bowchasers roared for the last time and the boats ground over the shingle and wallowed in the surf assassin cries boudancourt brandishing his half pimp roars kennedy from the neighbouring boat that was how we came away from madagascar more than a score of french and british dead it cost that mismanaged lunatic operation but since it saved my life and elspeths by sheer chance youll forgive me if i dont complain all that i could think as i huddled beside her in the stern my head swimming with fatigue and my body one great throbbing ache was by jove were clear mad black queens solomon brooke hovas headhunters chink hatchetmen poison darts boiling pits skull ships tanguin poison theyre all gone and were pulling across blue water my girl and i to a ship thatll take us home pardon monsieur boudancourt beside me was frowning at the piece of sodden flag in his hands can you say says he pointing at the black script on it what these words signify i couldnt read em of course but id learned enough of malagassy heraldry to know what they were that says ranavalona i told him shes the queen of that bloody island and you can thank your stars youll never get closer to her than this i could tell you i was going on but i felt elspeth stir against me and thought no least said soonest mended i glanced at her she was awake all right but she wasnt listening her eyes appeared to be demurely downcast which i couldnt fathom until i noticed that her dress was so torn that her bare legs were uncovered and every libidinous frog face in that boat was leering in her direction and didnt she know it though by george thinks i thats how this whole confounded business started because this simpering slut allowed herself to be ogled by lewd fellows dye mind says i to boudancourt and taking the torn banner from his hand i disposed it decently across her knees scowling at the disgruntled frogs she looked at me all innocent wonder and then smiled and snuggled up to my shoulder why harry sighs she you take such good care of me to be sure it is very tiresome to be parted again so soon from my dear dear h especially after the cruel separation which we have endured and just at a time when we supposed we could enjoy the repose and comfort of each others company in blissful peace at last and in the safety of old england but he the governor at mauritius was quite determined that h must go to india for it seems that there is growing turmoil there among the seekh people and that homeward bound regiments have had to be sent back again and every officer of proved experience is required in case of war so of course my darling being on the active list must be despatched to bombay not without vigorous protest on his part and he even went so far as to threaten to send in his papers and quit the service altogether but this they would not permit at all so i am left lamenting like lord ullins daughter or was it her father i dont perfectly remember which while the husband of my bosom returns to his duty and indeed i hope he takes care with the seekhs who appear to be most disagreeable my only consolation is the knowledge that my dearest would rather far have accompanied me home himself and it was this dear concern and affection for me that caused him to resist so fiercely when they said he must go to india but i could never have him forsake the path of honour which he loves so well for my sake and there really was no reason why he should for i am extremely comfortable and well taken care of aboard the good ship zelee whose commander captain feiseck has been so obliging as to offer me passage to toulon rather than await an indiaman he is most agreeable and attentive with the most polished manners and full of consideration to me as are all his officers especially lieutenants homard and st just and delincourt and ambrйe and dear little boudancourt and even the midshipmen appendix a cricket in the s flashman had a highly personal approach to cricket as to most things but there can be no doubt that through his usual cynicism there shines a genuine love of the game this is not surprising since it is perhaps the subtlest and most refined outdoor sport ever devised riddled with craft and gamesmanship and affording endless scope to a character such as his also he played it well according to his own account and that of thomas hughes who may be relied on since he was not prone to exaggerate anything to flashmans credit indeed if he had not been so fully occupied by military and other pursuits flashman might well have won a place in cricket history as a truly great fast bowler the dismissal of such a trio as felix pilch and mynn argues a talent far above the ordinary how reliable a guide he is to the cricket of his day may be judged from reference to the works listed at the end of this appendix his recollection of lords in its first golden age is precise as are his brief portraits of the giants of his day the huge and formidable mynn the elegant felix and the great allrounder pilch his technical references to the game are sound although he has a tendency to mix the jargon of his playing days with that of sixty years later when he was writing thus he talks not of batsmen but of batters which is correct s usage as are shiver trimmer twister and shooter at the same time he refers indiscriminately to both hand and innings which mean the same thing although the former is long obsolete and he commits one curious lapse of memory by referring to the ropes at lords in in fact boundaries were not introduced until later and in flashmans time all scores had to be run for undoubtedly the most interesting of his cricket recollections is his description of his singlewicket match with solomon this form of the game was popular in his day but later suffered a decline although attempts have been made to revive it recently the rules are to be found in charles boxs the english game of cricket but these varied according to preference there might be any number of players from one to six on either side but if there were fewer than five it was customary to prohibit scoring or dismissals behind the line of the wicket betting on such games was widespread and helped to bring them into disrepute however it should be remembered that the kind of wagering indulged in by flashman solomon and daedalus tighe was common in their time heavy eccentric and occasionally crooked it undoubtedly was but it was part and parcel of a rough and colourful sporting era in which even a clergyman might make a handsome income in cricket sidebets when games could be played by candlelight and enthusiasts still recalled such occasions as the greenwich pensioners match in which spectators thronged to see a team of onelegged men play a side who were onearmed indeed we may echo flashman cricket is not what it was w denisons sketches of the players nicholas wanostrochts felix on the bat and the rev j pycrofts oxford memories appendix b the white raja nowadays when it is fashionable to look only on the dark side of imperialism not much is heard of james brooke he was one of those victorians who gave empirebuilding a good name whose worst faults perhaps were that he loved adventure for its own sake had an unshakeable confidence in the civilizing mission of himself and his race and enjoyed fighting pirates his philosophy being typical of his class and time may not commend itself universally today but an honest examination of what he actually did will discover more to praise than to blame the account of his work which steward gave to flashman is substantially true brooke went to sarawak for adventure and ended as its ruler and saviour he abolished the tyranny under which it was held revived trade drew up a legal code and although virtually without resources and with only a handful of adventurers and reformed headhunters to help him fought his singlehanded war against the pirates of the islands it took him six years to win and considering the savagery and overwhelming numbers of his enemies the organized and traditional nature of the piracy the distances and unknown coasts involved and the small force at his disposal it was a staggering achievement that it was a brutal and bloody struggle we know and it was perhaps inevitable that at the end of it brooke should find himself described by one newspaper as pirate wholesale murderer and assassin and that demands were made in parliament by hume cobden and gladstone for an inquiry into his conduct palmerston equally inevitably defended brooke as a man of unblemished honour and catchick moses and the singapore merchants rallied to his support in the event the inquiry cleared brooke completely which was probably a fair decision his distant critics might think that he had pursued headhunters and searobbers with excessive enthusiasm but the coast villagers who had suffered generations of plundering and slavery took a different view so did the great british public they were not short of heroes to worship in victorias reign but among the gordons livingstones stanleys and the rest james brooke deservedly occupied a unique place he was after all the storybook english adventurer of an old tradition independent fearless upright priggish and cheerfully immodest and just a little touched with the buccaneer it was no wonder that a century of boys novelists should take him as their model which was a great compliment but no greater than that paid to him by the tribesmen of borneo to them one traveller reported he was simply superhuman the pirates of the islands might well have agreed suleiman usman among them brooke ran him to earth at maludu north borneo in august only a few weeks after the flashmans were rescued from madagascar from which it appears that usman having lost elspeth returned to his own waters he was certainly at maludu when the british force under admiral cochrane attacked and destroyed it one report states that usman was wounded believed killed in the action and he does not appear to have been heard of again appendix c queen ranavalona i one of the proudest and most cruel women on the face of the earth and her whole history is a record of blood and deeds of horror thus ida pfeiffer who knew her personally other historians have called her the modern messalina a terrible woman possessed by the lust of power and cruelty female caligula and so forth to m ferry the french foreign minister she was simply lhorrible ranavalo altogether there is a unanimity which with the welldocumented atrocities of her reign justifies the worst that even flashman has to say of her that he has reported his personal acquaintance with her accurately there is no reason to doubt his account of madagascar and its strange customs accords with other sources as do his descriptions of such minutiae as the queens eccentric wardrobe her napoleonic paintings furniture idols placecards at dinner drinking habits and even musical preferences his picture of her fantastically dressed court her midnight party and the public ceremony of the queens bath can be verified in detail as to her behaviour with him it is known that she had lovers possibly even before her husbands death although that admittedly is pure speculation based on a study of the events which brought her to the throne on which flashman touches only briefly king radama her husband had died suddenly at the age of in since they had no children the heir was the kings nephew rakotobe his supporters foreseeing a power struggle concealed the news of the kings death for some days to enable rakotobe to consolidate his claim in the meantime however a young officer named andriamihajas who was ostensibly among rakotobes supporters betrayed the news of the kings death to ranavalona for reasons which are not disclosed she promptly got the leading military men on her side put it about that the idols favoured her claim to the throne and ruthlessly slaughtered all who resisted including the unfortunate rakotobe she rewarded andriamihajas treachery by making him commanderinchief and taking him as her lover he was presently accused of treachery put to the tanguin and executed the next years were a reign of terror religious persecution and genocide on a scale hardly matched until our own times that ranavalona escaped assassination or deposition is testimony to the strength with which she wielded her absolute power and to her capacity for surviving plots how many of these there were we cannot know but none succeeded including the flashman coup of and a later conspiracy in which ida pfeiffer then aged found herself involved to her considerable alarm she describes in her travels how prince rakota showed her the arsenal he intended to use in his revolt and how she then went to bed and had nightmares about the tanguin test since we know that rakota and laborde both survived the plot which flashman describes it seems likely that it simply died stillborn or that the queen for some reason forebore to take vengeance on the conspirators it would be pleasant to think that mr fankanonikaka at least was spared to continue his devoted service to his queen and country notes i since most of the flashman papers were written between and it seems likely that flashman is here referring to the test match series of which australia won by four matches to one and possibly also to the series of summer when the australians retained the ashes it was in this year that an attempt to amend the evercontroversial legbeforewicket rule failed p flashmans behaviour on the football field is memorably described in tom browns schooldays where thomas hughes refers to his late arrival at scrimmages with shouts and great action p flashmans memory is playing him false here but only slightly the socalled rebecca riots did not begin until some months later in when a peculiar secret society known as rebecca and her daughters began a terrorist campaign against high toll charges in south wales they went armed masked and disguised as women and would descend by night on tollhouses and tollgates which they wrecked they apparently took their name from an allusion in genesis xxiv and they blessed rebekah and said let thy seed possess the gate of those which hate them s history of the english people vol iv and punch vol v introduction p this is the earliest mention in any sporting or literary record of the hat trick signifying the feat by a bowler of taking three wickets with successive balls which traditionally entitles him to a new hat the phrase has now of course a wider application outside cricket covering three successive triumphs of any kind a hattrick of goals or election victories for example it is interesting to speculate not only that the phrase had its origin in mynns impulsive gesture to flashman but also that it was first used ironically p lords haddington and stanley were respectively first lord of the admiralty and colonial secretary lord aberdeen was foreign secretary flashman is being malicious in coupling deaf burke and lord brougham as rascals one was a famous prizefighter and the other a prominent whig politican p alice lowe mistress of lord frankfort figured in a notorious court case over gifts he had given her and which he claimed she had stolen nelsons column in trafalgar square then nearing completion was something of a laughingstock punch noted gleefully that the statue of the great sailor closely resembled napoleon the royal hunt cup was first run at ascot in and the bohemian girl opened at drury lane in november of that year p various government reports appeared in the early s on conditions in mines and factories they were horrifying the atrocities referred to in morrisons conversation with solomon may be traced in those reports and in others from the preceding decade as a result lord ashley got a bill through the commons in prohibiting the employment of women or childen below thirteen in the mines although the lords subsequently lowered the age to ten in the publication of the report of the childrens employment commission led to further legislation including a reduction in factory working hours for children and adolescents the second report of the cec and other papers quoted in human documents of the industrial revolution by e royston pike lola montez was flashmans mistress for a brief period in the autumn of until they quarrelled he took revenge by engineering a hostile reception for her when she made her debut as a dancer on the london stage in june following this incident she left england and began that astonishing career as a courtesan which led to her becoming virtual ruler of bavaria an episode in which flashman and otto von bismarck were closely involved from flashmans description of the blufflooking chap in clerical duds with the crippled arm it seems certain that he was richard harris barham author of the ingoldsby legends of which one of the most famous relates how lord tomnoddy accompanied by mfuze and lieutenant tregooze and sir carnaby jenks of the blues attended a newgate execution and revelled the previous night at the magpie and stump overlooking the street where the scaffold was erected however barhams inspiration did not come from the execution which flashman describes he wrote his famous piece of gallows humour some years earlier but may well have attended later executions out of interest thackerays presence is interesting since it suggests that he had got over the revulsion he felt at courvoisiers hanging three years earlier when he could not bear to watch the final moment and criminal prisons of london mr tighes bet was that flashman would carry his bat a curious wager perhaps but not extraordinary in an age when sportsmen were prepared to bet on virtually anything the regency practice among noblemen of patronizing prizefighters and using them as bodyguards and musclemen had not quite died out in flashmans youth so his fears of the dukes vengeance were probably wellfounded especially in view of the names mentioned by judy ben caunt popularly known as big ben was a notoriously rough heavyweight champion of the s and the other tighter referred to can only have been tom cannon the great gun of windsor who had held the title in the s the first sale of australian horses imported into singapore by boyd and company did not in fact take place until august these were the first of the famous cavalry walers of the indian army not quite so ancient and shrivelled nowadays perhaps flashman writing in the pax britannica of the edwardian years could not foresee a time when the tribes of north borneo would resume the practice of headhunting which british rule discouraged the editor has seen rows of comparatively recent heads in a headhouse up the rajang river the locals admitted that most of them were orang japon taken from the japanese invaders of the second world war but some of them looked new enough to have belonged to the indonesian tribesmen who at that time were fighting the britishmalay forces in the communist rebellion frank marryat son of the novelist captain marryat served as a naval officer in far eastern waters in the s and confirmed flashmans opinion of the dullness and prudishness of singapore society little hospitality less gaiety everyone waiting to see what his position in society is going to be his description of the city its people customs and institutions tallies closely with flashmans by f s marryat and for a wealth of detail an anecdotal history of old times in singapore by c b buckley catchick moses the armenian and whampoa the chinese were two of the great characters of early singapore catchick was famous not only as a merchant but as a billiards player and for his eccentric habit of shaving lefthanded without a glass as he walked about his verandah he was about when flashman knew him when he made his will at the age of seven years before his death he followed the unusual procedure of submitting it to his children so that any disputes could be settled amicably during his lifetime whampoa was the richest of the chinese community renowned for the lavishness of his parties and for his luxurious country home with its goldframed oval doors his appearance was as flashman describes it down to his black silk robe pigtail and sherry glass as flashman later admits the name of james brooke white raja of sarawak and adventurer extraordinary meant nothing to him on first hearing which is not surprising since the fame of this remarkable victorian had not yet reached its peak but flashman was plainly impressed despite himself by his rescuers personality and appearance and his description tallies exactly with brookes famous portrait in the national portrait gallery which catches all his resolution and restless energy as well as that romantic air which made him the beau ideal of the early victorian hero the painting could serve as the frontispiece for any boys adventure story of the nineteenth century and sometimes did all that is missing is the facewound which flashman mentions brooke had received it in a fight with sumatran pirates at murdu on february so it would still be incompletely healed when they met p if it seems unlikely that even an emotional victorian can have spoken such purple prose we can be certain that brooke at least wrote it almost word for word in his journal about this time he recorded his emotions on hearing that a european lady was held prisoner by borneo pirates who were demanding ransom a captive damsel does it not conjure up images of blue eyes and auburn hair of hyacinthine flow and after all a fat old dutch frau may be the reality poor creature even though she be old and fat and unamiable and ugly it is shocking to think of such a fate as a life passed among savages obviously he cannot have had mrs flashman in mind p henry keppel was one of the foremost fighting seamen of the victorian period an expert in the specialized craft of river warfare he was known to the dyaks as the redhaired devil and served with brooke in numerous raids against the pirates of the south china sea he later became admiral of the fleet stuarts enthusiastic description of brooke and his adventures is perfectly accurate so far as it goes the only error at this point is a minor one of flashmans for stuarts name was in fact george steward obviously flashman has again made a mistake of which he is occasionally guilty in his memoirs of trusting his ears and not troubling to check the spelling of proper names angela georgina burdettcoutts the richest heiress in all england enjoyed a fame second only to queen victoria she spent her life and the vast fortune inherited from her grandfather thomas coutts the banker on countless charities and good causes endowing schools housing schemes and hospitals and providing funds for such diverse projects as irish famine relief university scholarships drinking troughs and colonial exploration livingstone stanley and brooke were among the pioneers she assisted she was the first woman to be raised to the peerage for public service and numbered among her friends wellington faraday disraeli gladstone daniel webster and dickens who dedicated martin chuzzlewit to her the combination of her good looks charm and immense wealth attracted innumerable suitors but she seems to have felt no inclination to matrimony until she met brooke and fell madly in love with him there is a tradition that she proposed to him and was politely rejected but they remained close friends and she is said to have been instrumental in obtaining official recognition for sarawak she eventually married in her sixties the americanborn william ashmeadbartlett she is buried in westminster abbey flashmans memory has again betrayed him on one small point he may have known miss coutts but not at stratton street she did not take up residence there until the late s the truth about brookes burmese wound is far from clear all that can be said with certainty is that he received it during his service in the bengal army in the assam campaign when he commanded a native cavalry unit and was shot while charging a stockade both his principal biographers gertrude jacob and spenser st john say that he was hit in the lung according to miss jacob the bullet was not extracted until more than a year later when it was kept in a glass case by brookes mother on the other hand owen rutter cites john dill ross whose father knew brooke well as the authority for the story that the wound was in the genitals if this is true it is certainly consistent with brookes reputed refusal of miss burdettcoutts and with the fact that he never married it is possible of course that jacob and st john were unaware of the true nature of brookes injury or that they were simply being tactful remarks occur in their biographies which are capable of varying interpretations st john for example says that in convalescing from the wound brooke was absorbed in melancholy thoughts and often longed to be at rest but that is not necessarily significant any young man with a wound that had put paid to his military career might well be gloomy again both jacob and st john refer to brooke being in love and briefly engaged after he had been wounded and st john adds that he from that time seems to have withdrawn from female blandishments it would be dangerous to draw conclusions from such conflicting evidence or from what is known of brookes character and behaviour flashman naturally would be ready to believe the worst whatever flashmans opinion of brooke he has been an honest reporter of the white rajas background and conversation the picture of the grovethe furnishings and routine the formal dinners the reception of petitioners even his interest in gardening his pleasure in comfortable armchairs and home newspapers and his eccentric habit of playing leapfrog is confirmed by other sources much more important virtually all the opinions which he expressed in flashmans presence throughout this narrative are to be found elsewhere in brookes own writings his views on native peoples piracy borneos future missionaries colonial development religion and ethics honours and decorations personal ambitions and private tastes all the philosophy of this remarkable man in fact is contained at length in his journals and letters and his conversation as reported by flashman reflects it accurately often in identical words even the style of his talk seems to have been like his writing brisk assertive eager and highly opinionated brooke had written these very words in his journal only a few days before charles johnson was brookes nephew and became the second white raja on his uncles death in he took the name brooke as his surname reigned for almost years extended sarawaks boundaries and earned a high reputation as a fighting man and just ruler despite his background he was an unusually clearsighted colonialist who predicted at the beginning of this century the end of empire and the ascendancy of new eastern powers in the shape of china and russia w e gladstone was one of several liberal politicians who pressed for charges to be brought against brooke on the ground that his actions against the borneo pirates were cruel illegal and excessive st john comments bluntly james brookes sympathies were with the victims gladstones with the pirates an excellent description of a seagoing pirate prau these vessels up to feet long heavily armed with cannon and carrying hundreds of fighting men were the scourge of the east indies until well into the nineteenth century cruising sometimes in fleets of hundreds from the great pirate nests of the philippines and north borneo they preyed on shipping and coast towns alike in search of slaves and plunder and set the small naval forces of britain and holland at defiance while piracy was universal in the islands the principal fraternities were the balagnini subsidized by the borneo princes in return for slaves and treasure the wandering maluku from halmahera in the moluccas the sea dyaks of the seribas and skrang rivers who specialized in headtaking and most feared of all the lanun or illanun rovers the pirates of the lagoon from mindanao whose praus could cruise for three years at a time and who operated the great slave market on sulu island although most of the pirate leaders were islanders some of them like flashmans friend sahib suleiman usman were arab halfbreeds usman was held to be especially detestable because he did not scruple to sell fellowarabs into slavery but he was extremely powerful as head of a strong confederacy of north borneo pirates and also through his marriage to the sultan of sulus daughter jersey can surely only refer to new jersey where the fiveshot muzzleloading revolver known as the colt paterson was produced between and some of these pistols had barrels a foot long flashman is definitely mistaken if any pirates were executed at linga and there is no supporting evidence although the methods of execution which flashman describes here were common among the dyaks makota could not have been among them since he was with the pirates at patusan on the following day the storming of patusan where five pirate forts were burned took place on august if flashmans account does not give prominence to the part played by wade and keppel or to the outstanding bravery of the loyal dyaks and malays it is understandable riverfighting was more confused than most and he was obviously fully occupied by his own share of it on some details he is exact seaman ellis was killed in the folly bachelor while loading the bow gun for example and other accounts also refer to the plundering of sharif sahibs headquarters and to the fact that his harem escaped unscathed from the battle plainly the other reporters did not consult flashman on this last point or if they did he was prudently reticent the fort of sharif muller was taken on august and a great force of pirate praus destroyed the death of lt wade and mullers escape took place as flashman describes the battle of the pyramids fought on july was one of napoleons most complete victories he beat and captured an egyptianturkish army more than strong under the circassian murad bey st john tells us that one of brookes people had taken part in the battle on the turkish side but refers to him merely as an old malay flashman is the only source for the suggestion that this anonymous veteran was paitingi ali it is possible assuming that paitingi was in his s at the time flashman knew him like flashman other participants in the battle on skrang river thought it the most hectic and bloody of all the encounters fought by brookes force in their passage up the batang lupar six hundred pirates in six praus attacked paitingis spyboat overwhelming its crew of seventeen keppels account quoted by flashman testifies to the viciousness of the fighting in the waterway choked by a mass of foundering craft and bodies which broke in two as it floated downstream enabling brooke and keppel to drive their gig through the gap followed by a rocketfiring boat in addition to paitingis crew the expedition lost other dead with wounded in the battle although flashman was in no position to appreciate it this action marked the end of the batang lupar operation with the stream too heavy against them brookes fleet returned to patusan having effectively destroyed or dispersed the pirates along the river in the fortnights campaign much of the credit for this undoubtedly belonged to keppel whose role in the leadership flashman tends to underrate otherwise his account of the expedition is on the whole accurate and fair although it is as usual a highly individual view and while he is reliable on dates names of people places and vessels and the broad conduct of operations there is no way of verifying his more personal recollections he seems to have magnified the action at fort linga but there is no reason to suppose that the gruesome picture which he paints of borneo riverfighting or of conditions along the pirate coast is in any way exaggerated so hostile to foreigners was madagascar that comparatively few written authorities exist for the first half of the last century and those named by flashman are the principal ones in english they bear out virtually every detail which he gives about that astonishing island and its appalling ruler ranavalona i james hastie was a soldier not a missionary he was tutor to two malagassy princes and british agent on the island at a time when europeans were still tolerated there his journal is in the public record office w elliss three visits to madagascar madagascar revisited and the martyr church of madagascar are invaluable sources for queen ranavalonas reign and the island background and people as is s p olivers madagascar see also h w littles madagascar j sibrees the great african island and l mcleods madagascar and its people but none compares with the indomitable and entertaining ida pfeiffer that great tourist whose last travels contains a wealth of informative detail recorded at first hand curiously enough this barbarous custom was abolished by queen ranavalona it was said to be her only humane act flashmans is possibly the only eyewitness account of the fearful cruelties and varied means of execution practised in madagascar at this time but the other authorities quote evidence in detail to support him and there can be no doubt that such atrocities as he describes took place and were part of the queens policy ida pfeiffer having confirmed flashmans figures of tens of thousands dying annually from execution massacre and forced labour sums up if this womans rule lasts much longer madagascar will be depopulated blood and always blood is the maxim of queen ranavalona and every day seems lost to this wicked woman on which she cannot sign at least half a dozen deathwarrants flashmans estimate of laborde was sound the frenchman was a tough and resourceful soldier of fortune who in his time had been a cavalry trooper steam engineer in bombay and a slavetrader he was shipwrecked in madagascar in enslaved bought by the queen and became a favourite subsequently he was liberated and married a malagassy girl but he was still kept in madagascar where he served the queen as engineer and cannonmaker he became an influential figure at court and was active in promoting french interest the few europeans who met queen ranavalona face to face and lived to write impressions of her confirm what flashman says of her appearance although most of them saw her much later in her reign than he did ellis giving a description which is very close to flashmans adds that the whole head and face is small compact and well proportioned her expression agreeable although at times indicating great firmness ida pfeiffer who apparently did not see her close to noted that she was of strong and sturdy build rather dark both she and mr ellis seem to have thought the queen rather older than she probably was there is no reliable evidence of her birthdate and although the nouvelle biographic generale says about which would make her when flashman met her it seems more likely that she was in her early fifties flashmans virtuosity on the keyboard was either highly eccentric or less memorable than he imagined for years later when ida pfeiffer was invited to play the palace piano she understood ranavalona to say that she had never seen anyone play with their hands mme pfeiffer found the piano sadly out of tune despite her suspicion of europeans and their ways the queen did in fact employ an englisheducated secretary these peculiar divinationboards were known as sikidy according to sibree there were three of them one of four squares by sixteen a second four by four and a third four by eight an unflattering description of prince rakota although not unlike his portrait which survives oliver described him as being like a greek god with dark curls and light gold skin but agrees with flashmans estimate of his character and confirms that he was a moderating influence on his mother flashman is the only survivor of the tanguin or tangena ordeal to have written of the experience his account varies from other descriptions only on minor points it was customary when time was available to starve the patient for hours before the scraped stone of the tanguin fruit was administered and some historians say that in order to pass the test the pieces of chicken skin had to be regurgitated in a particular direction the deposit of dollars was normally put up by the accuser of the person undergoing the test if the accused failed the test the accuser got his money back but if he passed the accuser recovered only onethird of the deposit the other thirds going to the accused and the queen as a result of its separate evolution the plant and animal life of madagascar is unique and it has been estimated that ninety per cent of its living things exist nowhere else on earth among its more celebrated fabulous monsters was the giant roc bird which carried off sinbad the apes which flashman saw were probably sifakas a type of lemur capable of prodigious jumps it was flashmans good fortune to arrive at tamitave on the very morning when three european warships the french berceau and zelee and the british frigate conway made a concerted attack on the fort and town the punitive expedition was in retaliation for ranavalonas illtreatment of europeans she had recently decreed that those trading with the island were liable to malagassy law there had been fatal incidents between british ships and malagassy troops and a british shipmaster of american origin jacob heppick had been enslaved after his barque the marie laure was shipwrecked captain kelly of the conway was sent to tamitave to demand redress early in june and when this was not forthcoming the anglofrench bombardment followed a few days later see oliver the memorial of jacob heppick mariner to the governor of mauritius and the annual register the unsuccessful storming of tamitave fort by landing parties from the anglofrench squadron took place as flashman says the outer palisade was carried under a hail of grapeshot and musketry the battery overrun and guns spiked but the attackers failed to carry the main fort and retired after a brisk fight the british lost four dead and wounded and the french dead and wounded both the zelee and berceau lost topmasts in the gunbattle with the fort the incident of the flag is true although not all the details are clear it appears that it was shot away from the outer wall and caught by a malagassy soldier who put it on a spear it fell again and was captured by a british midshipman and two sailors there was a tussle for it between french and british under malagassy fire and the matter was only resolved when someone the annual register says lt kennedy but doubtless flashman knows best cut it in two the french received the half bearing the legend ranavalona and the british the piece inscribed manjaka most of tamitave town was burned during the attack after a long period of political unrest and violence in the punjab the sikhs finally invaded britishcontrolled territory in december and the first sikh war began
