 the golden doom by lord dunsany persons the king chamberlain chief prophet girl boy spies first prophet second prophet first sentry second sentry stranger attendants scene outside the kings great door in zericon time some while before the fall of babylon two sentries pace to and fro then halt one on each side of the great door first sentry the day is deadly sultry second sentry i would that i were swimming down the gyshon on the cool side under the fruit trees first sentry it is like to thunder or the fall of a dynasty second sentry it will grow cool by nightfall where is the king first sentry he rows in his golden barge with ambassadors or whispers with captains concerning future wars the stars spare him second sentry why do you say the stars spare him first sentry because if a doom from the stars fall suddenly on a king it swallows up his people and all things round about him and his palace falls and the walls of his city and citadel and the apes come in from the woods and the large beasts from the desert so that you would not say that a king had been there at all second sentry but why should a doom from the stars fall on the king first sentry because he seldom placates them second sentry ah i have heard that said of him first sentry who are the stars that a man should scorn them should they that rule the thunder the plague and the earthquake withhold these things save for much prayer always ambassadors are with the king and his commanders come in from distant lands prefects of cities and makers of the laws but never the priests of the stars second sentry hark was that thunder first sentry believe me the stars are angry enter a stranger he wanders towards the kings door gazing about him sentries go back go back stranger why first sentry it is death to touch the kings door stranger i am a stranger from thessaly first sentry it is death even for a stranger stranger your door is strangely sacred first sentry it is death to touch it boy i want to see the king to pray for a hoop boy i cannot open it will it do as well if i pray to the kings door sentry yes quite as well turns to talk to the other sentry is there anyone in sight second sentry nothing but a dog and he far out on the plain first sentry then we can talk awhile and eat bash buy kings door i want a little hoop the sentries take a little bash between finger and thumb from pouches and put that wholly forgotten drug to their lips girl my father is a taller soldier than that boy my father can write he taught me girl ho writing frightens nobody my father is a soldier boy i have a lump of gold i found it in stream that runs down to gyshon girl i have a poem i found it in my own head boy is it a long poem girl no but it would have been only there were no more rhymes for sky boy what is your poem girl i saw a purple bird go up against the sky and it went up and up and round about did fly boy i saw it die girl that does nt scan boy oh that does nt matter girl do you like my poem

with my lump of gold it makes a yellow mark on the iron door girl oh do write it i would like to see it written like real poetry first sentry you see well be fighting again soon second sentry only a little war we never have more than a little war with the hillfolk first sentry when a man goes to fight the curtains of the gods wax thicker than ever before between his eyes and the future he may go to a great or to a little war second sentry there can only be a little war with the hillfolk first sentry yet sometimes the gods laugh second sentry at whom first sentry at kings second sentry why have you grown uneasy about this war in the hills first sentry because the king is powerful beyond any of his fathers and has more fighting men more horses and wealth that could have ransomed his father and his grandfather and dowered their queens and daughters and every year his miners bring him more from the opalmines and from the turquoisequarries he has grown very mighty second sentry then he will the more easily crush the hillfolk in a little war first sentry when kings grow very mighty the stars grow very jealous boy ive written your poem girl oh have you really boy yes ill read it to you i saw a purple bird go up against the sky and it went up and up and round about did fly i saw it die girl it does nt scan boy that does nt matter enter furtively a spy who crosses stage and goes out the sentries cease to talk girl that man frightens me boy he is only one of the kings spies girl but i dont like the kings spies they frighten me boy come on then well run away sentry go away go away the king is coming he will eat you the boy throws a stone at the sentry and runs out enter another spy who notices the door he examines it and utters an owllike whistle no comes back they do not speak both whistle no comes all examine the door enter the king and his chamberlain the king wears a purple robe the sentries smartly transfer their spears to their left hands and return their right arms to their right sides they then lower their spears until their points are within an inch of the ground at the same time raising their right hands above their heads they stand for some moments thus then they lower their right arms to their right sides at the same time raising their spears in the next motion they take their spears into their right hands and lower the butts to the floor where they were before the spears slanting forward a little both sentries must move together precisely first spy runs forward to the king and kneels abasing his forehead to the floor something has written on the iron door chamberlain on the iron door king some fool has done it who has been here since yesterday first sentry shifts his hand a little higher on his spear brings the spear to his side and closes his heels all in one motion he then takes one pace backward with his right foot then he kneels on his right knee when he has done these he speaks but not before nobody majesty but a stranger from thessaly king did he touch the iron door first sentry no majesty he tried to but we drove him away king how near did he come first sentry nearly to our spears majesty king what was his motive in seeking to touch the iron door first sentry i do not know majesty king which way did he go first sentry that way majesty an hour ago the king whispers with one of his spies who stoops and examines the ground and steals away the sentry rises king what does this writing say a spy we cannot read majesty king a good spy should know everything second spy we watch majesty and we search out majesty we read shadows and we read footprints and whispers in secret places but we do not read writing king see what it is chamberlain it is treason majesty king read it chamberlain i saw a purple bird go up against the sky and it went up and up and round about did fly i saw it die first sentry the stars have spoken king has anyone been here but the stranger from thessaly sentry nobody majesty king you saw nothing first sentry nothing but a dog far out upon the plain and the children of the guard at play king and you second sentry nothing majesty chamberlain that is strange king it is some secret warning chamberlain it is treason king it is from the stars chamberlain no no majesty not from the stars not from the stars some man has done it yet the thing should be interpreted shall i send for the prophets of the stars king find me some prophet of the stars i fear that we may go no more my chamberlain along the winding ways of unequalled zericon nor play dahoori with the golden balls i have thought more of my people than of the stars and more of zericon than of windy heaven chamberlain believe me majesty some idle man has written it and passed by your spies shall find him and then his name will be soon forgotten king yes yes perhaps you are right though the sentries saw no one no doubt some beggar did it chamberlain yes majesty some beggar has surely done it but look here come two prophets of the stars they shall tell us that this is idle enter two prophets and a boy attending them all bow deeply to the king the two spies steal in again and stand at back king some beggar has written a rhyme on the iron gate and as the ways of rhyme are known to you i desired you rather as poets than as prophets to say whether there was any meaning in it chamberlain t is but an idle rhyme first prophet bows again and goes up to the door he glances at the writing come hither servant of those that serve the stars first prophet bring hither our golden cloaks for this may be a matter for rejoicing and bring our green cloaks also for this may tell of young new beautiful things with which the stars will one day gladden the king and bring our black cloaks also for it may be a doom exit the boy the prophet goes up to the door and reads solemnly the stars have spoken king i tell you that some beggar has written this first prophet it is written in pure gold he dons the black cloak over body and head king what do the stars mean what warning is it first prophet i cannot say king come you then and tell us what the warning is second prophet the stars have spoken king what is it what does it mean second prophet we do not know but it is from the stars chamberlain it is a harmless thing there is no harm in it majesty why should not birds die king why have the prophets covered themselves in black chamberlain they are a secret people and look for inner meanings there is no harm in it king they have covered themselves in black chamberlain they have not spoken of any evil thing they have not spoken of it king if the people see the prophets covered in black they will say that the stars are against me and believe that my luck has turned chamberlain the people must not know king some prophet must interpret to us the doom let the chief prophet of the stars be sent for chamberlain summon the chief prophet of the stars that look on zericon voices off the chief prophet of the stars the chief prophet of the stars chamberlain i have summoned the chief prophet majesty king if he interpret this aright i will put a necklace of turquoises round his neck with opals from the mines chamberlain he will not fail he is a very cunning interpreter king what if he covers himself with a huge black cloak and does not speak and goes muttering away slowly with bended head till our fear spreads to the sentries and they cry aloud chamberlain this is no doom from the stars but some idle scribe hath written it in his insolence upon the iron door wasting his hoard of gold king not for myself i have a fear of doom not for myself but i have inherited a rocky land windy and illnurtured and nursed it to prosperity by years of peace and spread its boundaries by years of war i have brought up harvests out of barren acres and given good laws unto naughty towns and my people are happy and lo the stars are angry chamberlain it is not the stars it is not the stars majesty for the prophets of the stars have not interpreted it indeed it was some reveller wasting his gold meanwhile enter chief prophet of the stars that look on zericon king chief prophet of the stars that look on zericon i would have you interpret the rhyme upon yonder door chief prophet it is from the stars king interpret it and you shall have great turquoises round your neck with opals from the mines in the frozen mountains chief prophet cloaks himself like the others in a great black cloak who should wear purple in the land but a king or who should go up against the sky but one who has troubled the stars by neglecting their ancient worship such a one has gone up and up increasing in power and wealth such a one has soared above the crowns of those that went before him such a one the stars have doomed the undying ones the illustrious king who wrote it chief prophet it is pure gold some god has written it chamberlain some god first sentry last night i saw a star go flaming earthward king is this a warning or is it a doom chief prophet the stars have spoken king is it then a doom chief prophet they speak not in jest king i have been a great king let it be said of me the stars overthrew him and they sent a god for his doom for i have not met my equal among kings that man should overthrow me and i have not oppressed my people that man should rise up against me chief prophet it is better to give worship to the stars than to do good to man it is better to be humble before the gods than proud in the face of your enemy though he do evil king let the stars hearken yet and i will sacrifice a child to them i will sacrifice a girl child to the twinkling stars and a male child to the stars that blink not the stars of the steadfast eyes to his spies let a boy and a girl be brought for sacrifice will you accept this sacrifice to the god that the stars have sent they say that the gods love children chief prophet i may refuse no sacrifice to the stars nor to the gods whom they send make ready the sacrificial knives king is it fitting that the sacrifice take place by the iron door where the god from the stars has trod or must it be in the temple chief prophet let it be offered by the iron door to the other prophets fetch hither the altar stone the owllike whistle is heard off right the third spy runs crouching toward it exit king will this sacrifice avail to avert the doom chief prophet who knows king i fear that even yet the doom will fall chief prophet it were wise to sacrifice some greater thing king what more can a man offer chief prophet his pride king what pride chief prophet your pride that went up against the sky and troubled the stars king how shall i sacrifice my pride to the stars chief prophet it is upon your pride that the doom will fall and will take away your crown and will take away your kingdom king i will sacrifice my crown and reign uncrowned among you so only i save my kingdom chief prophet if you sacrifice your crown which is your pride and if the stars accept it perhaps the god that they went may avert the doom and you may still reign in your kingdom though humbled and uncrowned king shall i burn my crown with spices and with incense or cast it into the sea chief prophet let it be laid here by the iron door where the god came who wrote the golden doom when he comes again by night to shrivel up the city or to pour an enemy in through the iron door he will see your castoff pride and perhaps accept it and take it away to the neglected stars king go after my spies and say that i make no sacrifice goodbye my brittle glory kings have sought you the stars have envied you chief prophet even now the sun has set who denies the stars and the day is departed wherein no gods walk abroad it is near the hour when spirits roam the earth and all things that go unseen and the faces of the abiding stars will be soon revealed to the fields lay your crown there and let us come away the sentries yes majesty they remain kneeling until after the king has gone king and the chief prophet walk away chief prophet it was your pride let it be forgotten may the stars accept it first sentry the stars have envied him second sentry it is an ancient crown he wore it well first sentry may the stars accept it second sentry if they do not accept it what doom will overtake us first sentry it will suddenly be as though there were never any city of zericon nor two sentries like you and me standing before the door second sentry why how do you know first sentry that is ever the way of the gods second sentry but it is unjust first sentry how should the gods know that second sentry will it happen tonight first sentry come we must march away the stage grows increasingly darker reenter the chamberlain from the right he walks across the stage and goes out to the left reenter spies from the right they cross the stage which is now nearly dark boy enters from the right dressed in white his hands out a little crying kings door kings door i want my little hoop he goes up to the kings door when he sees the kings crown there he utters a satisfied ooh he takes it up puts it on the ground and beating it before him with the sceptre goes out by the way that he entered the great door opens there is light within a furtive spy slips out and sees that the crown is gone another spy slips out their crouching heads come close together first spy the gods have come they run back through the door and the door is closed it opens again and the king and the chamberlain come through king the stars are satisfied
