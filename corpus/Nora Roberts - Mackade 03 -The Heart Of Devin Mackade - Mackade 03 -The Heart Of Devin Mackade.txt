 prologue devin mackade considered the age of twenty to be an awkward time in the life of a man it was old enough for him to be considered responsible for actions and deeds old enough for him to make a living or love a woman yet in the eyes of the law it was not quite old enough for him to be considered fully adult he was glad it would only take twelve months to get through it being the third of four brothers hed already watched jared and rare move beyond him into adulthood and shane was not far behind him it wasnt that he was in a hurry really he was enjoying his time and his life but devin had begun in his methodical way to make plans for what would be the little town of antietam maryland would have been surprised to know that he had decided to uphold the law rather than break it or bend it his mother had pushed him into college true but once he arrived devin had decided to enjoy it the courses in administration of justice criminology sociology fascinated him how rules were made why how they were upheld it had seemed almost from the beginning that those books those words those ideals had just been waiting for him to discover th m so in his thoughtful way he had decided to become a cop it wasnt something he wanted to share with his family just yet his brothers would rag him undoubtedly even jared who was already on his way to becoming a lawyer would show no mercy it wasnt something he minded devin knew he could hold his own with all three of his brothers be it with words or fists but for him it was a personal agenda and he wasnt talking he was aware that not everything you wanted deep ifiside worked out there was proof of that right here in eds cafe where he and his brothers were grabbing a quick meal before heading to duffs tavern to shoot pool yes the proof was right here serving him the blue plate special flushing shyly at rafes easy teasing five foot two barely a hundred pounds as delicate and fragile as a rosebud angel hair like a curling halo around a face that was all quiet gray eyes a nose that tipped up just the tiniest bit at the end the prettiest mouth in the county with its deep dip in the top lip like a dolls small hands that he knew could juggle plates and coffeepots and glasses with a studied competence hands that carried a ring with a chip of a diamond barely big enough to glint on the third finger her name was cassandra connor and it seemed hed loved her forever surely hed known her forever watched her grow up with a flicker of interest that had become a fullblown crush hed considered too embarrassing to act on and that was the problem by the time he decided to act hed been too late joe dolin had already claimed her they would be married in june just two weeks after she graduated from high school and there was nothing he could do about it he made sure not to watch her walk away from their booth his brothers had sharp eyes and he would never be able to tolerate being teased about something as intimate and humiliating as unrequited love so he looked out the window at main street that he thought was something he could do something about one day he would give something back to the town that had been such an intricate and important part of his life one day he would serve and protect here it was his destiny he could feel it the way he sometimes felt in dreams that he had done so before or tried when the town was ravaged by war split and frayed by divided loyalties in dreams he could see it the way it had been the way it was in those old civil war photos stone houses and churches horses and carriages sometimes he could almost hear the men gathering on corners or in the barbershop discussing the war between the states of course he thought with cool rationality the town or parts of it were haunted the old barlow place on the hill just outside of town the woods his own home the fields he helped plow and plant every spring there were echoes there of lives and deaths of hopes and fears a man had only to listen to hear almost as good as moms shane shoveled mashed potatoes into his mouth and the mackade dimple flashed as he grinned almost what do you figure women do on their night out gossip his plate clean rafe leaned back and lit a cigarette what else moms entitled jared commented didnt say she wasnt old lady metz is probably giving her an earful about us right now though rafe grinned wickedly at that thought and at the knowledge that his mother could handle even the formidable mrs metz with one arm tied behind her back devin looked away from his view of main street back at his brother we do anything lately they all thought about it it wasnt that their memories were poor it was just that they found trouble so easily they often overlooked the results anyone breezing by the big window of eds cafe would have seen the four mackades darkhaired greeneyed devils handsome enough to raise any females blood pressure be she ten or eighty reckless enough to have mostmen bracing or backing away they argued awhile over who had done what most recently fights picked and fought laws broken or at least dented it was agreed after the argument grew heated that rafe had the prize with his race against joe dolins chevy on route they hadnt been caught but word had gotten around especially as rare had won and joe had slunk off muttering about revenge the guys a jerk rafe blew out smoke no one disagreed but rafes gaze shifted to where cassie was busy serving a booth behind them what does a sweet little thing like cassie see in him if you ask me she wants out of the house jared pushed his plate aside mother would be enough to send anyone looking for the first escape hatch the womans a fanatic maybe she loves him devin said quietly rafes opinion of that was one crude word kids barely seventeen he pointed out shell fall in love a dozen times not everyone has a flexible heart a flexible heart sfiane whooped with laughter at the phrase it aint rafes heart that flexible dev its his shut up creep rafe said mildly as his elbow jammed hard into shanes ribs you up for a beer jare im up for it rare leered nastily too bad you two have to stick with soda pop i bet duff has a whole case of the fizzy stuff for you kids that of course insulted shane as it was meant to hot words came first then the jostling from her station at the counter edwina crump shouted at them to take it outside they did with devin lagging he hind to pay the tab on the other side of the window his brothers pushed and shoved eh other more out of habit than from any real temper ignoring them he smiled over at cassie just blowing off steam he told her adding a tip that wouldnt embarrass her the sheriff sometim comes by about this time of night her voice was barely a whisper of warning and so sweet to devins ears he almost sighed ill go break it up he slid out of the booth he thought his mother probably knew his feelings it was impossible to hide anything from her god knew they had all tried and failed he thought he knew what she would say to him that he was young yet and there would he other girls other women other loves she would mean the best by it devin knew that though he wasnt yet he fully an adult he had a mans heart and hed already given it he kept that heart out of his eyes though because he would hate cassies pity casually he walked out of he diner to break up his brothers he caught shane in a headlock elbowed rare in the gut cocked a brow at jared and suggested amiably that they go play some pool chapter the town of antietam was a pretty sight in late spring sheriff devin mackadoliked to walk the uneven sidewalks and smell the freshly mowed grass the flowers hear the yip of dogs and shouts of children he liked to take in the order of it the continuity and the little changes outside the bank a bed of pink begonias was spreading the three cars jockeying in line at the drivein window constituted a traffic jam down a little ways in front of the post office there were men passing the time taking the air through the barbershop window he could see a toddler experiencing his first haircut while his mother bit her nails and blinked damp eyes the banners were flying for the annual memorial day parade and picnic he could see several people busily scrubbing or painting their porches in preparation for the event it was an event he enjoyed even with its logistical and traffic headaches he liked the continuity of it the predictability the way people would plant themselves with their folding chairs and coolers along the curb hours before parade time to ensure that they would have a good view of the marching bands and twirling batons most of all he liked the way the townspeople threw themselves into that weekend how much they cared how strong their pride his father had told him of the ancient man who when he himself was a little boy had walked creakily down main street wearing confederate gray at an earlier memorial day one of the last living testaments to the civil war dead now as they all were devin mused as he glanced over at the memorial in the towns square dead but not and never forgotten at least not in little towns such as these which had once known the sound of mortar and rifle fire and the terrible cries of the wounded turning away he looked down the street and sighed there was mrs metzs buick parked as usual in the red zone he could give her a ticke devin mused and she would pay it but when she lumbered into his office to hand over the fine she would hlso treat him to a lecture he blew out a breath studied the door of the library no doubt that was where she was gossiping over the counter with sarah jane poffenberger devin drew together his courage and fortitude and climbed the old stone steps she was exactly where hed expected her to be leaning over the counter a mountain of paperback novels at her dimpled elbow deep into the latest dirt with the librarian devin wondered why any woman so generously sized insisted on wearing wildly patterned dresses mrs metz he kept his voice low hed been tossed out of the library many times in his youth by miss sarah jane well hello there devin beaming a smile mrs metz turned to him her elbow nearly toppled the mountain of books but miss sarah jane for all her resemblance to an under stuffed scarecrow moved fast and how are you on this beautiful afternoon im just fine hello miss sarah jane devin iron gray hair pulled back from paperthin white skin starched collar buttoned firmly to her chin sarah jane nodded regally did you come in to return that copy of the red badge of courage no maam he very nearly flushed hed lost the damn book twenty years before hed paid for it hed even swept the library for a month as penance for his carelessness now though he was a man one who wore a badge and was considered responsible by most he was shriveled down to a boy by sarah jane poffenbergers steely eyes a book is a treasure she said as she always did yes maam ah mrs metz more to save himself now than to uphold parking laws he shifted his gaze youre parked illegally again i am all innocence she fluttered at him why i dont know how that happened devin i would have sworn i pulled into the right place i just came in to check ouj a few books id have walked but i had to run into the city and stopped by on my way home readings one of gods gifts isnt it sarah jane it is indeed though her mouth remained sol eton the dark eyes in sarah janes wrinkled face were laughing devin had to concentrate on not shuffling his feet youre in the red zone mrs metz oh dear you didnt give me a ticket did you not yet devin muttered because mr metz gets all hurry when i get a ticket and ive only been here for a minute or two isnt that right sarah jane just a minute or two sarah jane confirmed but she winked at devin if youd move your car ill do that i surely will just as soon as i check out these books i dont know what id do if i didnt have my books what with the way mr metz watches the tv you check these out for me sarah jane while devin tells us how his familys doing he knew when he was outgunned after all he was a cop theyre fine and those sweet little babies imagine two of your brothers having babies within months of each other i just have to get over to see them all the babies are fine too he softened at the thought of them growing oh they do grow dont they sarah jane grow like weeds before you can stop them now youve got yourself a nephew and a niece two nephews and a niece devin reminded her adding jareds wife savannahs son bryan yes indeed give you any ideas about starting your own brood her eyes were glittering at the thought of getting the inside story on future events devin stood his ground being an uncle suits me without a tualm he tossed his sistertinlaw to the wolves regan has little nate with her at the shop today i saw him a couple hours ago does she she mentioned savannah might be coming by with layla oh my well being able to corner both mackade women and their babies was such a coup mrs metz nearly trembled with the idea hurry on up there sarah jane ive got errands to run hold your horses now ive got em for you right here sarah jane handed over the canvas bag mrs metz had brought it now pregnant with books moments later when mrs metz puffed her way out sarah jane smiled youre a smart boy devin always were if regan finds out i headed her over there shell skin me he grinned but a mans gotta do what a man gotta do nice seeing you miss sarah jane you find that copy of the red badge of cour age devin mackade books arent meant to be wasted he winced as he opened the door yes maam for all her bulk mrs metz moved quickly she was already pulling out of the red zone and into the sparse traffic congratulating himself on a job well done devin told himself he could take a quick ride down to the mackade inn just needed to check and make sure there wasnt anything that needed his attention he told himself as he walked up the street to his cruiser it was his brother rafes place after all it was his duty to check on it now and again the fact that cassie dolin managed the bedandbreakfast and lived on the third floor with her two children had nothing to do with it he was just doing his job which was he thought as he slipped behind the wheel of his car a huge and ridiculous lie he was however doing what he had to do which was to see her at least once a day he simply had to see her he just had to no matter how much it hurt or how careful he had to be more careful he reminded himself now that she was divorced from that bastard who had beaten and abused her for years joe dolin was in prison devin thought with grim satisfaction as he headed out of town and he would be there for quite some time to come as the sheriff as a friend as the man who had loved her most of his life devin had a duty to see that cassic and the kids were safe and happy and maybe today he could make her smile all the way to her big gray eyes what had been the old barlow place and likely would remain that forever in the mind of the town sat on a hill just on the edge of antietam once it had been the propertyof a rich man who enjoyed its height its expensive furnishings its enviable view it had stood there while the blood lest day of the civil war raged around it it had stood while a wounded young soldier was murdered on its polished grand staircase there it had remained while the mistress of the house grieved herself to death or so the legend went it had stood falling into decay disuse disregard its stones had not moved when its porches rotted when its windows were shattered by rocks heaved by rambunctiouschildren it had stood empty but for its ghosts for decades until rare mackadehad returned and claimed it it was the house devin thought as he turned up its steep lane that had brought rare and rgan together together they had turned that brooding old building into something fine something lovely where there had once been weeds and thorny brambles there was now a lush terraced lawn vivid with flowers and shrubs he had helped plant them himself the mackades always united when it came to developing dreams or destroying enemies the windows gleamed now framed by rich blue trim their overflowing flower boxes filled with sunnyfaced pansies the sturdy double porches were painted that same blue and offered guests a place to sit and look toward town or he knew if they chose to sit around at the back theyd have a long view of the haunted woods that bordered the inns property his own farm and the land where his brother jared his wife savannah and their children lived he didnt knock but simply stepped inside there were no cars in the drive but for cassies so he knew the overnight guests had already left and any others had yet to arrive he stood for a moment in the grand hall with its pohshed floor pretty rugs anti haunted staircase there were always flowers cassie saw to that pretty vases of fragrant blooms little bowls and dishes with potpourri that he knew she made herself so to him the house always smelled like cassie he wasnt sure where he would find her in the kitchen in the yard in her apartment on the third floor he moved through the house from front to rear knowing that if he didnt find her in the first two he would climb the outside stairs and knock on the door of her private quarters it was hard to believe that less than two years before the house had been full of dust and cobwebs all cracked plaster and chipped molding now floors and walls gleamed windows shone wood was polished to a high sheen antique tables were topped with what devin always thought of as dust collectors but they were charming rafe and regan had done something here built something here just as they were doing in the old house theyd bought fo themselves outside of town he envied his brother that not just the love but the partnership of a woman the home and family they had created together shane had the farm technically it belonged to all four of them but it was shanes heart and soul rare had regan and their baby the inn and the lovely old stoneandcedar house they were making their own jared had savannah the children and the cabin and as for himself devin mused well he had the town he supposed and a cot in the back room of the sheriffs office the kitchen was empty though it was as neat as a model on display it held all the warmth kitchens were meant to slate blue tiles and creamy white appliances were a backdrop for little things fresh fruit in an old stoneware bowl a sassy cookie jar in the shape of a smiling cat that he knew would be full of fresh homebaked cookies long tapered jars that held the her bed vinegars cassie made a row of african violets in bloom on the wide windowsill over the sink and then through the window he saw her taking billowing sheets from the line where theyd dried in the warm breeze his heart turned over in his chest he could handle that had handled it for too many years to count she looked happy was all he could think her lips were curved a little her gray eyes dreamy the breeze that fluttered the sheets teased her hair sending the honeycomb curls dancing around her face along her neck and throat like the kitchen she was neat tidy efficient without being cold she wore a white cotton blouse tucked into navy slacks just lately shed started to add little pieces of jewelry no rings her divorce had been final for a full year now and he knew the exact day shed taken off her wedding ting but she wore small gold hoops in her ears and a touch of color on her mouth shed stopped wearing makeup and jewelry shortly after her marriage devin remembered that too just as he remembered the first time hed been called out to the house she rented with joe answering a complaint from the neighbors he remembered the fire in her eyes when shed come to the door the marks on her face the way her voice had hitched and trembled when she told him there wasnt any trouble there was no trouble at all shed slipped and fallen that was all yes he remembered that and his frustration the hideous sense of impotence that first time and all the other times hed had to confront her to ask her to quietly offer her alternatives that were just as quietly refused thered been nothing he could do as she tiff to stop what happened inside that house until the day she finally came into his office bruised beaten terrifiedto fill out a complaint there was little he could do now as sheriff but offer her friendship so he walked out the rear door a casual smile on his face hey cass alarm came into her eyes firstdarkening that lovely gray he was used to it though it pained him immeasurably to know that she thought of him as the she tiff first as authority as the bearer of trouble before she thought of him as an old friend but the smile came back more quickly than it once had chasing the tension away from those delicate features hello devin calmly because she was teaching herself to be calm she hooked a clothespin back on the line and began folding the sheet need some help before she could refuse he was plucking clothespins she simply couldnt get used to a man doing such things especially such a man he was so big broad shoulders big hands long legs and gorgeous of course all the mackades were there was something so male about devin she couldnt really explain it even as he competently took linen from the line folded it into the basket he was all man unlike his deputies he didnt wear the khaki uniform of his office just jeans and a faded blue shirt rolled up to the elbows there were muscles there shed seen them and she had reason to be wary of a mans strength but despite his big hands his big shoulders hed never been anything but gentle she tried to remember that as he brushed against her reaching for another clothespin still she stepped away kept distance between them he smiled at her and she tried to think of ssomething to say it would be easier if everything about him wasnt so definite she supposed so vivid his hair was as black as midnight and curled over the frayed collar of his shirt his eyes were as green as moss even the bones in his face were defined and impossible to ignore the way they formed hollows and planes his mouth was firm and that dimple beside it constantly drew the eye he even smelled like a man plain soap plain sweat hed never been anything but kind to her and hed been a part of her life forever it seemed but whenever it was just the two of them she found herself as nervous as a cat faced with a bulldog too nice a day to toss these in the dryer what she blinked then cursed herself oh yes i like hanging the linens out when theres time we had two guests overnight and were expecting another couple later today were booked solid for the memorial day weekend youll be busy yes its hardly like work though really he watched her smooth sheets into the basket not like waiting tables at eds no she smiled a little then struggled with guilt ed was wonderful to me she was great to work fo shes still ticked at rare for stealing you noting the distress that leaped into her eyes devin shook his head im only kidding cassie you know she was happy you took this job how are the kids theyre fine wonderful before she could pick up the basket of linens herself devin had it tucked to hi hip leaving her nothing to do with her hands theyll be home soon from sc hood no little league practice today no she headed toward the kitchen but he opened the door before she could and win ted for her to go in ahead of him connors thrilled he made the team hes the best pitcher theyve got everyone says so automatically she went to the stove to make coffee its so strange he was never interested in sports before well before she finished lamely bryans been wonderful for him my nephews a hell of a kid there was such simple and honest pride in the statement that cassie turned around to study him you think of him that way really i mean even though theres no blood between you when jared married savannah it made bryan his son that makes him my nephew family isnt just blood no and sometimes blood kin is more trouble than not your mothers hassling you again she only moved her shoulder and turned back to finish the coffee shes just set in her ways shifting she reached into one of the glassfronted cabinets for a cup and a small plate when devins hand curled over her shoulder she jerked and nearly dropped the stoneware to the tiles he started to step back then changed his mind instead he turned her around so that they were facetoface and kept both of his hands on her shoulders shes still giving you a hard time about joe she had to swallow but couldnt quite get her throat muscles to work his hands were finn but they werent hurting there was annoyance in his eyes but no meanness she ordered herself to be calm not to lower her gaze she doesnt believe in divorce does she believe in wifebeating now she did wince did lower her gaze devin cursed himself and lowered his hands to his sides im sorry no its all right i dont expect you to understand i cant understand myself anymore relieved that hed stepped back she turned to the cookie jar and filled the plate with chocolate chip and oatmeal cookies shed baked that morning it doesnt seem to matter that im happy that the kids are happy it doesnt matter that the law says what joe did to me was wrong that he attacked regan it only matters that i broke my vows and divorced him are you happy cassie id stopped believing i could be or even that i should be she set the plate on the table went to pour him coffee yes i am happy are you going to make me drink this coffee by myself she stared at him a minute it was still such a novel concept the idea that she could sit down in the middle of the day with a friend taking matters into his own hands he got out a second cup so tell me after pouring her coffee he held out a chair for her how do the tourists feel about spending the night in a haunted house some of them am disappointed when they dont see or hear anything cassie lifted her cup and tried not to feel guilty that she wasnt doing some chore rafe was clever to publicize the inn as haunted hes always been clever yes he has a few people are nervous when they come down for breakfast but most of them are well exalted i guess theyll have heard doors slamming or voices or have heard her crying abigail barlow the tragic mistress of the house the compassionate southern belle married to the yankee murderer yes theyll hear her or smell her roses or just feel something weve only had one couple leave in the middle of the night for once her smile was quick and just a little wicked they were both terrified but youre not it doesnt bother you to have ghosts wandering no he cocked his head have you heard her abigail oh yes often not just at night sometimes when im alone here making beds or tidying up ill hear her or feel her and it doesnt spook you no i feel she started to say connected but thought it would sound foolish sorry for her she was trapped and unhappy married to a man who despised her in love with someone else in love with someone else devin asked interrupting her ive never heard that baffled cassie set her cup down with a little clink i havent either i just know it she realized i suppose i added it in its more romantic emma calls her the lady she likes to go into the bridal suite and connor its a big adventure for him all of it they love it here once when bryan was spending the night i caught the three of them sneaking down to the guest floor they wanted to go ghosthunting my brothers and i spent the night here when we were kids did you of course you did she said before he could comment the mackades and an empty derelict haunted house they belong together did you go ghosthunting i didnt have to i saw her i saw abigail cassies smile faded you did i never told the guys theyd have ragged on me for the rest of my life but i saw her sitting in the parlor by the fire there was a fire i could smell it feel the heat from the flames smell the roses that were in a vase on the table beside her she was beautiful devin said quietly blond hair and porcelain skin eyes the color of the smoke going up the flue she wore a blue dress i could hear the silk rustle as she moved she was embroidering something and her hands were small and delicate she looked right at me and she smiled she smiled but there were tears in her eyes she spoke to me she spoke to you cassie repeated as chills raced up and down her back like icy fingers what did she say if only devin brought himself back shook himself that was it if only then she was gone and i told myself id been dreaming but i knew i hadnt i always hoped id see her again but you havent no but ive heard her weeping it breaks my i know id ah appreciate it if you wouldnt mention that to rare hed still rag on me i wont she smiled as he bit into a cookie is that why you come here hoping to see her again i come to see you the minute hed said it he recognized his mistake her face went from relaxed to wary in the blink of an eye and the kids he added quickly and for the cookies she relaxed again ill put some in a bag for you to take with you but even as she rose to do so he covered her hand with his she froze not in fear so much as from the shock of the contact speechless she stared down at the way his hand swallowed hers cassie he strained against the urge to gather her up just to hold her to stroke those flyaway curls to taste finally to taste that small serious mouth there was a hitch in her breathing that she was afraid to analyze but she made herself shift her gaze ordered herself not to be so much a coward that she couldnt took into his eyes she wished she knew what she was looking at or looking for all she knew was that it was more than the patience and pity shed expected to see there that it was different devin she broke off jerked back at the sound of giggles and store ping feet the kids are home she finished quickly breathlessly and hurried to the door im down here she called out knowing that they would do as theyd been told and go directly to the apartment unless she stopped them mama i got a gold star on my homework emma came in a blond pixie in a red playsuit she set her lunch box on the counter and smiled shyly at devin hello theres my best girl lets see that star clutching the lined paper in her hand she walked to him you have a star not as pretty as this one devin traced a finger over the gold foil stuck to the top of the paper did you do this by yourself almost all can i sit in your lap you bet he plucked her up cradled her there he quite simply adored her after brushing his cheek against her hair he grinned over at connor hows it going champ okay a little thrill moved through connor at the nickname he was small for his age like emma and blond though at ten he had hair that was shades darker than his towheaded sisters you pitched a good game last saturday now he flushed thanks but bryan went four for five his loyalty and love for his best friend knew no bounds did you see i was there for a few innings watched you smoke a few batters connor got an a on his history test emma s id and that mean old bobby lewis shoved him and called him a bad name when we were in line for the bus emma mortified connor scowled at his sister i guess bobby lewis didnt get an a devin commented bryan fixed him good emma went on i bet he did devin thought and handed emma a cookie so that shed be distracted enough to stop embarrassing her brother im proud of you trying not to worry cassie gave connor a quick squeeze both of you a gold star and an a all in one day well have to celebrate later with icecream sundaes from eds its no big deal connor began it is to me cassie bent down and kissed him firmly a very big deal i used to struggle with math devin said casually never could get more than a c no matter what i did connor stared at the floor weighed down by the stigma of being bright he could still hear his father berating him egghead pansy useless cassie started to speak to defend but devin sent her one swift look but then i used to ace history and english stunned connor jerked his head up and stared you did it was a struggle but devin kept his eyes sober the kid didnt mean to be funny or insulting he knew y ah i guess it was because i liked to read a lot still do you read books it was an epiphany for connor here was a man who held a real mans job and who liked to read sure devin jiggled emma on his knee and smiled the thing was rafe was pitiful in english but he was a whiz in math so we traded off id do his he glanced at cassie realized his mistake id help him with his english homework and hed help me with the math it got us both through do you like to read stories connor wanted to know madeup stories theyre the best kind connor writes stories cassie said even as connor wriggled in embarrassment so ive heard maybe youll let me read one before the boy could answer devins beeper went off hell he muttered hell emma said adoringly you want to get me in trouble he asked then hitched her onto his hip as he rose to call in a few minutes later hed given up on his idea of wheedling his way into a dinner invitation gotta go somebody broke into the storeroom at duffs and helped themselves to a few cases of beer will you shoot them emma asked him i dont think so how about a kiss she puckered up obligingly before he set her down thanks for the coffee cass ill walk you out you two go on upstairs and get your afterschool snack she told her children ill he right along she waited until they were nearly at the front door before she spoke again thank you for talking to connor like that hes still so sensitive about liking school hes a bright kid it wont take much longer for him to start appreciating himself you helped he admires you it didnt take any effort to tell him i like to read devin paused at the door he means a lot to me all of you do when she opened her mouth to speak he took a chance and brushed a finger over her cheek all of you do he repeated and walked out leaving her staring after him chapter some nights late at night when her children were sleeping and the guests were settled down cassie would roam the house she was careful not to go on the second floor where guests were bedded down in the lovely rooms and suites rare and regan had built they paid for privacy and cassie was careful to give it but she was free to walk through her own apartment on the third floor to admire the rooms the view from the windows even the feel of the polished hardwood under her bare feet it was a freedom and a security that she knew she would never take for granted any more than she would take for granted the curtains framing the windows made of fabric that she had chosen and paid for herself or the kitchen table the sofa each lamp not all new she mused but new to her everything that had been in the house she shared with joe had been sold it had been her way of sweeping away the past nothing here was from her before it had been vital to her to start this life with nothing she hadnt brought into it on her own if she was restless she could go down on the main level move from parlor to sitting room into the beautiful solarium with its lovely plants and glistening glass she could stand in the hallways sit on the steps simply enjoy the quiet and solitude the only room she avoided was the library it was the only room that never welcomed her despite its deep leather chairs and walls of books she knew instinctivel that it had been charles barlows realm abigails husband the master of the house a man who had shot in cold blood a wounded confederate soldier hardly old enough to shave sometimes she felt the horror and sadness of that when she walked up and down the staircase where it had happened now and again she even heard the shot the explosion of it and the screams of the servants who had witnessed the senseless and brutal murder but she understood senseless brutality knew it existed just as she knew abigail still existed in this house it wasnt just the sound of weeping the scent of roses that would come suddenly and from nowhere it was just the feel of the air that connection that shed been too embarrassed to mention to devin that was how she knew abigail had loved a man who wasnt her husband that she had longed for him wept for him as well as for the murdered boy that she had dreamed of him and despaired of ever knowing the joy of real love cassie understood and sympathized that was why she felt so welcomed in this house that held so much of the past why she was never afraid no she was grateful for every hour she spent here as caretaker to beautiful things it had been nearly a year since she had accepted regans and rafes offer and moved her family in she was still dazzled that hhey would trust her with the job and she worked hard to earn that trust the work was all pleasure she thought now as she wandered into the parlor to tend and polish lovely antiques to cook breakfast in that wonderful kitchen and serve it to guests on pretty dishes to have flowers all around the house inside and out it was like a dream like one of the fairy tales savannah mackade illustrated she was so rarely afraid anymore hardly even disturbed by the nightmares that had plagued her for so long shed come to expect them it was unusual for her to wake shivering in the middle of the night out of a dream listening terrified for joes steps for his voice she was safe here and for the first time in her life free bundled into her robe she curled on the window seat in the parlor she wouldnt stay long her children slept deeply and were content here but there was always a chance they might wake and need her but she wanted just a few moments alone to hug her good fortune close to her heart she had a home where her children could laugh and play and feel safe it was wonderful to see how quickly emma was throwing off her shyness and becoming a bright chattering little girl childhood had been harder on connor she knew it shamed her to realize that he had seen and heard so much more of the misery than she had guessed but he was coming out of his shell it relieved her to see how comfortable they were with devin with all the mackades really there had been a time when emma hesitated to so much as speak to a man and connor sweet sensitive connor had forever been braced for a verbal blow no more just that day both of them had talked to devin as if it were as natural as breathing she wished she was as resilient it was the badge she decided she was finding it easier and easier to be comfortable with jared or rare or shane she didnt jolt when one of them touched her or flashed that mackade grin it was different with devin but then shed had to go to him had to confess that shed allowed herself to be beaten and abused for years had been forced to show him the marks on her body nothing not even joes vicious fists had ever humiliated her more than that she knew he was sorry for her and felt obligated to look out for her and the children he took his responsibilities as sheriff seriously no one including her self would have believed twelve or fifteen years before when he and his brothers were simply those bad mackade boys that they would turn out the way they had devin had made himself into an admirable man still rough she supposed she knew he could break up a bar fight with little more than a snarl and that he used his fists when that didnt work still shed never known anyone gentler or more compassionate hed been very good to her and her children and she owed him laying her cheek against the window she closed her eyes she was going to train herself not to be so jumpy around him she could do it she had been working very hard over the past year or so to teach herself composure and calm to pretend she wasnt shy when she greeted the guests it worked so well that she often didnt even feel shy anymore there were even times and they were coming more and more often when she actually felt competent so she would work now to teach herself not to be so jittery around devin she would stop thinking about his badge and remember that he was one of her oldest friends one shed even had a little crush on once upon a time she would stop thinking of how big his hands were or what would happen if he got angry and used them against her instead she would remember how gently they ruffled her daughters hair or how firmly they covered her sons when he helped him with his batting stance or how nice it had been how unexpectedly nice to feel the way his finger brushed her cheek she curled more comfortably on the padded seat he was here right here beside her smiling in that way that brought his dimple out and made odd things happen to her insides he touched her and she didnt jolt this time there she thought it was working already he was touching her drawing her against him oh his body was hard but she didnt flinch she was trembling though couldnt stop he was so big so strong he could break her in half and yet and yet his hands stroked so lightly over her over her skin but he couldnt he touching her there his mouth was on hers so warm and gentle she couldnt stop him she forgot that she should even when his tongue slid over hers and his hand cupped her breast as if it were the most natural thing in the world he was touching her and it was hard to breathe because those big hands were gliding over her and now his mouth oh it was wrong it had to be wrong but it was so wonderful to feel that warm wet mouth on her she was whimpering moaning opening for him she felt him coming inside her so hard so smooth so right the explosion of a gunshot had her jerking upright she was gasping for breath damp with sweat her mind a muddled mess alone in the parlor of course she was alone but her skin was tingling and there was a tingling almost a burning inside her that she hadnt felt in so many years shed forgotten it was possible shame washed over her had her gathering her robe tight at her throat it was terrible she thought just terrible to have been imagining herself with devin like that after hed been so kind to her she didnt know what had gotten into her she didnt even like sex it was something shed learned to dread and then to tolerate very soon after her miserable weddingnight initiation pleasure had never entered into it she simply wasnt built for that kind of pleasure and had accepted the lack early on but when she got to her feet her legs were shaky and there was a nagging pressure low in her stomach she drew in a breath and along with it the delicate scent of roses so she wasnt alone cassie thought abigail was with her comforted she went back upstairs to check on her children one last time before going to bed devin was well into what he considered the paperpushing part of the day by noon he had a report to type and file on the breakin at duffs tavern the trio of teenagers whod thought to relieve duff of a bit of his inventory had been pathetically easy to track down then there was the traffic accident out on brook lane hardly more than a fender bender devin mused as he hammered at the keys but lester swoop whose new sedan had been crinkled was raising a ruckus he had to finish up his report to the mayor and town council on the preparations for crowd control on parade day then maybe hed get some lunch across the office his young deputy donnie banks was dealing with parking tickets and as usual drumming his fingers on the metal desk to some inner rhythm that devin tried hard to ignore the day was warm enough that the windows were open the budget didnt run to airconditioning he could hear the sounds of traffic what there was of it and the occasionally squeal of brakes as someone came up too fast on the stop light at main and antietam he still had the mail to sort through his job since crystal abbott was off on maternity leave and he hadnt come up with a temporary replacement for her position as general dogs body he didnt mind really the sheer monotony of paperwork could be soothing things were quiet as they were expected to be in a town of less than twentyfive hundred his job was to keep it that way and deal with the drunkanddisorder ies the traffic violations the occasional petty theft or domestic dispute things heated up now and again but in his seven years with antietams sheriffs department both as deputy and as sheriff hed had to draw his weapon only twice and hed never been forced to fire it reason and guile usually worked and if they didnt a fist usually turned the tide when the phone rang devin glanced hopefully toward his deputy donnies fingers neyer broke rhythm so with a sigh devin answered the phone himself he was well on his way to calming a hysterical woman who claimed that her neighbor deliberately sent her dog over into her yard to fertilize her petunias when jared walked in yes maam no maam devin rolled his eyes and motioned jared to a seat have you talked with her asked her to keep her dog in her own yard the answer came so fast and loud that devin winced and held the phone six inches from his ear in the little wooden chair across the desk jared grinned and stretched out his legs yes maam im sure you worked very hard on your petunias no no dont do that please theres a law against discharging a firearm within town limits you dont want to go waving your shotgun atthe dog im going to send somebody over there yes maam i surely am ah well see what we can do you leave that shotgun alone now you hear yes maam ive got it all down right here you just sit tight he hung up tore off the memo sheet donnie yo get on over to oak leaf and handle this we got us a situation donnie stopped his drumming looking hopeful devin thought he seemed very young in his carefully pressed uniform with his scarecrow hair and eager blue eyes weve got a french poodle using a petunia bed as a toilet explain about the leash law and see if you can keep these two women from a hairpulling contest yo delighted with the assignment donnie took the information sheet adjusted his hat and strode out ready to uphold the law i think he started to shave last week devin commented petunias and poodles jared said and stretched i can see youre busy antietams a real naked city devin got up to pour them both coffee had us a situation down to duffs he added tinting his voice with donnies accent and emphasis three cases of beer went miss well well got two of them back after handing jared the mug devin eased a hip onto his desk the other had been consumed by three sixteen yearolds tracked them down did you it didnt take sam spade devin shook his head as he sipped theyd bragged about it right and left took the beer out to the field near the high school and had themselves a party they were sick as dogs when i caught up with them idiots now theyve got b and e charges larceny and an appointment with juvie seems to me i remember a couple of cases of beer and a party in the woods we didnt steal it devin reminded him we left duff the money in the storeroom after wed broken in and taken the beer a fine but salient point god we got drunk and sick devin added when we crawled home mom made us shovel manure all afternoon i thought id die those were the days jared said with a sigh he sat back despite the trim suit and tie the expensive shoes there was no mistaking him for anything but a mackade like his brother he had the reckless dark good looks a bit more groomed a bit more polished but reckless enough what are you doing in town this and that jared wanted to work up to what he had to tell devin lay la getting a tooth yeah keeping you guys up i forgot what sleeps like his grin flashed its great you know bryan changes diapers the kids so in love with her savannah says the first thing he does when he gets home from school is to go find her you got lucky devin murmured dont i know it you ought to try it dev marriage is a pretty good deal its working for you and rafe i saw him this morning heading into the hardware with nate strapped to his back he looked real domestic did you tell him that i didnt want to start a fight in front of the baby good call you know what you need around here dev still sipping coffee jared looked around the office it was atilitarian basic desks wood floors coffeepot a ceiling fan that he knew squeaked when it was put into use in the summer unpadded chairs metal file cabinets you need a dog ethelll be dropping that litter any day now devin raised a brow fred and ethel shanes golden retrievers had finally figured out what boy and girl dogs could do together besides chase rabbits yeah i need a puppy puddling on the floor and chewing up my papers companionship jared insisted think how youd look cruising around town with a dog riding shotgun you could deputize him the image made devin grin but he set his coffee down ill keep it in mind now why dont you tell me what you came in to tell me jared blew out a breath he knew how devins mind worked step by meticulous step hed let jared ramble but he hadnt been fooled i had some business at the prison this morning one of your clients not getting his full television rights jared set his coffee aside linked his fingers you arrest them i represent them thats why its called law and order right how could i forget so so i had a meeting with the warden and as hes aware that im cassies lawyer he felt it reasonable to pass some news on to me devins mouth thinned dolin yeah joe dolin hes not up for a parole hearing for another eighteen months devin knew the exact day to the hour thats right it seems that after a difficult period of adjustment during which joe was a disciplinary problem hes become a model prisoner ill bet jared recognized the bitterness in the tone understood it perfectly we know hes a bastard devin but the point here is hes playing the game and hes playing it well he wont make parole not the first time at bat ill make sure of it paroles not the issneyet hes been put on work the hell he has as of this week i argued against it i pointed out the fact that hell be only a matter of miles from cassic his history of violence his ties to the town feeling helpless jared unlinked his hands held them palms up i got shot down hell be supervised along with the rest of the crew we need the work release program need the park and the roads cleaned and maintained and this is a cheap way to handle it letting cooperative prisoners serve the community is a solid method of rehabilitation and when they take a hike from trash detail devin was pacing now eyes fiery it happens two or three times a year at least it happens i hauled one back myself last fall it happens jared agreed they rarely get far theyre pretty easy to spot in the prison uniform and most of them dont know the area devin knows the damn area youre not going to get any arguments from me im going to fight it devin but its not going to be easy not when cassies own mother has been writing the warden in joes defense that bitch devins hands cured into fists she knows what he did to cassie cassie he repeated and scrubbed his hands over his face shes just starting to pull things together what the hell is this going to do to her im heading over there now to tell her no devin dropped his hands ill tell her you go file papers or whatever you have to do to turn this thing around i want that son of a bitch locked up twentyfour hours a day theyve got a crew out on right now trash detail hes on it fine devin headed for the door thats just fine it didnt take him long to get there or to spot the bright orange vests of the road crew devin pulled to the shoulder behind a pickup truck where bags of trash were already heaped he got out of his car leaned against the hood and watched joe dolin the sixteen months in prison hadnt taken off any of his bulk devin noted he was a big man thick burly hed been going to fat before his arrest from the lookof him hed been busy turning that fat into muscle the prison system approved of physical fitness he and another man were unclogging the runoff on the other side of the road working systematically and in silence as they gathered up dead leaves litter devin bided his time waited until joe straightened hauled a plastic bag overhis shoulder and turned their eyes met held devin wondered what the warden would say about rehabilitation if hed seen that look in joes eyes the heat and the hate if hed seen that slow bitterly triumphant smile before joe tossed the bag in the bed of the pickup parked on his side of the road because he knew himself devin stayed where he was he knew that if he got close too close he wouldnt he able to stop himself the badge he wore was both a responsibility and a barrier if he was a civilian he could walk across the road ram his fists into joes leering face and take the consequences if he was a civilian he could pummel the wifebeating bastard into putty but he wasnt a civilian help you sheriff one of the supervisors walked over ready to chat officer to officer his easy smile faded at the look in devins eyes is there a problem depends devin took out one of the cigarettes hed been working on giving up for the past two months taking his time he struck a match lit it blew out smoke you see that man there the big one dolin sure you remember that name l in flicked his gaze down to the ld clipped to the supervisors shirt and im going to remember yours richardson if he gets away from you even for a heartbeat its going to be your ass hey look sheriff devin merely fixed his eyes on richardsons face kept them there as he pushed off the hood you make sure that son of a bitch doesntwander into my town richardson you make damn sure of it joe watched the sheriffs car pull out drive away he bent his back to the work like a good team player and patted his pocket where the latest letter from his motherinlaw was tucked he knew what it said almost word for word she kept him up with cassie just fine how the little bitch had a fancy job now at the mackade inn lousy mackades he was going to take care of all of them every last one of them when he got out but first he was going to take care of cassie she thought she could have him tossed in a cell she thought she could divorce him and start strutting her stuff around town well she was going to think again real soon her mama was helping him out writing him letters they were preachy letters and he couldnt stand the dried up old bat but she was helping him out and he wrote her every week telling her how hed suffered how hed gotten religion how he wanted to be with his family again he made sure he went on about the kids he could have cared less about the kids whiny little brats it was cassie he wanted she was his wife till death do us part he was going to be reminding her of that before too much longer he hauled another bag to the bed of the truck tossed it in oh yeah he was going to remind her good just like the old days she would pay in spades for every hour hed spent in a cell curling his hand into a fist he dreamed about his homecoming chapter instead of going directly to cassie devin went to the prison he didnt doubt jareds skill as a lawyer but he wanted needed to add his weight he forced himself to stay calm as he laid out the facts and his opinion to the warden for every protest he made he was shown a report to offset it joe dolin had indeed made himself into a model prisoner one who showed every sign of rehabilitation he worked hard followed the rules went to chapel regularly he expressed regret over his crimes and kept up with his alcoholabuse counseling when devin left he understood that the system he worked hard to uphold had just kicked him in the teeth all he could do now was tell cassie and try to reassure her he found her on her hands and knees in the parlor polishing the carved wood of a gate leg table she was so busy humming to herself she hadnt heard him come in she was wearing a white bib apron over her blouse and slacks and had a plastic basket beside her filled with rags and cleaning tools her wavy hair was tucked behind her ear to keep it from falling forward into her face shed been letting it grow some he thought it rippled just past her chin she looked o damn happy devin thought and jammed his hands into his pockets cass she jerked up barely missed rapping her head on the table extension then blushed right to the hairline devin she twisted her polishing rag in her hands as her nerves went into overdrive shed been replaying the dream in her head the dream shed had right here in the parlor on the window seat the dream where devin had oh my he stared at her then stepped forward she looked as though shed been caught rifling the till whats wrong whats the matter nothing nothing it seemed her stomach was suddenly full of bats and she had to hold back a nervous giggle my mind was wandering thats all was it ever and you startled me thats all it wasnt like her to keep repeating herself and ms gaze narrowed are you sure youre all right yes yes fine just fine she scrambled to her feet still twisting the rag the couple who are staying here went out to tour the battlefield theyre going to stay another night theyre from north carolina hes a battlefield junkie thats what he said i gave them all the pamphlets and and a tour of the house they wanted to see all of it theyre excited about the idea of ghosts puzzled he nodded she was babbling like a brook when he usually had to coax to get three sentences in a row out of her okay do you want some coffee ill get you some coffee she said and started to bolt before he could answer and brownies i made brownies this morning and when he put a hand on her arm to stop her she froze like a doe caught in headlights cassandra relax i am relaxed im relaxed his hand was firm warm she thought she could feel the texture of it through her skin all the way to the bone youre about to jump out of your shoes takea deep breath take a couple of them obediently she did and felt some of the nerves settle im fine devin okay well have some coffee but even as he started to lead her out his beeper went off damn it he strode to the candlestick phone on the gate leg to call in mackade yes donnie devin pressed his fingers against his eyes where had the headache come from and why the hell was cassie staring at him as if hed grown two pounding heads im on a call now donnie handle it thats what i said look put the damn poodle in lockup along with those idiot women if you have to but he broke off cursed himself knowing donnie would do exactly that abort that be diplomatic donnie and do your job youre going to have to fine the poodle lady but do it privately and professionally suggest a fence remind her that the leash law is there for her pups safety as well as the publics theres traffic on that street and her little dog could get himself squashed when youve handled that you go over to the complainant tell her its been dealt with and compliment her on her flowers suggest a fence you know how good fences make good neighbors no i didnt make that up go away donnie he hung up and turned to see cassie smiling at him a small dog problem he explained youre so good at that and knowing how to handle people and put things right im a regular solomon he blew out a breath sit down cassie i need to talk to you oh her smile faded somethings wrong not necessarily come on lets sit down because he wanted to be able to hold her hand when he told her he chose the curvy settee that always made him feel like a clumsy giant im going to tell you first that theres nothing to worry about that i dont want you to worry its about joe her hand trembled once in his then went still they let him out no he squeezed her hand gently reassuringly and kept his eyes steady on hers hes not going to be out of jail for a long time he wants to see the children she went dead pale her eyes huge and dark and terrified oh god devin the children no he cursed himself knowing he was only making it worse by tryirg to cushion the blow its nothing like that its the work release program you know what that is yes they let the prisoners out for a few hours to do jobs community service oh a single shudder escaped before she closed her eyes thats it hes working on a road crew trash and litter pickup that sort of thing i wanted you to know and not worry ivearranged to be informed of his schedule ill know exactly where he is and so will you i dont want you driving by one day and seeing him on the side of the road and getting seared all fight the fear was there but she could handle it shed handled worse hes supervised thats right he wasnt going to bring up how often they misplaceda prisoner shed know it already im going to drive by or have one of the men drive by wherever hes working a couple of times a day and because i want you to feel secure about this well do drivebys here too and at the school he thought but he didnt want to bring up the kids again hes still in prison she said to reassure herself there are guards thats right jareds working on a protest but i should tell youdamn it he let out another breath your mothers for it and shes been writing to the warden i knew that cassie squared her shoulders she and joe are writing each other shes showed me his letters it doesnt make any difference devin im never going back to that im never letting my children go back to that well be all right youll be fine he was going to see to it he tucked a stray curl behind her ear relieved that she didnt jolt im sorry i scared you you didnt not really anytime cassie day or night that you feel uncomfortable or uneasy i want you to call me you know i spend most nights at the office i can be here in five minutes if you need me i never feel uncomfortable or uneasy here im hardly ever alone when he lifted a brow she smiled cant you smell them the roses yeah now he smiled still im usually better company than a ghost you call me all right she had to draw together all her courage a point had to be proved he was her friend always had been she had to stop being a trembling little mouse thank you she made herself smile then laid a hand on his cheek and touched her lips to his he barely tasted her but the explosion ripped through his system like nap aim it was so unexpected so long desired he didnt realize his hand had tightened like a vise on her fingers making her eyes go wide with shock all he knew was that her lips had been on his just for an instant and he couldnt stand it he dragged her against him and captured that taste again devoured it steeped himself in it warm sweet the shape of her mouth that deep dip drove him crazy he crushed it under his traced it with a frantic tongue then dived deep to plunder his heart was thundering wild surf against jagged rocks his blood was racing making his head buzz she was everything soft and small and sweet every thing he craved everything he cherished it took him several desperate moments to realize her hands were trapped between them and she was rigid in his arms stunned he let her go and leaped up in one frenzied motion and she stared at him eyes dark as rain clouds one hand lifted to lie against the mouth hed just savaged that was the word for it he thought disgusted savaged im sorry he was as pale now as she was flushed and cursing himself viciously im sorry he said again im sorry i didnt mean to you caught me off guard therewas no excuse he reminded himself and his punishment for breaking her trust would be the losing of it that was way out of line and it wont happen again i dont know what i was thinking of i have to go devin i have to go he repeated almost desperately as he backed up he nearly tripped over a table decided that would have capped things off nicely because she hadnt moved an inch he was able to escape without further humiliating himself she listened to the door slamming behind him no she hadnt moved because she couldnt she didnt think it would he wise to try to stand just yet what had just happened here she asked herself she had kissed him thinking it was time she was able to make that friendly gesture rafe kissed her all the time when he came by the inn for something he often kissed her just the way shed tried to kiss devin lightly casually and after a while shed gotten used to it and she no longer stiffened up then devin had kissed her but he didnt kiss like rafe at all no not at all she still had her fingers against her lips and could still feel the heat there no shed never been kissed like that before by anyone as if the mans life had depended on it shed never imagined devin oh but she had she remembered letting her unsteady hand fall into her lap she had imagined just the night before had she dreamed her way into this what had happened here was certainly reality her heart was pounding still and her skin was hot shed been so shocked by what hed done the way hed grabbed her the way his mouth had covered hers she hadnt been able to move how long had it lasted thirty seconds a minute she couldnt say but so much had happened inside her she was still shaky from it hed been sorry of course he had she thought and leaned back closed her eyes and tried to catch her breath he hadnt meant to kiss her it had just been some sort of spontaneous reaction a male reaction then hed found her lacking and let her go apologized he was a good and honorable man and hed apologized for doing something he hadnt really meant to do it was just a kiss she reminded herself but had to press a hand to her jittery stomach now shed spoiled things because she hadnt been able to shrug it off or laugh it off like a normal woman any more than shed been able to respond to him and make him want to kiss her again she would make an effort cassie ordered herself to behave as though nothing had happened the very next time she saw him she would smile and make natural conversation she was getting better at those things she simply couldnt bear it if they couldnt be friends anymore she got up on s tillwobbly legs to finish her polishing and didnt think of joe dolin at all devin worked like a fiend the rest of the day and of the next he drove his deputies insane and out to the farm to extend the same courtesy to younger brother of course he told himself hed come out to work there were crops to be tended and several of the cows that hadnt yet calved were due to drop he found his services welcomed when one of the cows delivered breech by the time it was over and the new calf was teetering on its spindly legs devin was a mess his shirt was ruined his arm was bruised from being side the cows birth canal and he stank in the stall shane was equally dirty and he whistling cheerfully as he administered inoculations the annoyed baby hereyou go pal that didnt hurt much disgusted devin stared at him it had been a hard messy job and it wasnt over the stall would have to be cleaned out and fresh hay spread and the calf would treed watching for the next couple of hours and there was shane kneeling in the muck happy as a fool hed been letting his hair grow lately devin noted and hed pulled a tail of it through the opening in the back of his grimy cap his green eyes shades paler than devins were dreamy and his mouth was curved next to his dimple he was sinfully goodlooking even for a mackade and he was the baby of the family even younger than devin which meant that his older brothers had been honorbound to kick his butt well and often as he continued to whistle devin gave serious thought to doing so now what the hell are you so happy about nice healthy calf from the look of him despite the calfs strong objections shane was holding him still and examining his eyes mamas doing fine now whats not to be happy about she damn near broke my arm she couldnt help it shane said reasonably besides i told you id take that end you insisted yeah right this place is a mess birthings not neat shane stood and rubbed his filthy hands on his equally filthy jeans he stepped out of the stall and leaned against the open door besides i thought this might sweat the mood out of apologized for doing something he hadnt really meant to do it was just a kiss she reminded herself but had to press a hand to her jittery

right this place is a mess birthings not neat shane stood and rubbed his filthy hands on his equally filthy jeans he stepped out of the stall and leaned against the open door besides i thought this might sweat the mood out of you his grin was cocky confident all the more reason for devin to want to punch it in women trouble right i dont have women trouble thats cause you dont have any women which i might add is an embarrassment to all of us why dont you take one of mine ive got plenty devin answered the suggestion with the crude and expected response before he stepped over to the sink to wash his hands no really you know who i think would be good for you frannie spader shes got all this red hair that just sort of tumbles all over the place and the cutest smile and when you get past the hair and the smile shes got a body that can make a man whimper i dont think youve done nearly enough whimpering lately ill pick my own women i dont need your damn castoffs just being brotherly he slapped devin on the back before reaching for the soap of course if you werent so damn brotherly yourself you could probably be making time with little cassie it was a tribute to devins speed and shanes innocence that the blow caught shane solidly on the jaw and sent him flying he landed hard shook his head before he could ask devin what the devil had gotten into him he was assaulted by a hundred and seventyfive pounds of furious frustrated male they were well matched knew each others moves and rhythms the barn echoed with grunts the smack of flesh against bone curses as they rolled over dusty concrete floor oh for heavens sake the female voice and the disdain in it didnt register on either of the combatants shane dropped his guard just long enough to be rewarded with a split lip and answered it by bloodying devins nose but darling it looks like theyve just gotten started i mean it rafe with a heavy sigh regan mackade shifted the gurgling baby on her hip break it up women he muttered but he would break it up his way which was to dive into the fray and get in a few licks of hi sown knowing he couldnt enjoy himself for long he managed to shove shane aside and sit on devin stay out of this swiping at blood shane hauled himself to his knees its better him and me maybe i will rafe was having quite a bit of trouble holding devin down to prove he meant to he covered devins grimy face with the flat of his hand and gave it enough of a shove to have his head rapping against the concrete and maybe i want to play he added whats it about ask him already cooling off shane flexed his sore hand i was just talking to him and he punched me well i want to punch you half the time youre talking to me rafe said reasonably and looked down to see that devins eyes were clearing he hadnt meant to rap his brothers head quite that hard what were you talking to him about stuff women devins vision was coming back and so was histemper he started to heave rare aside when regans firm nononsens voice stopped him thats just enough of this ridiculous behavior devin you should be ashamed of yourself still on top of him rare looked down and grinned yeah dev you should be ashamed of yourself get the hell off me you going to be a good boy with a laugh rafe leaned over and kissed him he was quick and agile and sprang away before devin could retaliate a fine thing regan said from the doorway of the barn making devin think twice about jumping shane again she stood there in tailored slacks and a crisp spring blazer a wideeyed baby on her hip a polished leather shoe tapping wrestling in the barn like a couple of badtempered boys look at the two of you youre filthy bloody and your clothes are torn he started it wisely shane held back a laugh and tried to look humble honest regan i was just defending myself im not interested in who started it regan said regally and deflated her brotherinlaw with one snippy look i believe we were invited to dinner oh yeah shane had forgotten about that we had a little trouble with a birthing breech call we just got finished oh instantly regan was all concern back a curtain of honeybrown hair she hurried inc side is it all right just dandy hey nate no you dont even as the cooing baby held out his arms to his uncle regan turned aside youre filthy the two of you go clean up devin eyed shane narrowly then hissed out a breath i felt like pounding somebody you were available you also have a big mouth shane dabbed at the blood on his lip you sucker punched me so so i owe you one thats it boys kiss and make up when both shane and devin turned on rafe regan gritted her teeth stop right there if nobody punches anyone else ill cook dinner good deal shane decided but youre not coming in the kitchen until whats that noise what noise devin unclenched his ready fist and listened the whimpering sound was soft barely audible over little nates babbling homing in on it he strode halfway down the barn and looked into another stall looks like its the day for birthing ethels having her babies ethel like a frantic papa shane bolted down the barn and all but fell into the stall beside his laboring pet oh honey why didnt you call me jeez shes already had two freds probably out passing out cigars at the entrance to the stall rafe leaned over and kissed his wife then his son i know just how he feels seeing the panic in shanes eyes devin shook his head theyd witnessed or assisted in countless births with the stock over the years but that meant nothing now this was ethel and she was as close to a true love as shane had ever known he stepped in crouched down beside his brother shes doing fine he hooked an arm over shanes shoulders you think sure shes a mackade isnt she devin glanced up at regan and winked mackade women are the best there is after the birthing the cleaning up the cooking and the celebrating of fred and ethels six healthy puppies devin drove back to the office he was too restless to stay at the farm though he had taken a long soaking bath to soothe out the worst of the aches his scuffle with shane had caused he still wasnt able to fully relax he slowed down as he passed the inn saw lightsshining on the second and third floors grimly he punched the gas again and headed into town she wasnt going to forgive him easily he thought he wasnt going to forgive himself hed acted like a maniac hed been rough and demanding when she deserved and should have expected a gentle touch no wonder shed looked at him as though hed lost his mind her eyes round in shock her soft pretty mouth trembling hed make it up to her somehow eventually he knew how to bide his time didnt he hed been waiting for her nearly half his life already joe dolin was also biding his time his cell was dark but he wasnt sleeping he was planning he knew most people thought he wasnt very smart but he was going to show them all of them soon hed learned how to play the game to say what the guards and the psychiatrists and the fatfaced warden wanted to hear hed learned how to act as they wanted him to act he could be humble he could be repentant he could be anything he had to be as long as it got him out devin mac katie thought hed proved something driving by the work site flashing his badge oh he owed devin mac katie bigtime he hadnt forgotten the way devin had come after him had cuffed him and tossed him into a cell no he hadnt forgotten what he owed devin there would be payback but cassie would come first because he owed her most of all everything would have been fine if shed stayed in her place but shed gone whining to mackade sniveling about their personal business a man had a right to punish his wife to give her the back of his hand or let her feel his fist when she needed it and cassie had needed it a lot she still did no final divorce papers changed that she was his wife his property and he was going to be reminding her of that before too much longer till death do us part he thought and smiled into the dark chapter parade day was a tactical nightmare that was to expected over and above his usual reasons devin looking forward to it because it would keep him busy to think about any personal problems the parade would kick off at twelve sharp which meant anytime between noon and twelvethirty with the usual speeches at the square and the ceremonial laying of the wreath at the memorial as sheriff he was required to be there in full uniform he could handle it there were only a handful of days out of the year when he had to drag out dress khakis and tie and shiny black shoes of course that meant dragging out the board as well which he hated it was the only domestic chore he truly despised and the only one that jittered his nerves but by a m he was pressed and dressed and out on the street already there were eager beavers claiming their spots holding spaces along the curbs and sidewalks for others with lawn chairs and coolers most of the storefronts and shops along the parade route were closed for the day but he could count on eds being open for breakfast he sauntered down the sidewalk knowing he had the best part of an hour before he had to worry about crowd control or making certain the concessionaires were in their proper places with their balloons and hot dogs and ice cream summer had decided to make its debut on parade day it was already hot and he tugged irritably at his collar he imagined the tar on the street would be soft and melting by afternoon he hoped the little girls who did their tumbles and cartwheels in their spangled uniforms were prepared he made a note to make certain there was plenty of water along the route for the marchers he didnt want anybody fainting on him it might be a holiday but eds was doing a brisk business he could smell ham frying coffee brewing the scent reminded him that hed been off his feed for the past couple of days after exchanging a few greetings with patrons in booths he sidled up to the counter and took a stool sheriff ed winked at him as usual her rhinestone glasses were dangling on a pearlstudded chain against her scrawny chest she wore a splattered apron but beneath it she was ready for the celebration in a snug midriffbaring top as red as her hair and shorts that barely met the limits of the law she had bright blue shadow all the way up to her penciled brows and her mouth was stopsign red poppies dangled from her ears and were pinned to ilex apron devin grinned at her only edwina crump could get away with an outfit like that ham and eggs ed and keep the coffee coming you got it sweetie though she was old enough to be his mother she fluffed her hair and flirted dont you look handsome in your uniform i feel like an aging boy scout he grumbled one of my first beaus was a boy scout she wiggled her brows as she took the clear plastic top off a plate of doughnuts and chose one for him he was surely prepared let me tell you on the house she added casting a sharp eye over her two waitresses she left devin with his coffee and doughnut before heading back into the kitchen he tried not to brood really to keep himself sane he set his clipboard on the counter and read over notes and itinerary a half hour later he was some finetuning and trying to enjoy eds very excels lent ham and eggs hi there sheriff locked anybody up lately he swiveled on the stool and looked into the grinning and not altogether friendly face of his law savannah mackade always made a devin thought when that lush sffens body sauntered into a room mens hearts stopped that thick black hair falling past her shoulders those almondshaped eyes the color of sinful chocolate and those iceedged cheekbones against golddust skin and there was devin mused all that attitude as a matter of fact no not lately he grinned at the boy beside her his nephew whether savannah liked it or not tall for his age and as dark and handsome as his mama bryan was sporting his baseball uniform and fielders cap riding in the parade today yeah me and con and the guys are riding in the coachs pickup itll be cool kind of early arent you we had some things to pick up savannah supplied including connor were on our way to get him as soon as bryan here fills his stomach im starving the boy claimed and eyeing the plate of doughnuts he leaped onto the stool beside devin hey ed you got a starving boy out here im coming she slapped the swinging door of the kitchen open and strolled out her grin flashed at bryan well its my champ as sponsor of the antietam cannons ed preened with pride hell of a game saturday she saluted savannah leaned over the counter long enough to coo at the baby in the stroller then fell into a deep and serious discussion with bryan about food and baseball devin didnt ask hed be damned if he would he slid off the stool long enough to pick up his niece then settled back down with the wideeyed layla on his lap beneath the frilly sun hat laylas hair curled thick and dark her mouth her mothers mouth devin mused was serious as she watched him out of big eyes that were already easing from birth blue to mackade green hello beautiful he bent over to kiss her and was pleased to see that pretty mouth curve she smiled at me gas devin looked up into savannahs bland eyes the hell it is she smiled at me she loves me dont you layla dont you darling he traced a finger over her hand until she gripped it shes got mackade eyes theyre still changing savannah claimed she was softening despite the badge and the she tried to resist him she grew fonder of devin every day they might turn brown nah mackade eyes he looked up again at her youre stuck with them with us apparently his grin only widened he knew she liked him matter how cool she tried to be want a doughnut maybe she gave up and slid onto a stool dont have to hold her i want to hold her wheres jared doing some lawyer thing hes going the inn about nine thirty so you havent been by yet devin said ally very casually as he shifted layla to his and rubbed her back no savannah bent down to take a cloth from the stroller and smoothed it over devins shoulder i nursed her right before we left shes liable to spit up all over that pretty cop suit then i wouldnt have to wear it youre just picking up connor mmhmm with an experts eye savannah selected her own doughnut rafe and regan are swinging by later to get cassie and emma shanes going to drive jared in so we dont have so many cars when we head to the park for the picnic she glanced over saw that her son was well on his way to demolishing the two doughnuts ed had given him you angling for a ride no ive got to take the cruiser so tcan pretend im working i didnt see you at the game saturday i swung by for a couple of innings hed spotted cassie in the stands and he hadnt wanted to make her uncomfortable you didnt make it to sunday dinner yesterday at the farm did you miss me not particularly but there was something in his eyes that wiped the sneer off her face is something wrong devin no jared told me about joe dolin the work release its bothering you thats a mild term for it im keeping my eye on him he murmured and turned his face into laylas sweetsmelling neck to nuzzle ill bet you are savannah murmured she brushed a hand over her daughters head then let it rest on devins shoulder in a gesture of affection and support that surprised both of them am i growing on you savannah she let her hand drop but the comers of her mouth quirked up like you said im stuck with you now give me my kid devin settled layla in her mothers arms then kissed savannah firm and quick on the mouth see you see you bry he added as he rose bryan mumbled something hampered by a mouthful of applefilled doughnut damn mackades savannah said under her breath but she was smiling as she watched devin stride away by noon the town was bursting at the seams people crowded the sidewalks and spilled over front yards kids raced everywhere at once bawling of fretful babies rose through the air cord ant music several streets were barricaded to keep the parad route clear des in posted himself at the main intersection so that he could soothe travelers who had gotten about parade day or were from of town that theyd never heard of it he offered alternate routes or invitations to and join the festivities the twoway radio hitched to his belt squawked with static or calls from deputies distant points along the route across the street from him at the comer of the gas station a clown sold colorful balloons half a block down ice cream and snow cones were big sellers they melted in the heat almost as soon as they were passed from hand to hand devin looked at the wrappers the spills the bits of broken toys and balloons cleanup was going to be a bitch then in the distance he heard the first of the marching bands approaching the square the brassy music the clickclack of booted feet had his practical frame of mind shifting into the pleasures of his youth what the hell there was just nothing like a parade officer officer resigned devin turned back to the barricade where another car had pulled up with one look he summed up the middleaged couple in the latemodel sedan as hot frazzled and annoyed yes maam he leaned down to the open window and gave them his best publicservant smile what can i do for you we have to get through here the drivers irritated ione carried the flavor of the north that went with his pennsylvania tags i told you not to get off the highway george you just had to take the scenic route be quiet marsha we have to get through he said again well now devin ran his hand over his chin the problem here is that weve got a parade going on to prove il the marching band let out a blare of trumpets a boom of drums devin pitched his voice over the din we wont he able to open this road for another hour that sparked a heated domestic argument demands accusations devin kept the easy smile on his face where yall headed dc well ill tell you what you can do if youre in a hurry you turn around and head straight up this road for about five miles youre going to see signs to route take the eastbound youll hit the washington beltway thats in just about an hour i told you not to get off the highway marsha said again george huffed how was i supposed to know some little one horse town would block off the streets if youre not in a hurry devin continued call as a lake you can turn around and pull into that field where theres a sign for parking its free we got nice parade here he glanced over as a junior majorette tossed up her baton and snagged it to the ful applause of the crowd i can give you a nice pretty route into d c i havent got time for any damn out his cheeks george slapped the sedan in devin could hear them arguing as he jockeyed into a turn and headed off aint that a shame devin muttered and turned nearly knocking cassie over he grabbed instinctively then let her go as if her skin had burned his hands sorry didnt see you i thought i should wait until youd finished being diplomatic yeah george and marsha dont know what theyre missing smiling she watched the senior majorettes twirl and tumble but in her mind she was still seeing devin in his uniform so competent and male i know you must he hot would you like me to get you a drink no im fine ah his tongue was in knots he didnt know the last time hed seen her in shorts and over the years hed done his best not to think about her legs now here they were all long and smooth showcased by neat little cuffed shorts the color of plums wheres emma shes made friends with the little mccutcheon girl lucy theyre in her yard it was easier to talk to him if she wasnt looking at him so cassie concentrated on the slowmoving convertible and its passenger the waving and flouncly dressed current agriculture princess are you angry with me devin no of course not he stared so hard at the princess that she flashed him a brilliant hopeful smile and a very personal wave but it was cassie he saw looking shocked and delicate and beautiful youve flustered julie cassie murmured noting the exchange julie whos julie her quick laugh surprised them both then they were staring at each other are you sure youre not mad no yes yes im sure he jammed his hands into his pockets where they would be safe not at you at me like i said i was out of line the other day i didnt mind the blare of the next band rang in his ears he was sure he hadnt heard her correctly excuse me i said i she broke off when his twoway squawked sheriff sheriff this heres donhie we got a little situation down to quadrant c you there sheriff quadrant c my butt devin muttered hes at the elementary school watching too many dragnet reruns ill let you go cassie said quickly as he will out his twoway youre busy if youd he cursed again because she was ready hurrying through the cheering crowd kade he snapped into the receiver the little situation turned out to be a between overly loyal students at rival high devin broke it up snarled at donnie then mother deal with her terrified daughter her breakfast over the idea of twirling her public by the time the last marching boot clicked the l flag waved and the last balloon drifted into the had to oversee the traffic headed for the cleanup detail and help a couple of weeping children find their way back to mama he took his time cooling off under the stingy of his office shower then gratefully retired his form until the next official event by the time he it to the park and snuck the cruiser in behind a trail of cars the picnic with its grilling food and boisterous games was well under way there was softball horseshoes pitching contests eggthrowing contests threelegged races he saw shane nuzzling frannie spader the curry redhead he had so generously offered devin a few days before there was rafe stepping up to bat and jared winding up to pitch regan and savannah were spread out in the shade with their babies there were dogs and kids bigbellied men sitting in lawn chairs discussing sports and politics old women fanning themselves and laughing there was cy the town mayor looking ridiculous as always sporting a pair of violently checkered bermuda shorts that still exposed far too much of his hairy legs mrs metz was shouting encouragement to her grandchildren gnawing on a chicken leg and gossiping with miss sarah jane good god devin thought he really loved them all of them he wandered over the grass stopping here and there to chat or listen to a complaint or a snippet of news with his hands tucked in his back pockets be watched solemnly with old mr wineburger as horseshoes were tossed and clanged against the pole he was debating different techniques of horseshoe pitching when emma came up quietly and held out her arms he picked her up settled her on his hip while wineburger wheezed out opinions but devins mind had begun to wander little emma smelled like sunshine and was as tiny as a fairy but she was nearly seven now he recalled with a jolt soon she wouldnt want to be picked up and held she would like the young girls he saw over at the edge of the field be flirting with young boys want to be left alone to experiment with being male he sighed and gave her a quick squeeze how come youre sad she wanted to know im not im just thinking that youre growing up on me how about a snow cone okay a purple one a purple one he agreed and set her down hands linked they walked toward the machine manned by the american legion he bought two then settled down with her on the grass to watch the soft ball match come on dev from his position at second rafe shouted to his brother batter up im not moving ive got me a pretty girl here he shouted back mama says im pretty too he smiled at emma ruffled her hair thats b cause you are mamas pretty she sure is emma cuddled closer knowing his arm would around her just the way she liked it she cries anymore in her innocence she licked at th snow cone and didnt notice the way devins arm taut she used to cry all the time at nighttime but now she doesnt thats good was all devin could manage and we got to have ed the kitten and a brandnew house and nobody yells and breaks things or hits mama now connor gets to play baseball and write stories and i can have lucy come right to my room to play ive got pretty curtains too with puppies on them and new shoes she wiggled her pink sneakers for devins benefit theyre very nice its cause you made him go away the bad man connor said you arrested him and sent him to jail and now he cant hit mama and make her cry she looked up at him her mouth circled with sticky purple her eyes wide and clear i love you oh emma undone he lowered his brow to her soft golden curls i love you too youre my best girl i know she puckered her purple lips and planted a sticky kiss on his cheek im going to get lucy now shes my very best friend she got to her f t smiled her mothers soft smile thank you for the snow cone youre welcome he watched her dance off pretty as a pixie then rubbed his hands over his face it was hard enough being in love with the mother what the hell was he going to do with this need for the child was he going to have to settle always for protecting for watching over for being the dependable friend the favored honorary uncle he was getting damn sick of it of holding in of holding back this time when rafe called out devin got to his feet yeah he thought hed batter up all right god knew he needed to hit something there was something intrinsically satisfying about smacking a little white ball with a slim wooden bat it was the connection the way the power of it sang up the arms it was the sound the solid crack the whoosh of air the rising cheers as the ball lifted he was feeling human by the time he rounded third and headed for home more than human since it turned out to be shane guarding the plate his lips peeled back in a feral grin matching his brothers as he went into a hard bruising headfirst slide there was the brutal collision of flesh and bone the swirl of choking dust the hysterical screams of fans and teammates he heard shane grunt as his elbow whipped around to catch his brother in the ribs beside the padded catchers vest he saw stars as some bony part probably shanes knee caught him beside the ear but what he heard over it all was the glorifying call of safe ill be damned shane had managed to hold on to the ball that jared had bulleted to him even after the nasty collision i tagged the sucker shane insisted waving the ball for emphasis cy the umpire hung tough you werent on the plate shane devin was you didnt get the tag in time that of course was tantamount to a declaration of war from the sidelines savannah watched the very polished attorney jared mackade go nosetonose with the towns mayor while her brothersinlaw shouted at each other and anyone else who happened to get in the way i love picnics savannah commented mmm me too regan stretched her arms theyre so relaxing she smiled up at cassie who stepped under the shade with them dont worry she said noting the way cassie hugged her arms they wont hurt each other very much i know she tried not to be so poorspirited the mackades were always yelling but she hugged herself tighter when she saw connor and bryan race up to get a piece of the action dont worry regan said again no i wont it was good wasnt it that connor could race and shout that way hed been too quiet for too long too worried she thought guiltily he was coming into himself more and more every day and if picking sides over a baseball ball made him happy then no she wouldnt let herself worry it was over soon enough with vows of revenge and retaliation she watched bryan do a victory boogie then nag until he was allowed up to the plate devin picked up a mitt bent over and said something that had connor goggling with pleasure her son raced into the outfield and joined the game hes awfully good with children cassie murmured devin she added every time he comes by the house he has nate on his hip the minute he steps through the door regan smiled down at her son who was busy chewing on a bright red teething ring hes bleeding alarmed cassie looked down at nate where no i meant devin his mouths bleeding anyone got a tissue i do cassie pulled one out of her pocket as she hurried over to where devin was walking to the outfield regan grinned she hasnt figured it out yet has she nope savannah leaned back against the tree layla was napping and that seemed like a wonderful idea hes going to have to do something a little more obvious for her to realize hes crazy about her hes the only mackade i know who moves slow savannah arched a brow before she closed her eyes ill bet he moves fast enough when the time comes cassie wont have a chance no regan said softly shell have the best chance of her life out of breath from the effort of catching up with his long strides cassie called out devin wait a minute he glanced around saw her rushing after him and did what hed trained himself to do he put his hands in his pockets what your mouth gosh you must be all leg she managed puffing when she stopped in front of him my mouth its bleeding in practiced maternal gestures she dabbed at the corner of his mouth i saw you dive headfirst into shane i had to close my eyes youre lucky you only cut your lip doing something that crazy its only a game its baseball he reminded her and struggled not to groan as her fingers gently soothed the wound he hadnt even been aware of i got the run yes i know im learning all the rules and terms rbis and eras connors so excited about playing it was sweet of you to let him go into left field right right field devin managed as his heart jitterbugged in his chest he kept his hands balled into fists in his pockets cassie im fine it was the tone the sharp impatience in it that had her stopping you are mad at me im not mad at you amn it im not mad look frustrated beyond belief he snatched the bloodspotted tissue from her hands whats this its blood i told you your mouth blood he said interrupting her thats what ive got in my veins blood not ice water so if youre going to keep leaning up against me and putting your hands on my face i he cut himself off clenched his teeth im not mad he said more calmly i need to take a walk cassie gnawed at her lip as she strode away into the little grove of trees that lined the east side of the park the idea of losing his friendship gave her all the courage she needed to follow him he stopped turned and the heat in his eyes was like an arrow in her heart tin sorry she said quickly im sorry devin dont say youre sorry to me cassie you have nothing to apologize for where the hell was everybody he asked himself why werent there people in the grove he couldnt risk being alone with her now when he didnt have himself under complete control go on back cassie go on now she started to it was second nature for her to do as she was told but she couldnt not this time not when it was so important if youre not mad then youre upset i dont want to be the cause of that it was hard almost terrifying to step forward when there was still temper simmering in his eyes she knew he wouldnt hurt her of course she knew but there was a part of her that couldnt be entirely sure but for devin shed risk it its because i kissed you she blurted out i didnt mean anything by it the temper drained from his eyes there were blank now carefully blank i know you didnt you kissed me back her heart was pounding so hard she could barely hear herself speak you said you were angry with yourself for doing it but i dont want you to be i didnt mind you didnt mind he repeated spacing out the words okay well put it aside go on back now why did you kiss me like that the words ended on a whisper as her courage began to flag like i told you you caught me off guard when she only continued to stare at him with those big soft eyes he felt something snap damn it what do you want from me i apologized didnt i i said it wouldnt happen again im trying to stay away from you and its killing me ive waited to kiss you for twelve years and when i do i practically eat you alive i didnt mean to hurt you her knees were starting to shake but it didnt feel like fear she knew fear well enough to recognize it but whatever this was that was working through her was unfamiliar you didnt hurt me she had to swallow i didnt mind i dont mind he was trying to get a bead on her but wasnt sure of his aim i want to kiss you again i dont mind she repeated because it was the best she could do she didnt move as he stepped toward her had no idea if she should touch him she would have liked to run her hands up those arms they were so strong but she wasnt sure then she didnt have to worry or think or try to guess he laid his hands on her cheeks framing her face and lowered his mouth to hers so gently so patiently her heart fluttered and the sensation was sweet like something flying silently out of a cage when the door has been opened unexpectedly when he drew her closer just a little closer she thought she floated toward him her lips parted on a sigh of quiet wonder this was what he meant to do always show her tenderness and care let himself slide into her slowly gently the dappled shade was perfect sweetened by the call of birds and the tang of wildflowers this was what hed meant to do he thought hazily and deepened the kiss with patient skill until she sighed again and all the years hed waited and wanted seemed like minutes now that she was here with him the sound of the shouts and laughter from the field beyond was like the buzz of happy bees in her head she didnt realize shed lifted her hands curled them around his wrists until she felt the strong quick beat of his pulse against her fingers she held on as lovely colors began to revolve in her head as the kiss went on and on spinning out time he didnt let her go until her hands had slipped weakly from his wrists to fall to her sides her eyes were still dosed when he lifted his head when he moved his hands from her face to her shoulders as he watched she pressed her lips together as if io draw in that last taste and savor it cassie she opened her eyes and they were heavy and clouded and confused i dont know what to say now yes she did she realized will you kiss me again twelve years of repression kept him from groaning out loud not just this minute he said and held her at arms length any closer and he might just toss her over his shoulder and carry her off behind some handy rock he wasnt sure either of them was ready for that i figure we ought to spread it out a little no ones ever kissed me like that made me feel like this cassie the words had his libido growing fangs snapping down on it he took her hand lets go back i havent had lunch oh you must be starving right he could almost laugh at himself as he pulled her back onto the field chapter i really appreciate this cassie regan tucked a giggling nate into his portable swing then bent over to kiss him as he bounced gleefully with outoftown clients coming into the shop this morning i just cant keep him with me and rafes got two crews to supervise its a real hardship cassie said from the sink i cant think of anything more annoying than having to play with the baby he is wonderful isnt he i cant believe hes already five months old when she cranked up the music on the swing nate began to kick his feet in delight i nursed him an hour ago and ive got plenty of bottles here and diapers and two changes of clothes and regan i know what to do with a baby of course you do grinning foolishly at nate regan swept her hair back its just that i know youre so busy with the inn you and rare are slave drivers its true but im learning to bear up amused regan cocked her head youre joking and youre smiling and im pretty sure i heard you singing when i came in im happy cassie loaded plates into the dishwasher the breakfast hour was over and the guests were either gone or relaxing in their rooms i didnt know i could be this happy thi is the most wonderful house in the world regan handed nate a ring of colorful plastic to jiggle so working here makes you happy absolutely not that wasnt happy working for ed but i love living here regan she beamed at the view from the window the kids love living here regan ran her tongue around her teeth and thats why you were singing cassie bent over a little farther busied herself arranging dishes actually there is something else i guess youve got to go open the shop ive got a few minutes one of the perks of running my own business if there was anyone she could talk to it was regan cassie straightened took a deep breath devin its about devin that is im probably making too much of it or not making enough of it its just well do you want some coffee cassie he kissed me she blurted out then slapped a hand to her mouth when a laugh bubbled out i mean kissed me not like rare kisses me or shane or jared i mean like my hands are sweating its about time regan said with feeling i thought hed never get to it youre not surprised cassie the man would crawl naked over hot coals for you she decided she would have some coffee and walked over to the stove to pour it herself so how was it regans statement had cassie running a nervous hand through her hair how was what with a chuckle regan sipped and leaned back against the counter i have to figure that he has more in common with rafe than a quick temper and great looks so it must have been a pretty terrific kiss it was at the picnic two days ago my heads still buzzing yep thats a mackade for you what are you going to do about it i dont know what to do brow creased cassie picked up a damp rag and began to wipe the counter regan i started going with joe before i was sixteen ive never been with anyone else oh regan pursed her lips i see well it would be only natural to be a little nervous over the idea that you might be heading toward a physical relationship because her palms were indeed damp cassie set down the cloth and rubbed them on her apron i dont like sex she said flatly rattling dishes again so that she didnt note the lift of regans brow or the concern in her friends eyes im not any good at it and i just dont like it anyway cassie i know the counseling helped you yes it did and im grateful for you persuading me to go i feel better about myself and im more confident about a lot of things i know i didnt deserve to be abused that i didnt cause it and that i did the right thing by getting out she let out a breath this is a different matter not all women are built to enjoy sex ive read about it anyway she continued before regan could comment im getting ahead of myself but im not stupid regan i know that devin has needs and im prepared to meet them that is stupid regan snapped making love is not supposed to be a chore like like flustered she gestured to the sink like doing the damn dishes i didnt mean it that way because regan was her friend she smiled what i meant was that i care for devin i always have this is a different level i didnt know he was attracted to me im so flattered regans response to that was a muttered curse that only made her smile widen well i am hes so beautiful and hes kind i know he wont hurt me no regan said quietly he wouldnt hurt you but she thought would you hurt him kissing him was lovely and i think having sex with him would be nice wisely regan covered her cough with a sip of coffee if devin was anything like rafe nice was hardly the word has he asked you to bed no he wouldnt even kiss me again when i asked him to thats what i wanted to ask you about how do i go about letting him know i dont mind being with him that way it was a tribute to her willpower that regan didnt goggle carefully she set the coffee cup aside this goes against the grain for me cassie against every feminist cell in my body but i have to trust my instincts here and go with what i know about you and about devin im going to advise you to let him set the pace at least initially take your cues from him just relax and enjoy the ride i think you can count on him to get you both where you want to go when youre ready cassie its important to think of yfurself too not just dotin so i really shouldnt do anything do what seems right to you and do this dont compare him with joe and dont compare the woman who lived with joe with the woman you are now i think youre in for a few surprises ive already had one cassie touched a fingertip to her lips it was wonderful good keep an open mind she gave cassie a quick kiss bent down to fuss over nate one last time and cass i really wouldnt mind if you sort of kept me uptodate with the progress by midafternoon cassie had finished the guest rooms and the laundry and had nate tucked in a portable crib in emmas room for a nap shed slipped a chicken in the oven to roast and was giving some thought to tackling the mending when she heard the quick rap on her door her heart did a little flip at the hope that it might be devin stopping by but settled again when she saw her mother through the screen hello mama dutifully cassie opened the door and pecked her mothers dry cheek its nice to see you ive just made some iced tea and i have some nice cherry cobbler you know i dont eat sweets in the middle of the day constance connor scanned the living area of her daughters quarters she wrinkled her nose at the cat that curled under the table animals belonged outside the curtains were drawn back which would surely fade th upholstery with that strong sunlight but it was neat shed taught her daughter to be neat after all cleanliness was next to godliness still she didnt care for the bright colors or all the folderols sitting about it was showy she sniffed to indicate her disapproval and sat down on one of the living room chairs her back broomstickstraight ill say again its a poor choice for you to live in a mans house who isnt your husband it was an old argument and cassie answered by rote i lived in mr hallerans house for nearly ten years and paid good rent i earn my keep here whats the difference you know very well the difference so ill not mention it again until the next time cassie thought wearily would you like some iced tea mama i can get through an hour without sipping or snacking constance set her purse firmly on her lap crossed her ankles above her sensible shoes sit down cassandra the children are in school i take it yes theyre doing very well theyll be home in about an hour i hope youll stay and see them its you ive come to see she unsnapped her bag with fingers adorned with only a thin gold band there was no glint to it no shine as cassie thought there had been no glint or shine to her parents marriage she often thought after a visit with her mother that her father had died simply to escape it but she said nothing waiting as her mother drew out an envelope she didnt have to see the handwriting to know who it was from this is the latest letter i received from your husband it came in this mornings mail constance held it out i want you to read it cassie folded her hands in her lap linked her fingers no eyes narrowed with righteous anger constance studied her daughter cassandra you will read this letter no maam wont hes not my husband constances thin pale face went dark with temper you took vows before god and ive broken them it was hard so hard to keep her voice and hands from trembling to keep her eyes level you take pride in that you should be ashamed no not pride but

constances mouth was a thin line if you forced him to discipline you discipline me stunned even after all the time that had passed cassie leaped to her feet he had no right to discipline me i was his wife not his dog and not even a dog deserved to be treated the way i was he would have disciplined me to death if i hadnt finally found the courage to do something about it would that have satisfied you mama id have kept my vows then till death do us part youre overdramatizing and whatever happened before is done hes seen his mistakes it was the drink the women who tempted him hes asking for your forgiveness and hopes that you will keep your vows as he intends to he cant have my forgiveness and he cant have me how can you do this to me im your daughter your only child cassies eyes were no

do as youre told yes thats all you ever wanted from me to do what i was told to be what you expected me to be why do you think i married him mama cassie couldnt believe the words were coming out of her mouth but they wouldnt be stopped just as the emotions that pushed them from her heart to her throat and through her lips wouldnt be stopped it was to get away from you to get out of that house where nobody ever laughed nobody ever showed any affection you had a good home this time it was constance whose voice trembled you had a decent christian upbringing no i didnt theres nothing decent or christian about a house where theres no love my children wont be raised that way not anymore cassie spoke calmly now amazed that she could fascinated that she felt nothing at all youre my mother and ill give you all the respect that i can all im asking is for you to give me the same i dont want you corresponding with joe anymore constance got to her feet you would dare tell me what to do will you stop writing him mama will you stop writing the prison authorities i will not then youre not welcome in my home we have nothing else to say to each other staggered constance could only stare youll come to your senses i have come to them goodbye mama cassie walked to the door and held it open she stiffened when constanceswept by and then the trembling began slowly unsure of her footing cassie walked to the table she braced herself on it as she lowered herself into a chair wrapping her arms tight around her body she began to rock she was still sitting there when devin came to the door ten minutes later he started to give a friendly rap on the wooden slat of the screen but then he saw her saw the way her shoulders were hunched and curled and the quick monotonous rocking of her body as if she were trying to still something inside herself or comfort it hed seen her like that before sitting in his office with her face battered all he knew was that she was hurt and he was through the door like a bullet the heart ol devin mac lode cassie she sprang to her feet he saw alarm mix with the hurt even as he reached out she scooted back out of his way devin i didnt hear you come up i was i should her mind raced for excuses for the barrier of appearances as always pale with grief her eyes swimming with it she stared at him then she began to move quickly let me get you some iced tea its fresh she was hurrying for glasses for the pitcher her movements jerky tve got some cobbier i just made it this morning she jolted like a spring when his hands came down on her shoulders and the glass she had just filled smashed on the tiles the cat that had been napping under the table took off in a blur of fur oh god look what ive done her breathing hitched and the feeling in her chest tightened she couldnt stop it i have to i have to leave it he struggled to keep his voice easy as he turned her to face him she was shaking hard trying to pull back not this time was all he could think not this time come here he murmured come on now the instant he drew her into his arms the dam broke she wept against his shoulder the fast hot tears soaking his shirt he kissed her hair stroked her back tell me tell me whats wrong so i can help it wasnt coherent nor was it complete but h understood the gist when she stuttered out words between sobs bitter fury curled inside him as he soothed her kissing her wet cheeks you did what you had to do you did what was right shes my mother cassie lifted her ravaged face to his i sent her away i turned my mother away who turned who away cass her breath sobbed out again and her hands balled into fistson his shoulders its not right get away from her the screen door slammed as connor burst through it his own hands were fisted and his face was flushed with fury taut with violence all he saw was a man holding his mother and his mother crying if you touch her ill kill you connor shock had cassies voice ringing sharp was this her baby with his fists raised and his eyes fierce she caught a glimpse of emmfi at the door her frightened face pressed to the screen don speak that way to sheriff mackade every cell on alert connor stepped forward take your hands off my mother intrigued devin merely lifted a brow and let his arms fall to his sides i said not to speak that way cassie began he was hurting you he made you cry connor bared his teeth a tenyearold warrior he better leave right now he wasnt hurting me though she was shaken to the core cassie stepped between them i was upsetgrandma upset me and sheriff mackade was helping to make me feel better i want you to apologize this minute devin saw the boys arms drop and knew when the angry flush on connors cheeks turned to shame with his eyes on the boy he laid a hand on cassies shoulder id like to talk to connor alone anticipating her protest he gave cassies shoulder a quick squeeze cass the babys crying why dont you and emma go see to him nate i forgot at her wits end cassie dragged a hand through her hair why dont you go on devin said giving her a gentle nudge con and i are going to take a walk all right come on emma nates crying but she took a deep breath as she held out a hand for her daughter i expect you to apologize connor you understand yes maam with his chin on his chest connor turned to go outside he knew what was coming he was going to get whipped his father had always done the hitting away from the house away where his mother couldnt see and wouldnt know hed get a beating now for sure and it would be worse than anything his father had ever done to him because hed tried to do what was right and hed been wrong devin said nothing at all just walked with the boy across the lawn toward the woods that bordered it he chose the path without thinking the woods were as familiar to him as the town as his own home as his own mind beside him connor walked stiffly his head drooped in shame his back braced because he knew he had to gauge his timing and his moves devin resisted the urge to drape his arm over those thin little shoulders instead he led the way down a path and stopped at the cluster of rocks where two soldiers had once met and doomed each other he sat and the boy stood rigid and waiting im awfully proud of you connor the words the last hed expected to hear had the boys head whipping trp sir casually devin took out a cigarette the first of a very long day i have to tell you its a relief to me i worry about your mother some shes had a bad time of it knowing youre there to look after things makes my mind a lot easier connors confusion was too huge for him to feel any pride he stared at devin his eyes still wary i i sassedtou i dont think so youre not going to hit me devins hand stiffened hesitated very slowly he tossed the barely smoked cigarette on the ground and crushed it under his heel as he would have liked to crush joe dolin im never going to raise my hand to you not today not any day he spoke deliberately his eyes level with connors as a man would speak to another man im never going to raise it to your mama or to your sister but he held out that hand and waited im giving you my word connor he said when the boy simply stared at the hand being offered id be grateful if youd take it dumbfounded connor put his hand in devins yes sir devin gave the hand a little squeeze tugged the boy a little closer and grinned youd have torn right into me wouldnt you id have tried the emotions swirling inside connor were frightening most of all he was afraid he would cry now and show devin he was just a stupid little boy after all i never helped her before i never did anything it wasnt your fault connor i never did anything connor repeated he hit her all the time sheriff all the time i know no you dont you only know about when one of the neighbors would call you or when hed get so drunk hed hit her someplace where it would show but there was more it was worse dcvin nodded there was nothing else he could do and drew the boy down on the rocks beside him he hit you too when she couldnt see bravery forgotten connor pressed his face into devins side when she didnt know dcvin stared off into the trees eaten away by a useless anger at what he hadnt been able to prevent emma no sir he never paid much attention to emma because she was just a girl dont tell mama please dont tell her he hit me shed just feel bad i wont i hate him id kill him if i could i know how you feel when the boy shook his head devin drew him back looked deep into his eyes i do know im going to tell you something i used to fight a lot i know connor sniffled but was profoundly grateful hed controlled the tears people talk about it yeah i know they do i used to like it and i used to think there were lots of people i wanted to rip into sometimes i had reason for it sometimes i didnt anyway i had to learn to take a step back its important that step now you figure you owe your father some grief dont call him that connor snapped out then flushed darkly sir all right i figure you owe him some too but youve got to take that step back let the law handle it im not ever going to let him or anybody hurt her again im with you there studying connors determined face he decided the boy deserved to know the situation im going to give it to you straight okay yes sir your grandma got your mama real upset today she wants him to come back its never going to happen i wont let it happen your mama feels the same way and thats why she sent your grandma away that was hard for her real hard connor but she did it you were helping her im sorry i dont apologize devin said quickly i mean it i know cassie thinks you should but we know how things stand you did exactly right connor id have done the same no compliment hed ever received no praise from a teacher no highfive from a teammate had ever meant more he had done what sheriff mackade would do im glad you want to help her ill do anything you want me to do that kind of trust devin thought was worth more than gold i need to tell you that theyve given joe work release connors face tightened up i know about it kids at school say things they giving you a rough time he moved a shoulder not as much as they used to learning to handle yourself devin thought with an astonishing sense of pride what i want is for you not to worry too much but more i want you to keep your eyes open youre smart and you notice things thats why you write good stories connor wriggled with pleasure i like to write i know and you know how to look at things how to watch so i know youre going to watch out for your family if you see something hear something even feel something that doesnt sit right i want you to come to me i want your word on that yes sir do you have to call me sir all the time it makes me feel creaky connor flushed and grinned im supposed to its like a rule i know all about rules devin decided they could deal with that little matter later a man would be lucky to have you for a son connor i dont ever want to have a father again the hand that had lifted toward connors shoulder stiffened biting back a sigh devin ordered it to relax then ill say a man would be lucky to have you for a friend are we square here yes sir there were those eyes again devin thought filled with trust your mamas probably worried youre beating me up when connor giggled at the idea devin ruffled his hair you go on back now and tell her we straightened it all out ill talk to her later yes sir he scrambled off the rocks then had to bite his lip to spark that last bit of courage can i come to your office sometime and watch you work sure i wouldnt get in the way id justin connor tumbled over his own words and skidded to a halt i can sure you can anytime its mostly boring it couldnt be connor said with giddy pleasure thanks sheriff thanks for everything devin watched the boy race off then settled back he wished briefly for a cigarette before reminding himself he was quitting then he reminded himself that sooner or later he intended to have those two children and maybe another on the way connor didnt want another father and that would be a tough one so devin mused hed just have to find the right path to take and step carefully the first step of course was cassie one step then the next direction always took you somewhere if he was careful she would be taking those steps with him chapter it was supposed to be devins day off but he spent two hours in the morning dealing with a small crisis at the high school the smoke bomb had failed in its mission when it landed in the girls locker room it hadnt put out much of a cloud and more important hadnt made the girls come rushing out screaming in their underwear the one hed put together a short lifetime ago had had far more satisfying results not that hed mentioned that particular incident to the two offenders he coil area once he had it under control and the juvenile chemists shaking in their basketball shoes he headed straight for the inn he had a surprise for cassie one he hoped would make her smile and one he hoped would ease the way into that next step he supposed he had an unfair advantage he knew her so well had watched and observed for years he knew every expression of her face every gesture of her hands he knew her weaknesses and her strengths she knew him he thought but not in the same way or in the same detail shed been too busy surviving to notice if she had noticed she would have been able to see that he was in love with her it was just as well she didnt see not until hed finished laying the foundation he could take his time about that devin mused as he turned up the lane toward the inn but once he had that foundation in place and solid he was going to move fast twelve years was a damn long time to wait because there was a car parked in one of the guest slots he opted to go into the inn first he was delighted to find her there fully occupied with two snowyhaired women shed forgotten to take her apron off the new arrivals had come unexpectedly and they had wanted a full tour and the history of the inn cassie was grateful shed finished the breakfast dishes even though shed been caught in the middle of vacuuming the two women were sisters both widowed and were eager to hear about the barlow legend cassie led them back down the stairs after the tour of the second floor and was well into her spiel when devin walked in the bloodiest single day of the civil war the antietam battlefield is one of the most pristine parks in the country the visitors center is only four miles from here and very informative youll find oh hello devin dont let me interrupt ladies mrs berman mrs cox this is sheriff mackade sheriff mrs cox adjusted her glasses and beamed through the lenses how exciting antietams a quiet town he told her certainly more quiet than it was in september of because tourists inevitably enjoyed it devin grinned youre standing right about on the spot where a confederate soldier was killed oh my goodness mrs cox clapped her hands together did you hear that irma nothing wrong with my ears marge mrs betman peered down at the stairs as if inspecting for blood mrs dolin was telling us something of the history we decided to visit the inn because we read one of the brochures that claimed it was haunted yes maam it surely is sheriff mackades brother owns the inn cassie explained he can tell you quite a bit about it you cant do better than to hear it from mrs dolin devin corrected she lives with the ghosts every day tell them about the two corporals cassie though she told the story several times each week cassie had to struggle not to feel selfconscious in front of devin she folded her hands over her apron two young soldiers she began became separated from their regiments during the battle of antietam eacl wandered into the woods beyond the inn some say they were looking for their way back to the battle others say they were just trying to go home still legend holds that they met there fought there each of them young frightened lost they would have heard the battle still raging in the fields over the hills but this was one on one strangers and enemies cause one wore blue and the other gray poor boys mrs berman murmured they wounded each other badly and crawled off in different directions one the confederate made his way here to this house its said he thought he was coming home because all he wanted in the end was his home and his family one of the servants found him and brought him into the house the mistress here was a southern woman her name was abigail abigail obrian barlow she had married a wealthy yankee a man she didnt love but was bound to by her vows devins brow lifted it was a new twist a new detail to the legend he had known since childhood she saw the boy a reminder of her own home and her own youth her heart went out to him for that and simply because he was hurt she ordered him to be taken upstairs where his wounds would be tended she spoke to him reassured him held his hand in hers as the servant carried him up these stairs she knew that she could never go home again but she wanted to be sure the boy could the war had shown her cruelty useless struggle and the terribi pain of loss as her marriage had if she could do this one thing she thought help this one boy she could hear it mrs cox took out tissues handed one to her sister and blew her own nose hard but her husband came to the stairs cassie continued she didnt hate him then she didnt love him but shed been taught to respect and obey the man she had married and the father of her children he had a gun and she saw what he meant to do in his eyes she shouted for him to stop begged him the boys hand was in hers and his eyes were on her face and if she had had the courage she would have thrown her body over his to protect him to save not only him but everything shed already lost now it was cassie who looked down at the stairs sighed over them but she didnt have the courage her husband fired the gun and killed him even as she held the boys hand he died here the young soldier and so did she in her heart she never spoke to her husband again but she learned how to hate and she grieved from that day until she died two years later and often very often you can smell the roses she loved in the house and hear her weeping oh what a sad sad story mrs cox wiped at her eyes irma have you ever heard such a sad story mrs berman sniffed shed have done better to have taken the gun and shot the louse yes cassie smiled a little maybe thats one of the reasons she still weeps she shook off the mood of the story and led the ladies the rest of the way down the steps if youd like to make yourselves at home in the parlor ill bring in the tea i promised you that would be lovely mrs cox told her still sniffling such a beautiful house such lovely furniture all of the furnishings come from past times mrs mackades shop on main street in town if you have time you might want to go in and browse she has beautiful things and offers a tenpercent discount to any guest of the inn ten percent mrs berman murmured and eyed a graceful hall rack devin would you like to have some tea it took an effort to move he wondered if she knew that connor got his flair for telling a story from his mother ill take a rain check on that i have something in the car for upstairs for your place oh ladies nice to have met you enjoy your stay at the mackade inn and in the town what a handsome man mrs cox said with a little pat of her hand to her heart my goodness irma have you ever seen a more handsome young man but mrs berman was busy sizing up the dropleaf tablein the parlor by the time cassie had settled the ladies in with theft tea her curiosity was killing her she had chores to see to and she scolded herself for letting them lag as she hurried around to the outside stairs halfway up she saw devin hooking up a porch swing oh it made a lovely picture she thought a man standing in the sunlight his shirtsleeves rolled up tools at his feet muscles working as he lifted one end of the heavy wooden seat to its chain this seemed like the spot for it yes its perfect rare didnt mention that he wanted one i wanted one devin told her dont worry i ran it by him he hooked the other end and gave it a testing swing works bending he gathered up the tools going to try it out with me i really have to try it out with me devin finished setting the tools aside in their case i put it up because i figured it was a good way to get you to it with me on a summer afternoon a good way for me to kiss you again oh you said you didnt mind no i didnt i dont there it was again that flutter in her chest arent you supposed to be working its my day off sort of he held out a hand then curled his fingers around hers you look pretty today cassie automatically she brushed at her apron ive been cleaning real pretty he murmured drawing her to the swing and down i should get you something cold to drink you know one of these days youre going to figure out that i dont come around so you can serve me cold drinks connor said you worried about me you dont have to i was hoping youd come by so i could tell you how much i appreciate what you did for him the day the way you made him feel i didnt do anything he earned what he felt youve got a fine boy in connor i know she took a deep breath and relaxed enough to lean back against the seat the rhythn the swing took her back far back to childhood ano sweet days endless summers her lips curved a then she laughed whats funny its just this sitting here on a porch swing likea couple of teenagers well if you were sixteen again this would he next move he lifted up his arms stretched one drape casually over her shoulders subtle she laughed again tilted her face toward when i was sixteen you were too bad to everybody knew how you snuck off to the girls and the best way to so gently savoring the quick tremor of her lips body not so subtle he said quietly wanna quarry when she s uttered he only l ughed other time for now id settle for you kissing me kiss me back cassie like you were sixteen and have a worry in the world with someone else anyone else he mi am used by the concentration on her face but his heart the way her mouth lifted to his that tant pressure the unschooled way her hands lifted to rest on his shoulders relax he said against her mouth turn off your head for a minute can you do that i dont she didnt turn it off it shut off when his tongue danced lightly over hers when his hands skimmed down her sides and up again down and up in firm steady strokes that had the heels of his hands just brushing the sides of her breasts i love the taste of you he pressed his lips toher jaw her temples back to her lips ive dreamed of it you have most of my life ive wanted to be with you like this for years forever the words were seeping through that lovely haze of pleasure that covered her whenever he kissed her but you got married he trailed his lips down her cheek i didnt move fast enough i got drunk the day you married joe dolin blind fallingdown drunk i didnt know what else to do i thought about killing him but i figured you must have wanted him so that was that devin i dont understand this if hed stop kissing her just for a minute she might be able to understand but he couldnt seem to stop any of it i loved you so much i thought id die from it just keel right over and die panic and denial had her struggling away you couldnt have hed said too much but the regrets would have to come later now hed finish it tve loved you for over twelve years cassandra i loved you when you were married to another man when you had his children i loved you when i couldnt do anything to help you out of that hell you were living in i love you now she got up and in an old defensive habit wrapped her arms tight around her body thats not possible dont tell me what i feel she jolted back a full step at the anger in his tone making him clench his teeth as he rose and dont you cringe away from me when i raise my voice i cant be what im not not even for you but im not joe dolin ill never hit you i know that she let her arms drop i know that devin even as she said it she watched him struggle to push back the worst of his temper i dont want you to be angry with me devin but i dont know what to say to you seems like ive already said more than enough he began to pace his hands jammed in his pockets tin good at taking things slow thinking them through but not this time ive said what ive said cass and i cant wont take it back youre going to have to decide what you want to do about it do about what baffled she lifted her hands then let them fall you want me to believe that a man like you had feelings for me all these years and didnt do anything about it what the hell was i supposed to do he tossed back you were married youd made your choice and it wasnt me i didnt know there was a choice my mistake he said bitterly now ive made another one because youre not ready or yo dont want to be ready or maybe you just dont want me i dont she lifted her hands to her checks she honestly didnt know which if any of those alternatives was true i cant think youve been my friend youve been well the sheriff and ive been so grateful dont you dare say that to me devin shouted the words and was too twisted with pain and fury to norice that she went white as death damn it i dont want you to be grateful im not playing public servant with you i dont deserve that i didnt mean devin im sorry im so sorry the hell with being sorry he raged the hell with gratitude you want to be grateful i locked the son of a bitch up who was pounding on you then be grateful to the badge not to me because i wanted to break him in half you want to be grateful ive been coming around here being the nice guy like some lovewhipped mongrel dog dont because what ive wanted to do is he bit that back his eyes cutting through her like hot knives you dont want to know no what you want is for me to keep my voice down my feelings inside and my hands to myself no thats not you dont mind if i kiss you but then youre so damn grateful its the least you can do her stumbling protest fell apart thats not fair im tired of being fair im tired of waiting for you im tired of being torn up in love with you the hell with it he strode by her and was halfway down the stairs before her legs unfroze she raced after him devin devin please dont go this way let me he jerked away from her light touch on his shoulder whirled on her leave me alone now cass you want to leave me be now she knew that look though she had never expected to see it aimed from his eyes into hers it was a mans bitter fury she had reason to fear it her stomach clenched painfully but she made herself stand her ground he would never know how much it cost her you never told me she said fighting to keep her voice slow and even you never let me see now you have and you wont give me time to think to know what to do you dont want to hear that im sorry that im grateful that im afraid but im all of those things and i cant help it i cant make myself into what anyone else expects me to be ever again ill lose everything this time if i could do it for anyone id do it for you but i cant thats clear enough he knew he was wrt ng not completely wrong but wrong enough it just didnt seem to matter compared with this ragged tearing hurt inside of him the thing youve got twisted around cass is that i dont want you to be anything but what you are once you figure that out you know where to find me she opened her mouth again then closed it when he strode away there was nothing else she could say to him now nothing else she could do she felt raw inside and her throat hurt and it was hurt that had been in his eyes she thought closing her own hurt that she had caused without ever meaning to devin mackade loved her the idea left her weak with terror and confusion but bigger even than that was the idea that he had loved her all this time dotin mackade the kindest most admirable man she knew loved her had loved her for years and all she had to give in return was gratitude now she had lost him the friendship she come to cherish the companionship she had grown to depend on shed lost it because he wanted a woman and she was empty inside she didnt weep it was too late for tears instead she rose reminded herself to square her shoulders she went back into the inn through the kitchen there were chores to see to and she could always think more clearly when she was working her latest guests had gone off eager to hunt antiques so cassie went back upstairs and turned on the vacuum shed abandoned when the guests arrived she worked methodically down the hallway room by room the bridal suite abigails room was her favorite but she paid little attention now to the lovely wallpaper with its rosebuds the graceful canopy bed the wash of sunlight through the lace curtains she reminded herself to bring up fresh flowers even when the room wasnt occupied there were always flowers on the table by the window shed forgotten them that morning yet the room smelled of roses powerfully a sudden chill had her shivering she felt him and turned toward the door devin relief confusion sorrow she experienced them all as she took a step toward the doorway but it wasnt devin the man was tall darkhahed and handsome but the face wasnt devins and the clothes were formal oldfashioned her hand went limp on the handle of the vacuum and the sound of it buzzed in her ears abigail come with me take the children and come with me leave this place you dont love him no cassie thought ive never loved him now i despise him cant you see what this is doing to you how long will you stay closed away from life this way its all i can do its the best i can do i love you abby i love you so much i could make you happy if youd only let me well go away from here away from him start our lives over together ive already waited for you so long how can i im bound to him i have the children and you your life is here you cant walk away from the town your responsibilities the people who depend on you you cant settle for another mans wife another mans children theres nothing i wouldnt do for you id kill for you die for you for gods sake abigail give me the chance to love you all these years ive stood by knowing how unhappy you were knowing you were out of reach thats over now hes gone we can leave and be miles from here before he comes back why should either of us settle for less than everythin g i dont want to sit in the parlor with you and pretend i dont love you dont need you i cant keep being only your friend you know i value you depend on you tell me you love me i cant i cant tell you that theres nothing inside me any longer he killed it come with me and live again whatever was there whoever was there faded until there was only the doorway the lovely wallpaper and the strong sad scent of roses cassie found herself standing almost swaying with one hand reaching out to nothing at all the vacuum was still humming as she sank weakly to the floor what had happened here she asked herself had she been dreaming hallucinating she laid a hand on her heart and found it was beating like a wild bird in a cage carefully she let her head drop down to her up drawn knees she had heard the ghosts before felt them now she realized she had seen one not one of the barlows not the poor doomed soldier but the man abigail had loved the man who had loved her who had he been she thought she might never know but his face had been compelling though filled with sorrow his voice strong even when it was pleading why hadnt abigail gone with him why hadnt she taken that hand he reached out to her and run run for her life abigail had loved him cassie drew in a deep breath of that she was sure the emotions that swirled through the room had been so powerful she felt them still there had been love here desperate helpless love is that why you weep cassie wondered because you didnt go and you lost him you didnt reach out and then there was nothing to hold on to you were afraid to love him so you broke his heart just as she had broken devins heart today with a shudder cassie lifted her head why she asked herself out of fear and doubt out of habit that was pathetic all devin had wanted was affection but she hadnt told him that she cared hadnt showed him she cared would she close herself away as abigail had or would she take the chance hadnt she been a coward long enough wiping her damp face she got to her feet she had to go to him she would go to him somehow of course such things are never simple she had children and could hardly leave them to fend for themselves she had guests at the inn and a job to do it took her hours to manage it and with every minute that passed the doubts weighed more heavily she combated them by reminding herself that it didnt matter how clumsy she was he wanted her that would be enough im so grateful ed i know its a lot to ask heyre already settled down in front of the television with a bowl of popcorn ed waved a hand so i closed a little early i get a night off the kids are asleep but still cassie fretted they hardly ever wake up after theyre down dont you worry about those angels and dont worry about the people downstairs she added anticipating cassie they want anything theyll call up here and let me know im going to watch this story i rented then hit the sack you take the bed you promised cassie insisted ill just flop down on the couch when i get back mmhmm ed was betting that wouldnt be until dawn you say hi to devin for me now cassie twisted the collar of her blouse in her fingers im just going over to his office for a little while if you say so honey hes angry with me ed hes so angry with me he might just boot me out ed stopped the videotape she was watching turned around on the couch and gave cassie one long summingup look honey you look at him like that and hes not going to boot you anywhere but into that cot hes got in the back room when cassie wrapped her arms around her body ed only laughed oh you stop that now devins not going to push you into anything a man like that doesnt have to push he just has to be how did you know i was going over there to to try to cassie honey look who youre talking to here ive been around this block plenty you call me ask if id settle in here for the night because you need to see devin im going to figure it out and its long past time if you ask me cassie looked down at her plain cotton blouse and simple trousers her neat fiatheeled shoes hardly the garb of a femme fatale ed im no good at this sort of thing ed cocked her head id wager devins plenty good at it so dont you worry regan said i should let him set the pace maybel shouldnt be going over there sweetie pie sometimes even a real man needs a little kick now you stop secondguessing yourself and wringing your hands go on over there and get him i should do something with my hair cassie fretted and ive chewed off my lipstick havent i maybe i should put on a dress cassie ed tipped down her rhinestone glasses peered over them you look fine you look fresh he doesnt care what youre wearing take my word for it hes only going to care that youre there now go get him all fight cassie squared her shoulders picked up her purse im going im going now but if you need anything just i wont need a thing go im going ed wiggled her bright red brows as cassie went out the door poor kid she thought she looked like she was walking out in front of a firing squad with a cackle ed tipped her glasses back up and flipped the video back on her money was on devin mackade he really should just give it up and go back and crawl into his cot that was what devin told himself but he kept right on sitting at his desk with his nose in a book the story just wasnt holding his interest it wasnt the fault of the author nothing could have held his interest just then he knew it was foolish and useless but hed had nothing and no one to vent his temper on so there it was still curdling inside him hed actually considered heading out to the farm and picking a fight with shane it would have been easy too easy so hed decided against it he told himself it was because he was a better man than that hed have done that sort of thing in his teens hell in his twenties the fact was hed probably have done it last week but it just didnt suit his mood now he was just going to sit here in his quiet office with his feet up on his desk and the chair kicked back and read even if it killed him it was after ten on a weeknight which meant it was doubtful any calls were going to come in to liven things up he didnt have to be there but he liked the solitude of his office at night the familiarity of it and the fact that he could be there behind the desk instead of behind the bars he hadnt even turned the radio on as he often did to bring a little music and company into the night the only light was the one on his desk the metal gooseneck lamp aimed at the book in his hands the book he wasnt reading he considered getting up and brewing coffee since he wasnt going to bed but it seemed like too much effort it was the first time in his life he could remember being so angry and so tired at the same time usually temper energized him got his blood up and his adrenaline sizzling now he was sapped he supposed it was because most of the anger was selfdirected thougllhe still had plenty left over for cassie when a woman hurt a man it was the most natural thing in the world to cover it with anger hed told other women he loved them he wouldnt have denied it the fact was that hed tried to love other women hed worked hard at it for a space of time the last thing hed wanted to do was moon around over something he couldnt have which was just what he was doing now sulking his mother would have called it he thought with a grimace he missed her more just now than he had since shed died and hed missed her quite a bit over the years shed have given him a cuff on the ear he supposed or shed have laughed shed have told him to get his sorry butt up and do something instead of brooding over what he should have done or shouldnt have done well he couldnt think of anything to do except count his losses hed moved too quick pushed too hard and hed stumbled over his own heart the hell with it devin thought again and let the book lie on his chest shifting in the chair he closed his eyes and ordered himself to think about something else he needed to talk to the mayor about getting a stop sign out on the end of reno road three serious accidents there in a year was reason enough to push for it then there was the talk hed promised to give at the high school for the last assembly before summer hit and he really had to help shane with the early haying the dream snuck up on him sly and crafty somehow hed gotten from the hay field to her bedroom door cassie no that wasnt cassie abigail love and longing stirred in him why couldnt she see that she needed him as much as he needed her would she just sit there with her hands folded in her lap over her embroidery her eyes tired and lost it seemed nothing he could say would convince her to come with him to let him love her as surely hed been born to do no she would close herself off from him from everything they could have should have anger stirred along with the love along with the longing he was tired of coming begging with his hat in his hand i wont ask again he told her and she just watched him i wont come to you again and have you break my heart ive waited long enough if this is the way it has to be im leaving antietam i cant keep running the law here knowing youre here always out of reach i have to pick up whatever pieces are left of my life and go but she said nothing and he knew when he stepped back walked down the hall and down the stairs that it was the end her weeping drifted to him when he left the house cassie stood on the other side of the desk twisting the strap of her purse in her fingers she hadnt expected to find him asleep didnt know if she would wake him or leave as quietly as she had come there was nothing peaceful about him there should have been the way his feet were propped on the desk crossed at the ankles the way the book was lying open against his chest the desk lamp slanting light over it but his face was hard and tense his mouth grim she wished she had the courage to smooth those lines away and make him smile then again courage had always been her problem he opened his eyes and had her jumping like a rabbit im sorry i didnt mean to wake you i wasnt asleep at least he didnt think hed been asleep his brain was fuzzy and full of the scent of roses and for a moment hed thought she was wearing some fullskirted blue gown with lace at the throat of course she wasnt just her tidy little blouse and slacks he thought dragging a hand through his hair i was just going over some things in my head town business if youre busy i can what do you want cassie i he was still angry she had expected that was prepared for it i have some things to say to you all right go ahead i know i hurt you and that youre furious with me you dont want me to apologize you get mad when i do so i wont fine arent you going to make me coffee oh i shed already turned to the pot before she caught herself she drew a breath turnedback and faced him he had a brow lifted no well thats something im used to waiting on people now she was irritated a not entirely unpleasant sensation even if an unfamiliar one if it annoys you i cant help it maybe i like waiting on people maybe it makes me feel useful i dont want you to wait on me he could see the irritation clearly enough it added a snap to her eyes that fascinated him i dont want you to feel obliged to me well i do feel obliged and i cant help that either and the fact that i do feel obliged and do feel grateful dont shout at me devin impressed with her nononsense tone he closed his mouth then added i might yet at least wait until ive finished it wasnt so hard she realized it was like dealing with the children really you just had to be fair and firm and not allow yourself to be sidetracked i have good reasons to feel obliged to you and grateful to you but that doesnt meant that beyond that or besides that it doesnt mean i dont have other feelings too such as i dont know exactly i havent had real feelings for a man in maybe never she decided but i dont want to lose your friendship and affection next to the children theres no one i care for more than you devin being with yot she was going to fumble now and she hated herself for it the way we were today this afternoon before you got mad was so nice it was so special she was cutting right through his temper slicing it to ribbons the way she was standing there twisting her purse strap and struggling to find a way to put things right between them okay cassie why dont we i came here to goto bed with you his jaw dropped he was sure he heard it hit the edge of the desk before he could pick it up again the door burst open and shane strolled in hey den hey there cassie thought you might want to go down to duffs and shoot a couple games why dont you come along cassie its about time you learned how to shoot pool go away shane devin muttered without taking his eyes off cassies face come on dev youve got nothing to do around here except read another book and drink stale coffee experimentally he picked up the pot and sniffed this stuffll kill you get lost now or die whats the problem well just all innocence shane turned back the tension in the air struck him like a fist the way his brother was staring at casshe the way she was staring back oh oh he repeated drawing out the word on a mile wide grin well son of a gun whod have thought youxte got ten seconds to get out the door before i shoot you well hell im going how was i supposed to know you and cassie were tomorrow devin said evenly and finally managed to get his feet off the desk and onto the floor im going to break you into very small pieces yeah right i guess you two dont want to play pool so ill be going ah want me to lock this he said winking as devin snarled at him but he was obliging enough to flip the latch and shut the door snugly behind him youre not really going to fight with him casshe began quickly he didnt mean anything and tonguetied she let her words trail off as devin walked slowly around the desk what did you say to me before my idiot brother came in that i came hereto go to bed with you thats whht i thought you said is this your way of mending fences and keeping my friendship some new way of apologizing no oh she was making a mess of it he didnt look amorous just curious yes maybe im not sure i know at least i thought you wanted to dont you im asking what you want im telling you lord hadnt she just said it out loud in plain words i came hege didnt i i called ed and shes staying with the kids and im here she shut her eyes briefly it isnt easy for me devin i can see that cassie i want you but what i dont want is for you to think this is necessary to make things up with me she did what she had done once before it had worked then cupping her hand on his cheek she leaned up and kissed him now youre waiting for me to jump you devin murmured oh im no good at this in disgust she tossed her purse into a chair i never have been at sex of course at sex what else are we talking about i wonder he said quietly but she was off and running in a way hed never seen or heard before i dont know what you want or how to give it if youd just do whatever you usually do it would be all right its not that i wont like it i will im sure i will its not your fault that im clumsy or stiff or that i dont have orgasms she broke off in horror and saw that he was gaping at her excuse me someone else had said that she thought frantically looking everywhere but at him surely someone else had said that all she could do to cover the overwhelming tide of horrid embarrassment was to rush on what i mean is i want to go to bed with yore i know itll be nice because its nice when you kiss me so im sure the rest will be too and if youd just do something i wouldnt be feeling so stupid what the hell was he supposed to do he knew very well the woman standing there was the mother of two had been married for a decade and hed just realized she was as close to a virgin as anyone hed ever touched it scared the living hell out of him he started to tell her that they would take a step back take it slow then he knew that was the wrong way to go it was painfully obvious that so much of her had been crushed already what he would know was patience she would see as rejection i should do what i want with you enormously relieved she smiled yes it was an offer that had the juices flowing hot he knew if he wanted this to work he had to clamp down on needs and on nerves and ill tell you what to do and youll do it yes oh it was really so stmple if you just dont expect too much and you why dont we start this way he put his hands on her shoulders and lowered his mouth gently to hers theres something i want very much cassie all right i want you to say youre not afraid of me that you know i wont hurt you im not i know you wont and i want you to promise something he skimmed his lips up her jaw felt her shoulders relax under his hands all right that youll say stop if you mean stop if i do something you dont like you wont his lips cruised around to her ear and made some thing quake inside her promise me i promise he took her hand and led her through the door into the small room he used at night it was dark it held little more than a narrow bed a rickety table an ashtray he rarely used anymore it shouldnt be here i should take you somewhere no if it wasnt now shed lose her nerve what difference did atmosphere make when it was dark and her eyes were closed this is fine well make it better than fine he lit one of the stations emergency candles so at least there was soft light she ouldnt know how arousing she was standing there tidy and terrified prepared to give herself to sacrifice herself he thought grimly he would show her different i love you cassie it didnt matter that she didnt believe him she would he kissed her again slowly deeply patiently putting his heart into it and moment after moment there was nothing but the kiss the taste of it the meeting of lips the way she softened against him hold me he murmured obedient wanting to please she wrapped her arms arm rid him there was a little shock when she felt how hard he was how strong how odd it was to hold him tight against her while his mouth moved over hers she stroked her hands over his back i want to see you he continued to rub his lips over her throat even as her hands tensed on his back he didnt mind her being shy he found it endearing you have such a lovely face his eyes stayed on it as he slowly undid the buttons of her blouse eyes like fog and that sexy mouth she blinked thrown off enough to ma keno protest when he parted her blouse no one had ever called her sexy then his gaze shifted downward and the sound that rumbled in his throat had something cuffing hard in her stomach he was cupping her breasts in his hands holding them as if they were delicate glass that could be shattered by a careless touch lovely im small perfect he lifted his gaze to hers again just perfect he watched her lashes flutter when he circled her breasts brushed his thumbs over her nipples and his blood heated when they stiffened when she shuddered when her eyes opened again ill surprise and went dark what was he doing why wasnt he squeezing or pulling she felt her head spin before it fell back heard with a kind of dull shock her own moan do you have to close your eyes he asked her it wasnt so difficult to keep his hands easy after all not on skin that was soft as silk i like to watch them go cloudy when i touch you i love to touch you casshe i cant breathe youre breathing i can feel your heart he lowered his lips to her shoulder before straightening to pull off his shirt feel mine my oh my cassie thought he looked like something in one of those glossy magazines all muscles and firm smooth skin with only the slightest of liesrations she laid a han don his chest and smiled its pounding are you ready oh cassie biting back a groan he drew her into his arms cradled her there savored the feel of her flesh pressed against his i havent even started because she thought he meant something entirely different her brows drew together and she swallowed her distaste and reached courageously for his crotch with a ripe oath he jerked back stuttering as she covered herself and gaped i thought you wanted i thought you meant good god hed been hard as rock and huge he decided laughing would be better than screaming darling you do that again im going to embarrass myself and well have to start all over if its all the same to you id just like to touch you for a while i dont mind but youre i know what i am you said youd do what i want he reminded her fight rag to keep his voice from growing rough with need i want you to look at me look right at me now when she did he skimmed his hands over her breasts again he could see surprised pleasure ripple over her face hear it in her quickening breaths so he began to murmur to her endearments foolishness gauging her reaction when her eyes closed he lifted her slowly off her feet holding her suspended trailing his mouth down from hers and over her throat her collarbone and at last to her breast her hands clamped on his shoulders and her body arched as arrows bullets of hot sensation pierced through her flesh and straight to her center to burn she shook her head struggling to clear it devin he laved his tongue over her do you want me to stop no no thank god when she was quivering when her hands were clutching and flexing on his skin he lowered her to the floor again until his mouth was fixed on hers her hands were fisted in his hair her breath was coming fast her lips were hot and still she stiffened just for an instant when he unhooked her slacks she wouldnt spoil it that she promised herself whatever came now didnt matter because what came before had been so lovely shed never felt these pulls these yearnings or shed somehow forgotten them his hands were hard the palms rough but he used them so gently on her she would have been happy to have him go on touching her just like this forever she could blissfully have drowned in those wonderful ripples of sensations now he was uncovering the rest of her and she knew it would be over soon but he would hold her when he was done he would hold her close and warm she was sure of it that would be enough when he picked her up and cradled her against his chest she smiled the candlelight was lovely and she felt an intense sense of tenderness of sweetness hed made her feel wanted she laid her lips against his curled her arms around his neck keeping them there as he lowered her to the cot so that the springs squeaked under their weight she opened her eyes in confusion when he didnt push inside her instead he was curved beside her his eyes on her face his hand stroking up and down her torso dont rush me he said mildly im enjoying myself to her astonishment he began to talk to her about her body her skin her eyes her legs and the things he was murmuring sent flashes of new heat inside her she was grateful he didnt seem to need her to talk back she was having trouble breathing again she was so incredibly sweet so amazingly innocent that was what kept his need locked away kept his hands from taking quickly twelve years he thought listening to the way her breath caught then burst out when he skimmed a finger up the inside of her thigh when a man had waited so long he could be as patient as a saint though his blood churned like a riptide he lowered his mouth to her breast again so small and firm and smelling like spring under his lips he felt her heart thundering felt her skin quiver and knew he pleasured her he wanted to give her more to give her everything to know she craved as he did sohe stroked and suckled arousing himself and her until she began to writhe under him and he knew she was climbing toward the edge and he would be the one to show her that the fall was sweet it was too hot she was burning from the inside out and couldnt keep still she ached and nothing she could do seemed to soothe the throbbing something inside her was racing for something else and she strained away from it it was too big too huge too terrifying the air was thick the sensations were too fast and too many she moaned and bit down on her lip to stop the sound you can yell devin told her his own voice ragged you can scream if you want nobody can hear but me just let go cassie i cant he dipped his fingers inside her and his head spun she was hot and wet and more ready than she knew dont ask me to stop he murmuwxl against her mouth dont ask me no no dont she did scream then a sound that shot id have shocked her it was so wild and wanton but her body was too busy rearing up toward him poised on a spear of dark drenching pleasure such as shed never known everything inside l er came to a fist tensed violently painfully then burst free she collapsed weak as water and thought she heard him groan again he was greedy now he kept a hand fisted in the tousled sheet to keep himself sane and urged her up urged her over she strained against his hand poured into it and the arms shed wrapped around him slid bonelessly to the mattress surrender he thought more fulfillment but now he would give her himself he covered her slipped inside her holding himself back as her eyes fluttered open on fresh shock he took her slowly drawing out each stroke each pulse his heart almost burst from the strain of control when she convulsed again deliberately patiently he stirred her gaining unimagined joy as he felt her begin once more to tremble and race the shudder worked through him ripping demanding this time he knew he would go with her finally with her he clenched at the hand shed fisted in the sheet covered it and took the fall she couldnt stop shuddering but she wasnt cold not cold at all the heat from her body and from devins which lay over her seemed to rise in waves that were all but visible he was breathing hard like a man whod been racing and his full weight was on her pinning her to the mattress so that she could feel the springs pushing against her back it was lovely she understood for the first time in her life the secrets of the dark i know im crushing you he managed im trying to move you can stay she wrapped her arms around him to keep him there he was still inside her still there it felt wicked and wonderful i like it this way i appreciate you putting up with all that seeing as youre not big on sex the dry tone alerted her but she was too delighted to mind being teased i didnt mind she said and smiled against his throat devin it was wonderful i actually i know several times i counted she laughed and didnt feel at all embarrassed you did not i certainly did he found the energy to lift his head and look down at her you can thank me later her smile sweetened shed never had a man look at her like that all hazyeyed and satisfied and sleepy it was all right incredibly moved she lifted a hand to his cheek wasnt it it was worth waiting for he turned his lips into her palm but im not waiting another twelve years to have you again i dont want you to everything inside her was dreamy and disjointed youre so handsome the curse of the mack aries i mean it she lifted her other hand framing his face it was so easy to touch him now to let her finger trace that wonderful dimple beside his smile do you remember how i used to come out to the farm sometimes when i was a girl to visit with your mother sure you were a pretty little thing skinny and i didnt pay you much mind my mistake i used to watch you in the summer especially when youd be working with your shirt off his grin flashed well well little cassie i had a terrible crush on you for a while and these really imaginative fantasies she chuckled well i thought they were imaginative until now nothing came close i cant believe im saying this talking to you like this under the circumstances you can say pretty much anything he was hoping she would he could feel himself hardening inside her i was about twelve and you were always nice to me all of you were i loved coming out there just to be there but it was a bonus when it was summer and youd be barechested and sweaty like you are now experimentally she traced a finger over his shoulder all those muscles shiny with damp your body its so beautiful sometimes youd come into eds and when youd go out if there were women in there theyd roll their eyes and sigh come on really of course if one of your brothers came in theyd do the same thing dont spoil it she laughed lifting a hand to push tousled hair from her cheek okay they sighed louder and longer for you thats better and ed would say something like that devin mackades got the best buns in three counties she caught herself on a giggle her eyes going wide i shouldnt have said that too late besides i know eds partial to that particular part of the anatomy shes told me shes shameless with a long sigh of her own cassie wound her arms around him again let her hands wander down but you do have an exceptional seat now youve done it as her fingers brushed over his hips he began to move inside her nothing could have pleased him more than seeing the way her eyes rounded in surprise but how can you oh my god its no trouble he assured her its my pleasure and after a long time after he curled up beside her on the cot his face buried in her hair his legs tangled with hers as she had hoped as she had needed he held her chapter it was barely dawn when cassie crept into her own kitchen she felt giddy like a teenager sneaking home after curfew not that shed ever broken curfew she thought now not that shed ever done anything except exactly what was expected of her it made her hushed secret return all the more liberating shed just spent the night all night with the most exciting beautiful the most gentle man shed ever known she cassandra connor dolin was having an affair she had to slap her hand over her mouth to muffle a burst of laughter her heart was still racing her head still swimming and her body her body felt as though it had been polished with flower petals she was sure she looked different and tried to see her reflection in the chrome of the toaster because she was alone she allowed herself three quick spins before putting the kettle on for coffee then being a mother she padded toward the bedrooms to make sure her children were snug and ask turning from connors room she stifled a gasp there was ed her fireengine hair done up in squashy pink rollers wearing a wildly flowered robe of pink and blue im sorry cassie whispered i didnt mean to wake you you were quiet as a little mouse i was listening out for you ed took a long measuring look and liked what she saw well well i believe youre feeling good and smug this morning about time too cassie cast a last look at her sleeping son then backed down the short hallway toward the kitchen the kids didnt give you any trouble did they of course not never heard a ix zp out of either of them grinning ed followed cassie into the kitchen watched while she busied herself measuring out coffee you going to tell me about it or am i going to have to use my imagination i got a damn good one the heat rose to cassies cheeks but it was from pleasure as much as embarrassment i stayed with devin i figured that out sweetie pie very much at home ed popped bread into the toaster from the look on your face the two of you didnt discuss world events until morning sighing a little she poked around in the refrigerator im not just being nosy i guess i want to make sure youre as okay on the inside as you look on the out im fine cassie turned smiled there was ed holding a jar of preserves in one hand and a gallon of milk in the other her thin face shiny with night cream her hair exploding on rollers her outrageous robe falling over legs the shape of toothpicks this cassie realized was the mother of her heart cassie set the steaming kettle down again and dashed over to throw her arms around ed surprised moved ed pressed her lips to cassies hair there baby i feel different do i look different you look happy my stomachs still jumping laughing at herself cassie drew back and pressed a hand to it but it feels good i didnt know it could be like that i didnt know i could be like that casting a quick look at the hallway she went back to the coffee her children were asleep and would be for another half hour after all these years cassie thought she would have a mother to listen ive never been with anyone but joe i know that baby before we were married i wouldnt let him i wanted to be married first i wanted it to be right she poured coffee for both of them then sat at the table i was nervous on our wedding night but excited too youd given me a white nightgown for my shower it was so pretty so perfect it made me feel like a bride when we got to the motel i asked joe to give me an hour to myself i wanted to take a long bath and well you know the female ritual yeah i know he came back it was closer to two hours and he was drunk it wasnt the way id always dreamed he ripped the gown and he pushed me onto the bed it all happened so fast and he hurt me i knew it was supposed to hurt some the first time but it was more than some he fell asleep right after and i just laid there i didnt feel anything a mans not supposed to treat a woman that way even if she hadnt already despised joe dolin ed would have despised him now thats not how its supposed to be it was the way it was always i never felt anything ed ever he didnt always hurt me but it was always quick and mostly a little mean i figured it was my fault he told me it was often enough it got better when i was carrying connor because he left me alone most of the time i didnt know he was cheating on me then i guess i was too stupid dont you call yourself stupid ed said fiercely i dont want to hear that maybe i just didnt care enough to know or want to know i was wrapped up in becoming a mother then in being one he was already hitting me we hadnt been married long when that started but i didnt think there was anything i could do about it my mother said well it doesnt matter what she said i stayed then emma came along he only wanted me a couple of times after emma he forced me oh cassie honey why didnt you tell me ed i was too ashamed he was my husband and i had it in my head that he had a right to do what he did i know different now she took a long breath you see when i went to devin last night i didnt think i knew he wouldnt hurt me at least not like joe had i thought going to bed with him would make him happy and it didnt matter to me i mean i thought he would just that i would just you had yourself a real man last night ed finished and it changed things yes relieved cassie smiled he was so gentle so patient you know it mattered to him what i was feeling it really mattered and he made me feel beautiful ed she bit her lip even as it curved again it matters to me now im already thinking about next time ed let out a cackling laugh and squeezed cassies hand good for you he says he loves me cassie said quietly i know men say those things when they want you or they think you need to hear it but do you think he could i think devin mackades a man who says what he means what about you i dont know that part of me is so confused i didnt love joe ed i never did i used him cassandra no i did i used him to get out of the house because i wanted to have a family of my own and he was there i wasnt fair to him i dont mean that gave him the right to beat me she added noting the warrior gleam in eds eye nothing gave him that right but i didnt love him not the way a woman should have her husband he didnt do anything to deserve love no he didnt with devin i feel so many things so many different things and i dont know if one of them is that kind of love then you take all the time you need to sort it out dont you let anyone push you into anything youre not ready for not even devin how will i know sweetie pie when the time comes youll know take my word for it youll know while cassie was talking with ed over coffee devin was pulling up at the farm hed felt a need for home the sky was losing its dawn haze when he walked into the milking parlor shane and two of the h students he often took on as help were finishing up the morning routine patiently shaneshowed one of the boys how to detach cow from machine without causing irritation the parlor smelled of warm milk animal and hay youre going to check her teats after just like you did before to make sure theres no infection he did so himself demonstrating when shes dry you see to her feed he cocked a brow at devin you can see the sheriff wanders in when most of the works done yall lead them out now devin gave the cow an easy swat then helped shane clean and disinfect the machines it was routine companionable work remember when dad had us milking by hand devin asked he figured wed better know machines break down but cows fill up regular youre up early shane commented and youve got a stupid grin on your face looks like you got lucky devin only angled his head im feeling too good to pound on you this morning good because ive got to finish up here and get to the hens before breakfast you and cassie he said grinning again whod have thought it ive been thinking about it for a long time dew in helped shane secure the fresh milk in the stainlesssteel tanks ive been in love with her a long time shane straightened winced man dont start that every time i turn around somebodys falling in love its giving me nightmares well get used to it im going to

youve got one woman for the rest of your life just one and therere so many out there tall ones short ones round ones amused devin slapped a hand on shanes shoulderas they walked toward the chicken coop and with me out of the way therell be more for you there is that taking it philosophically shane shrugged i guess itll he up to me to maintain the mackade legend ill just have to make the sacririce youre up to it bro cassie never lingered in the library she was much too conscientious to skim over her cleaning there but most often she tried to arrange her schedule so that someone was in the house when e dealt with that room there was no one in the house now her children were in school and the guests were busy with their sightseeing for the afternoon she made excuses in her h d for why she should see to a dozen other things besides that one room but she kn w the library had b n used the day before she kn v there were books that needed to be put back on the shelves plants that needed watering windows that needed washing she told herself it was foolish she knew the emotions and moods of the house better than she knew her own there was nothing here that could hurt her in fact the house had changed her life and all for the better armed with her cleaning basket she went in if she left the door open wide behind her it was only hecause she wanted to be able to hear if one of the guests returned and wanted anything it wasnt because she was afraid she set the basket aside and tidied the books first she knew guests often liked to borrow one to read on a rainy afternoon or to help them drift off to sleep at night rare and regan had provided a variety of books for a variety of tastes she too was free to borrow any she liked whenever she liked but she rarely did nor she thought suddenly did connor though he was a voracious reader it occurred to her that he too avoided this room even though he was thoroughly at home in the rest of the inn it was a feeling she supposed something that lingered in the air shaking it off she carried her basket over to the twin philodendrons that trailed their leaves from pots set in stands by the tall window that overlooked the side garden they needed to be dusted shed been putting it off as she began she felt the chill down to the bone and knew she wasnt really alone she thought she could see him out of the corner of her eye the big body going to fat the wide face set in hard dissatisfied lines joe the terror came so quickly she dropped the basket at her feet as she whirled around he wasnt there of course he wasnt no one was but it was so bitterly cold with numb fingers she reached for the window to open it to the warm breeze she fumbled couldnt work the latch and discovered her breath was coming in short gasps you let him touch ypu didnt you whore she hunched her shoulders automatically against a blow that didnt come did you think i wouldnt know did you think you could cuckold me in my own house you with your innocent face and fancy southern manners nothing but a slut shaking she backed slowly away from the window her eyes darted around the room searching corners there was no one there but how could she hear the voice so clearly in her head know this youll never leave me ill see you dead first you dont love me cassie wanted to say you despise me let me go but the words wouldnt come ill kill you both remember that till death do us part and death is your only escape cassie on a strangied shriek she spun around i vin was just inside the door his eyes narrowed in concern without a thought she ran into his arms i vin devin you have to go go quickly he fore he sees you hes going to kill you what are you talking about god youre shaking like a leaf its freezing in here you feel it her teeth were all but chattering as she drew back you can feel it sure i can its like an icebox he rubbed her hands in his to warm them i thought it was joe i swear i saw him fist coming toward me and then the room spun her knees buckled the di ziness lasted only an instant but she was already up in devins arms im all right its gone the room was warm again sunny and bright with the scent of roses and polish very gently he laid her down on the soft leather sofa let me get you some water no im all right she thought she might jump out of her skin if he left her alone there its just this room she steadied herself sat up i thought it was joe but it wasnt it was barlow she was still too pale devin thought but her eyes had cleared his heart had dropped to his knees when hed seen them roll back in her head has this happened before not like this not this strong im never very comfortable in this room even his bedroom is easier but this time i heard youre going to think ive lost my mind no i wont he cupped her face in his hands remember who youre talking to all right she blew out a breath i heard him talking in my head i think it sounded so much like joe the tone the meanness in it he called me her a whore a slut he knew she was in love with someone else but he wasnt going to let her go ever he said hed kill her first kill both of them come on lets get out of here lets go upstairs i havent finished leave it cassie just leave it he would have carried her but she got to her feet still her hand reached for his the other day when you were talking to the old ladies mrs cox and mrs berman yes you talked about abigail being in love with someone i thought youd made it up to add a little romance to the story no i cant explain it dewin i just know its true i saw him he paused at the back stairs that led up to her apartment you saw who the man she loved i was in her room and then i looked and he was at the door he was looking right at me talking to me as if i were abigail i could feel her there her heart was broken but she let him go made him go devin devin i think she killed herself he sat her down in a chair in her living room why do you think that i cant explain that either just a feeling she didnt know how else to get free and maybe because i thought about it once the blood drained from his face good god cassie not for very long she said quickly and not very seriously i had the kids to think about if i hadnt had them i might have thought about it longer when youre trapped devin you get crazy ideas about escape nothing he knew about her had ever frightened him more i would have helped you i wanted to help you i wouldnt let you i wouldnt let anyone you ed regan there were others too others who were willing to do whatever they could i was wrong not to accept the help but thats over now she curled her hands over his im not telling you this to upset you but to try to help you understand how i know she did it she didnt have people to help her hed seen to that he made sure she was cut off from the women in town made sure the servants were too frightened to do anything but stand back somewhere in her mind she could almost feel it see it he hit her too it was his fist i saw today not joes but its the same you see so much the same when he killed that boy in front of her she knew he was capable of anything she gave up devin eventually even her children werent enough to keep her from escaping in the only way she knew its not you cassie it could have been but its not he said firmly youre here youre with me theres nothing for you to be afraid of im tired of being afraid she closed her eyes let her head rest on his shoulder as he crouched in front of her im glad youre here she let out a deep sigh why are you here i worked it so i could clear out for a hour i wanted to see you i want to be with you i thought about you all morning i nearly put coffee in emmas thermos for school because i was thinking about you instead of what i was doing really he couldnt think of a more satisfying compliment when she lifted her head he could see that the color was back in her cheeks were you thinking that youd like to make love with me again yes i was ive still got most of an hour he murmured rising and bringing her to her feet she blinked its the middle of the day uhhuh he drew her toward the hall devin its daylight thats right he unhooked his belt that held his beeper and weapon hung them over the doorknob its her heart stumbled as he reached out to unbutton her blouse its barely noon yeah im going to miss lunch as he slipped the blouse from her shoulders lowered his mouth toward hers he smiled do you want me to stop cassie her head rolled back on her shoulders i guess i dont she said weak willing she forgot that the sun was shining and the birds were twittering she forgot that traffic was cruising by on the road and that people were going about their business in town it was so easy so powerfully easy to let it all happen again it was so easy to enjoy the way his hands moved tenderly over her the way his mouth coaxed hers to warm he felt so good against her when she curled her arms around him so solid that she forgot to feel selfconscious because the sun was pouring through the windows he undressed her completely taking his time over it drawing out each moment just to look at her to look at what was finally his the softness the sweetness he kissed her soothing and arousing her as he undressed himself his hands were gentle because he knew it was what she needed his mouth was patient allowing her to set the pace and the pace was slow and dreamy he lowered her to the bed shed made so neatly that morning gave himself the quiet delight of brushing her hair with his fingers until it was all tangled golden curls over the plain white quilt her eyes were closed and already her cheeks carried the faint flush of stirred passions last night there had been only the light from a practical and unscented emergency candle a narrow bunk and a room that smelled of old coffee today there was sunlight birdsong and the perfume of the flowers by her window and today he thought she knew there would be pleasure he gave her pleasure rivers of it she floated on it glided on it immersed herself in it without reserve all hesitancy all shyness vanished under a warm haze of gently lapping sensations the texture of his callused fingers the friction of them as they moved over her skin mused little sparking shocks that speeded her pulse the taste of his mouth as it moved to her flesh then back to her lips was drugging she could hear his breathing quicken or those little hums of pleasure in his throat whenever he touched some new part of her he was so beautiful to her not just his incredibly stunning outward good looks more it was the beauty inside that drew and seduced her the kindness the strength the patience it delighted her to be able to squeeze her hands over his biceps feel the coil of strength in them in the muscles of his back she adored the shape and weight of his body the way it pressed hers deep into the mattress the light scrape of his teeth on her shoulder gave her a quick jittery thrill to answer it she nipped at his while her hands grew bold enough to journey down he hissed out a breath jolted her eyes flashed open when his head reared up for an instant for an eternity she saw something dark and edgy and dangerous in those mossgreen eyes something that had her blood leaping high and her pulse scrambling he yanked himself back into control the way he would have yanked a wild dog on a thick leash his muscles knotted he could have sworn he felt the sweat burst out of his pores dont worry his voice was raw but he lowered his mouth gently to hers again dont he afraid she wanted to tell him she wasnt couldnt be afraid of him that she would be afraid of nothing that happened between them that shewanted to know what had come into his eyes but he was kissing her into oblivion again into that misty place where there was nothing but warm quiet pleasures her moan was long and deep when he eased her to a peak long and deep when he gave her more she let the current take her opening for him letting him fill her nothing was more stunning than moving with him feeling his body mesh and mate with hers then his mouth was at her ear and through her own gasping passion she heard him say her name just her name before he pulled her with him i love you he still ached for her even as he hifted his weight and drew her against his side i want you to get used to hearing that devin no i dont expect it yet i will but i dont expect it yet he turned his face into her hair and breathed in the scent of it and her a scent that always reminded him of sunlight on a meadow you just get used to hearing it you tell me when youre used to it because then im going to ask you to marry me she went rigid i cant how can i think about that this is happening too fast not for me he wouldnt be angry he wouldnt even allow himself to be discouraged by the shock in her voice instead he stroked a hand down her arm and spoke with quiet confidence ive gotten good at waiting so i can wait awhile longer but i figured you should know where im heading here i want you i want the kids i want a life but i can wait until youre ready i might never be ready devin you have to understand i dont know if i can ever make those promises again youve never made them to me thats all that counts he rose up on his elbow so that he could study her face hed frightened her he noted but it couldnt be helped i love you you let that settle in and well see what happens next dont you see that i only see you cassie persuasively he kissed her until the hand shed lifted to push against his shoulder went lax only you a few miles away joe dolin was policing a picnic area on the battlefield for litter as he worked his eyes scanned the fields the hills the road below there were large shady trees stone walls he was going to pick his time and his spot this wasnt it eventually the crew would work their way down toward the bridge where general burnside had screwed up during the battle of antietam there the ground was uneven rocky and thick with brash there was a creek to hide his scent trees to cover him hed often poached in those woods jack lighting deer illegally with some of his drinking buddies he had plenty of time now to calculate how long it would take him to travel through them where he could hide who he could go to for a little help in the meantime he was making himself a busy little bee picking up the soft drink cans and wrappers tossed aside by lousy tourists or kids hooking school his supervisor wasnt a fool but joe never gave him any lip any trouble and made sure he was first in line to volunteer for any of the harder or messier jobs he was building himself a damn good rep in prison something hed never had on the outside something he thought as he wiped sweat from his brow that was going to help him get out of the cage and get back to cassie get to cassie the little bitch was going to pay for every day hed spent behind bars every hour hed had to go without a drink or a woman when he was finished with her he was going after mackade maybe all four of the stinking mack aries hed had plenty of time to plan it out to work out the mistakes to dream about it he hoped he had to kill one of them he hoped it would be devin and when he was finished he was going to mexico taking whatever was left of his wife with him all he needed was money a car and a gun he knew exactly where he was going to get all three chapter connor tried to take in everything at once he knew bryan was getting restless wandering around the sheriffs office trying to get a look at the cells in the back but for himself he thought nothing was more fascinating than watching the sheriff handle calls and type up reports he was going to write a story about it and he had to get everything just right the way the office looked with the dust dancing in the sunlight through the windows the scars on the desk from feet or cigarettes the way the ceiling fan squeaked overhead he took a deep sniff and filed away in his mind the scent of coffee really strong and a little harsh and the smell of the dust that sort of tickled the nose he tried to remember just how the phone sounded when it shrilled on the sheriffs desk how the sheriffs chair scraped against the floor how the deputy scratched his head then his cheek as he put papers away in the file cabinet he already had the sound of the sheriffs voice it was deep and slow and there was a hint of something in it humor connor thought when he answered some of the calls other times it was brisk kind of official once or twice hed seen lines form between the sheriffs brows he sure did drink a lot of coffee connor thought and he wrote a lot of things down connor had a million questions but he held them in because he knew the sheriff was working devin glanced up and saw the boy watching him like an owl he thought wise and patient a look at his watch told him hed kept the kids hemmed in for most of their satu day morning he imagined connor could sit there quiet as a mouse for hours yet but he recognized the signs of trouble brewing in bryan it was time to give them all a break donnie you take over here were going to get some lunch at eds yo the state boys call about the messnet case you tell them ill have the report to them by monday yo donnie said again and crushed his brows together over the filing ill pick up lunch for curtis tell him if he starts to make noises back there you got a prisoner suddenly all of bryans boredom was washed away in the thrill of it you didnt tell us just somebody sleeping off a night on the town he was almost sorry he couldnt tell them it was a mad psychopath i could use a burger all right bryan darted out of the door im starving extra fries right con i guess connor could hardly think about food with all the questions in his head ah sheriff how come you have that police radio on all the time i mean it has fire department stuff and things from out of your jurisdiction because you can never he sure what might come over that youd have to pay attention to when you know somebody does it feel funny to have to lock them up sometimes if you know them it makes it easier to settle things before they get out of hand have you ever had anybody break out bryan wanted to know as he danced backward on the sidewalk like conk you over the head and run for it devin ran his tongue around his teeth he had a wonderful image of poor old curtis going over the wall nope cant say as i have if they did youd have to shoot them right the excitement of it leaped in bryans eyes like in the leg if they did its likely id know who they were so id just go to their house and bring them back what if they resisted arrest devin knew what was expected of him id have to rough era up slap the cuffs on him bryan said with a hoot and back into the cage wham the towns quiet connor said because the sheriff keeps it quiet touched devin flipped a finger over the hill of connors hall cap thanks we aim to serve sheriff devin turned and watched with an itlner sigh as the ancient and wiry owner of the general store and sub shop approached the man could talk the bark off a tree afternoon mr grant hows business oh up and down sheriff up and down mr grant paused flicked a bit of lint from the front of his wrinkled brown shirt i thought i should let you know sheriff not that i poke my nose into whats not my business with me its live and let live that ended the statement which devin knew was habitual mr grants mind wandered freely from pillar to post let me know what mr grant oh well i was just taking a little air and happened to walk by the bank just past closing time you know yes i know seemed to me somebody was holding up the bank excuse me seemed to me mr grant repeated in his ponderous way somebody was holding up the bank had a gun sure enough looked to me to be a could be im wrong about that might he a before either boy could comment devin slapped a hand on each of their shoulders go on up to eds stay there but devin do it bryan go on now both of you stay there and dont say anything he stared hard at connor dont say anything he repeated we dont want people getting upset and getting in the way what are you going to do connor said in an awed voice im going to take care of it get up to eds move now when they ran off devin kept one eye on them to be sure they obeyed mr errant i wonder if youd come along with me lets just take a look at this fine by me the bank was across the street and another half a block up an old brick building with elaborate ironwork it sat cattycorner from eds cafe a quick look showed devin that the boys had indeed gone in they had their faces pressed up to the window devin scanned the street it was saturday and there was considerable traffic enough in any m se to cause a problem if there was trouble he didnt intend to have any of his people hurt did you get a look at the man mr grant some young bout your age i expect cant say as i recognized him looked a little like the harris boy but wasnt devin nodded he spotted a dirty white compact with delaware tags at the curb in front of the bank recognize that car there mr grant thought it over cant say as i do never seen it around here stay here a minute unsnapping the flap covering his weapon devin sidestepped up to the bank the door was festooned with curvy ironwork through it he could make out one teller behind the wide counter and the man across from her nervously waving a gun it was a he noted grant had been deadon he slipped away from the door mr grant id like you to get on down to the office tell donhie i need some backup here at the bank weve got an armed robbery in progress i want you to tell him that straight out and that i dont want him coming up here blaring sirens or coming into the bank i dont want him coming into the bank have you got that why sure i do sheriff be happy to oblige and stay down there yourself mr grant dont come back up here

havent time to play deputy see that car white compact delaware plates sure i got eyes put it out of commission now rafes brows lifted and his grin flashed gee devin i dont know as i remember how do it

perp im going in if he comes out waving that damn gun dont he a jerk get out of the way the hell he would rafe thought but he crouched down to move around to the drivers side of the car while devin took out his weapon devin wanted to keep it simple and safe he tucked his gun into the back of his belt slipped his badge off and into his pocket he strolled into the bank smiled at the teller hey there nancy thought id be too late to make my deposit lucky for me youre still open though her face was frozen in fear she managed to gape at him but but the wifell have my hide if i forget to put the money in we got that automatic withdrawal on our insurance you know he strolled up to the counter one hand reaching down are you crazy the man with the gun shrieked out nerves in every syllable are

wig that had been dislodged during the scuffle looks that way might as well give him a shave while im at it none too gently he pulled the mans head back and ripped off the fake moustache in case you

now im going to send donnie in to get your statements from their station at the window both boys watched devin come out dragging a balding man with a bloody lip he got lama bryan said awed devin got an honesttogod bank robber of course he did connor beamed hes the sheriff there was talk of little else but the attempted bank robbery in the way of small towns unofficial reports leaped over the wires far ahead of official ones in many of the phone and backyardfence conversations it was said that devin had burst into the bank gun drawn eyes blazing in others he had taken out the robber whod been armed to the teeth with automatic weapons barehanded by the end of the day devin found himself the recipient of enough homemade baked goods that could have opened his own restaurant the for the endless official reports he had to type and file they nearly made up for the phone calls he was forced to field from concerned citizens the mayor the bank manager anda number of women who thought heil might need a bit of comfort after his ordeal he was deflecting one of the offers when his brothers walked in no annie i wasnt wounded he rolled his eyes as all three of hishis tors gnnned at h m no he didnt shoot me sharilyns exaggerating ah little baffled by the offer presented to him his throat thats nice of you annie and i hate the thought butno i dont think im to suffer from delayed stress syndrome yeah ive heard of it butno no really im just fine and im a little tied up right now yeah official business thats right you take care now uhhuh you bet bye he let out a long breath shaking his head briskly as he replaced the rex iver holy hell was that annie the body linstrom shane wanted to know she was hitting on me devin said with a snort of laughter women are a puzzle theres no way around it jared sat on the comer of devins desk the way i heard it bullets bounce off your chest nah shane sniffed at one of the pies sitting on a crowded shelf i heard he eats bullets betty malloy bake this lemon meringue yeah devin winced when the phone rang again where the hell is donnie last i saw he was strutting down main street trying to look like supercop rare cocked his head arent you going to answer it sheriff devin swore and picked up the phone sheriffs office mackade he leaned back closed his eyes it was the press again every small paper and news bureau within fifty miles had picked up on the botched robbery by rote he gave the official line danced around the demand for a more indepth interview and hung up youre good at that jared decided real stern and authoritative im beginning to wish id kicked that jerk in the head devin muttered hes caused me a lot of trouble now im stuck here answering the damn phone typing reports with some outoftown idiot who couldnt hold up a lemonade stand in the back he whines all the time at least you wont starve shane said and helped himself to one of the cookies on a plate by the pie we thought wed take you down to duffs buy you a drink can tleave the prisoner unattended rough jared said without sympathy you know bryan was about to jump out of his socks when he got home youre better than rambo amused devin scratched his cheek dont tell him the last robbery i had to deal with was when acouple of kids stole underwear off mrs metzs clothesline he shuffled papers on his desk have you been by the inn rare everything okay there everythings fine cassie was a little upset word travels he added unnecessarily but i told her it was all blown out of proportion and you didnt do anything much thanks a lot no problem connor was already writing a story about you no kidding the grin all but split his face a day in the life of sheriff mackade rafe helped himself to coffee the boys nuts about you good thing shane took another cookie since devins going to marry his mama rafe bobbled the coffee spilled it on his hand and swore cassie little cassie shanes getting ahead of himself devin said in a mild tone that belied the gleam in his eye as usual hey youre the one who said it me i figure youve just lost your mind like these two shut up shane jared kept his eyes on devins face you and cassie so what so thats interesting are you speaking as her attorney devin pushed back from the desk if the phone rang again he thought he might just rip it out of the wall to get himself back under control he went to the coffee hes got it bad rare observed didnt you have a thing for her about ten twelve years ago when devin didnt answer merely poured the coffee sipped it steelyeyed rare grinned never got over it did you sonof a gun why thats practically poetic bro it gets me right herey he thumped a hand on his chest keep ragging me itll get you somewhere else its getting so every days valentines day in antietam in disgust shane shoved another cookie in his mouth a mans not safe cassies a sweetheart rare said pointedly sure she is gamely shane swallowed so that he could make his point shes as good as they come and pretty with it but why does that mean he has to marry her you see all this stuff with a sweep of his hand he indicated all the pies cakes tarts cookies women are going to fall all over him and hes tossing them off because hes gone crosseyed over one woman its not only stupid its well its selfish rafe gave shane a thump on the back of the head that would have felled a grizzly man i love this guy hes going to carry the mackade legend into the next millennium damn right shane agreed no womans going to tie me down i mean with all the flowers out there why pick one when you can have a bouquet now thats poetry rafe thumped him again lets go get that beer you two go on jared stayed where he was i need to talk to devin a minute they left arguing about who was buying when the room was quiet again devin took his coffee back to his desk you got a problem no jared shifted so that they were facetoface but you might have you talked to cassie about marriage a little why joe dolin theyre divorced its done theyre divorced eyes steady ja xl rested a hand on his knee but dones another thing hell get out eventually devin hell come back ill handle it yeah i figure you can handle joe oneonone but theres the law unconsciously devin brushed a finger over his badge he tries to touch cassie again just tries and ill have him back behind bars before he can blink and thats part of the problem youre the heriff but you wont be objective you cant be devin set his coffee aside leaned forward ive been in love with her most of my life at least it seems that way and i had to stand back and do little more than nothing while he hurt her while i knew what he was doing to her insfde that house she wouldnt let me help so the law tied my hands things are different now and nothings going to stop me from taking care of her he lifts his hand to her again and hes dead problem solved jared nodded he didnt take the statement lightly he knew what it was to need to protect the woman you loved from any sort of harm and he knew devin was a man who said exactly what he meant im talking about a situation that could develop if hes smart enough not to lift his hand to her what if after he serves his time he moves back here stays clean how are you going to handle that one step at a time jared like always of course the first thing id have to do is keep rafe from going after him because of what he tried to do to regan that was true enough jared thought and rafe wouldnt be the only one who wouldnt welcome joe dolin back into the community dev i know what cassies been through exactly i know because im her lawyer i handled the divorce were talking about a textbook case of spousal abuse a pitiful phrase textbook case for that kind of horror therapys helped her the towns helped her and her own backbones helped her but shes got scars shes never going to get rid of im being careful devin said slowly for gods sake jared ive given her time even after the divorce i waited and gave her time im trying to give her more devin im just trying to show you the whole package believe me i cant think of anyone id rather see you with than cassie anyone id rather see her with than you god knows she deserves somebody decent but its not just the two of you there are two kids here joe dolins kids devins eyes darkened narrowed you can say that to me when youve got bryan are you going to tell me it matters theyre another mans blood when i know damn well bryans as much yours as layla thats not what im saying jareds voice was low and calm ive seen you with them i didnt have a clue how you felt about cassie you kept that covered well but anybody with eyes can see youre crazy about those kids that youve been good for both of them they deserve you he added and nipped dew ins temper before it could bloom they deserve a father who loves them and a home where they can just he kids fine thats what im going to see they have but its not like bryan dev his biological father isnt around isnt an issue dolin is he doesnt give a damn about those kids never has no but hell have a right to them knowing that the frustration he felt didnt help jared spread his hands and took a deep breath the law says he does and if he cant get to cassie he may just come up with the notion to get to her through them once hes out hell have a legal right to see them to have visitation to be part of their lives you wont he able to block that devin hadnt thought of it maybe he hadnt let himself now that it was there fight in the front of his mind his blood went cold youre the lawyer you block it parental rights are a sticky business der you know that until and unless he does something to put them in jeopardy until and unless we can prove hes not just unfit but dangerous to them hell have the law on his side already devin was thinking it through working it out we may be able to put the pressure on for supervised visitations only but blood still counts heavy in court he beat connor jareds brows drew together i didnt know anything about that connor didnt tell cassie didnt want to make it worse on her i might be able to use that if the time comes but once hes considered rehabilitated a lot of the slate gets erased hes going to be in for a long time yet but i want you to know what youre up against here ive got a clear picture of what im up against nothings going to stop me from making cassie and the kids mine not joe dolin not the law not anything well then jared rose ill state the obvious im behind you rafe and shane are behind you i appreciate it if you get yourself out from behind that desk for an hour come down to duffs ill buy you a beer satisfied jared headed for the door then paused shes a terrific woman dev sweet like shane says but tougher than you might think tougher than she thinks if you cot vince her she wants you as much as you want her youll handle whatever comes down ive got one piece of advice you always do devin said dryly for cassie its not enough to let her know you love her you want her you let her know you need her thats a woman whod go to the wall for a man who needed her he did need her devin thought when jared had shut the door behind him but he didnt know how to show her and wasnt entirely sure he should wasnt that just the kind of pressure he was struggling not to put on her he didn t want cassie to go to the wall for him he only wanted her to feel safe and happy no it was up to him to see that she was never hurt again to protect her to shield her and the children his need could wait chapter cassie told herself it was foolish to worry devin was fme rafe had told her the story himself and she knew that his version of tile attempted bank robbery was much more accurate than those shed heard over the phone even connors report given in fits and starts of desperate excitement had been less dramatic than the gossip spewing out of the town so there was no need to worry she was so worried she jumped each time the phone rang if shed been able to leave the inn and the children for an hour shed have dashed into town to check every inch of devin herself one thought one fact kept running in a loop in her brain hed faced down a man with a gun she shuddered again and gave up trying to block the picture from her mind hed walked into an armed robbery risked his life to protect others his badge had never taken on such huge proportions for her fore hed risked his life in the daytoday business of a town like antietam a sheriffs work was more diplomacyor so shed imagined than risk of course now she began to see that hadbeen foolish of her there were fights drunks breakins hot tempers between neighbors and families she had personal knowledge of the dangers of domestic disputes that tidy t im for the violence that could happen behind closed doors he was in charge and while connor might see him as a hero she began to see just how vulnerable the badge made him because she did she also realized that the worry that ate at her all through the long afternoon and vening wasnt just for a friend a lover not just for a man she admired and cared for it was for the man she loved it had taken something unexpected shocking to open her eyes now that they were open she could look back almost as far back as she could remember d vin had been there she had depended on him admired him and in some ways she supposed taken his place in her life for granted it had been humiliating to go to him and admit what joe had done to her to show him the marks to describe how she had come by them not just because hed been the sheriff she thought now because he had been devin shed always been more shy around him than around his brothers because she thought again hed been devin part of her heart had always been set aside for him so she had never been able to look at him as just one of the mackades or just her friend or just the sheriff shed always felt something more now she was free and she could let those feelings out she could admit that it wasnt just part of her heart that be longed to him but all of it all of her through the worry came the wonder and with it the joy she loved when the phone rang she raced to it like a madwoman then struggled to keep her voice calm when savannah greeted her hi i guess youve heard the big news by now no ones talking about anything else to calm herself cassie reached over to the refrigerator and took out a pitcher of juice have you seen devin since it happened not personally jared has he says our big bad sheriff is annoyed with all the glory a television crew came down from hagerstown and the papers been here because she understood cassies silence perfectly she softened her voice hes fine cassandra not a scratch just grumbling because this whole business is going to keep him tied up for a while are you all right me cassie stared at the juice shed poured im fine im just concerned i know i have to admit that by the time bryan finished giving me the playbyplay i was pretty concerned myself but the one thing we can all be sure of is that devin mackade can handle himself yes cassie picked up the glass set it down again he can i guess theres no one who needs anyone worrying about him less than devin but why hadnt he called listen i really called to ask you a favor sure what can i do you can give my temper a break and send connor over for the night bryans been nagging me since he got home from the great bank rob bevy oh cassie peeked out the window into the yard where connor and emma were playing with the cat hed love it if youre sure there was a crash and cassie could hear savannah yell bryan mackade if you break a window with that baseball youre not only out of the game youre suspended for the season yes im sure she said to cassie with feeling when she returned to talk in the receiver but theres more can we have emma too emma you want emma to spend the night jared has this idea that wed better start practicing with girls we sure know boys and he started thinking that once layla starts growing up well be lost she laughed and cassie heard the baby coo so how about giving us emma for the experiment we swear well turn her back over in one piece shed be thrilled but savannah youd have four to deal with yeah weve decided thats our magic number if you know what i mean four it was cassies turn to chuckle well youre going to need plenty of practice then lets just see how we survive one night pack them up will you cassie jared will walk over through the woods and get them on one condition youll call anytime if you want to bail out youve got my word on that one there was another crash and something shattered all right bryan now you have to die hurry cassie i have to believe theres safety in numbers though it tugged at her heart a little cassie supervised he overnight packing while her children bristled with excitement they were so eager to go and she tried not to fret that it was emmas first sleepover she made certain they had clean clothes toothbrushes instructions on how to behave they even took the cat when they trooped off toward the woods with jared she was completely utterly alone with too much time she realized to think to brood to worry she went down to the inn found the handful of guests well occupied and content stdl she set up cake and coffee in the parlor offered complimentary wine to those playing cards in the sun room seeing that she wasnt needed she set the table for breakfast and checked her pantry and refrigerator though she knew she was well supplied for the large sunday breakfast the inn was becomingrenowned for at loose ends she wandered outside she wasnt used to having nothing to do no one to look after certainly she had often fantasized about how she would spend an evening alone a bubble bath a booka late movie on television that was what she would do she told herself as soon as she ran into town and made sure devin was really fine she dashed up the stairs then let ou a yelp when she saw the shadowy figure on the porch swing i saw you were busy devin said thought id wait she still had a hand against her speeding heart i thought you had to stay in town i dragooned donnie into staying at the office its the least hecan do after he left me with the phones all damn afternoon he held out a bouquet of yellow tea roses i brought you flowers i was going by the florist and remembered id never brought you flowers i know you like them theyre beautiful are you going to sit down with me all right she sat and held the roses in her arms as she would have a child theyre beautiful she said again i should put them in water theyll keep a minute curious he tucked a hand under her chin and turned her face to his what is it its nothing i was so worried she blurted out i couldnt leave and kept waiting for you to call devin why didnt you call im sorry she said immediately i shouldnt nag you one of the scars he mused and kept his fingers firm when she would have looked away dont be sorry i did call several times your phone was busy everyones been calling ive heard a dozen different stories the truths probably less exciting he had a gun didnt he you knew he had a gun when you went into the bank i had to do my job cass he wasnt going to get anywhere and even if he did there was a canister inside the moneybag that would have spewed red paint all over him and the bills his grin spread actually im kind of sorry we couldnt play that part out it would have been some show but he might have hurt someone he might have hurt you well then you didnt hear about how bullets bounce off me instead of laughing she pressed her face into his shoulder im so glad youre all right im so glad youre not hurt im so glad youre here im happy to be all of those things slipping an arm around her he set the swing in motion id have come sooner if i could i know you were on the news yeah so i hear you didnt see she turned her head theyll show it again at eleven i know what i look like studying his face she found something endearing youre embarrassed no im not he shifted maybe some not just endearing she realized adorable im awfully proud of you she murmured and brushed her lips over his actually we taped the broadcast connor was so excited we can watch it if you want ill pass i dont she interrupted him with her lips again and experienced an odd sweet power when she felt his heart jump ive watched it three times i thought you looked like a movie star you dont get out enough his palms were damp so he eased off the swing a little distance mackade he warned himself before you explode ive been thinking about that too i havent ever taken you out to dinner or anywhere you took us down to the zoo in the spring and to the fair last summer why was she looking at him like that he wondered shed never looked at him like that before with was that amusement or lust orgod i meant you and me i love having the kids but i dont have to go ou on dates devin im happy with the way things are still and all he couldnt seem to think very clearly not when she was just sitting here smiling at him a bouquet of flowers in her arms i ah brought all this food pies and cookies and cakes people have been bringing them by the office all afternoon theyre grateful with her heart tripping lightly she rose they want to show it yeah well id never be able to eat it all i gave some to donnie but i figured the kids might he backed up when she stepped forward they might want some i didnt see them when i came up its a little early for them to be in bed on a saturday night isnt it theyre not here she blessed savannah and jared and fate theyre spending the night at the cabin theyre not here no were alone hed been prepared to leave to spend a little time with her then go he wouldnt have asked to stay with her through the night with the children in the next room none of them were ready for that now they were alone and the night had just be gun a slap of desire whipped through him painfully he braced against it and managed an easy smile then ill take you out i dont want you to take me out she murmured i want you to take me to bed it closed his throat cassie his hand was very gentle on her cheek i dont expect that every time i come here thats not the only reason i want to be with you i know she turned her lips into his palm its what id like tonight im going to put these in water she left him churning and speechless on the dark porch more than a little dazed he followed her in side i bought this at regans shop briskly cassie filled a green depressionglass pitcher with water im still getting used to having a little extra money to buy pretty things i dont even feel guilty about it any more you shouldnt feel guilty about anything oh a few things with hands as gentle as they were efficient she arranged the roses in the pitcher but not this and not you her eyes lifted do you know what i feel about you devin about us he thought it was best not to try to speak just then not with the way the blood was draining out of his head dazzled she murmured you dazzle me you make me feel things and want things i never knew i could have im almost twentynine and youre the only man whos really touched me i want you to touch me he would as soon as he could he sure he had his hands and his needs under control if it had been anyone but cassie he would have thought she was seducing him because he said nothing made no move toward her she was afraid she was doing it all wrong it wasnt nerves now that plagued her so much as doubt and doubt had her shifting her gaze back to the flowers if youd rather not right now if you dont want me god it exploded out of him made her head whip up in alarm made him bite back whatever might have come out next lets go for a drive he said quickly its a pretty night the moons coming up id like to go for a drive with you she was sure shed made some foolish mistake but couldnt put her finger on it all she was sure of was that her system was in overdrive and his wasnt as a seductress she thought she was a miserable amateur all right if you like he recognized that tone the bright and false cheerfulness he would have slit his throat before he did anything to cause that cassie its not that i dont want to make love with you i do its just that maybe im a little more revved from this morning than i thought i need to smooth out some of the edges before i i cant touch you now he ended his tone too sharp too quick why because im a little too needy right now and it doesnt help for you to keep looking at me that way i wouldnt be able to id hurt you youre angry with me no he swore ripely showing her some portion of his frustration in the way he whirled around and paced when im angry with you youll know it youre driving me crazy look at the way youre standing there with your hands folded and those big gorgeous eyes watching every move i make i cant breathe when you look at me like that i used to be able to he shot the words out like an accusation but that was before and i just cant handle it as well now that weve been together weve got to get out of here before i eat you alive were not going anywhere it

almost brutal making all the years of patience nothing in his rush to taste her flesh he ripped her blouse the sound of the seam tearing would have snapped him back but she moaned and wrapped herself around him instinctively he recognized the quiver of her body as desire not fear it clawed at him i cant stand it then dont she murmured thrilling when his arms clamped around her when he lifted her off her feet so that she was pressed hard against him heat to heat touch me she fisted her pale hands in his dark hair amazed at the hunger that swarmed through her ill go crazy if you dont nearly stumbling his mouth racing over her face and throat he headed for the bedroom but she wrapped her legs tight around his waist and shot new fire into his blood by the doorway he pressed her against the wall using it to brace her his desperate mouth clamped over her breast suckling hard through her tattered blouse her response was to throw back her head and rock against him more she couldnt believe what was coming out of her mouth couldnt believe this vicious need had been in either one of them with a groan she reached down and tore her own blouse aside so that his mouth could take her she climaxed the instant his teeth closed over her shocking herself with the power of it for an instant she was like a moth pinned quivering helplessly and then she was alive bursting with life mindless as coupling animals they dragged each other to the floor she pulled at his shirt he yanked at her slacks speech was impossible as they rolled over the floor in the narrow hallway groping for each other there were only gasps and moans no sighs now no murmurs only hissing breath and thundering pulses craving drove him a craving long suppressed and denied he yanked her hips high and ripped her practical cotton panties to shreds and made her scream with his greedy mouth she bucked then stiffened into a quaking bridge her arms straining as her body arched up toward him he drove her ruthlessly relentlessly until throaty growls rumbled in her throat more this time it was he who demanded it he who groaned as her nails scraped up his back and dug crescents into his shoulders when her hand closed around him his vision grayed and the drumbeat of his pulse scrambled she was moving under him writhing her eyes were nearly black and blind with pleasure when he fused his mouth to hers again it was greed rather than control that kept him from ending it that had him sliding sleekly down her body again tasting and taking and touching until they were both mad he reared up clamped his hands over hers then plunged into her beyond all reason he pumped and thrust angling her rocking hips so that he could immerse himself in her deep then deeper his mind had gone dark leaving only snarling sensations as he rammed into that hot wet pleasure with a feral force that had them both gasping she couldnt hold on she tried for him how could she have known he needed like this that she was capable of needing like this how could she have known until he finally showed her but she was being tossed too high now to fight her way back her hands slid off his damp skin rapped hard on the wooden floor she gave herself willingly to the last savage stab of pleasure going weak as he continued to hammer himself into her then that wonderful hard body heaved went rigid she saw him throw his head back as if in pain saw with wonder that it was he who was lost when he shuddered shuddered and cried out her name she wept with the joy of it he felt the tears against his shoulder the moment his sated body collapsed on hers he would have levered himself away instantly but her arms came around him dont please dont move im sorry there was nothing he could say to her that would be good enough nothing he could say to himself that would be bad enough i hurt you i promised i wouldnt do you know what you did her lips were curved but he couldnt see all he could see was his own careless treatment of the most precious thing in his life you forgot forgot again he tried to shift again she held him tight you forgot to be careful you forgot to worry you forgot everything i didnt know i could make you do that it makes me feel a long satisfied sigh powerful powerful his throat was bonedry he wanted to lift her up off the floor god hed taken her on the floor he wanted to tuck her into bed and soothe her but the word shed used and the tone baffled him strong sexy at last she lifted her arms stretched them above her head in a long lazy movement powerful ive never felt powerful before i like it oh i really like it eyes closed lips curved she hummed in her throat and that was his fir it glimpse of her when he lifted his head the smug smile and erotic glow of h woman whod just discovered a dangerous and exciting secret his blood stirred all over again she looked triumphant he realized just who he wondered had ravaged who you like it he repeated mmm i want to feel this way again and again and again i want to feel cherished too the way i do when youre gentle i want to feel everything i ma you forget she opened her eyes again and laughed when she saw the stunned and sated look in his eye st i seduced you didnt i you destroyed me i tore your clothes i know it was exciting will you do it again i he shook his head but when it didnt clear he gave up and lost himself in her eyes anytime can i rip yours words failed him he managed a couple of strangled st unds before clearing his throat wed better get off the floor i like it here i like knowing you wanted me so much you couldnt wait she lifted a hand to toy with the dark curls that fell damp over his forehead i like the way youre looking at me right now its probably wrong and i dont care but i like knowing you wanted me for years that you watched me and wanted me like this i didnt exactly picture it like this her lips curved again a sly knowing smile that made his blood swim didnt you welli maybe his brain was still numb it was the only part of him that seemed to have shut down once in a while she pressed her lips together ran the tip of her tongue over them i can still taste you oh god a quick and delicious tremor coursed through her as she felt him move inside her im doing it again huh seducing you he couldnt get his breath looks like that she felt powerfully a woman a normal competent wellloved woman tell me you love me derin while youre ill frog me while youre wanting me tell me you love me he couldnt keep himself from hardening again from driving deep into her from groaning as her body rose and fell with him i love you helpless he buried his face m hair somehow shed taken the reins from him he could do nothing but ride i cant stop she absorbed it all the love the passion the power willingly matching his fast and desperate pace when she knew he was falling off the edge with her when they were each defenseless she turned her lips to his ear i love you devin i love you i think i always have when he could s pgak again he gathered her up cradled her in his lap ive wanted to hear that for long time i meant it i couldnt have said it unless i did i know and it left him shaken and without defenses youve tossed my master plan into dumpster cars how well i had it plotted out you see by my r coning id get you to fall in love with me by ch mas then id kc p things at a nice steady pace a talk you into marrying me by spring lets not talk about marriage devin not yet now he tipped her head back when i dont know there was worry in her eyes and in her voice marriage isnt always the right answer it is for people like you and me he nearly s of the children but stopped himself it wasnt use them to press his case id make you happ i know you would she turned her face into the curve of his neck let this be enough for now its so much more than i ever thought id have let it be enough for now for now he contented himself with the scent of her hair why dont we do this c t ourselves some wine some of that pie have a little picnic id like that she leaned back smiled ill get a couple of plates but when she reached for her slacks his hand closed over hers youre not going to need those he said his eyes dark and wicked she laughed im not going to serve pie bucknaked then she blinked felt a quick skitter of her pulse am i why dont we see chapter school was out and that made life for two tenyearold boys close to perfect the haunted woods that fringed between bryans cabin and the inn beckoned there they could search for ghosts listen for the pounding of mortar fire or hunt for more tangible remnants of war in the dirt and brambles even after more than a century old shells could be unearthed connor had a collection bryan envied stubby bullets that looked like they were made of day an old brass button that had survived the uniform it belonged to and best of all the metal triangle of a stirrup cassie had unearthed in the garden of the inn the boys had decided it had belonged to a union general and his trusty steed connor viewed this stretch of summer in a way he never had before the last year had been exciting when they moved into the new apartment but hed still worried often that it would all end now hed come to believe now he could anticipate the long hot days the companionship of his best friend and a home where no one stumbled in drunk with fists raised he watched his mother still her eyes no longer looked so tired and she laughed so much more than she had ever laughed before he liked the way she put pretty things around the house the flowers the pale green glass shed begun to collect from regans shop but he kept quiet about that because he knew the guys would rag on him for liking something as lame as flowers or glass bowls but not bryan bryan was the best of friends and didnt even mind if emma tagged along with them bryan liked to listen to connors stories bryan could keep secrets bryan was his brother his blood brother they had held a solemn ceremony in the wods pricking their fingers and mixing their blood together to seal the bond they spent some of those early days of freedom from books and classrooms in the tree house jared had built on the edge of the woods nearest the cabin some they spent in the yard of the inn practicing baseball they would also cut through the trees and visit shane at the farm as bryan said shane was very cool and he never minded if they wanted to play with the dogs and the puppies or hang out in the hayloft of the big old barn but almost every day it was the woods that pulled at them and tonight they had finally wangled permission to camp out just the two of them deep in the haunted woods they had pitched devins old tent it was devin connor knew who had turned the tide his mother had worried over the idea of letting the two boys loose for a night but devin had talked to her about rites of passage and memories and friendships he owed the most important night of his life to sheriff mackade they had built a fire carefully in a circle of stones on clear ground as devin had shown them and they had hot dogs and marshmallows to roast over it cassic had given them a big jug of juice but devin had slipped them a sixpack of soda and told them to take the empty cans along with the other trash over to the farm in the morning for disposal their sleeping rolls were spread out in the tent the moon was high and bright overhead and owls were hooting the fire crackled and the scent of scorched meat stung the night air the sweet gooey taste of marshmallow was in connors mouth and he was in heaven this is the best he said its pretty cool bryan watched his hot dog turn black on the end of his stick just the way he liked it we should do it every night connor knew it wouldnt be special if they did it every night but didnt say so its great here sheriff mackade said that he and his brothers used to camp out in the woods all the time dad likes to walk in the woods bryan loved using that word dad he tried to use it often without making it a big deal mom too they sure kiss a lot he made smacking noises with his lips so connor would laugh beats me why kissings supposed to be so damn neat i think id gag if a girl tried to put her mouth on me disgusting revolting especially the tongue part at that bryan executed very realistic vomiting sounds that had both boys rolling with laughter shanes always kissing girls connor rolled his eyes i mean always i heard your dad say hes got an addiction bryan snorted at that its weird i mean shane knows all there is to know about animals and machines and stuff but he likes having girls hang around he gets this funny look in his eye too like devin does with your room i figure some girls must zap some guys brains likea laser beam what do you mean connor had gone very still you know zap bryan demonstrated with a pointed finger and cocked thumb no about sheriff mackade and my room jeez hes really stuck on her the hot dog was thoroughly burned concentrating bryan blew on the end before biting in and filling his mouth with charcoal he hangs around her all the time and brings her flowers and junk thats what my dad did with mom hed bring her flowers and shed go real dopey over them he shook his head screwy he comes around because hes looking out for us connor said but the sweet taste in his mouth had gone sour because hes the sheriff sure he looks out for you involved with his hot dog bryan didnt see the panic in his pals eyes maybe thats how he got stuck on her in the first place but man hes gone i heard my more and dad talking the other night and mom said how she got a kick out of seeing the big bad sheriff thats what she calls him out of seeing him coweyed over cassie coweyed bryan snickered at the em hey if they get married wed be cousins and blood brothers thatd be great shes not getting married connors voice lashed out so fast and furious that bryan nearly bobbled the rest of his dinner hey shes not going to marry anyone ever again connor leaped to his feet fists clenched youre wrong youre making it up am not whats your problem he comes around because hes the sheriff and hes looking out for us thats it you take it back he might have but the martial glint in connors eyes sparked one in his own get real anybody can see devins got the hots for your mom connor was on him like a leech knocking bryan back rolling over the dirt surprise and panic gave him the first advantage as his fists pummeled at bryans ribs but it was his first fight and bryan was a veteran within a few sweaty moments bryan had connor pinned both of them were scraped and filthy and breathing hard in reflex bryan bloodied connors lip snarling like a young wolf give up no connor jabbed an elbow out and had bryan grunting into the brambles they rolled gasping out threats and curses again bryan pinned him and again he raised his fist he stopped froze he would have sworn he heard something something that sounded like a man dying but it didnt sound of this world you hear that yeah connor didnt loosen his grip on bryans ripped tshirt but his eyes darted left and right it didnt sound real though it sounded like ghosts the word came through bryans cold lips jeez con theyre really here its the two corporals connor didnt move a muscle he didnt hear it anymore just the owls and the rustle o pounds small animals in the brush but he felt it and he suddenly understood that was whatwar was he thought stranger against stranger brother against brother fighting killing dying and he was ashamed because bryan was his brother and hed raised his fist to him raised his fist he thought as tears stung his eyes as joe dolin had done to mama and to him im sorry he couldnt stop the tears just couldnt not even when bryan stared down at him im sorry hey its okay you hit good uncomfortable he patted connors shoulder before he levered himself to his feet systematically he tugged aside brambles and picked thorns out of his clothes and flesh you just got to work on your guard is all i dont want to fight i hate fighting connor sat up and curled himself into a ball of misty bryan cast around for something to say man were a mess youre going to have to come up with a good story for how we got our clothes torn and stuff maybe we could say we were attacked by wild dogs thats stupid nobodyd believe that you come up with one con bryan coaxed youre real good at stories connor sighed kept his head on his knees he didnt want to lie he hated lying as much as he did fighting but he didnt think he could stand seeing disappointment in his mothers eyes well say we lost the baseball in the blackberry bushes and got all caught up in the thorns it was simple bryan decided and sometimes simple was best how about your lip its going to puff up real good i guess i fell down bryan wiped his hands on his dirty jeans does it hurt you can putone of the soda cans on it its okay look con i didnt mean anything by what i said nothing bad about your mom i mean shes great it i thought somebody was saying something bad about my more id beat the hell out of them its okay connor said again i know ym werent well whatd you go at me like that for calmer now connor rested his chin on his knees i thought sheriff mackade was coming around because he liked me well sure he likes you hes coming around for my mother hes probably been kissing her and maybe even more you know bryan shrugged well since hes stuck on her everythings been good everythings changed and its so great the way it is weve got the apartment and mamas happy and hes locked up now everythings going to be ruined if she marries the sheriff itll ruin everything why devins cool i dont want a father not ever again dark eyes dominated connors dirty tearstreaked face hell take over and things will change back hell start drinking and yelling and hitting not devin thats what happens connor said in a fierce whisper itll all be his instead of ours and itll all have to be his way and if it isnt hell hurt her and make her cry he had an image of devin making a vow offering his hand on it right here in the woods but he pushed it aside thats what fathers do mine doesnt bryan said reasonably hed never hit my mom he yells but she yells back sometimes she yells first its pretty cool he hasnt hit her yet she just hasnt made him mad enough she makes him real mad sometimes one time she made him so mad i thought smoke was going to come out of his ears like in a cartoon he picked her right up and threw her over his shoulder bryan shook his head he didnt hurt her they started wrestling around on the grass and she was yelling at him and swearing then they started laughing then they started kissing bryan rolled his eyes man it was embarrassing if hed really been mad im telling you he was his face gets real hard and his eyes too he was really steaming did it scare you nah then bryan moved his shoulders again well maybe it does just a little when i do something to make him really mad at me but its not because i think hes going to belt me or anything bryan let out a long breath then shifted so that he could drape an arm over connors shoulders look con devins not like joe dolin he fights yeah but not with girls or kids whats the difference connor was about the smartest person he knew bryan thought but he could be so dopey you just socked me right are you going togo home and whip up on emma of course not id never he broke off brooding maybe its different i have to think about it cool satisfied bryan rubbed his sore ribs lets break out a soda and you can make up a ghost story a really gruesome one because devin had awakened early he was up and feeding the pigs when he spotted the two boys crossing from the woods with their gear and bag of trash he lifted a hand in greeting then cocked a brow when he saw the scrapes bruises and ripped shirts must have been some night he said mildly run into bears bryan chuckled and greeted the exuberant fred and ethel nab wolves umhmm he studied connors puffy lip looks like you put up a hell of a battle he started to reach out for connors chin but the boy jerked back we lost the baseball in the berry bushes connor said flatly we got tangled up and i fell your mothersll probably buy that devin decided your dad wont he told bryan but hell let it slide he emptied the bucket of grain into the trough and had the pigs squealing greedily howd it go otherwise it was great bryan stepped onto the bottom rung of the fence to watch the pigs we ate hot dogs and marshmallows and told ghost stories we even heard the ghosts sounds eventful thank you for the tent connor said stiffly no problem why dont you hang on to it i imagine youll use it again before i will i dont want it connor said with a lack of courtesy so out of character devin only stared i dont want anything he dropped the tent on the ground i have to go he stood for a moment chin jerked up waiting for devin to show him what happened when you sassed but devin only studied his face and there was puzzlement rather than anger in his eyes put some ice on that lip shoulders stiff connor turned and walked quickly away without a word to his friend ill keep the tent devin mortified and irritated bryan shot connors back a seething look he doesnt mean to be a jerk hes ticked at me do you know why when bryan kept his head down his hands in his pockets devin sighed i dont want you to break a confidence bry if ive done something to hurt connor id like to make it right i guess its my fault miserable bryan scuffed his shoe in the dirt i said something about how you were stuck on his mom and he went nut so devin rubbed a hand over his suddenly tensed neck is that what you fought about no answer again and devin nodded okay thanks for telling me dcvin loyalty had never been a problem for bryan before now he felt himself tugged in different directions its just hes just scared i mean cons not a wimp or anything but hes scared that if you have you know like a thing going with mrs dolin thingsll be like they were before you know hes got it stuck in his mind that youd start punching out on his mom the way that bastard i mean the way joe dolin did bryan looked around but connor had already disappeared into the woods i tried to tell him he was off but i guess he didnt really believe me okay i got it hell probably hate me for telling you no he wont you did right bryan youre a good friend youre not mad at him are you for talking back no im not mad at him you know how jared feels about you bryan pleasure and embarrassment mixed tinted his cheeks yeah i feel pretty much the same way about con and emma i just have to give him time to get used to it shed tried not to worry really she had but when she looked out the window and saw connor crossing toward the inn the relief was huge cassie set aside the flour shed taken out for pancakes and went to the kitchen door of the inn im down here connor did you have she saw the bruised face the torn clothes and her heart froze in her chest she was outside like a bullet terror seeping out of every pore what happened oh baby who hurt you let me im all right still seething connor jerked away from her the look he aimed at her was one shed never seen from him before it was filled with fury and disdain im just fine isnt that what you always told me after he hit you i fell down i slipped i walked into the damn door connor well ill tell you the truth i had a fight with bryan i hit him he hit me honey why would you again he jerked away from her hands its my business why i dont have to tell you everything just like you dont tell me everything it was rare very rare for her to have to discipline the boy no you dont she said evenly but you will mind your tone when you speak to me his swollen lip trembled but he kept his eyes steady why didnt you ever tell him that why didnt you ever tell him to mind his tone when he spoke to you you let him say anything he wanted do anything he wanted her own shame at hearing the bald truth from her son swamped her connor if this is about your father dont call him that dont ever call him my father i hate him and im ashamed of you she made some sound as tears sprang to her eyes but she couldnt speak youre going to let it happen again connor raged on youre just going to let it happen i dont know what youre talking about connor come inside and sit down and lets straighten this out theres nothing to say i wont stay if you marry sheriff mackade i wont stay and watch when he hits you i wont let you make me have a father again she sucked in a harsh breath forced it out again im not going to marry him connor id just started to think about it but i would never have made a decision on something that important without talking to you and emma and id never marry anyone if you were against it i couldnt he wants you to yes he wants me to he loves me and wants us to be a family he deserves a family when she said it she realized how true it was how selfish shed been to ask him to wait he cares for us i thought you cared for him connor i dont want a father im not ever going to have one no matter what you do everythings good now and youre going to ruin it no i wont she blinked the tears back go upstairs now connor and get cleaned up i wont do as youre told she said sternly however you feel about me im your mother and im in charge i have to fix breakfast down here you clean up and keep an eye on emma until im finished she turned and walked back into the kitchen somehow she got through it the cooking the serving the conversations when shed finished clearing up she checked on the children suggested that they play in the yard while she tidied the guest rooms she refused connors stiff offer to help and left them to play she was changing the linens on the bed in abigails room when she heard the front door open and close she knew it was devin she knew hed come she didnt know that connor had heard the car and demanding a vow of silence from emma crept into the hallway can i give you a hand with that devin asked no cassie smoothed the contoured sheet out then reached for the top one ive got it i saw con and bry over at the farm this morning youre not upset with him are you boys get into tussles no im not upset about that about what she drew a breath shed gone over it in her mind countless times already that morning shed let her children down all their lives whatever it cost she would never do so again devin i need to talk to you im here connors very upset very hurt she kept her hands busy tucking the sheet folding it down smoothing it hes sensed or been told something about us and i know i told you i saw him this morning id say what he is cassie is mad yes he is and upset and hurt frightened she added pressing her lips together to steady them most of all frightened i cant let him be frightened devin not after what hes already been through you didnt cause it didnt i meticulously she fluffed and patted the pillows into place doing nothing to stop it all those years is the same as causing it the first eight years of his life were a nightmare i didnt put an end to i thought i was shielding him i told myself i was but he knew hes ashamed of me thats not true cassie devin moved to her took her hands if he said that it was because he was angry with me and you were the nearest target he adores you ive hurt him devin more than i ever realized maybe emma too i see now that ive just started to make things right make things up to them now im letting it change before they can adjust before they can trust i cant do that devin and i cant see you anymore panic reared up echoed clearly in his voice you know thats not the answer ill talk to him i dont want you to do that cassie tugged her hands from his i have to handle this devin i need to prove to connor that i can and that he and emma come first im not asking to come ahead of them damn it just to be a part of your life of their lives i love you cassie i know i love you i always will but i cant he with you dont ask me to choose what are you asking me to do he demanded to just walk away ive waited for you for twelve years i cant keep waiting for everything to be perfect its never going to be perfect it just has to be right were right cassie you mean everything to me so do the kids i need you i need all of you that cut her heart out devin if things were different well make them different he insisted taking her by the shoulders well make it work im not going to ask you to wait she stepped back turned toward the window you need me and hearing you say that is wonderful even more wonderful than when you first told me you loved me but connor needs me too and hes just a little boy hes my little boy and hes frightened she took a deep breath so that she could get it all out cleanly you want marriage family and youre entitled to that youre entitled to have someone whos free to give you what you want and need but im not free and i may never be free i cant give you what youre entitled to so i cant be with you devin you expect me just to step back as if nothings happened between us just step back and wait no its time you stopped waiting theres no one but you her heart ripped in two ragged pieces one for the man one for the boy you havent let there be i let you hold on to me devin i think part of me always knew youd be there and that was so unfair im trying to be fair now to everyone fair its fair to toss me all of what we have together aside because a tenyearold boy demands it when the hell are you going to take charge cassie it was the first time hed ever hurt her she faced it accepted it thats what im trying to do taking charge doe snit always mean doing what you want sometimes it means doing whats right for the people you love damned if ill beg you suddenly bitter suddenly furious he bit off each word damned if ill ask you again cassie ive had enough of standing on the sidelines and breaking my heart over you ive stripped myself bare for the last time hurting you is the last thing i want devin but i cant give you what you need most so i cant give you anything his eyes cut into her as hard and searing as his voice its time it was down to all or nothing youve made your choice looks like ive made mine she listened to his receding footsteps heard the door slam downstairs this she knew was what abigail had felt when she sent the man she loved away this emptiness this emptiness that was too huge for grief cassie sat on the edge of the bed buried her face in her hands and sobbed in the corner of the hallway connor kept his hand tight on his sisters mamas crying emma whispered i know it wasnt joe dolin that had made her cry either connor thought and it wasnt sheriff mac katie it was him and only him while cassie wept and connor crept downstairs with grief and guilt heavy on l is shoulders joe dolin look his chance hed waited oh hed waited so patiently for just the right moment the creek rushed under the burnside bridge with a harsh bubbling sound the trees were thick with leaves his supervisor was gesturing to one of the other men his attention distracted by a nest of copperheads theyd unearthed that was all it took joe bent to gather litter working his way toward cover step by careful step and then he melted into the trees as he walked quickly through the woods he stripped off his orange vest and tossed it into the brush beside the creek he didnt run not right away he still had trouble with the peripheral vision in his right eye thanks to an injury hed received when he attacked regan mackade so he moved carefully at first deliberately turning his head to judge his ground and his distance then he sprinted wild as a dog over rocks through brush and finally into the creek breathing hard he kept to the water following its curves and angles before long he was wet to the waist but he kept going pushing himself panting he scrambled up the side of the bank using rocks and vines to heave himself clear then he took a deep gulp of freedom he would use the sun and the direction of the creek to show him the way he wanted to go when devin made up his mind he was as hard to swerve as a sixton truck so when rafe wandered into his office saw devin sitting behind his desk typing furiously with his face set in stubborn lines he knew there was trouble im supposed to ask you to dinner rare said easily beat it regan wanted to have the whole family over tomorrow plus cassie and the kids im going to be busy now get the hell out of here i didnt mention what time rare continued and walked over to look over devins shoulder what the bells this just what it looks like looks like a resignation to me what wild hair do you have up your get off my back rare did the brotherly thing and ripped the paper out of the typewriter chill out before devin could lunge to his feet rare slapped a hand on his shoulder look we can pound each other i dont mind but why dont we get the preliminaries out of the way what the hell are you doing resigning as sheriff what i should have done a long time ago im getting the hell out of this town im tired of being stuck here in the same damn rut with the same damn people dev you like nothing better than a rut rafe tossed the paper aside what happened with casshe nothing leave it arent you the one who came breathing down my neck and made me face up to what i felt for regan one good turn i dont have to face what i feel for cassie ive faced it for years what i have to do is get over it she turn you down the vicious gleam indevins eyes didnt frighten rare it touched him go ahead take a shot at me ill give you a free one forget it deflated devin dropped back into his chair want to talk about it im talked out he rubbed his hands over his face im tired connor doesnt trust me she doesnt trust me it comes down to neither of them wanting me enough i cant keep trying to prove myself the kids come a long way der so has cassie give them a little time ive run out of time i need something back rafe devin drew a deep breath i just cant keep hurting like this its killing me im getting out before rafe could speak the phone rang devin snagged the receiver and all but spit into it sheriffs office mackade he was on his feet in a flash swearing violently when thats over a damn hour ago why in hell wasnt i notified dont give me that crap he listened for another minute then slammed down the receiver dolins out he strode over to the gun cabinet unlocked it and pulled out a rifle youre deputized chapter j oo stayed hunkered in the ravine across from the little rancher where his motherinlaw lived he doubted theyd look for him there not right away theyd go to his friends check on cassie maybe just maybe mackade or one of his horsefaced deputies would swing by but his mamainlaw wasnt home there was no ear in the drive and the curtains were drawn tight over the front windows the ranch house sat on the edge of a deadend road and was perfect for his purposes he kept his eyes peeled then scurried out of the ravine keeping low the far side of the house faced nothing but trees so he used that for his entry with an elbow he shattered a window once inside he headed toward the main bedroom he needed fresh clothes and knew she kept some of her dead husbands things hanging in the closet like shrouds the old bag was morbid she was also paranoid that was how he knew there would be a pistol in her nightstand drawer fully loaded the only thing he wouldnt find in the house was a drink but hed see to that soon enough instead in dry clothes too small for his frame he settled down to wait he heard her drive up listened to her fiddling with the locks and bolts on the front door he smiled as he rose and walked out into the darkened living room she was carrying a bag of groceries in one arm a cheap purse in the other her eyes widened when she saw him joe what in the world he did what hed wanted to do for years he swung out and knocked her flat with the back of his hand actually he thought about killing her but he wanted to save that for his darling little wife as she moaned and flailed at him weakly he tied her with clothesline gagged her once she was secured wriggling like a fish on the floor he dumped out her purse twenty lousy bucks he complained i shoulda known he stuffed the bills in his pocket and picked up her keys im going to borrow your car need to take a little trip a little trip with my wife a wifes bound to go where her husband tells her to go isnt that right he grinned as she rolled her eyes as sick panic dulled them it was real obliging of you to write all those letters to the prison real obliging thats why im not going to mess you up too bad i want to show you how i appreciate it he laughed when constance moaned and babbled against the gag now cassies a different thing isnt she she didnt stick by her husband like a proper wife did she but im going to take care of that im going to teach her a real good lesson want to hear what im going to do to your daughter old woman want to hear what i got planned for her because he was enjoying the panic in her eyes joe hunkered down and told her devin squealed to a halt at the inn his eyes scanned every bush every tree as he hurried around to the back and up the stairs he didnt stop praying until he opened the door and saw cassie at the stove he couldnt help it he grabbed her dragged her hard against him and just held on devin sorry clamping down on every emotion he drew back and became a cop again i have to talk to you he flicked a glance to the living room where connor and emma sat staring at him he started to tell connor to take emma to her room and stay there then realized he was thinking like a father not a cop joe walked off work release just over an hour ago cassies knees buckled devin held her up and guided her to a chair sit down and listen ive got people checking on his known associates the places where he used to hang out well pick him up cassie does he know youre living here i dont know she said dully my mother might have i dont know we wont chance it i want you to get whatever you need im going to take you over to the cabin the cabin youll stay with savannah i need jared i need shane too or id have taken you over to the farm pull it together cassandra he said sharply enough to have her eyes clearing i cant go to the cabin devin i cant put savannah and her children in danger savannah can handle it so can i give me a minute she needed to take a breath connor and emma will go wherever you think theyll be safe no maam connor curled his trembling hand over emmas im not going anywhere without you im not leaving you nobodys leaving anybody youre all going where i tell you to go get your things devin snapped or do without them savannah is not responsible for me and mine cassie said slowly i am i dont have the time to be patient with you i cant stay here and take care of you so youre going he whirled around connor his stomach queasy saw a kind of fury hed never seen before not even in joe dolins eyes get downstairs into the car i can take care of my mother im counting on it but not here doas i tell you connor devin take the children and the hell with this he spun around again picked cassie up bodily and flung her over his shoulder out he shouted at connor then swore when the boys blood drained out of his face damn it boy dont you see id die before id hurt her before id hurt any of you and connor did so clearly that the shame of it burned color back into his cheeks yes sir come on emma put me down devin cassie didnt bother to struggle please put me down well go he set her on her feet keeping him hands on her shoulders for a moment you have to let me take care of you you have to let me do that at least trust me cassie i do she reached for connors hand we do make it quick he put ah and on the screen door scanned quickly before stepping out weve got roadblocks he began helicopters are on the way odds are well have him before nightfall how many at the inn no one we have a family coming in tonight but ill take care of it just dont when the shot rang out it was so sudden so shocking cassie could do nothing but gasp devin collapsed at her feet hi honey joe walked forward a grin on his face a gun in his hand im home she did the only thing she could do she shoved the children behind her and faced him she saw the changes in him his face was thinner harder as his body was there was a scar beside and beneath his right eye puckered and white but the eyes themselves were the same brutal ill go with you joe she knew devin was breathing but there was blood on his temple where the bullet had streaked he needed help an ambulance the only way to save him and her children was to surrender herself ill go wherever you want just dont hurt my babies ill do whatever i want with your brats bitch and youll do just what i tell you he looked down at devin sneered not so tough now is he i should have aimed better he squinted laughed got a little problem with the eye but ill do a lot better close up as if in a dream she saw his face saw the gun lower the cold came over her the cold and the knowledge that this had happened before only then it had been a young wounded soldier and a woman too weak too frightened to save him no she screamed threw herself over devins body hes hero she knew her words were useless and struggled to find others if you kill him joe and they catch you youll never get out again do you know what happens when you kill a police officer it isnt worth it i said id go with you you stay there ill just shoot through you then maybe he smiled again shifted his gun toward connor stay away from my babies like a woman possessed she lunged threw herself at him with a fire and fury that nearly knocked him over even when he hit her she clung like a burr then connor was on him pummeling shouting jo swatted him off like a fly ill teach you manners you little brat before he could strike out with the butt of the gun he heard the sound of sirens later he said as connor scrambled to his feet ill be back for you later he had am arm around cassies throat choking her the gun to her temple his only escape he saw was the woods ill kill her he shouted to anyone who could hear anyone comes after me shes dead he dragged her away trampling flowers on the ground emma squeezed devins hand please wake up please wake up connor crawled to him as rafe and a deputy rushed around the house he shot him be shot him and he took mama grimfaced rafe bent over his brother its not as bad as it looks it helped to say it he pulled a bandana out of his pocket and stanched the blood hes coming around he murmured and relief washed through hi ming a flood as devin stirred connor go in and call an ambulance hurry no devins eyes fluttered open he batted his brothers hand away im okay cassie youre shot you idiot but even as rafe tried to hold him down devin was fighting his way up his vision wavered grayed a short stream of oaths helped steady it again whered he take her to the woods connor bit his lip he took her into the woods he was hurting her i tried to stop him take care of your sister devin ordered i want men posted around the woods notify jared tell him to get back to the cabin he might go there you stay with these kids he ordered his deputy get them inside im going in with you rare stated you can go in eyes cold devin drew his weapon but hes mine cassie did whatever she could to slow him down now that he was away from her children and devin she would not be a silent victim again she scratched she bit she kicked forgot whos boss didnt you thought you could lock me up in a cage and forget who was in charge cursing her he shoved the gun into his waistband so that he could use both hands to drag her im going to have a good time reminding you theyll find you theyll catch you and lock you up for good this time maybe theyll catch me ma he they wont he stumbled along hauling her after him and losing his direction in his fury he hated these damn woods the mackade woods ive had a lot of time to think about this i know just what were going to do were going to get us a car thats what were going to do he cursed the fact that hed had to leave the one hed already stolen behind ive got friends he muttered ive got plenty of friends wholl help me out youve got no one you never did devinll come after you joe and hell never stop hes lying on his back and bleeding to death hell never stop she said again nothing you do to me will come close to what hell do to you got something going with him dont you joe stopped breathless and dragged her head back by the hair he thought he heard voices in his head voices saying the words just before he did you whore i own you dont you forget ii i own you till death do us part youre a miserable drunken bully defiance bolted through her like lightning you dont own anything not even yourself youre pathetic she barely winced when he yanked mercilessly on her hair the only thing you can beat is something weaker than you go ahead joe hit me its the only thing you know how to do but this time damn you to hell youre in for a fight he grabbed her hair using that hand to knock her sprawling on the path the pain only energized her eyes hot and deadly she got to her feet her fists clenched he stepped forward and she braced ready even eager to defend herself if you touch her if you breathe on her ill put a hole in you slowly joe turned devin was less than three yards back on the path his weapon drawn and aimed rafe mackade was behind him as his eyes darted in search of an escape shane stepped out of the trees and jared moved up the path behind cassie drop the gun dolin take it out slow and drop it or ill kill you youre plenty brave mackade joe wet his lips as he took the gun out with two fingers stooped to set it on the ground when youve got four guns on me and your brothers standing by kick it this way yeah a real hero long as its not onetoone joe gave the gun a shove with his foot youve been helping yourself to my wife havent you you dont have a wife devin turned handed his gun to rafe stay back he demanded then skimmed a glance over his other brothers all of you he looked at cassie briefly saw the bruises already forming and felt hatred wash through him get to the cabin cassie savannah will take you back to the kids you dont have io do this oh yeah i do and he smiled lets go joe its been a long time coming whats to stop one of your brothers from shooting me in the back once i beat you to a pulp mackade nothing now the smile turned feral this is the last shot youre going to get at me though you yellow son of a bitch so make it good joe shouted ferociously as he lunged all devin had to do was pivot and pump upward with a fist to send joe reeling back tougher when its somebody near your own size isnt it devin taunted tougher when its not a woman or a little boy come on you bastard try again blood spilling from his lip joe came at him like a bull the woods cracked with the sound of bare knuckle against bone of men grunting cassie forced herself not to cover her face with her hands it was for her each blow devin threw or received was for her so she would watch all the fear shed felt of joe ebbed as she did he was exactly what she had called him a pitiful bully his size and the wildness of his attack helped him land a few blows certainly it was that size that had him overbalancing devin to the ground but even there even outweighed devin dominated his fists were fast brutal and the look on his face was so concentrated she knew he felt none of the hits he took she didnt turn her face away from the blood hold her hands over her ears to block tut the sound this was the end finally the end and she needed to bear witness the rage was on him so thick so cold that he could see noth mg but joes face each time his fist hammered down each time the power of it sang up his arms he felt nothing but dark deadly pleasure his knuckles were raw his shirt was splattered with blood some of it his own but he couldnt stop his fist from pumping thats enough jared stepped forward to pull devin off and nearly got a fist in the face for his trouble thats enough he repeated but it took all three of them to drag devin to his feet thats a satisfying sight rare commented studying joes battered and unconscious face i guess i cant be too ticked you didnt leave a piece of him for me looks like he resisted arrest right jare shane shouldered his rifle scratched his chin thats the way i saw it come on dev lets haul this carcass in you need a beer and an ice pack but the rage hadnt faded away not completely devin jerked his brothers hand from his shoulder leave me alone he turned looked to where cassic still stood pale bruised eyes wide with shock im finished he took off his badge tossed it into the dirt take him im going home devin when cassie started forward jared put out a hand to stop her give him some time he murmured watching devin cut through the woods toward the farm hes hurting she tried she went to her children and comforted them she let regan and savannah come to her and fuss over her bruises she spoke to her mother briefly on the phone and reassured herself that though her mother had been bruised and terrified there was no serious damage and perhaps there was some understanding between them that theyd never shared before in the end she gave in and took the sedative that was pushed on her and slept like the dead through the night but in the morning she knew she hadnt finished facing her demons she let regan deal with breakfast and readied herself to go to the farm and face devin the only thing she needed to take she tucked into the pocket of her slacks youre going to see sheriff mackade connor stepped into her bedroom doorway his eyes were swollen and shadowed there was a faint bruise on his cheek and he was still so very pale cassie wanted badly to gather him close but he was standing so stiff yes i need to talk to him connor i need to thank him for what he did hell say it was his job yes i know he will that doesnt mean i dont have to thank him he could have been killed connor for us i thought he was dead at first when his voice broke he sucked in a breath and steadied it again when he fell and there was all the blood i thought we were all gong to be dead she shuddered tried to keep the tears out of her voice im sorry connor for what i did for what i didnt do i hope one day youll forgive me it wasnt your fault it wasnt ever i shouldnt have said those things he wanted to look away but he knew that would make him a coward he knew what cowards were like now it wasnt true and it wasnt the way i really felt i said it to hurt you hecause i felt bad connor she held her arms out closing her eyes tight when he raced into them that part of our lives is over i promise you its over i know you were pretty brave unbearably touched she kissed the top of his head so were you this time he sucked in a deep breath sheriff mackade stood up for us emma and i want to go with you we talked about it we want to see the sheriff it might be better if i talked to him alone just now hes feeling hes upset i have to talk to him please how could she deny her child the same closure she needed for herself all right well go together from his seat on the front porch of the farm devin saw them come out of the woods he nearly got up and went inside but it seemed a small and petty revenge they looked like a unit he realized and he supposed however much it hurt him that was what they needed to be his head was still aching and hands burned but that was nothing compared to the pain in his gut as he watched cassie and the children cross the wide front lawn there were bruises on her face and on the boys fury flashed in his blood like lightning then emma broke away from cassies hand and raced to him we came to thank you because you took the bad man away she crawled right into his lap as if she belonged there you have hurts solemnly she touched her puckered lips to the cuts and bruises to the white bandage on his temple is that better now he gave in for a moment and pressed his face into her hair yeah thanks before cassie could speak he shifted emma onto his knee if they havent contacted you i can tell you theyve already transferred him to the state prison with the new charges the escape the assaults grand theft auto the weapons possession assault with a deadly weapon and he ran his fingers over his ripped knuckles and resisting arrest hes not going to see the light of day again you and your family have nothing to worry about are you all right was all cassie could manage tin fine you just fine her fingers curled and uncurled over connors we wanted to come and thank i was doing my job i told her youd say that connor said and earned a mild glance from devin so im predictable he looked back at cassie you handled yourself well cass you want to remember that ive got work to do as he started to set emma down cassie moved forward devin please dont he hurt you the words burst out of him he hurt all of you and i didnt stop him you were shot for gods sake you were lying there unconscious and bleeding the bad man was going to shoot you again emma told him but mama wouldnt let him she lay on top of you so he couldnt every ounce of his hot blood went cold at the thought of it damn it cassie are you crazy you needed me she let out a shaky breath i couldnt stand back devin i did what i had to do now im going to ask you to do what you know is right she took his badge out of her pocket dont give this up devin dont go he stared at the badge in her hand then into her face again you know what its like to see something you want you need day after day and know you cant have it im not living like that anymore not even for you you wont let me be part of your life you wont marry me and i cant go on being your friend and nothing else ill marry you emma curled into him i love you his heart simply shattered he held emma tight then set her gently on her feet i cant handle this cassie he rose blindly go home and leave me be sheriff mac katie connor bolted forward then skidded to a halt im sorry youve got a right to your feelings devin said steadily and no need to apologize for them sir i got something to say devin rubbed a hand over his face dropped his arms all right get it out then i know youre mad at me yes sir you are connor said keeping his eyes level when devin started to correct him i was mad too because i thought youd come around just for me or mostly and then i found out it was because of mama and i thought if shed let you youd change things and theyd get bad again even though youd given your word bryan told me they wouldnt but i didnt believe him i didnt want to he had to takea deep breath yesterday when you came to make us go to the cabin and mama said she wouldnt you were mad you were already mad and then you were madder than anything werent you thats right you yelled yeah i did i thought this is it this is when hes going to hit her you knew i was thinking it but you werent going to you told me youd never hurt her not for any thing i knew you meant it i knew when you went into the woods after her youd do anything to save her it wasnt just because it was your job it was because it was her because it was us he gathered the rest of his shaky courage and climbed the steps until he stood facetoface with devin even after she sent you away even after i made her send you away you wouldnt hurt her i couldnt hurt her connor if my life depended on it thats how it is yes sir and she

made her cry and i want to tell you im sorry i want to tell you that i dont want a father i cant help it all right devin knew he would fall apart in a minute its all right i dont want a father connor

was easy to see rebecca was different he doubted shed walk away unscathetkwhen the time came they worked together in silence until shane shut off the motor and squinted up at the sky its going to rain we havent got much time to get this in but his gaze wandered to the house where rebecca and the other women were busy in the kitchen damn it shane disgusted devin pulled out a bandanna and mopped his brow youre sleeping with her who dont give me that arent there enough women to the fall of shane mackade dangle after around here without sniffing around regans friend shes not even your type shane

then what the bell ave you going to do thats my business isnt it mine and rebeccas i didnt push her into anything he wasnt going to talk about it and he certainly wasnt going to worry about it a man

in the house since mom died cramping your style a smile curved shanes lips nope catching the look rare set down the bale hed just lifted you are sleeping with her what am i wearing a sign cant you keep it in your pants for once in disgust rare sliced his baling hook down regan feels responsible for her why the hell should anybody feel responsible shes a grown woman shane spared devin a glance before he turned on rafe its none of his business its none of your business anything connected to regans my business and rebeccas connected what do you know about her do you know how she was brought up how she spent all her time in classrooms with tutors in boarding schools what difference does it make irritated because he didnt know because what he knew was far from enough shane ignored the rain the work and let oat his frustration on his brother shes got a brain she uses it thats all she was ever allowed to use she wouldnt stand a chance if you aimed for her back off shane snarled at rare and stay out of my personal life devin plucked out a spear of hay and gnawed on it we shouldve figured hed hit on her i didnt hit on her thats bull shed barely unpacked her bags and you were stalking her in my kite hem i shouldve punched you out right then shanes eyes narrowed try it now youve got it all figured out dont you now that youve got your pretty wife and pretty kids all of you there was more anger than hed realized boiling inside of him i live my life my way not yours so stick your advice and your judgments and anything else youve got up your from the kitchen window rebecca watched the four men she was puzzled at first it had seemed they were having some sort of serious discussion then it had looked as though an argument was brewing somethings going on out there she commented and savannah an infant over her shoulder wandered to the window oh theyre going to go at it at what the fall of shane mackade each other what else she shook her head and called to regan and cassic who were busy at the stove our boys are about to rumble fight shocked to the core rebecca goggled you mean theyre going to fight with each other but why regan walked to the kitchen door opened it its just something they like to do from time to time do you think its soon enough to stop it cassie wondered we can no regan finished as the first blow was launched too late with horrified eyes rebecca watched shanes fist streak out and plow into rafes face an instant later they were rolling in the dirt why doesnt somebody stop them rebecca demanded jared and devin are just standing there not for long savannah predicted as if on cue devin reached down if his intention was to break it up he failed miserably now there were three men wrestling in the mud the rain had churned up this is ridiculous by the time rebecca reached the kitchen door jared had joined the fray tin going to put a stop to this thing right now as rebecca marched out savannah slanted a look at regan shes really stuck on him isnt she im afraid so it worries me i think shes good for him cassie joined them at the door i think hes good for her too both of them need someone even if they havent figured that out yet the only thing rebecca figured as she marched toward the barn was that these four grown men brothers no less were absolute fools by the time rebecca neared the battlefield she was soaked stop it she stood hands on hips and realized they were laughing four baboons she decided laughing while they beat on each other get up from there all of you you should be ashamed eyes hot she scalded every one of them in turn i said get up you choosing at random she pointed a righteous finger at devin youre a sheriff for gods sake youre supposed to uphold order and here you are rolling in the mud like a hooligan yes maam gamely devin swallowed a chuckle and disengaged himself from the tangle of limbs dont know what got into me and you the valiant finger was aimed at jared a lawyer what are you thinking of nothing he rubbed a hand over his sore jaw before he rose absolutely nothing rafe mac katie she had the pleasure of seeing him wince a businessman a member of the community husband and father what kind of example are you setting for your children a poor one he cleared his throat and got to his feet he had the feeling that if he let the laugh loose shed put him on his butt again and you she said with such contempt in her voice shane decided to stay in the mud i thought better of you i didnt start it the fall of shane mackade typical response just typical is this how you settle your disagreements violence is never the answer and theres no problem that cant be solved with reason and communication isnt she something shane said in a tone that had all three of his brothers studying him have you ever seen anybody like her come on and kiss me sweetie if you think you can she let out a shriek as he caught her just at the back of the knees and had her sprawling on top of him you idiot you brainless then she was flat on her back covered by wet hard male his mouth trembling with laughter swooped down on hers shes the prettiest little thing and then he was kissing her senseless the rain beat down mud slicked her hands and there was an audience of fascinated onlookers she just didnt care as he watched rare found himself grinning im damned he murmured shes hooked him i think youre right devin rubbed his bloody cheek on his muddy shoulder ive never seen him look at any woman that way think he knows it i dont think either of them have a clue delighted jared swiped wet hair out of his eyes its going to be a pleasure rare hooked his thumbs in his pockets and rocked back on his heels a real pleasure to watch shane mackade take the fall
