tune pouring out their matin hymn all at once a conscious thrill led me half against my will to look up abashed i see his dark eyes full fixed on me what he said i do not know but his voice was soft

can pay you may take me robert if you will one pleasant summer night the garden walks alone looking about with restless eyes wondering whither my rose had flown till from a leafy arbor near there came to my ears the sound of speech who can be with rose to night let me hide me under the beach it must be one of her female friends talking with her in the gloaming gray perchance i thought they may speak of me let me listen to what they say this i said with a careless smile and a joyous heart that was free from fears little i dreamed that the words i heard would weigh on my heavy heart for years rose my rose for your heart is mine i heard in a low voice passionfraught in the sight of heaven we are truly one why will you cast me away for naught will you give your hand where your heart goes not to a man who is grave and stern and old and whose love compared with my passionheat as the snow of the frozen north is cold and rose i could feel her cheek grow pale her voice was tremulous then grew strong richard she said your words are wild and you do my guardian bitter wrong did you never hear how years gone by she spoke in a tremulous undertone bereft of friends oer the worlds highways i wandered forth as a child alone he opened to me his home and heart he whom you call so stern and cold and my grateful heart i may well bestow on him for his kindness manifold rose he said in a saddened tone i thank him for all he has done for thee he has acted nobly i did him wrong but is there no voice in your heart for me and rose she trembled i felt it all i heard her quick breath come and go her voice was broken she only said have pity richard and let me go and then heaven gave me strength i think i stood before them calm and still you might have thought my tranquil breast had never known one passionthrill and they alternate flushed and paled rose tottered and i feared would fall i caught her in supporting arms and whispered rose i heard it all i had a dream but it is passed that we might journey hand in hand along the rugged steeps of life until we reached gods promised land this was my dream tis over now thank heaven it is not yet too late i pray no selfish act

phoebe where is the chit when i want her most shes out of the way child youre running a long account up to be squared on judgmentday where have you been and what have you there to the pasture for buttercups wet with dew my patience i think you are out of your wits i wonder what good will buttercups do theres pennyroyal you might have got it might have been useful to you or me but i never heard in all my life of buttercup cordial or buttercup tea i want you to stay and mind the bread ive just put two loaves in the oven to bake when they are clone take them carefully out and put in their place this loaf of cake while i run over to widow browns her son from the mines has just got back i dont believe hes a cent in his purse young men are so shiftless now alack it was very different when i was young young men were prudent and girls were wise you wouldnt catch them gadding about like so many idle butterflies so bustled and scolded the worthy dame until she had passed the outer sill to do her justice it seldom chanced that her hands were idle or tongue was still so phoebe gathered her knitting up and sat her down in the chimney niche but her mind was on other thoughts intent and here and there she dropped a stitch the yellow kitten purred on the hearth while the kitchen clock with its frame of oak in the corner stood like a sentinel and challenged time with its measured stroke but phoebes mind was on none of these the bread in the oven her good aunts frown and the scene before her faded away and blended with thoughts of reuben brown how they walked together on summer days or bravely faced the winters chill and chatted merrily all the way to the little schoolhouse on sligo hill how both grew older and schooldays passed when he was a youth and a maiden she how often she went with reuben brown to the rustic dance or the social bee the warm flush deepened on phoebes cheek and she breathed a low halfconscious sigh ah welladay they were happy times but he has forgotten and so must i so phoebe gathered her knitting up which while she was thinking had fallen down when her quick ear caught a strange footfall and there in the doorway stood reuben brown with the same frank handsome face she knew a smile as bright and an eye as black phoebe he said i have wandered far are you glad to see your playmate back the kitten still purred on the kitchen hearth and the ancient clock with its frame of oak in the corner stood like a sentinel and challenged time with its measured stroke a pleased light shone in the maidens eyes ah love young love it is very sweet reuben had gone but she sat quite still and the knitting lay untouched at her feet just then the dame came bustling in and went to the oven without ado why phoebe child what have you done the bread is baked as black as my shoe and phoebe started and blushed for shame took up her knitting and dropped it down and when her aunt said what ails you child she hastily answered reuben brown ah love young love it is very sweet in field or hamlet or crowded mart but it burns with the brightest purest flame in the hidden depths of a young maids heart the lost heart one golden summer day along the forestway young colin passed with blithesome steps alert his locks with careless grace rimmed round his handsome face and drifted outward on the airy surge so blithe of heart was he he hummed a melody and all the birds were hushed to hear him sing across his shoulders flung his bow and baldric hung so in true huntsmans guise he threads the wood the sun mounts up the sky the air moves sluggishly and reeks with summer heat in every pore his limbs begin to tire slumbers his youthful fire he sinks upon a violetbed to rest the soft winds go and come with low and drowsy hum and ope for him the ivory gate of dreams beneath the forestshade there trips a woodland maid and marks with startled eye the sleeping youth at first she thought to fly then timid drawing nigh she gazed in wonder on his fair young face when swiftly stooping down upon his locks so brown she lightly pressed her lips and blushing fled when colin woke from sleep from slumbers calm and deep he felthe knew not howhis heart had flown and so with anxious care he wandered here and there but could not find his lost heart anywhere then he with air distraught and brow of anxious thought went out into the world beyond the wood of each that passed him by he queried anxiously i prithee hast thou seen a heart astray some stared and hurried on while others said in scorn your heart has gone in search of your lost wits the day is wearing fast young colin comes at last to where a cottage stood embowered in trees he looks within and there he sees a maiden fair who sings low songs the while she plies her wheel i prithee maiden bright she turns as quick as light and straight a warm flush crimsons all her face she much abashed looks down for on his locks so brown she seems to see the marks her lips have made whereby she stands confest what need to tell the rest he said i think fair maid you have my heart nay do not give it back i shall not feel the lack if thou wilt give to me thine own therefor john maynard twas on lake eries broad expanse one bright midsummer day the gallant steamer ocean queen swept proudly on her way bright faces clustered on the deck or leaning oer the side watched carelessly the feathery foam that flecked the rippling tide ah who beneath that cloudless sky that smiling bends serene could dream that danger awful vast impended oer the scene could dream that ere an hour had sped that frame of sturdy oak would sink beneath the lakes blue waves blackened with fire and smoke a seaman sought the captains side a moment whispered low the captains swarthy face grew pale he hurried down below alas too late though quick and sharp and clear his orders came no human efforts could avail to quench the insidious flame the bad news quickly reached the deck it sped from lip to lip and

at the stern the dreaded flames above the deck appear john maynard watched the nearing flames but still with steady hand he grasped the wheel and steadfastly he steered the ship to land john maynard can you still hold out he heard the captain cry a voice from out the stifling smoke faintly responds ay ay but half a mile a hundred hands stretch eagerly to shore but half a mile that distance sped peril shall all be oer but half a mile yet stay the flames no longer slowly creep but gather round that helmsman bold with fierce impetuous sweep john maynard with an anxious voice the captain cries once more stand by the wheel five minutes yet and we shall reach the shore through flame and smoke that dauntless heart responded firmly still unawed though face to face with death with gods good help i will the flames approach with giant strides they scorch his hand and brow one arm disabled seeks his side ah he is conquered now but no his teeth are firmly set he crushes down his pain his knee

one sad day a deadly sin which being done he drew back selfabhorred from the rebuking presence of the lord and kneeling down besought with bitter cry since life was worthless grown that he might die all night he knelt and when the morning broke in patience still he waits deaths fatal stroke when all at once a cry of sharp distress aroused anselmo from his wretchedness and looking from the convent window high he saw a wounded traveller gasping lie just underneath who bruised and stricken sore had crawled for aid unto the convent door the friars heart with deep compassion stirred when the poor wretchs groans for help were heard with gentle hands and touched with love divine he bathed his wounds and poured in oil and wine with tender foresight cared for all his needs a blessed ministry of noble deeds in such devotion passed seven days at length the poor wayfarer gained his wonted strength with grateful thanks he left the convent walls and once again on death anselmo calls when lo his

where avon rolls its silvery tide i stood in silent thought by shakspeares tomb o happy church beneath whose marble floor his ashes lie who so enriched mankind the manysided shakespeare rare of soul and dowered with an allembracing mind through the stained windows rays of sunshine fall in softened glory on the chancel floor while i a pilgrim from across the sea stand with bare head in reverential

many a banner with gay device floats in the outer air the walls are of solid silver the towers are of massive gold and the lights that stream from the windows a royal scene unfold ah could you but enter my castle with its pomp of regal sheen you would say that it far surpasses the palace of aladeen could you but enter as i do and pace through the vaulted hall and mark the stately columns and the pictures on the wall with the costly gems about them that send their light afar with a chaste and softened splendor like the light of a distant star and where is this wonderful castle with its rich emblazonings whose pomp so far surpasses the homes of the greatest kings come out with me at morning and lie in the meadowgrass and lift your eyes to the ether blue and you will see it pass there can you not see the battlements and the turrets stately and high whose lofty summits are tipped with clouds and lost in the arching sky dear friend you are only dreaming your castle so stately and fair is only a fanciful structure a castle in the air perchance you are right i know not if a phantom it may be but yet in my inmost heart i feel that it lives and lives for me for when clouds and darkness are round me and my heart is heavy with care i steal me away from the noisy crowd to dwell in my castle fair there are servants to do my bidding there are servants to heed my call and i with a masters air of pride may pace through the vaulted hall and i envy not the monarchs with cities under their sway for am i not in my own right a monarch as proud as they what matter then if to others my castle a phantom may be since i feel in the depths of my own heart that it is not so to me appleblossoms i sit in the shadow of appleboughs in the fragrant orchard close and around me floats the scented air with its wavelike tidal flows i close my eyes in a dreamy bliss and call no king my peer for is not this the rare sweet time the blossoming time of the year i lie on a couch of downy grass with delicate blossoms strewn and i feel the throb of natures heart responsive to my own oh the world is fair and god is good that maketh life so dear for is not this the rare sweet time the blossoming time of the year i can see through the rifts of the appleboughs the delicate blue of the sky and the changing clouds with their marvellous tints that drift so lazily by and strange sweet thoughts sing through my brain and heaven it seemeth near oh is it not a rare sweet time the blossoming time of the year summer hours it is the years high noon the earth sweet incense yields and oer the fresh green fields bends the clear sky of june i leave the crowded streets the hum of busy life its clamor and its strife to breathe thy perfumed sweets o rare and golden hours the birds melodious song wavelike is borne along upon a strand of flowers i wander far away where through the forest trees sports the cool summer breeze in wild and wanton play a patriarchal elm its stately form uprears which twice a hundred years has ruled this woodland realm i sit beneath its shade and watch with careless eye the brook that babbles by and cools the leafy glade in truth i wonder not that in the ancient days the temples of gods praise were grove and leafy grot the noblest ever planned with quaint device and rare by man can ill compare with these from gods own hand pilgrim with wayworn feet who treading lifes dull round no true repose hast found come to this green retreat for bird and flower and tree green fields and woodland wild shall bear with voices mild sweet messages to thee june throw open wide your golden gates o poetlanded month of june and waft me on your spicy breath the melody of birds in tune o fairest palace of the three wherein queen summer holdeth sway i gaze upon your leafy courts from out the vestibule of may i fain would tread your garden walks or in your shady bowers recline then open wide your golden gates and make them mine and make them mine little charlie a violet grew by the riverside and gladdened all hearts with its bloom while over the fields on the scented air it breathed a rich perfume but the clouds grew dark in the angry sky and its portals were opened wide and the heavy rain beat down the flower that grew by the riverside not far away in a pleasant home there lived a little boy whose cheerful face and childish grace filled every heart with joy he wandered one day to the rivers verge with no one near to save and the heart that we loved with a boundless love was stilled in the restless wave the sky grew dark to our tearful eyes and we bade farewell to joy for our hearts were bound by a sorrowful tie to the grave of the little boy the birds still sing in the leafy tree that shadows the open door we heed them not for we think of the voice that we shall hear no more we think of him at eventide and gaze on his vacant chair with a longing heart that will scarce believe that charlie is not there we seem to hear his ringing laugh and his bounding step at the door but alas there comes the sorrowful thought we shall never hear them more we shall walk sometimes to his little grave in the pleasant summer hours we will speak his name in a softened voice and cover his grave with flowers we will think of him in his heavenly home in his heavenly home so fair and we will trust with a hopeful trust that we shall meet him there the whippoorwill and i in the hushed hours of night when the air quite still i hear the strange cry of the lone whippoorwill who chants without ceasing that wonderful trill of which the sole burden is still whippoorwill and why should i whip him strange visitant has he been playing truant this long summer day i listened a moment more clear and more shrill rang the voice of the bird as he cried whippoorwill but what has poor will done i ask you once more ill whip him dont fear if youll tell me what for i paused for an answer oer valley and hill rang the voice of the bird as he cried whippoorwill has he come to your dwelling by night or by day and snatched the young birds from their warm nest away i paused for an answer oer valley and hill rang the voice of the bird as he cried whippoorwill well well i can hear you dont have any fears i can hear what is constantly dinned in my ears the obstinate bird with his wonderful trill still made but one answer and that whippoorwill but what has poor will done i prithee explain im out of all patience dont mock me again the obstinate bird with his wonderful trill still made the same answer and that whippoorwill well have your own way then but if you wont tell ill shut down the window and bid you farewell but of one thing be sure i wont whip him until you give me some reason for whipping poor will i listened a moment as if for reply but nothing was heard but the birds mocking cry i caught the faint echo from valley and hill it breathed the same burden that strange whippoorwill carving a name i wrote my name upon the sand and trusted it would stand for aye but soon alas the refluent sea had washed my feeble lines away i carved my name upon the wood and after years returned again i missed the shadow of the tree that stretched of old upon the plain to solid marble next my name i gave as a perpetual trust an earthquake rent it to its base and now it lies oerlaid with dust all these have failed in wiser mood i turn and ask myself what then if i would have my name endure ill write it on the hearts of men in characters of living light of kindly deeds and actions wrought and these beyond the touch of time shall live immortal as my thought in time of war gone to the war my charlie has gone to the war my charlie so brave and tall he left his plough in the furrow and flew at his countrys call may god in safety keep him my precious boy my all my heart is pining to see him i miss him every day my heart is weary with waiting and sick of the long delay but i know his country needs him and i could not bid him stay i remember how his face flushed and how his color came when the flash from the guns of sumter lit the whole land with flame and darkened our countrys banner with the crimson hue of shame mother he said then faltered i felt his mute appeal i paused if you are a mother you know what mothers feel when called to yield their dear ones to the cruel bullet and steel my heart stood still for a moment struck with a mighty woe a faint as of death came oer me i am a mother you know but i sternly checked my weakness and firmly bade him go wherever the fight is fiercest i know that my boy will be wherever the need is sorest of the stout arms of the free may he prove as true to his country as he has been true to me my home is lonely without him my hearth bereft of joy the thought of him who has left me my constant sad employ but god has been good to the mother she shall not blush for her boy where is my boy tonight when the clouds in the western sky flush red with the setting sun when the veil of twilight falls and the busy day is done i sit and watch the clouds with their crimson hues alight and ponder with anxious heart oh where is my boy tonight it is just a year today since he bade me a gay goodby to march where banners float and the deadly missiles fly as i marked his martial step i felt my color rise with all a mothers pride and my heart was in my eyes theres a little room close by where i often used to creep in the hush of the summer night to watch my boy asleep but he who used to rest beneath the spread so white is far away from me now oh where is my boy tonight perchance in the gathering night with slow and weary feet by the light of southern stars he paces his lonely beat does he think of the mothers heart that will never cease to yearn as only a mothers can for her absent boys return oh where is my boy tonight i cannot answer where but i know wherever he is he is under our fathers care may he guard and guide and bless my boy wherever he be and bring him back at length to bless and to comfort me may god bless all our boys by the campfires ruddy glow or when in the deadly fight they front the embattled foe and comfort each mothers heart as she sits in the fading light and ponders with anxious heart oh where is my boy tonight a soldiers valentine just from the sentrys tramp i must take it again at ten i have laid my musket down and seized instead my pen for pacing my lonely round in the chilly twilight gray the thought dear mary came that this is st valentines day and with the thought there came a glimpse of the happy time when a schoolboys first attempt i sent you in borrowed rhyme on a giltedged sheet embossed with many a quaint design and signed in schoolboy hand your loving valentine the years have come and gone have flown i know not where and the schoolboys merry face is grave with manhoods care but the heart of the man still beats at the wellremembered name and on this st valentines day his choice is still the same there was a time ah well think not that i repine when i dreamed this happy day would smile on you as mine but i heard my countrys call i knew her need was sore thank god no selfish thought withheld me from the war but when the dear old flag shall float in its ancient pride when the twain shall be made one and feuds no more divide i will lay my musket down my martial garb resign and turn my joyous feet toward home and valentine last words dear charlie breathed a soldier o comrade true and tried who in the heat of battle pressed closely to my side i feel that i am stricken my life is ebbing fast i

safely brought me through my words are weak dear charlie my breath is growing scant your hand upon my heart there can you not hear me pant your thoughts i know will wander sometimes to where i lie how dark it grows true comrade and faithful friend goodby a moment and he lay there a statue pale and calm his youthful head reclining upon his comrades arm his limbs upon the greensward were stretched in careless grace and by the fitful moon was seen a smile upon his face song of the croaker written by request for the philadelphia sanitary fair an old frog lived in a dismal swamp in a dismal kind of way and all that he did whatever befell was to croak the livelong day croak croak croak when darkness filled the air and croak croak croak when the skies were bright and fair good master frog a battle is fought and the foemans power is broke but he only turned a greener hue and answered with a croak croak croak croak when the clouds are dark and dun and croak croak croak in the blaze of the noontide sun good master frog the forces of right are driving the hosts of wrong but he gave his head an ominous shake and croaked out nous verrons croak croak croak till the heart is full of gloom and croak croak croak till the world seems but a tomb to poison the cup of life by always dreading the worst is to make of the earth a dungeon damp and the happiest life accursed croak croak croak when the noontide sun rides high and croak croak croak lest the night come by and by farewell to the dismal frog let him croak as loud as he may he cannot blot the sun from heaven nor hinder the march of day though he croak croak croak till the heart is full of gloom and croak croak croak till the world seems but a tomb king cotton king cotton looks from his window towards the westering sun and he marks with an anguished horror that his race is almost run his form is thin and shrunken his cheek is pale and wan and the lines of care on his furrowed brow are dread to look upon but yesterday a monarch in the flush of his pomp and pride and not content with his own broad lands he would rule the world beside he built him a stately palace with gold from beyond the sea and he laid with care the cornerstone and he called it slavery he summoned an army with banners to keep his foes at bay and gazing with pride on his palace walls he said they will stand for aye but the palace walls are shrunken and partly overthrown and the storms of war in their violence have loosened the cornerstone now famine stalks through the palace halls with her gaunt and pallid train you can hear the cries of famished men as they cry for bread in vain the king can see from his palace walls a land by his pride betrayed thousands of mothers and wives bereft thousands of graves newmade and he seems to see in the lowering sky the shape of a flaming sword whereon he reads with a sinking heart the anger of the lord god speed the time when the guilty king shall be hurled from his bloodstained throne and the palace of wrong shall crumble to dust with its boasted cornerstone a temple of freedom shall rise instead on the desecrated site and within its shelter alike shall stand the black man and the white out of egypt to egypts king who ruled beside the reedy rivers flow came gods command release o king and let my people go the kings proud heart grew hard apace he marked the suppliant throng and said nay they must here abide the weak must serve the strong straightway the lord stretched forth his hand and every stream ran blood the river swept towards the sea a full ensanguined flood the haughty king beheld the land by plagues afflicted sore but as gods wonders multiplied hardened his heart the more until the angel of the lord came on the wings of night and smote firstborn of man and beast in his destructive flight throughout all egypt not a house was spared this crowning woe then broke the tyrants stubborn will he bade the people go they gathered up their flocks and herds rejoicing to be free and going forth a mighty host encamped beside the sea then pharaohs heart repented him he called a mighty force and swiftly followed on their track with chariot and with horse then israels host were sore afraid but god was on their side and lo for them a way is cleft the redsea waves divide at gods command the restless waves obey the prophets rod and through the middle of the sea the people marched dryshod but when the spoilers following close would hinder israels flight the waters to their course return the parted waves unite and pharaohs host is swept away the chariots and the horse and not a man is left alive of all that mighty force so in these days god looks from heaven and marks his servants woe hear ye his voice break every yoke and let my people go for them the redsea waves divide the streams with crimson flow therefore we mourn for our firstborn then let the people go they are not weak whom god befriends he makes their cause his own and they who fight against gods might shall surely be oerthrown the price of victory a victory a victory is flashed across the wires speed speed the news from state to state light up the signal fires let all the bells from all the towers a joyous peal ring out weve gained a glorious victory and put the foe to rout a mother heard the chiming bells her joy was mixed with pain pray god she said my gallant boy be not among the slain alas for her that very hour outstretched in death he lay the color from his fair young face had scarcely passed away his nerveless hand still grasped the sword he never more might wield his eyes were sealed in dreamless sleep upon that bloody field the chestnut curls his mother oft had stroked in fondest pride neglected hung ia clotted locks with deepest crimson dyed ah many a mothers heart shall ache and bleed with anguish sore when tidings come of him who marched so blithely forth to war oh sad for them the stricken down in manhoods early dawn and sadder yet for loving hearts god comfort them that mourn yes victory has a fearful price our hearts may shrink to pay and tears will mingle with the joy that greets a glorious day but he who dies in freedoms cause we cannot count him lost a battle won for truth and right is worth the blood it cost o mothers count it something gained that they for whom you mourn bequeath fair freedoms heritage to millions yet unborn and better than a thousand years of base ignoble breath a patriots fragrant memory a heros early death harvard odes sung at annual dinners of the harvard club of new york new york harvard odes

in loyal devotion unite ii feb as we meet in thy name alma mater tonight all our hearts and our hopes are as one and love for the mother that nurtured his youth beats high in the breast of each son the sweet chords of memory bridge oer the past the years fade away like a dream by the banks of cephissus beneath the green trees we tread thy fair walks academe the heights of hymettus that bound the near view fill the air with an odor as sweet as the beautiful clusters of suntinted grapes from the vineyards that lie at our feet o realm of enchantment o wonderful land where the gods hold high converse with men come out from the dusk of past ages once more and live in our fancy again let us drink to the past as our glasses we lift let eye speak to eye heart to heart let the bonds of sweet

tendrils that bound our hearts to the mother whose provident care encompassed her children around now strong in our manhood we cherish her still and if by misfortune brought low our strength shall support her our arms bear her up and sustain her through weal and through woe occasional odes bicentennial ode june sung at the bicentennial celebration of the incorporation of marlboro mass from the door of the homestead the mother looks forth with a glance half of hope half of fear for the clock in the corner now points to the hour when the children she loves should appear for have they not promised whatever betide on this their dear mothers birthday to gather once more round the family board their dutiful service to pay from the east and the west from the north and the south in communion and intercourse sweet her children have come on this festival day to sit as of old at her feet and our mother god bless her benevolent face how her heart thrills with motherly joys as she stands at the portal with arms opened wide to welcome her girls and her boys and yet when the first joyful greetings are oer when the words of her welcome are said a shadow creeps over her motherly face as she silently thinks of the dead of the children whose voices once rang through her fields who shared all her hopes and alarms till tired with the burden and heat of the day they have fallen asleep in her arms they have gone from our midst but their labors abide on the fields where they prayerfully wrought they scattered the seed but the harvest is ours by their toil and selfsacrifice bought as we scan the fair scene that once greeted their eyes as we tread the same paths which they trod let us tenderly think of our elders by birth who have gone to their rest and their god god bless the old homestead some linger there still in the haunts which their childhood has known while others have wandered to places remote and planted new homes of their own but time cannot weaken the ties love creates nor absence nor distance impede the filial devotion which thrills all our hearts as we bid our old mother godspeed for the consecration of a cemetery this verdant field that smiles to heaven in natures bright array from common uses set apart we consecrate today gods acre be it fitly called for when beneath the sod we lay the dead with reverent hands we yield them back to god and his great love so freely given shall speak in clearer tones when pacing through these hallowed walks we read memorial stones here let the sunshine softly fall and gently drop the rain and natures countless harmonies blend one accordant strain that they who seek this sacred place in mourning solitude in all this gracious company may have their faith renewed so lifted to serener heights and purified from dross their trustful hearts shall rest on god and profit by their loss
