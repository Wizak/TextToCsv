chapter one when she pulled the letter from her mailbox kelsey had no warning it was from a dead woman the creamy stationery the neatly handwritten name and address and the virginia postmark seemed ordinary enough so ordinary she had simply stacked it with her other mail on the old belker table under her livingroom window while she slipped out of her shoes she went into the kitchen and poured herself a glass of wine she would sip it slowly she told herself before she opened her mail she didnt need the drink to face the slim letter or the junk mail the bills the cheery postcard from a friend enjoying a quick trip to the caribbean it was the packet from her attorney that had shaken her the packet she knew contained her divorce decree the legal paper that would change her from kelsey monroe back to kelsey byden from married woman to single from half of a couple to a divorcée it was foolish to think that way and she knew it she hadnt been married to wade in anything but the most technical legal sense for two years almost as long as theyd been husband and wife but the paper made it all so final so much more so than the arguments and tears the separation the lawyers fees and legal maneuvers till death do us part she thought grimly and sipped some wine what a crock if that were true shed be dead at twentysix and she was alive alive and well and back in the murky dating pool of singles she shuddered at the thought she supposed wade would be out celebrating with his bright and spiffylooking associate in the advertising agency the associate he had had an affair with the liaison that he told his stunned and furious wife had nothing to do with her or with their marriage funny kelsey hadnt thought of it that way maybe she didnt feel shed had to die or kill wade in order to part but shed taken the rest of her marriage vows seriously and forsaking all others had been at the top of the list no she felt the perky and petite lari with the aerobically sculpted body and cheerleader smile had had everything to do with her no second chances had been given his slip as wade had termed it was never to be repeated she had moved out of their lovely town house in georgetown on the spot leaving behind everything they had accumulated during the marriage it had been humiliating to run home to her father and stepmother but there were degrees of pride just as there were degrees of love and her love had snapped off like a light the instant shed found wade cozied up in the atlanta hotel suite with lari surprise she thought with a sneer well thered been three very surprised people when shed walked into that suite with a garment bag and the foolishly romantic intention of spending the weekend leg of wades business trip with him perhaps she was rigid unforgiving hardhearted all the things wade had accused her of being when shed refused to budge on her demand for a divorce but kelsey assured herself she was also right she topped off her wine and walked back into the living room of the immaculate bethesda apartment there was not a single chair or candlestick in the sunwashed room that had stood in georgetown clean break thats what she had wanted thats what shed gotten the cool colors and museum prints that surrounded her now were hers exclusively stalling she switched on the stereo engaged the cd changer and filled the room with beethovens pathétique her taste for the classics had been passed down from her father it was one of the many things they shared indeed they shared a love of knowledge and kelsey knew shed been in danger of becoming a professional student before shed taken her first serious job with monroe associates even then shed been compelled to take classes in subjects ranging from anthropology to zoology wade had laughed at her apparently intrigued and amused by her restless shuffling from course to course and job to job shed resigned from monroe when she married him between her trust fund and wades income she hadnt needed a job shed wanted to devote herself to the remodeling and redecorating of the town house theyd bought shed loved every hour of stripping paint sanding floors hunting in dusty antique shops for just the right piece for just the right spot laboring in the tiny courtyard scrubbing brick digging weeds and designing the formal english garden had been pure pleasure within a year the town house had been a showplace a testament to her taste and her effort and her patience now it was simply an asset that had been assessed and split between them shed gone back to school that academic haven where the real world could be pushed aside for a few hours every day now she worked parttime at the national gallery thanks to her art history courses she didnt have to work not for money the trust fund from her paternal grandfather could keep her comfortable enough so that she could drift from interest to interest as she chose so she was an independent woman young she thought and glancing over at the stack of mail single qualified to do a little of everything and a lot of nothing the one thing shed thought shed excelled at marriage had been a dismal failure she blew out a breath and approached the belker table she tapped her fingers against the legal packet long narrow fingers that had received piano lessons art lessons fingers that had learned to type to cook gourmet meals to program a computer a very competent hand that had once worn a wedding ring kelsey passed over the thick envelope ignoring the little voice that hissed the word coward inside her head instead she picked up another one with handwriting oddly like her own it had the same bold looping style neat but a little flashy only mildly curious she tore it open dear kelsey i realize you might be surprised to hear from me she read on the vague interest in her eyes turning to shock the shock to disbelief then the disbelief turned into something almost like fear it was an invitation from a dead woman a dead woman who happened to be her mother in times of crisis kelsey had always for as long as she could remember turned to one person her love for and trust in her father had been the one constant in her restless nature he was always there for her not so much a port in a storm but a hand to hold until the storm was over her earliest memories were of him his handsome serious face his gentle hands his quiet infinitely patient voice she remembered him tying bows in her long straight hair brushing the pale blond tresses while bach or mozart sang from the stereo it was he who had kissed her childhood hurts better who had taught her to read to ride a bike who had dried her tears she adored him was almost violently proud of his accomplishments as the chairman of the english department at georgetown university she hadnt been jealous when hed married again at eighteen shed been delighted that hed finally found someone to love and share his life with kelsey had made room in her heart and home for candace and had been secretly proud of her maturity and altruism in accepting a stepmother and teenage stepbrother perhaps it had been easy because she knew deep in her heart that nothing and no one could alter the bond between herself and her father nothing and no one she thought now but the mother shed thought was dead the shock of betrayal was warring with a cold stony rage as she fought her way through rushhour traffic toward the lush palatial estates in potomac maryland shed rushed out of her apartment without her coat and had neglected to switch on the heater in her spitfire but she didnt feel the chill of the february evening temper had whipped color into her face adding a becoming rosy glow to the porcelain complexion a snap to lakegray eyes she drummed her fingers against the steering wheel as she waited for a light to change as she willed it to change so she could hurry hurry her mouth was clamped in a thin line that masked its lush generosity as she fought to keep her mind a blank it wouldnt do to think now no it wouldnt do to think that her mother was alive alive and living hardly an hour away in virginia it wouldnt do to think about that or kelsey might have started to scream but her hands were beginning to tremble as she cruised down the majestically treelined street where shed spent her childhood as she pulled into the drive of the threestory brick colonial where shed grown up it looked as peaceful and tidy as a church its windows gleaming its white trim pure as an unblemished soul puffs of smoke from the evening fire curled from the chimney and the first shy crocuses poked their delicate leaves up around the old elm in the front yard the perfect house in the perfect neighborhood shed always thought safe secure tasteful only a short drive to the excitement and culture of dc and with the wellpolished hue of quiet respectable wealth she slammed out of the car raced to the front door and shoved it open shed never had to knock at this house even as she started down the berber runner in the whitetiled foyer candace came out of the sitting room to the right she was as usual immaculately dressed the perfect academic wife in conservative blue wool her minkcolored hair swept back from her lovely youthful face to reveal simple pearl earrings kelsey what a nice surprise i hope you can stay for dinner were entertaining some of the faculty and i can always use where is he kelsey interrupted candace blinked surprised by the tone she could see now that kelsey was in one of her snits the last thing she needed an hour before her house filled up with people was one of her stepdaughters explosions automatically she shifted her stance is something wrong wheres dad youre upset is it wade again candace dismissed the problem with a wave of her hand kelsey divorce isnt pleasant but it isnt the end of the world either come in and sit down i dont want to sit candace i want to talk to my father her hands clenched at her sides now are you going to tell me where he is or do i have to look for him hey sis channing strode down the stairs he had his mothers strong good looks and a thirst for adventure that had according to his mother come from nowhere though hed been fourteen when candace married philip byden channings innate good humor had made the transition seamless whats up kelsey deliberately took a deep breath to keep from shouting wheres dad channing the profs in his study buried in that paper hes been writing channings brows lifted he too recognized the signs of a rage in the making the spark in the eye the flush on the cheeks there were times he would put himself out to bank that fire and times he would indulge himself and fan it hey kels youre not going to hang around with these bookworms tonight are you why dont you and i skip out hit a few clubs she shook her head and tore down the hall toward her fathers study kelsey candaces voice sharp annoyed trailed after her must you be so volatile yes kelsey thought as she yanked open the door of her fathers favorite sanctuary yes she slammed the door at her back saying nothing for a moment as the words were boiling up much too hot and much too fast in her throat philip sat at his beloved oak desk nearly hidden behind a stack of books and files he held a pen in his bony hand hed always maintained that the best writing came from the intimacy of writing and stubbornly refused to compose his papers on a word processor his eyes behind the silverframed glasses had the owlish look they took on when he amputated himself from the reality of what was around him they cleared slowly and he smiled at his daughter the desk light gleamed on his closecropped pewter hair theres my girl just in time to read over this draft of my thesis on yeats im afraid i might have gotten longwinded again he looked so normal was all she could think so perfectly normal sitting there in his tweed jacket and carefully knotted tie handsome untroubled surrounded by his books of poetry and genius and her world of which he was the core had just shattered shes alive kelsey blurted out shes alive and youve lied to me all my life he went very pale and his eyes shifted from hers only for an instant barely a heartbeat but shed seen the fear and the shock in them what are you talking about kelsey but he knew he knew and had to use all of his selfcontrol to keep the plea out of his voice dont lie to me now she sprang toward his desk dont lie to me shes alive my mothers alive and you knew it you knew it every time you told me she was dead panic sliced through philip keen as a scalpel where did you get an idea like that from her she plunged her hand into her purse and dragged out the letter from my mother are you going to tell me the truth now may i see it kelsey tilted her head stared down at him it was a look that could pick clean down to the bone is my mother dead he wavered holding the lie as close to his heart as he held his daughter but he knew as much as he wished it could be otherwise if he kept one he would lose the other no may i see the letter just like that the tears shed been fighting swam dangerously close to the surface just a no after all this time all the lies only one lie he thought and not nearly enough time ill do my best to explain it all to you kelsey but id like to see the letter without a word she handed it to him then because she couldnt bear to watch him she turned away to face the tall narrow window where she could see evening closing in on the last bloom of twilight the paper shook so in philips hand that he was forced to set the sheet on the desk in front of him the handwriting was unmistakable dreaded he read it carefully word by word dear kelsey i realize you might be surprised to hear from me it seemed unwise or at least unfair to contact you before though a phone call might have been more personal i felt you would need time and a letter gives you more of a choice on your options they will have told you i died when you were very young in some ways it was true and i agreed with the decision to spare you over twenty years have passed and youre no longer a child you have i believe the right to know that your mother is alive you will perhaps not welcome the news however i made the decision to contact you and wont regret it if you want to see me or simply have questions that demand answers youd be welcome my home is three willows farm outside of bluemont virginia the invitation is an open one if you decide to accept it i would be pleased to have you stay as long as it suited you if you dont contact me ill understand that you dont wish to pursue the relationship i hope the curiosity that pushed you as a child will tempt you to at least speak with me yours naomi chadwick naomi philip closed his eyes good god naomi nearly twentythree years had passed since hed seen her but he remembered everything about her with utter clarity the scent shed worn that reminded him of dark mossy glades the quick infectious laugh that never failed to turn heads the silvery blond hair that flowed like rain down her back the sooty eyes and willowy body so clear were his memories that when philip opened his eyes again he thought he saw her his heart took one hard violent leap into his throat that was part fear part longsuppressed desire but it was kelsey her back stiff facing away from him how could he have ever forgotten naomi he asked himself when he had only to look at their daughter to see her philip rose and poured a scotch from a crystal decanter it was kept there for visitors he rarely touched anything stronger than a short snifter of blackberry brandy but he needed something with bite now something to still the trembling of his hands what do you plan to do he asked kelsey i havent decided she kept her back to him a great deal of it depends on what you tell me philip wished he could go to her touch her shoulders but she wouldnt welcome him now he wished he could sit bury his face in his hands but that would be weak and useless more much more he wished he could go back twentythree years and do something anything to stop fate from running recklessly over his life but that was impossible it isnt a simple matter kelsey lies are usually complicated she turned then and his fingers clutched reflexively on the lead crystal she looked so much like naomi the bright hair carelessly tumbled the eyes dark the skin over those long delicate facial bones flushed luminously with passion some women looked their best when their emotions were at a dangerous peak so it had been with naomi so it was with her daughter thats what youve done all these years isnt it kelsey continued youve lied to me grandmother lied she lied kelsey gestured toward the desk where the letter lay if that letter hadnt come you wouldve continued to lie to me yes as long as i continued to think it was best for you best for me how could it be best for me to believe my mother was dead how can a lie ever be best for anyone youve always been so sure of right and wrong kelsey its an admirable quality he paused drank and a terrifying one even as a child your ethics were unwavering so difficult for mere mortals to measure up her eyes kindled it was close much too close to what wade had accused her of so its my fault no no he closed his eyes and rubbed absently at a point in the center of his forehead none of it was your fault and all of it was because of you philip after a quick knock candace opened the study door the dorsets are here he forced a weary smile onto his face entertain them dear i need a few moments with kelsey candace flashed a look at her stepdaughter disapproval mixed with resignation all right but dont be long dinners set for seven kelsey shall i set another place no candace thank you im not staying all right then but dont keep your father long she eased the door shut kelsey drew a breath stiffened her spine does she know yes i had to tell her before we were married had to tell her kelsey repeated but not me it wasnt a decision that i made lightly that any of us made lightly naomi your grandmother and i all believed it was in your best interest you were only three kelsey hardly more than a baby ive been an adult for some time dad ive been married divorced you have no idea how quickly the years go he sat again cradling the glass hed convinced himself that this moment would never come that his life was too staid too stable to ever take this spinning dip on the roller coaster again but naomi he thought had never settled for staid neither had kelsey and now it was time for truth ive explained to you that your mother was one of my students she was beautiful young vibrant ive never understood why she was attracted to me it happened quite quickly really we were married within six months after we met not nearly long enough for either of us to understand how truly opposite we were in nature we lived in georgetown wed both come from what we could call privileged backgrounds but she had a freedom i could never emulate a wildness a lust for people for things for places and of course her horses he drank again to ease some of the pain of remembering i think it was the horses more than anything else that first came between us after you were born she wanted desperately to move back to the farm in virginia she wanted you to be raised there my ambitions and hopes for the future were here i was working on my doctorate and even then i had my eye set on becoming the english department chairman at georgetown for a while we compromised and i spent what weekends i could spare in virginia it wasnt enough its simplest to say we grew apart safer to say it he thought staring into his scotch and certainly less painful we decided to divorce she wanted you in virginia with her i wanted you in georgetown with me i neither understood nor cared for the racing crowd she ran with the gamblers the jockeys we fought bitterly then we hired lawyers a custody suit stunned kelsey gaped at her father you fought over custody it was an ugly business unbelievably vile how two people who had loved each other had created a child together could become such mortal enemies is a pathetic commentary on human nature he looked up again finally and faced her im not proud of it kelsey but i believed in my heart that you belonged with me she was already seeing other men it was rumored that one of them had ties to organized crime a woman like naomi would always attract men it was as though she was flaunting them the parties her lifestyle daring me and the world to condemn her for doing as she pleased so you won kelsey said quietly you won the suit and me then decided to tell me shed died she turned away again facing the window that was dark now in it she could see the ghost of herself people divorced in the seventies children coped there should have been visitation i should have been allowed to see her she didnt want you to see her neither did i why because she ran off with one of her men no philip set the glass aside carefully on a thin silver coaster because she killed one of them because she spent ten years in prison for murder kelsey turned slowly so slowly because the air was suddenly thick murder youre telling me that my mother is a murderess id hoped never to tell you he rose then sure he could hear his own bones creak in the absolute silence you were with me i thank god you were with me rather than on the farm the night it happened she shot her lover a man named alec bradley they were in her bedroom there was an argument and she took a gun from the drawer of the bedside table and killed him she was twentysix the same age as you are now they found her guilty of murder in the second degree the last time i saw her she was in prison she told me she would rather you believe her dead if i agreed she swore she wouldnt contact you and she kept her word until now i cant understand any of this reeling kelsey pressed her hands over her eyes i would have spared you gently philip took her wrists lowering her hands so he could see her face if protecting you was wrong then ill tell you i was wrong but without apology i loved you kelsey you were my entire life dont hate me for this no i dont hate you in an old habit she laid her head on his shoulder resting it there while ideas and images spun in her brain i need to think it all seems so impossible i dont even remember her dad you were too young he murmured rocked by relief i can tell you that you look like her its almost uncanny how much and that she was a vibrant and fascinating woman whatever her flaws a crime of violence being one of them kelsey thought there are so many questions but i cant seem to latch on to one why dont you stay here tonight as soon as i can get away well talk again it was tempting to give in to close herself into the safe familiarity of her old room to let her father soothe away the hurts and the doubts as he always did no i need to go home she drew away before she could weaken i should be alone for a while and candace is already annoyed with me for keeping you from your guests shell understand of course she will youd better get along i think ill go out the back id just as soon not run into anyone right now the passionate flush had died away he noted leaving her skin pale and fragile kelsey i wish youd stay im all right really all i need to do is absorb it well talk later go see to your guests and well talk more about this later she kissed him as much a sign of forgiveness as to hurry him along once she was alone she walked behind the desk and stared at the letter after a moment she folded it and slipped it back into her purse it had been a hell of a day she decided shed lost a husband and gained a mother chapter two sometimes it was best to follow your impulses perhaps not best kelsey corrected as she drove west along route through the rolling virginia hills but it was certainly satisfying speaking to her father again might have been wiser taking time to think things through but it was much more satisfying to simply hop into the car and head to three willows farm and confront the woman whod played dead for two decades her mother kelsey thought the murderess to distract herself from that image kelsey turned up the radio so that rachmaninoff soared through the halfopen window it was a beautiful day for a drive thats what shed told herself when shed hurried out of her lonely apartment that morning she hadnt admitted her destination then even though shed checked the map to find the best route to bluemont no one knew she was coming no one knew where shed gone there was freedom in that she pressed down on the gas and reveled in the speed the whip of the chilly air through the windows the power of the music she could go anywhere do anything there was no one to answer to no one to question it was she who had all the questions now maybe shed dressed a bit more carefully than a casual drive in the country warranted that was pride the peach tone of the silk jacket and slacks was a good color for her the breezy lines flattering to her slim frame after all any woman who was about to meet her mother for the first time as an adult would want to look her best shed fixed her hair into a neat and intricate braid and spent more time than usual on her makeup and accessories all the preparations had eased her nerves but she was beginning to feel them again as she approached bluemont she could still change her mind kelsey told herself as she stopped the car in front of a small general store asking for directions to three willows didnt mean she had to follow them she could if she wanted simply turn the car around and head back to maryland or she could just drive on through virginia into the carolinas she could turn west or east toward the shore one of her favorite indulgences was hopping in her car and driving wherever the whim took her shed spent an impulsive weekend at a lovely little bedandbreakfast on the eastern shore after shed left wade she could go there again she mused a call in to work a stop at a mall along the way for a change of clothes and shed be set it wasnt running away it was simply leaving why should it feel so much like running away the little store was so crammed with shelves and dairy cases and walls of tools that three customers made a crowd the old man behind the counter had an ashtray full of butts at his elbow a head as bald and shiny as a new dime and a fresh cigarette dangling from the corner of his mouth he squinted at kelsey through a cloud of smoke i wonder if you could tell me how to get to three willows farm he stared at her another minute his smokereddened eyes narrowing with speculation youd be looking for miss naomi kelsey borrowed a look from her grandmother one designed to put the questioner firmly in his place im looking for three willows farm i believe its in this area oh yeah it is he grinned at her and somehow the cigarette defied gravity and stuck in place heres what you do you go on down the road a piece say bout two miles theres a fence there a white one youre gonna wanna make a left on chadwick road and head on down another five miles or so go on past longshot got a big wroughtiron fence with the name on it sos you cant miss it next turn you come tos got two stone posts with rearing horses on em thats three willows thank you he sucked in smoke blew it out your name wouldnt be chadwick would it no it wouldnt kelsey went out letting the door swing shut behind her she felt the old mans eyes on her even as she pulled the car back onto the road understandable she supposed it was a small town and she was a stranger still she hadnt liked the way hed stared she found the white fence and made the left out of town the houses were farther apart now as the land took over rolling and sweeping with the hills that were still caught between the haze of winter and the greening of spring horses grazed manes ruffling in the breeze mares their coats still thick with winter cropped while their young gamboled nearby on spindly toothpick legs here and there a field was plowed for spring planting squares of rich brown bisecting the green she slowed the car at longshot it wasnt a road as shed assumed but a farm the curvy wroughtiron gate boasted the name and through it she could see the long sweep of a macadam lane leading up to a cedar and stone house on the crest of a hill attractive she mused commanding its many levels and terraces would afford breathtaking views from every inch the lane was lined with elms that looked much older and much more traditional than the house itself which was almost arrogantly modern yet it perched on the hill with a territorial pride kelsey sat there for some time not that she was terribly interested in the architecture or the scenery as compelling as it was she knew if she continued down this road she wouldnt turn back longshot she decided was the point of no return it seemed ironically appropriate closing her eyes she willed her system to level this was something she should do coolly pragmatically this wasnt a reunion where she would launch herself weeping into the arms of her longlost mother they were strangers who needed to decide if they would remain so no she corrected she would decide if they would remain so she was here for answers not love not even reasons and she wouldnt get them kelsey reminded herself if she didnt continue on and ask the questions shed never been a coward she could add that to her list of vanities kelsey told herself as she put the car in gear again but her hands were cold as she gripped the wheel as she turned between the two stone posts with their rearing horses as she drove up the gravel lane toward her mothers house in the summer the house would have been shielded by the three graceful willows for which it had been named now the bowed branches were just touched with the tender green of approaching spring through their spindly fans she could see the white doric columns rising up from a wide covered porch the fluid curves of the threestory plantationstyle house feminine she thought almost regal and like the era it celebrated gracious and stately there were gardens she imagined would explode with color in a matter of weeks she could easily picture the scene heightened by the hum of bees and the chirp of birdsong perhaps the dreamy scent of wisteria or lilac instinctively her gaze lifted to the upper windows which room she wondered which room had been the scene of murder a shiver walked down her spine as she stopped the car though her intention had been to go straight up to the front door and knock she found herself wandering to the side of the house where a stone patio spilled out of tall french doors she could see some of the outbuildings from there tidy sheds a barn that looked nearly as stately as the house itself farther out where the hills curved up she could see horses cropping and the faint glitter of sun striking water all at once another scene flipped over the vision the bees were humming the birds singing the sun was hot and bright and she could smell roses so strong and sweet someone was laughing and lifting her up and up until she felt the good strong security of a horse beneath her with a little cry of alarm kelsey pressed a hand to her lips she didnt remember this place she didnt it was her imagination taking over that was all imagination and nerves but she could swear she heard that laughter the wild free seduction of it she wrapped her arms around her body for warmth and took a step in retreat she needed her coat she told herself she just needed to get her coat out of the car then the man and woman swung around the side of the house arm in arm they were so beautiful staggeringly so in that flash of sunlight that for a moment kelsey thought she was imagining them as well the man was tall an inch or more over six feet with that fluid grace certain men are born with his dark hair was windblown curled carelessly over the collar of a faded chambray shirt she saw his eyes deeply vividly blue in a face of angles and shadows widen briefly in what might have been mild surprise naomi his voice had the faintest of drawls not slow so much as rich like a fine aged bourbon you have company nothing her father had told her had prepared her it was like looking in a mirror at some future time a mirror polished to a high sheen so that it dazzled the eyes kelsey might have been looking at herself for one mad moment she was afraid she was well naomis hand clamped hard on gabes arm it was a reaction she wasnt aware of and one she couldnt have prevented i didnt think i would hear from you so soon much less see you shed learned years before that tears were useless so her eyes remained dry as she studied her daughter we were about to have some tea why dont we go inside ill take a rain check gabe began but naomi clung to his arm as if he were a shield or a savior thats not necessary kelsey heard her own voice as from a distance i cant stay long come inside then we wont waste what time you have naomi led the way through the terrace doors into a sitting room as lovely and polished as its mistress there was a low sedate fire in the hearth to ward off the latewinter chill please sit down be comfortable itll only take me a moment to see about the tea naomi shot one quick glance at gabe and fled he was a man accustomed to difficult situations he sat drew out a cigar and flashed kelsey a smile fashioned to charm naomis a bit flustered kelsey lifted a brow the woman had seemed as composed as an ice sculpture is she understandable id say you gave her a shock took me back a step myself he lighted the cigar and wondered if the raw nerves so readable in kelseys eyes would allow her to sit im gabe slater a neighbor and youre kelsey how would you know queen to peasant he thought it was a tone that would normally challenge a man certainly a man like gabriel slater but he let it pass i know naomi has a daughter named kelsey whom she hasnt seen in some time and youre a little young to be her twin sister he stretched out his legs and crossed them at his booted ankles they both knew hed yet to take his eyes off her and he knew he didnt intend to youd pull off the dignified act better if you sat down and pretended to relax id rather stand she moved to the fire and hoped it would warm her gabe merely shrugged and settled back it was nothing to him after all unless she took a few potshots at naomi not that naomi couldnt handle herself hed never known a woman more capable or in his mind more resilient nonetheless he was too fond of her to let anyone even her daughter hurt her neither did it concern him that kelsey had obviously decided to ignore him he took a lazy drag on his cigar and enjoyed the view stiff shoulders and a rigid spine didnt spoil it he mused it was a nice contrast to the long fluid limbs and fancy hair he wondered how easily she spooked and if shed be around long enough for him to test her himself tea will be right in steadier naomi came back into the room her gaze locked on her daughter and her smile was practiced this must be horribly awkward for you kelsey it isnt every day my mother comes back from the grave was it necessary for me to think you were dead it seemed so at the time i was in a position where my own survival was a priority she sat looking tailored and unruffled in her duncolored riding habit i didnt want you visiting me in prison and if i had your father would never have agreed to it so i was to be out of your life for ten to fifteen years her smile shifted a few degrees going brittle how would the parents of your friends have reacted when you told them your mother was doing time for murder i doubt youd have been a popular little girl or a happy one naomi broke off looking toward the hallway as a middleaged woman in a gray uniform and white apron wheeled in a tea tray heres gertie you remember kelsey dont you gertie yes maam the womans eyes teared up you were just a baby last time youd come begging for cookies kelsey said nothing could say nothing to the dampeyed stranger naomi put a hand over gerties and squeezed gently youll have to bake some the next time kelsey visits thank you gertie ill pour yes maam sniffling she started out but turned when she came to the doorway she looks just like you miss naomi just like you yes naomi said softly looking at her daughter she does i dont remember her kelseys voice was defiant as she took two strides toward her mother i dont remember you i didnt think you would would you like sugar lemon is this supposed to be civilized kelsey demanded mother and daughter reunite over high tea do you expect me to just sit here sipping oolong actually i think its earl grey and to tell you the truth kelsey i dont know what i expect anger certainly you deserve to be angry accusations demands resentments with hands that were surprisingly steady naomi passed gabe a cup to be honest i doubt theres anything you could say or do that wouldnt be justified why did you write me taking a moment to organize her thoughts naomi poured another cup a lot of reasons some selfish some not id hoped youd be curious enough to want to meet me you were always a curious child and i know that at this point in your life youre at loose ends how do you know anything about my life naomis gaze lifted as unreadable as the smoke wafting up the flue you thought i was dead kelsey i knew you were very much alive i kept track of you even in prison i was able to do that fury had kelsey stepping forward fighting the urge to hurl the tea tray and all the delicate china it would be satisfying oh so satisfying but it would also make her look like a fool only that kept her from striking out sipping tea gabe watched her struggle for control highstrung he decided impassioned but smart enough to hold her ground she might he thought be more like her mother than either of them knew you spied on me kelsey bit off the words you hired what detectives nothing quite so melodramatic as that my father kept track of you while he could your father kelsey sat down my grandfather yes he died five years ago your grandmother died the year after you were born and i was an only child youre spared a flood of aunts and uncles and cousins whatever questions you have ill answer but id appreciate it if youd give us both a little time before you make up your mind about me there was only one she could think of one that had continued to hammer at the back of her mind so she asked it quickly before she could draw away from it did you kill that man did you kill alec bradley naomi paused then lifted her cup to her lips over the rim her eyes stayed steady on kelseys she set the cup down again without a rattle yes she said simply i killed him im sorry gabe naomi stood at the window watching her daughter drive away it was really unforgivable of me to put you in that position i met your daughter thats all on a weak laugh naomi squeezed her eyes shut always the master of understatement gabe she turned then standing in the strong light it didnt bother her that the sun would highlight the fine lines around her eyes show her age shed spent too long away from it too long away i was afraid when i saw her so much came flooding back some expected some not expected i couldnt deal with it alone he rose and went to her laying his hands on her shoulders to soothe the strong tensed muscles if a man isnt happy to help a beautiful woman he might as well be dead youre a good friend she lifted a hand to his squeezed one of the very few i can drop all pretenses with her lips curved again maybe its because weve both done time a quick smile lifted the corners of his mouth nothing like prison life to pack down common ground nothing like prison life of course a youthful runin over a poker game doesnt quite come up to murder two but there you go oneupping me again she laughed we chadwicks are so competitive she moved away from him shifting a vase of early daffodils an inch to the right on a table what did you think of her gabe shes beautiful the image of you i thought i was prepared for that my father had told me and the photographs but to look at her and see myself it still staggered me i remember the child remember the child so well now seeing her grown up impatient with herself she shook her head the years passed she knew that better than anyone but beyond that she glanced over her shoulder what did you think of her he wasnt sure he could or would explain precisely what hed thought he too had been staggered and he was a man rarely surprised beautiful women had walked in and out of his life or he in and out of theirs he appreciated them admired them desired them but his first glimpse of kelsey byden had all but stopped his heart he would dissect that interesting little fact later but for now naomi was waiting and he knew his answer mattered she was running on nerves and temper she doesnt quite have your control i hope she never needs it naomi murmured she was angry but smart enough and curious enough to hold on to her temper until she gauges the lay of the land if she were a horse id have to say i need to see her paces before i could judge if she has heart endurance or grace but blood tells naomi your daughter has style she loved me her voice shook but she didnt notice nor did she notice the first tear that spilled over and trailed down her cheek its difficult to explain to someone whos had no children what its like to be the recipient of that kind of total uncompromising love kelsey felt that for me and for her father it was philip and i who lacked we didnt love enough to keep that unit whole and so i lost her naomi brushed at the tear caught it on her fingertip she studied it as if it were some exotic specimen just discovered she hadnt cried since she buried her father hadnt seen the point ill never be loved that way again she flicked the tear away and forgot it i dont think i understood that until today youre rushing your fences naomi thats not like you you had all of fifteen minutes with her today did you see her face when i told her i killed alec there was a smile on her lips as she turned back to gabe but it was hard brittle as glass ive seen it in dozens of others civilized horror decent people dont kill people decent or otherwise do what they need to do to survive he had reason to know she wont think so she might have my looks gabe but shed have her fathers mores christ they dont come any more decent than dr philip byden or more foolish since he let you go she laughed again easier this time and kissed him firmly on the mouth where were you twentyfive years ago she shook her head nearly sighed playing with your crayolas i dont recall ever playing with them betting with them maybe speaking of bets ive got a hundred that says my colt will outrun yours at the derby in may her brow rose and the odds even youre on why dont you come down and take a look at my prize yearling before you leave in a couple of years shell leave anything you put against her in the dust what did you name her her eyes glinted as she opened the terrace doors naomis honor shed been so cool kelsey thought as she unlocked her apartment door so cold naomi had admitted to murder as casually as another woman might admit to dyeing her hair what kind of a woman was she how could she have served tea and made conversation so polite so controlled so horribly detached leaning against the door kelsey rubbed at the headache storming behind her temples it was all like some insane dream the big beautiful house the placid setting the woman with her face the dynamic man naomis newest lover did they sleep in the same room where a man had died hed looked capable of it she thought hed looked capable of anything with a shudder kelsey pushed away from the door and began to pace why had naomi written the letter she wondered thered been no emotional storm no fatted calf no desperate apologies for the lost years only a polite invitation to tea and the calm unhesitating admission of guilt so naomi chadwick wasnt a hypocrite kelsey thought wryly just a criminal when the phone rang she glanced over and saw that her message machine was blinking kelsey turned away and ignored both she had two hours before her shift at the museum and no need no desire to speak with anyone before then all she had to do now was convince herself that her mothers reappearance didnt have to change her life she could go on just as she had before her job her classes her friends she dropped down on the sofa who was she trying to fool her job was no more than a hobby her classes a habit and her friends most of them had been shared with wade and therefore in the odd byproduct of divorce they had divvied up sides or simply faded into the background so as not to be touched by the trauma her life was a mess she ignored the knock at the door kelsey another quick impatient rap open the door or ill have the apartment manager open it for me resigned kelsey rose and obeyed grandmother after lifting her cheek for the expected kiss milicent byden strode into the apartment she was as always flawlessly dressed and coiffed her hair was tinted a glossy auburn and swept back from a polished face that could at a glance pass for sixty rather than eighty she kept her figure trim with unsentimental diet and exercise her sizesix chanel suit was a pale blue she tugged off matching kid gloves and set them down on an occasional table then laid her mink over a chair you disappoint me sulking in your room like a child her almondcolored eyes scraped over her granddaughter as she sat crossing her legs your fathers desperately worried about you both he and i have called you at least half a dozen times today ive been out and dad has no reason to be worried no milicent tapped a lacquered fingernail against the arm of the chair you burst in on him last night with the news that that woman has contacted you then you dash off and refuse to answer your phone that woman is my mother and you and he knew she was alive it caused an emotional scene grandmother which im aware you might consider to be in poor taste but that i felt was very justified dont take that tone with me milicent leaned forward your father has done everything to protect you to give you a decent upbringing and a stable home and you attack him for it attack him kelsey threw up her hands knowing such an outward display would count against her i confronted him i demanded answers i demanded the truth and now that you have it are you satisfied milicent inclined her head you would have been better off all of us would have been better off if she had stayed dead to you but she was always selfish always more concerned with herself than anyone else for reasons kelsey could never have explained she picked up the spear of battle and did you always hate her i always recognized her for what she was philip was blinded by her looks by what he saw as vivacity and verve and he paid for his mistake and i look like her kelsey said softly which explains why youve always looked at me as though i might commit some horrible crime at any moment or at least an unforgivable breach of etiquette milicent sighed and sat back she wouldnt deny it saw no reason why she should i was concerned naturally about how much of her was in you youre a byden kelsey and for the most part youve been a credit to the family every mistake ive watched you make has her stamp on it i prefer to think ive made my own mistakes such as this divorce milicent said wearily wade comes from a good family his maternal grandfather is a senator his father owns one of the most prestigious and wellrespected advertising agencies in the east and wade is an adulterer on a little sound of impatience milicent waved a hand the diamond wedding ring on her widows hand glinted like ice you would blame him rather than yourself or the woman who seduced him almost amused kelsey smiled thats right i would blame him the divorce is final grandmother as of yesterday youre wasting your time there and you have the dubious honor of being the second byden in family history to divorce in your fathers case it was unavoidable you however have done what youve made a habit of doing all your life reacting impulsively but thats another issue i want to know what you intend to do about the letter dont you think thats between me and my mother this is a family matter kelsey your father and i are your family she tapped her finger again carefully selecting both words and tone philip is my only child his happiness and wellbeing have always been primary in my life you are his only child with genuine affection she reached up and took kelseys hand i want only the best for you there was no arguing with that however much her grandmothers code of behavior grated kelsey knew she was loved i know i dont want to fight with you grandmother nor i with you pleased she patted kelseys hand youve been a good daughter kelsey no one who knows you and philip would doubt your devotion i know youd do nothing to hurt him i think it would be best if you gave me the letter let me handle this business for you youve no need to contact her or put yourself through this turmoil ive already contacted her i went to see her this morning you milicents hand jerked then settled you saw her you went to her without discussing it first im twentysix years old grandmother naomi chadwick is my mother and i dont have to discuss meeting her with anyone im sorry if it upsets you but i did what i had to do what you wanted to do milicent corrected without thought for the consequences as you like but theyre my consequences id think you and dad would have to agree its a normal reaction on my part it may be difficult for you but i cant imagine why it would make you so angry im not angry though she was furious im concerned i dont want some foolish emotional reaction to influence you you dont know her kelsey you have no idea how clever or how vindictive she is i know she wanted custody of me she wanted to hurt your father because hed begun to see through her you were the tool she drank and she had men and she flaunted her flaws because she was so sure she would always win and she ended by killing a man milicent drew a deep breath even the thought of naomi burned at her heart i suppose she tried to convince you it was selfdefense that she was protecting her honor her honor unable to sit any longer milicent rose oh she was clever and she was beautiful if the evidence against her hadnt been so damning she might have convinced a jury to absolve her but when a woman entertains a man in her bedroom in the middle of the night in nothing more than a silk robe its difficult to cry rape rape kelsey repeated but the word was only a shocked whisper and milicent didnt hear some believed her of course some will always believe that kind of woman eyes hard she snatched her gloves from the table and began to tap them against her palm but in the end they convicted her she was out of philips life and yours until now will you be so stubborn so selfish as to let her back in to cause your father this kind of grief this isnt a choice between him or her grandmother thats exactly what it is for you not for me do you know before you came here i wasnt sure i would see her again now i know i will because she didnt defend herself to me she didnt ask me to choose im going to see her again and decide for myself no matter whom it hurts as far as i can see im the only one whos risking anything youre wrong kelsey and its a dangerous mistake she corrupts stiffly milicent smoothed on her gloves finger by finger if you insist on pursuing this relationship shell do whatever she can to destroy the bond between you and your father no one could do that milicent lifted her gaze and it was sharp as steel you dont know naomi chadwick chapter three no kelsey didnt know naomi chadwick but she would kelseys years of higher education hadnt been wasted if there was one thing she knew how to do well it was how to research a subject any subject naomi was no exception for the next two weeks she spent most of her free time poring over microfilm at the public library her first stop was the society page where she read the announcement of the engagement of naomi anne chadwick twentyone daughter of matthew and louise chadwick of three willows farm bluemont virginia to professor philip james byden thirtyfour son of andrew and milicent byden georgetown a june wedding was planned kelsey found the wedding announcement it was a shock to see her father looking so young so carelessly happy his fingers entwined at his heart with naomis hed worn a rosebud boutonniere kelsey wondered if it had been white or perhaps a sunny yellow beside him naomi glowed the grainy newsprint couldnt diminish the luster her face was impossibly young heartbreakingly beautiful her lips curved her eyes bright as if on the verge of a laugh they looked as though they could face anything together it shouldnt hurt kelsey told herself it was foolish to be hurt by a divorce that had happened without her knowledge but these two young vital people had created her now they were no more to each other than painful memories she made hard copies of what she wanted made notes on the rest as she would for any report with feelings of amusement and bafflement she found her own birth announcement there was little after that an occasional squib about attendance at a ball or charity function it seemed her parents had lived a quiet life out of the washington glitter for the short term of their marriage then there was the custody suit a terse little article that had merited space in the washington post she imagined due to her paternal grandfathers position as undersecretary of the treasury she read the names her own naomis her fathers with a sense of detachment the post hadnt wasted much of its dignity on a domestic squabble she found a few articles on three willows and racing one mentioned the tragedy of a promising colt who had broken down at a race and was shot it merited a single picture of naomis beautiful tearstreaked face then there was murder such matters rated more space a few prominent headlines lovers quarrel ends in tragedy pastoral virginia scene of violent death her mother was described as the estranged wife of a georgetown english professor and the daughter of a prominent thoroughbred breeder the victim was somewhat flippantly referred to as a playboy with ties to the racing world the story was straightforward enough alec bradley had been shot and killed in a bedroom at three willows farm the weapon belonged to naomi chadwick byden who had notified the police she and bradley had been alone in the house at the time of the shooting police were investigating the virginia papers were a bit more informative naomi never denied firing the fatal shot she claimed through her attorney that bradley had attacked her and she had resorted to the weapon in selfdefense the facts were reported that naomi and bradley had a friendly relationship and had been seeing each other socially for weeks and of course that naomi was in the midst of a messy custody suit over her threeyearold daughter a week after the murder there were more headlines virginia woman arrested for murder new evidence derails claim of selfdefense and damning evidence it was kelseys blood chilled as she read of the photograph taken by a detective hired by her fathers lawyers to obtain ammunition for the custody battle rather than an illicit affair the detective had recorded murder hed testified at the trial as well stubbornly moving from page to page she read on about witnesses who agreed under oath that naomi and bradley behaved in public as intimate friends that naomi was an expert marksman that she enjoyed parties champagne the attention of men that she and bradley had quarreled the evening of his death over his flirtation with another woman then charles rooney had taken the stand and told his story hed taken dozens of photographs of naomi at the track at the farm at various social events he was a licensed private investigator in the state of virginia and his surveillance reports were carefully documented they formed a picture of a reckless beautiful woman who craved excitement who was eager to break the bonds of an inhibiting marriage to an older man and one who on the night of the murder invited the victim into her home where she was alone and dressed only in a negligee rooney was unable to swear to what was said between the two but his photographs and his observations said a great deal the couple had embraced brandy was poured then they appeared to argue and naomi had stormed upstairs bradley had followed eager to fulfill his duties rooney had climbed a handy tree and aimed his telephoto lens at the bedroom window the argument had continued there becoming more heated naomi had slapped bradleys face but when hed turned to go shed pulled a gun out of the nightstand drawer the camera had captured the shock on his face and the fury on naomis as she fired kelsey stared at the photo for a long time and at the headline above it that shouted guilty carefully she made more copies then shut off the machine and gathered her files and notes before logic could interfere with emotion she found a pay phone and dialed three willows naomi chadwick please may i ask whos calling this is kelsey byden there was a small strangled sound quickly muffled miss naomis down at the stables ill buzz her moments later an extension was picked up kelsey heard naomis voice cool as sherbet over the line hello kelsey its good to hear from you id like to talk to you again of course whenever you like now itll take me an hour to get there and id prefer that we be alone this time fine ill be here naomi hung up and wiped her damp hands on her jeans my daughters coming moses so i gathered moses whitetree naomis trainer trusted employee and longtime lover continued to study his breeding reports he was half jew half choctaw and had never taken the mix for granted he wore his hair in a long graying braid down his back there was the glint of a silver star of david around his neck whatever there was to know about horses he knew and he preferred them with few exceptions to people shell have questions yes how do i answer them he didnt glance up didnt need to he knew every nuance of naomis face you could try the truth a lot of good the truths done me shes your blood it was always so simple for moses naomi thought impatiently shes a grown woman i hope shes her own woman she wont accept me simply because we share blood moses id be disappointed if she did he set his paperwork aside and rose he wasnt a big man only a few pounds and a few inches over his onetime dream of being a jockey in his worndown boots he was eye level with naomi you want her to love you to accept you but you want her to do it on your terms youve always wanted too much naomi with tenderness she touched a hand to his windbitten cheek it was impossible to stay irritated with him he was the man who had waited for her who never questioned her who had always loved her so youve always told me i didnt know i would need her so much until i saw her again moses i didnt know it would matter as much as it does and you wish it didnt oh i wish it didnt that he understood hed spent most of his life wishing he didnt love naomi my people have a saying which people he smiled they both knew he made up half of his sayings and twisted the other half to suit his purposes only the foolish waste their wishes let her see what you are itll be enough moses a groom looked into the office then tipped his hat toward naomi miss i dont like the way serenitys favoring her near foreleg got some swelling too she ran well this morning mosess brow puckered hed been up before dawn to watch the early workouts lets take a look moses kept his office in a small area at the front of the stables it was cramped and often smelled of horse urine but he preferred it to the airy space his predecessor had used in a whitewashed building near the west paddock moses often said the earthy smell of horses was french perfume to him and he didnt want any fancy digs away from the action in truth the stables were nearly as sparkling as any luxury hotel and usually busier the concrete slope between the lines of stalls was scrubbed and spotless the individual stalls were marked with an enameled plaque with the name of each horse scrolled in gold it was an affectation of naomis fathers that shed continued when shed taken over running the farm there were scents of horses of liniment of hay and grain and leather a potpourri naomi had missed sorely during her years in prison and one she never failed to appreciate it was to her the scent of freedom as moses passed horses stuck their heads out of stalls he too had a scent one they recognized his boots might have clattered quickly along the slope but there was always time for a quick stroke a murmured word stable hands continued their work perhaps pitchforks or currycombs moved with more enthusiasm now that the man was in view i was going to take her out to pasture when i saw how she favored the leg the groom paused beside serenitys box stall noticed the swelling and thought youd want to take a look for yourself moses merely grunted passing his hands over the glossy chestnut coat he studied the fillys eyes smelled her breath murmuring to her as he worked his way down from cheek to chest to leg there was swelling just above the fetlock and some heat as he applied some slight pressure the filly jerked back and blew a warning looks like shes knocked into something reno was riding her this morning naomi remembered that the jockey had made a special trip to the farm for the workout see if hes still here yesm the groom scurried off she had a beautiful run this morning eyes narrowed naomi crouched beside moses and examined the lame leg herself gently lifting it forward and back to check for shoulder strain looks like an overreach she muttered there was discoloration a sign of blood clotting under the skin the bone was probably bruised she thought if they were lucky thered be no fracture she was due in saratoga next week she might still make it but he didnt think so not on that leg we can get the swelling down better call the vet though an x ray wouldnt hurt ill take care of it and ill talk to reno she straightened hooking an arm around the mares neck they were an investment a business but that didnt negate her love for them shes got the heart of a champion moses i dont want to hear that she cant race again less than an hour later naomi watched grimly as the fillys injury was treated already a stream of cold water had been applied directly to the wound now moses himself was massaging the bruise with a mixture of vinegar and cool water her vet stood in the stall and prepared a syringe how long before she can start training again matt a month six weeks would be better he glanced toward naomi matt gunner had a long pleasant face kind eyes the bones bruised naomi and theres some tissue damage but theres no fracture you keep her stabled keep up the massage some light exercise and shell do we were going at a fast pace reno put in the jockey stood just outside the box watching the procedure hed changed from his morning workout into one of the smart tailored suits he preferred but he was a racetracker there was nothing of more concern to him or the others than a thoroughbreds delicate legs i didnt notice any change of gait neither did i naomi added reno says she didnt stumble i was watching the run this morning and i would have noticed if she had this filly has a quiet temperament shes not one to kick in her stall well she took a hard knock matt said if your groom hadnt been alert it would have been a great deal worse thisll ease the pain there you go girl easy now he slid the needle under serenitys flesh just above the wound she rolled her eyes snorted but didnt struggle shes strong and shes healthy matt said shell run again moses theres nothing i can tell you about treating that leg that you dont already know you give me a call if it heats up otherwise he trailed off staring over naomis shoulder excuse me kelsey stood back clutching her purse and her file im sorry to interrupt i was told up at the house id find you here oh distracted naomi dragged a hand through her hair i lost track of time weve had a small crisis here matt this is my daughter kelsey kelsey byden matt gunner my vet matt reached out the syringe still in his hand he drew it back flushed sorry hello nerves aside she had to smile nice to meet you and moses whitetree naomi continued my trainer moses continued to massage the mares leg and merely nodded reno sanchez one of the best jockeys on the circuit the best he said with a wink nice to meet you and you kelsey said automatically youre busy here i can wait no theres nothing more i can do thanks for coming so quickly matt sorry i interrupted your day reno hey no problem ive got plenty of time before the first post he looked at kelsey again with undisguised admiration youll have to come to the track see me ride im sure id enjoy it moses ill be back to check on her myself again later why dont we go up to the house naomi gestured careful very careful not to make contact then led the way out the rear of the building you have a sick horse injured im afraid well have to scratch her from her races for the next several weeks thats a shame kelsey glanced toward a paddock where a yearling was being put through his paces on a longe line another with a rider up was being led by a handler toward the walking ring a groom was giving a glossy chestnut a bath spraying streams of water over the gelding with a hose other horses were simply being walked in wide repetitive circles busy place kelsey murmured aware that eyes had turned her way oh most of the work gets done in the morning but itll be busy again when the track closes this afternoon youre racing today theres always a race naomi said absently but right now weve still got mares dropping foals so what doesnt get done in the morning happens in the middle of the night she smiled a little they always seem to have them in the middle of the night i guess i didnt realize you had such a large operation in the last ten years weve become one of the top thoroughbred farms in the country weve had a horse do no less than show in the last three derbies won the st leger and belmont took the breeders cup two years running one of our mares took a gold in the last olympics naomi cut herself off with a laugh dont get me started im worse than a grandmother with a wallet full of snapshots its all right im interested more kelsey mused than shed realized actually i took riding lessons when i was a girl i guess most of us go through a horsecrazy stage dad hated it but she trailed off suddenly understanding why hed been so unhappy when shed developed the traditional girlhood obsession with horses of course he did naomi said with a thin smile its perfectly understandable but you had your lessons anyway yes i hounded him for them she stopped and looked straight into her mothers eyes she could see the small subtle signs of aging that shed been too nervous to notice at their first meeting fine lines fanning out from the eyes others either from temper or worry gently scoring the high creamy forehead it must have hurt him to see me simply to see me day after day i dont think so however philip came to feel about me he adored you she looked away then because it was easier to stare at the hills a horse whinnied high and bright a sound sweeter to naomi than any aria i havent asked you about him how is he hes well hes the chairman of the english department at georgetown now has been for seven years hes a brilliant man and a good one but not good enough for you naomi lifted a brow darling kelsey i was never good enough for him ask anyone naomi tossed her hair back and continued to walk im told he married again yes when i was eighteen theyre very happy together i have a stepbrother channing and youre fond of them your family very naomi crossed the same patio used the same terrace doors as she had the first time what can i get you coffee tea some wine perhaps it isnt necessary i hope youll indulge gertie she made cookies when she heard you were coming i know you dont remember but you meant a great deal to her trapped kelsey thought by manners and compassion tea and cookies then thanks ill tell her please sit down she didnt sit it seemed only fair that she take a closer look at her mothers things at first glance the room was quietly elegant a world apart from the bustle and manurecoated boots of the stable area the low fire burned sedately rosecolored drapes were pulled back to welcome the sun that sun shone on a dozen or so lovely crystal horses in clear and jewel hues the oriental rug on the polished chestnut floor picked up the colors of the drapes and the creamy tones of the sofa nothing ostentatious nothing jarring until you looked again the walls were covered in watered silk the same cool ivory as the upholstery but the paintings large and abstract were explosions of bold and restless color violent works kelsey thought sated with passion and anger and signed she saw with a jolt with a bloodred n c naomis work she wondered no one had mentioned that her mother painted no amateurish works these kelsey decided but skilled and capable and disturbing they should have unbalanced the steady dignity of the room she thought as she turned away yet they humanized it there were other telling touches throughout the room a statue of a woman her alabaster face carved in unfathomable grief a glass heart in pale green with a jagged crack down the center a small bowl filled with colored stones those were yours guiltily kelsey dropped a pebble back into the bowl and turned gertie had wheeled in the tea tray and stood beaming at her im sorry you always liked pretty rocks i kept them for you when you her smile wobbled when you went away oh how was she supposed to answer that youve worked here a long time then ive been at three willows since i was a girl my mother kept house for mr chadwick then i took over when she retired moved to florida chocolate chip was always your favorite the woman looked as though she could devour kelsey whole the desperate yearning in her eyes was difficult to face the desperate joy beneath that worse they still are kelsey managed you come sit and help yourself miss naomi got a phone call but shell be right along all but humming with happiness gertie poured tea arranged cookies on a plate i always knew youd come back always knew it miss naomi didnt think so she fretted about it all the time but i says to her shes your girl isnt she shell come back to see her mama all right and here you are yes kelsey made herself sit and accept the tea here i am and all grown up unable to help herself gertie stroked a hand over kelseys hair a grownup woman now her lined face crumpled as she let her hand fall turning quickly she hurried from the room im sorry naomi said when she came in moments later this is an emotional time for gertie it must make you uncomfortable its all right kelsey sipped her tea oolong this time she noted with a tiny smile understanding naomi laughed just my subtle sense of humor she poured herself a cup then sat i wasnt sure youd come back neither was i im not sure i would have at least so soon if grandmother hadnt all but forbade me to ah milicent trying to relax naomi stretched out her long legs she always detested me well she said and shrugged it was mutual tell me have you been able to satisfy her high standards not quite kelseys smile came and went it felt disloyal to discuss her grandmother family honor naomi said nodding youre absolutely right i shouldnt goad you into criticizing milicent besides im not the one who should be asking the questions how can this be so easy for you kelsey set down her cup with a snap of china against china how can you sit there so calmly i learned a great deal about taking what comes when i was in prison you have the reins here kelsey ive had a lot of time to think this through and i had to promise myself before i contacted you that i would accept whatever happened why did you wait so long youve been out of prison for twelve years eight months ten days excons are more obsessive than exsmokers and im both she smiled again but that doesnt answer your question i considered contacting you the day i got out i even went to your school every day for a week i sat in my car across the street and watched you in the little playground watched you and the other girls watching the boys and pretending not to once i even got out of my car and started across the street and i wondered if youd smell prison on me i could still smell it on myself naomi moved her shoulders chose a cookie so i got back in my car and drove away you were happy you were secure you didnt know i existed then my father became ill the years passed kelsey every time i thought about picking up the phone or writing a letter or just walking back into your life it seemed wrong why now because it seemed right youre not so happy not so secure and i thought it was time you knew i existed your marriage is over youre at a crossroads perhaps you dont think i can understand how you feel but i do you know about wade yes and your job your academic career youre fortunate you inherited your fathers brain i was always a lousy student if you dont want the cookies stick a few in your purse will you gertie will never know the difference with a sigh kelsey picked one up and took a bite i dont know how to feel about all of this i dont know how to feel about you reality is rarely like those big emotional reunions on oprah naomi commented longlost mother reunited with daughter all is forgiven im not asking for all to be forgiven kelsey im hoping youll give me a chance kelsey reached for the file shed set beside her on the sofa ive done some research the hell naomi decided and reached for another cookie i thought you might newspaper articles on the trial among other things i can arrange for you to have a transcript kelseys fingers faltered on the file a transcript id want one if i were in your place its public record kelsey if i had something to hide i couldnt when i came here before i asked if you were guilty and you said yes you asked if id killed alec and i said yes why didnt you tell me youd claimed selfdefense what difference does it make i was convicted i paid my debt to society and i am according to the system rehabilitated was it a lie then was it a legal maneuver when you said youd shot him to protect yourself from rape the jury thought so im asking you kelsey shot back firing up a simple yes or no taking a life isnt simple whatever the circumstances and what were they you let him into your house into your bedroom i let him into my house naomi said evenly he came into my bedroom he was your lover no he was not hands icily calm naomi poured more tea he might have been eventually but i hadnt slept with him her gaze met her daughters the jury didnt believe that either i was attracted to him i thought he was a charming fool harmless and amusing you fought with him over another woman im territorial naomi said blithely he was supposed to be madly in love with me which meant i was allowed to flirt and he wasnt and because he was beginning to bore and annoy me i decided to break off the relationship alec didnt want it to be broken so we had a scene in public then another one later in private he was furious called me a few names tried to make his case with some rough handling i didnt care for it and ordered him to leave though she fought to keep it calm her voice shook as the night flooded back instead he followed me upstairs and called me several more names and got quite a bit rougher apparently he decided he would show me what id been missing by forcing me into bed i was angry and i was afraid we struggled and i realized he would do exactly what hed threatened to do i broke away got my gun and i shot him without a word kelsey flipped open the file and took out the copy of the newspaper photo when naomi took it only a quick spasm at the side of her mouth betrayed any emotion not terribly flattering to either of us is it but then we didnt know we had an audience he isnt touching you he has his hands up yes i guess you had to be there she handed the photo back im not asking you to believe me kelsey why should you whatever the circumstances im not blameless but ive paid society has given me another chance thats all im asking you to do why did you let me think you were dead why did you allow that because i felt i was part of me was and whatever my crimes i loved you i didnt want you to grow up knowing i was in a cage i couldnt have survived those ten years thinking of that and i needed to survive there were other questions dozens of them swirling around in kelseys head like bees but she didnt think she could bear to hear the answers i dont know you she said at last i dont know if ill ever feel anything for you your father would have instilled a sense of duty in you certainly milicent would have im going to use it and ask you to come here to stay here for a few weeks a month kelsey was completely taken aback for a few moments you want me to live here she finally managed to say an extended visit a few weeks of your life kelsey for the lifetime i lost she didnt want to beg god she didnt want to beg but she would if there was no other choice its selfish of me and not terribly fair but i want the chance its too much to ask yes it is but im asking anyway im your mother you cant avoid that you can choose to avoid me if thats what you want but ill still be your mother well have time to see if theres anything between us if not youll walk away im betting you wont walk away naomi leaned forward what are you made of kelsey is there enough chadwick in there for you to accept a dare kelsey angled her chin it was a risk perhaps shed needed it to be put that way rather than as a request i wont promise a month but ill come she was surprised to see naomis lips tremble once before they curved into that cool steady smile good if i cant enchant you three willows should well have to see how much you picked up in those riding lessons i dont get thrown easily neither do i chapter four dinner with the family was a civilized affair excellent food was served with dignity like any last meal kelsey thought as she spooned up her leek soup she didnt want to think of the evening in her fathers house as an obligation or worse as a trial but she knew it was both philip made casual conversation but his smile was strained since kelsey had told him of her upcoming visit to three willows hed been able to think of little else but the past it seemed disloyal somehow to candace that his mind should be so full of his first wife his nights restless and disturbed by memories of her no matter how often he told himself it was illogical foolish even indulgent he couldnt quite chase away the fear that he was losing the child hed fought so hard to keep a woman now he had only to look at her to be reminded of that yet he had only to close his eyes to remember the girl and the guilt milicent waited until the roast chicken was served normally she disliked discussing unpleasant matters over a meal but as she saw it shed been given no choice you leave tomorrow im told yes kelsey took a sip from her water glass watched the thin lemon slice dip and float first thing in the morning and your job ive resigned kelsey lifted a brow in challenge and acknowledgment it was little more than volunteer work i may look for something at the smithsonian when i get back it may be difficult to get anything with your record of coming and going it may the historical societys always looking for an extra pair of hands candace put in im sure i could put in a word for you thank you candace always the peacemaker kelsey thought ill think about it maybe youll catch racing fever channing winked at kelsey buy yourself some stud and make the circuit that would hardly be acceptable or wise milicent dabbed a napkin at her lips such things may seem romantic and exciting at your age channing but kelseys old enough to know better it sounds like a great deal to me hanging out at the stables placing a few bets at the track he shrugged making quick work of his dinner i wouldnt mind spending a few weeks playing in the country you could visit me itd be fun is that all you can think of incensed milicent set her fork down with a clatter fun have you no idea what this is doing to your father mother but milicent overrode philips objection with an impatient wave of her hand after all the pain and unhappiness we went through to have that woman simply snap her fingers to make kelsey come running its appalling she didnt snap her fingers under the table kelsey balled her hands into fists it would be much too easy to create a scene she told herself she asked i agreed im sorry if this hurts you dad my concerns for you kelsey i wonder candace spoke up hoping to ward milicent off and salvage some of the evening is it really necessary for you to stay there its only an hour or so away after all you could move more slowly go out on a weekend now and then she glanced toward philip to gauge his reaction then smiled bolsteringly at kelsey it seems more sensible if she was sensible she would never have gone out there kelsey bit back a sigh at her grandmothers comment and sat back its not as if ive signed a contract i can leave at any time i want to go this she addressed to her father i want to find out who she is sounds natural to me channing said over a bite of chicken if id found out i had a longlost mother whod done time thats what id do did you ask her what it was like inside im a sucker for those womeninprison movies channing candaces voice was a horrified whisper must you be so crude just curious he speared a perfectly boiled new potato bet the food sucked delighted with him kelsey let out a laugh ill be sure to ask her god are channing and i the only ones around here who dont see this as some drawingroom melodrama you should be relieved im not running traumatized to some therapist or washing my shock away with cheap wine im the one who has to make the adjustments here and im doing the best i can youre thinking only of yourself milicent said between stiffened lips yes i am im thinking of myself enough was enough kelsey decided and she pushed back from the table it might interest you to know that she had nothing but good things to say about you she told her father theres no insidious plot to turn me against you and nothing could she walked to him bending down to kiss his cheek thanks for dinner candace i really have to get home and finish packing channing if you have a free weekend give me a call good night grandmother she hurried out the moment she shut the door behind her she took a deep gulp of air it tasted like freedom she thought she intended to enjoy it in the morning gertie met kelsey at the door youre here the woman snatched kelseys suitcases before kelsey could object miss naomis down to the stables we didnt know what time youd come so she told me to call her when you got here no dont bother her im sure shes busy let me take those theyre heavy im strong as an ox gertie backed up still beaming ill show you up to your room you just bring yourself thats all she might have been small and thin but gertie strode effortlessly up the stairs chattering we got everything ready its good to be busy again miss naomi she doesnt take any care at all hardly needs me around im sure thats not true oh for company she does but she eats like a bird and does for herself mostly before i can do for her gertie led the way down a wide hall carpeted in faded cabbage roses sometimes she has people over but not like there once was used to be there was always people and parties she stepped across a threshold and set both cases on an elegant fourposter bed the room streamed with light from a double window seat that faced the hills the long slim windows overlooking the gardens deep colors and floral accents gave the room an elegant european feel its lovely kelsey stepped to a cherry vanity table where tulips speared up out of fluted crystal like sleeping in a garden it was your room before course it was done up different then all pink and white like a candy cane gertie gnawed at her lip when she saw the surprise in kelseys eyes miss naomi said if you didnt like it you could take the room across the hall this is fine she waited for a moment wondering if shed be bombarded with some sensory memory but all she felt was curiosity your bathrooms through here anxious to please gertie opened a door you just ask if you need any more towels or anything anything at all ill go call miss naomi no dont on impulse kelsey turned away from the suitcases ill go on down i can unpack later ill do that for you dont you worry about that you go on down and have a nice visit then you can have lunch you want to button that jacket the airs chilly kelsey fought back a smile all right ill be back for lunch make your mama come she needs to eat ill tell her kelsey left gertie happily opening the suitcases it was tempting to do a quick turn around the house to poke into rooms and explore hallways but it could wait the day might have held the chill of the dying winter but it was gloriously sunny and kelsey hoped as she went out promising she wasnt going to start the visit by chasing at shadows it would have to be done of course still it seemed harmless to enjoy one uncomplicated day in the country with the smells of hardy spring blooms and new grass in the air the panorama of hills and horses and sky she could look on it at least for now as a short vacation until shed literally packed her bags she hadnt realized just how much shed needed to get away from the confinement of her apartment the fillin job the tedious routine of learning to be single again and here she thought as she caught the first poignant smell of horse was something else to be learned after all she knew nothing about the racing world nothing of the people and little of the animals that composed it so she would study and find out it seemed to follow that the more she discovered the better she would understand her mother as before there was activity at the stables horses being walked or washed men and women carrying tack hauling wheelbarrows kelsey tolerated the sidelong glances and outright stares and walked inside a groom was bandaging a mares legs in the first box kelsey hesitated when he cut his eyes up to hers his eyes were shadowed under the bill of his cap and his face was incredibly old cracked like neglected leather left in the sun excuse me im looking for ms chadwick grew up did ya the man shifted a tobacco plug into the pocket of his cheek heard you was coming there now sweet thing hold your water it took kelsey a moment to realize the last comment was addressed to the mare and not to her is something wrong with her kelsey asked the horse just a little sprain old she is but still likes to run you remember the days dont you girl won her first race and her last and a goodly number between twentyfive she is was a spry young filly when you last saw her his grin mostly toothless flashed dont remember i expect her nor me im boggs put you up on your first pony forget how to ride have you no i can ride kelsey reached out a hand to stroke the old mares cheek whats her name queen vanity fair i just call her queenie the mare whickered her soft brown eyes looking deeply into kelseys shes too old to race now kelsey murmured or to breed queenies in retirement but she gets to thinking shes still a girl and kicks up her heels if i was to bring a saddle in here her ears would perk right up she can still be ridden then with the right rider your mas in the breeding shed out the back to your left big doings today oh thank you boggs welcome home he turned back running his gnarled callused hands as gently as silk over the mares legs best to wear boots around here next time yes nonplussed kelsey looked down at her soft italian flats youre right she walked through the stables pausing with a quick look over her shoulder before stopping by serenitys box she was rewarded by a welcoming snort and nuzzle outside she didnt require boggss directions there was enough activity around the outbuilding to the left to have drawn her in any case she recognized gabe and was torn for a moment as to who looked more magnificent he or the rearing chestnut stallion he was fighting to control he stood at the horses head boots planted muscles straining the reins shortened while the stallion quivered and called his own hair flying in the breeze gabe tossed back his head and laughed anxious are you dont blame you a bit nothing like having a beautiful female ready for sex to get the blood moving hello kelsey he continued to control the stallion without looking around hed known she was there he almost believed hed smelled her as the stallion scented the mare youre just in time for the main event arent skittish are you no im not good naomis inside with the mare longshot and three willows are about to breed a champion kelsey skimmed her gaze over the horse handlers were positioned around him helping gabe to keep the stud from charging the shed magnificent he was his coat already gleaming like flame from sweat his eyes fierce his muscles bunched youre going to turn him loose on some poor unsuspecting mare gabe grinned believe me shell be grateful shell be terrified kelsey disagreed and strode into the shed she saw her mother and moses calming the mare who looked to be every bit as eager to get on with things as the stallion she too was a chestnut as regal as her intended mate even though she was hobbled protected at the neck by a thick jacket of leather and canvas she looked proud and valiant kelsey covered with grime and sweat naomi wiped a hand over her brow gertie was supposed to let me know when you got here i told her not to bother im in the way no naomi looked doubtfully at moses but things are about to get a little frantic and graphic i know a little about sex kelsey said dryly stay here moses added and youll learn more shes ready he said to one of the handlers keep back out of the way naomi warned her daughter this isnt as simple as an hour in the local motel she could smell the sex even as gabe and his handlers brought the stallion in the air in the shed thickened with it sharp edgy elemental the mare called out in protest or welcome and the stallion answered with a sound that caused something to tighten in kelseys stomach orders were given movements were quick in a powerful lunge the stallion reared up and mounted the mare wideeyed kelsey stared as moses stepped in and assisted in the most technical aspect of the coupling then her breath caught as she saw why the mare wore the leather neck cover surely the stallion would have bitten through her flesh without it he plunged wildly his need frantic and somehow human he covered her commanding demanding she accepted her eyes rolling in what kelsey thought must surely be pleasure hardly realizing it she moved closer fascinated by the passionate frenzy of mating her own heart was pounding her blood hot the quick sharp pang of arousal staggered her she found herself looking at gabe sweat was running down his face his muscles strained against his shirt and his eyes were on hers it was shocking to see her own primitive and unexpected reaction mirrored there staggering to have the vision flash through her mind of being taken as the mare was being taken fiercely violently heedlessly he smiled a slow movement of lips that was both arrogant and charming smiled she thought as if he knew exactly what she was thinking as if hed intended her to think it incredible isnt it naomi stepped back beside her it was the third mare theyd bred that morning and her body was aching with the effort hundreds of pounds lost in the most basic of needs does it kelsey cleared her throat does it hurt her i doubt she notices if it does out of her back pocket naomi took a plain blue bandanna to mop her damp throat some stallions breed very kind like a shy or longtime lover she grinned wryly at the panting horses theres not a shy bone in that ones body hes a beast and what woman doesnt want a beast now and again she glanced at moses the intellect kelsey thought as her pulse danced it would be better or at least more comfortable to explore the logistics how do you choose which stallion for what mare bloodlines dispositions tendencies even color we make up genetic charts then you cross your fingers christ i know its a cliché but i could use a cigarette lets get some air theyre nearly done here naomi pulled a stick of gum out of her pocket as she stepped outside want some no thanks its a poor substitute for tobacco she sighed a little as she folded the stick in her mouth but most substitutes are poor in any case tilting her head she studied her daughter more thoroughly you look tired kelsey restless night somewhat naomi sighed again her daughter had once been so open with her a chatterbox of news and questions those days like so many others were over you can tell me if youd rather i leave it alone but id like to ask if philip is against this visit i think its more accurate to say hes hurt by my decision to accept your invitation i see naomi looked down at the ground and nodded once id tell you id talk to him myself try to reassure him but i think it would only make matters worse it would all right then hell be uneasy for a few weeks her eyes were hard when she looked up again dammit she deserved this one short month out of so many years hell survive i cant be dead just because so many people would prefer it she glanced over as gabe led the sweaty stallion out of the shed her smile bloomed softening her face again so do you think we have a merger if not its not for lack of trying he slapped the stallions neck before giving the reins to a handler the first of many i hope well kelsey youve had an interesting initiation into life on a horse farm if you stick around till after the first of next year youll see the results of todays tryst thats a very understated description for what went on in there she didnt appear to have much choice in the matter neither did he grinning gabe took out a cigar that kind of primitive attraction doesnt allow for choice moses will let me know if we need a repeat performance he said to naomi but ive got a hunch we wont id ask for odds but i prefer to go with your hunch on this one excuse me just a minute i want to check on the mare kelsey looked over to where the stallion was being cooled down shouldnt you be over there exchanging lies and letting him puff on that cigar i gave up lying about my sex life in high school do i make you nervous kelsey or is it just the atmosphere neither he made her something all right she thought but that was her problem so you own the neighboring farm then longshot thats right i admired your house from the road its quite a bit less traditional than the others in the area so am i the very dignified cape cod that stood on the hill when the farm passed into my hands didnt suit me so i tore it down he blew out a stream of smoke youll have to come over have a tour id like that but i think ill concentrate on touring three willows first you wont find a better operation on the east coast unless its mine the snort from behind him made him turn then grin at moses of course id have the best in the country if i could lure whitetree away double what she pays you moses keep your money boy buy yourself another fancy suit moses handed the mare to a stableboy for a rubdown owners like you flash in the pan thats what you said five years ago thats what i say now give me a cigar youre a hard man whitetree gabe obliged him yep moses stuck the cigar in his pocket for later your groom with the broken nose there was gin on his breath gabes easy smile faded his eyes narrowed ill take care of it tell your trainer to take care of it moses shot back its his job my horses gabe corrected excuse me he turned on his heel and headed for the trailer where the stallion was being loaded hell never learn that one moses muttered theres no chain of command as far as gabe is concerned watching gabe confront the groom naomi shook her head you should have told his trainer moses and jamison shouldnt need me to tell him what goes on under his nose ah kelsey held up a hand would you mind telling me whats going on gabes firing one of his grooms naomi told her just like that you dont drink when youre working moses hissed a breath out of his teeth as the grooms enraged voice carried to them owners should stay out of shedrow business why kelsey asked because theyre owners with a shake of his head moses strode off toward the stables never a dull moment naomi touched kelseys arm why dont we shit what kelsey looked over in time to see the groom swing at gabe and to see gabe evade once twice fluid as a shadow gabe didnt strike back though the instinct was there the back alley that always lurked under the civilized man hed made himself the groom was pitiful he thought and half his size and the worst of it was that it had taken moses to point out that hed had a drunk handling his horse go back and get your gear lipsky gabe repeated icily calm as the groom stood with cocked fists youre through at longshot who are you to tell me im through lipsky ran a hand over his mouth he wasnt drunk not yet hed had only enough of the gin in his flask to make him feel tall and mean i know more about horses than you ever will you lucked your way into the big time slater lucked and cheated and everybody knows it just like everybody knows your old mans a drunken loser the heat that flashed into gabes eyes had the handlers easing back in tacit agreement they silently formed a ring it was they believed nearly showtime know my father do you lipsky im not surprised youre welcome to look him up have a few drinks but in the meantime pick up your gear and the pay thats coming to you youre fired jamison hired me ive been at cunningham farm for ten years and ill be there after youve gone back to your roulette wheels and blackjack tables over lipskys head gabe saw two of the handlers exchange glances so he thought those were the cards he was dealt hed play them out later but now he had to finish this hand there is no cunningham farm and no place for you at longshot jamison might have hired you lipsky but i write your checks i dont write checks for drunks if i see you near any of my horses i can promise you it wont be jamison who deals with you he turned his gaze cutting straight to kelsey she stood like the handlers watching the show she had a moment to think shed prefer that the calm disdain in gabes eyes wasnt directed at her before she caught the glint of sun on steel the warning strangled in her throat but gabe was already whipping back to face the knife the first lunge sliced almost delicately down his arm rather than plunging into his back the sight and smell of blood had the handlers shifting quickly from their mildly interested attitudes keep back gabe ordered ignoring the pain in his arm his mistake he thought was in not judging correctly how far the drink would push you want to take me on lipsky his body was coiled now ready when you couldnt walk away from a fight you dove in and played the odds well youll need that knife so come on the blade trembled in lipskys hand for a moment he couldnt remember how it had gotten there the hilt had seemed to leap into his hand but it was there now and so was first blood pride stirred by gin wouldnt allow him to back off he crouched feinted and began to circle we have to do something the horror in kelseys throat tasted like rusted copper call the police no not the police pale as wax naomi clenched her hands at her sides not the police something good god she watched the blade gleam and lunge slipping by inches from gabes body no one moved but the two in the center of the circle then the stallion began to kick in his trailer excited anew by the scent of blood and violence before she could think kelsey grabbed a pitchfork leaning against the side of the shed she didnt want to dwell on what the tines would do to flesh so she hefted it and began running forward only to stumble to a halt when the knife flashed again it arched up flying free as lipsky hit the ground she hadnt seen the blow gabe hadnt appeared to move at all but now he was standing over the groom his eyes cold his face as calm as carved stone let jamison know where you end up hell send your gear and your money in an effortless move he hauled lipsky up by the scruff of the neck the stink of gin and blood curdled in his stomach sour memories dont let me catch you around here again or i might forget im a gentleman now and break you in half he tossed the limp groom down again and turned to his men let him off on the road he can ride his thumb out of here yes sir mr slater they scrambled as impressed as boys at a schoolyard brawl dragging lipsky up and carrying him to the truck sorry naomi in a careless gesture gabe raked the hair out of his eyes i should have waited to fire him until we were back at longshot she was trembling and hated it then i would have missed the performance forcing a smile on her face she moved closer blood was dripping down his arm come on up to the house well clean that arm thats my cue to say its just a scratch he glanced down at it grateful it wasnt much more than that no matter how nastily it throbbed but id be a fool to turn down nursing by beautiful women he looked at kelsey then she still held the pitchfork her knuckles white as bone on the handle valiant color rode high on her cheeks and shock glazed her eyes i think you can put that down now he took it from her gently but i appreciate the thought her knees began to shake so she locked them stiff youre just going to let him go what else people are usually arrested for attempted murder she looked back at her mother saw the wry smile curve naomis lips is this how things are handled around here youll have to ask moses naomi replied he does the firing at three willows taking the bandanna out of her pocket she stanched the blood on gabes arm sorry i dont have a petticoat to tear up for you so am i hold it there press hard she instructed him lets go up to the house and get it bandaged they started off gabe keeping his pace slow until kelsey caught up he turned his face to hers and grinned welcome home kelsey chapter five kelsey left the first aid to her mother and the bustling and clucking to gertie she would have voted for a trip to the emergency room but no one seemed particularly interested in her opinion knife wounds it seemed were to be taken philosophically and mopped up in the kitchen once gabes arm was cleaned medicated and bandaged bowls of chicken soup and hot biscuits were served talk was of horses of bloodlines and races of times and tracks since it wasnt a world kelsey understood she was free to observe and speculate she had yet to determine naomis relationship with gabriel slater it appeared intimate easy it was he who rose to refill coffee cups not his hostess they touched each other often casually a hand over a hand fingertips against an arm she told herself it didnt matter what they were to each other after all her mother and father had been divorced for more than twenty years naomi was free to pursue any relationship she chose and yet it bothered her on some elemental level certainly they suited each other beyond the easy flow between them over and above their interest in horses that consumed them both there was a strain of violence in each controlled on ice but as she knew with her mother and as shed seen for herself with gabe deadly kelsey might enjoy a trip to the track for some morning workouts gabe put in he was enjoying his coffee enjoying watching kelsey he could almost see the thoughts circling around in her head the track she was interested despite having her private musing interrupted i thought you worked the horses out here we do both naomi told her using the track gives a horse a feel for it and the handicappers a chance to gauge their bets gabe put in the track draws an interesting and eclectic group particularly in those dawn hours long before post time dawns no exaggeration naomi smiled at her daughter you might not like to start your day quite so early actually id like to see how its done tomorrow the lift of gabes brow was a subtle challenge fine well meet you there naomi glanced at her watch ive got to get down to the stables the farriers due as she rose she pressed a hand to gabes shoulder finish your coffee kelsey youll keep gabe company wont you hell tell you what to expect in the morning she grabbed a denim jacket and hurried out she doesnt stay in one place very long kelsey murmured first part of the year is the busiest in the business gabe leaned back the coffee cup in his hand so should i tell you what to expect id rather be surprised then tell me something would you have used that pitchfork she considered letting the question hang i guess neither of us will know the answer to that id lay odds you would have a hell of a picture you made darling more than worth a prick on the arm to see it youre going to have a scar slater youre lucky it was your arm and not your pretty face he was aiming for my back gabe reminded her i didnt thank you for the warning i didnt give you one sure you did your face was as good as a shout he slipped a hand into his pocket and pulled out a worn deck of cards casually he began a riffling shuffle do you play poker confused she scowled at him i dont as a rule but i know the game if you take it up never bluff youd lose more than your shirt have you lost more than your shirt more times than i care to remember out of habit he began to deal two hands of stud faces up would you bet on your queen kelsey moved her shoulders i suppose he flipped up the next cards after a while if youre smart you dont risk what you cant afford to lose ive got plenty of shirts your queens still high so it is for some absurd reason she was enjoying the game on the third card her spade queen still reigned and on the fourth still mine is it the betting or the horses that interests you ive got more than one interest including naomi including naomi he turned over the last card smiled easily a pair of fives he mused looks like they usurp your queen her mouth moved into what was very close to a pout its a shame to lose to such pathetic cards no cards are pathetic if they win he took her hand amused when the fingers went rigid an old southern tradition maam he brought her hand to his lips watching her i owe you for lipsky payments your choice it had been a long time since shed felt this quickening in the blood since it couldnt be ignored it would have to be fought dont you think its in questionable taste for you to make a move on me in the kitchen christ he loved the way she could come up with those prim little phrases and deliver them in that husky voice darling this isnt even close to a move keeping her hand firmly in his he turned it palm up lady hands he murmured teacup hands ive always had a real weakness for long narrow hands with soft skin he pressed his lips to the center lingering while her pulse bumped like a hammer under his thumb that he said curling her fingers closed as if to ensure she kept the imprint of his lips there was a move as far as taste goes yours suits me youll probably want to keep that in mind he released her hand scooped up his cards and rose ill see you in the morning unless youre having second thoughts dignity she reminded herself was as important as pride im not having any thoughts at all slater that involve you sure you are he leaned down until they were facetoface i warned you not to bluff kelsey you lose he left her steaming over cold coffee it was a damn shame he thought that he couldnt indulge himself in a few afternoon fantasies but he had work to do as soon as he returned to longshot gabe sought out jamison the trainer had been cunninghams man but when gabe took over the farm it hadnt taken much to induce jamison to stay his loyalties had always been more with the horses than with the owner he was a bigbellied man who liked his food and his beer though hed trained generations of horses that had finished in the money no one but his staunchest friends would have considered him in moses whitetrees league hed come from the county of kerry as a babe in his mothers arms his earliest memories were of the shedrow the smell of the horses his father had groomed jamison had lived his entire life in the shadow of the thoroughbred now at sixtytwo he sometimes dreamed of owning his own small farm and one champion just one to carry him comfortably into retirement well gabe he set aside his condition book and rose as gabe walked in i shipped honest abe to santa anita and reliance to pimlico missed the first post he smiled wanly but i heard youd had a spot of trouble and thought youd want to see me before i headed to the track how many times have you caught lipsky drinking on the job no prevaricating or how was your day with the likes of gabriel slater jamison thought hed known the boy for some twenty years and had yet to fully understand him twice before i gave him a warning and told him hed be cut loose if it happened again hes a good hand a weakness for gin its true but hes worked on this farm for a decade he glanced at the bandage on gabes arm and sighed i swear on my mothers heart id no notion the man would try to stick you drunks are unreliable jamie you know my feelings about that i do indeed jamison folded his hands over his belly he should be at the track not here smoothing feathers and maybe i understand why youve no tolerance for that particular weakness still the lads are my province arent they and i followed my own judgment your judgment was faulty it was a hand drinks on the job from you down to the lowest stableboy hes gone no more warnings jamie no exceptions irritation might have flickered in his eyes but jamison nodded youre holding the bat gabe satisfied gabe picked up the condition book himself skimming pages ill be spending more time around the barn and the backstretch he said i dont want you to feel im breathing down your neck its your barn jamie returned his voice stiffening your backstretch yes it is and it was very clear to me today that the men dont consider me an integral part of this operation thats my fault he set the book down again the first couple of years after the farm changed hands i was involved with building the house and shoehorning my way into the tight little club of owners since then ive let most of the daytoday business stay in your hands and played owner now im going to get down to work youre my trainer jamie and as far as the horses go ill accept what advice you give me but im back in the game now i dont intend to lose it would pass jamison decided owners rarely concerned themselves with the real work for long all they wanted was their spot in the paddock and the purse you know your way around a shedrow as well as anyone its been a long time since i picked up a pitchfork gabe smiled as the image of kelsey brandishing one like a spear flashed into his mind he looked at the bigfaced clock jamison had nailed to the wall of his office we can make it to pimlico by three whod you send with the filly carstairs torkys up on her lynettes groom lets go see what kind of team they make since she was left to her own devices kelsey changed her shoes for boots and headed out she didnt go toward the stables aware that she would just be in the way or stared at as if she were an oddity instead she walked toward the soft roll of hills where the horses were at grass the quiet the undeniable peace were a welcome change from the frantic morning even so she had to fight a restlessness that urged her to keep walking keep moving until she found what was over the next rise how could she have walked here as a child and remember nothing it frustrated her to think that the first three years of her life were a virtual blank it wouldnt matter in most cases but her destiny had been skewed in those early years she wanted them back wanted to decide for herself what was right what was wrong she stopped by a tidy white fence leaning on it while a trio of mares began an impromptu race their babies skipping after them another mother stood patiently cropping grass while her foal suckled it was almost too perfect kelsey thought a postcard that was just slightly too clear too bright for reality yet she found herself smiling at the foal admiring the impossibly delicate legs the tilt of the somehow elegant head what would he do she wondered if she climbed the fence and tried to pet him spectacular arent they naomi joined her at the fence the breeze ruffled the hair shed cut to chin length for convenience more than fashion i never get tired of watching them spring after spring year after year its soothing the routine of it and exciting the possibility of it theyre beautiful sedate somehow its hard to imagine them streaking down a racetrack theyre athletes bred for speed youll see that for yourself tomorrow naomi tossed back her hair then impatient with it pulled a soft cap out of her jacket pocket and put it on the one there nursing hes five days old five surprised kelsey turned back studying the mother and her baby more closely the foal was sleek and healthy and appeared wise to the ways of the paddock that doesnt seem possible they grow quickly in three years hell be prime it starts here or more accurately in the breeding shed then goes to that final blur of color at the wire hell be fifteen sixteen hands perhaps twelve hundred pounds and hell race the oval with a man on his back its a beautiful thing to watch but not easy kelsey commented it cant be easy to take something so delicate and turn it into a competitor no naomi smiled then her daughter already understood that she supposed was in the blood its work and dedication and quite often disappointment but its worth it every time she angled her hat so the brim shaded her eyes im sorry i left you so long the farrier likes to talk he was a friend of my fathers he does the work for me here rather than at the track because of old ties its all right i dont expect you to entertain me what do you expect nothing yet naomi looked back at the nursing mare wishing it could be that easy to bond with her own child are you still angry about this morning angrys the wrong word kelsey turned away from the fence so she could study her mothers profile baffled is better everyone just stood there you didnt with a grin naomi shook her head i thought you were going to run that drunken fool through i envy you that kelsey that kneejerk reaction that comes from a lack of fear or a surplus of honor i froze i have too much fear and not nearly enough honor left a lifetime ago i wouldnt have hesitated either she braced herself and shifted to face her daughter youre wondering why the police werent called gabe did that for me he may or may not have handled it differently on his own place but here well he would have known id be reluctant to talk to the police again ever again its none of my business naomi closed her eyes the simple fact they both had to face was that it was all kelseys business now i wasnt afraid when they came to arrest me i was so arrogantly sure that they would end up looking like fools and i a heroine i wasnt afraid when i sat in the interrogation room with its long mirror gray walls the hard chair designed to make you squirm she opened her eyes again i didnt squirm not at first i was a chadwick but the fear creeps up on you inch by crafty inch you can beat it back not away but back before i left that horrible room with the mirror and the gray walls i was afraid she took a steadying breath reminded herself she was free of that free of it but for the memories through the trial the headlines the stares i was afraid but i didnt want to show it i hated the idea of everyone knowing i was terrified then they tell you to stand up so the jury of your peers can deliver the verdict your verdict you cant beat it back then it has a choke hold on you and you cant breathe you might stand there pretending to be calm pretending to be confident because you know theyre watching you every eye is on you but inside youre jelly when they say guilty its almost anticlimactic she drew another deep breath so you see im very reluctant to talk to the police again she said nothing for a moment expected no response do you know we used to come here when you were little id sit you up on the fence you always loved visiting the foals im sorry and she was suddenly deeply sorry i dont remember it doesnt matter see the one there sunning himself the black hes a champion i knew it when he was born he might prove himself to be one of the best to come out of three willows kelsey studied the foal more closely he was charming certainly but she didnt see anything to separate him from the other young in the pasture how can you tell its in the eyes mine and his we just know she leaned on the fence looking out over the fields with her daughter and was for a moment nearly content late that night when the house was quiet and the wind tapped seductively at the windows naomi curled her body to moses she liked it best when he came to her bed it had more of a sense of permanence than when she crept up to his rooms above the trainers shed not that she didnt enjoy the thrill of doing just that the first time their first time shed walked into his room surprising him as he sat in his underwear nursing a beer and poring over paperwork hed been a tough seduction she recalled stroking a hand along the firm skin of his chest but his eyes had given him away hed wanted her just as hed always wanted her it had just taken her sixteen years to realize she wanted him too i love you moses it always jolted him to hear her say it he supposed it always would he laid his hand over hers over his heart i love you naomi how else could you have talked me into coming up here with your daughter down the hall she laughed shifting her head so that she could nibble on his neck kelseys an adult i doubt shed be traumatized even if she knew i had you in bed she rolled over straddling him and i do have you moses its hard to argue with that since all the blood just drained from my head and into my lap in an old habit he skimmed his hands up her slim torso to cup her breasts you get more beautiful every day naomi every year thats because your eyes get older not when they look at you her heart simply melted christ you destroy me when you get sentimental i look at kelsey and see how much ive changed its wonderful to see her to have her close even for a little while she laughed shaking her hair back and im still vain enough to look away from her and into the mirror and see every goddamned line im crazy about every goddamned line being beautiful used to be so important to me it was like a mission no like a duty then for so many years it didnt mean anything until you she smiled bending down to brush his lips with hers and now you tell me you like wrinkles moses cupped a hand behind her head drawing her more firmly to him as she flowed into the kiss he shifted her raising her hips lowering them so that he slid deep into her he watched her arch back thrilling to her quick throaty moan he set the rhythm slow holding her to his pace drawing the pleasure out for both of them from the hallway outside her room kelsey heard the muffled sounds of lovemaking the creak of the old mattress the breathy moans and murmurs she stood the cup of tea shed gone down to brew in one hand a book in the other flustered into immobility not once had she ever heard her father and candace in the night she assumed they were both too restrained and polite to make noisy love there was certainly nothing restrained or polite about the sounds only partially smothered by the closed door down the hall nor she reminded herself was it polite to stand out here listening she fumbled with the knob spilling tea in her rush to get inside her mother she thought barraged by dozens of conflicting emotions and gabe slater she assumed the emotions his presence behind that door conjured up were best not explored the moment she had her own door safely closed she leaned back against it part of her wanted to laugh at the absurdity of it a grown woman shocked because another grown woman who happened to be her mother had an active sex life but she wasnt very amused at the moment at the situation or her own reaction to it no longer wanting either she set the tea and book aside the dark still sleeping garden beneath her window was silvered with moonlight romantic she thought laying her brow against the glass mysterious as so much of three willows was she didnt want romance she didnt want mystery at least she didnt want to want them she was here because it was important to learn about the half of her parentage that had been taken away from her turning from the window she went back to bed but she didnt sleep until long after she heard the door down the hall open and close and the sound of quiet footsteps moving past her room toward the stairs chapter six the track at dawn it was a different world from the one kelsey had expected racing to her meant more than speed it meant gambling and gamblers fat cigars and bad suits the smell of stale beer and losers sweat the drunken groom gabe had fired the day before fit her image of the world shed imagined much more cozily than the tranquil somehow mystical reality of the dawn horse the track was cloaked in mist when she arrived with naomi the horses had left even earlier to be offloaded saddled and prepped for their workouts it was quiet almost serene voices were muffled by the fog and people moved in and out of the trailing mist like ghosts men leaned against the sagging rail around the oval sipping from steaming paper cups theyre clockers naomi told her speedboys some work for the track or daily racing form theyll be here for hours timing the horses handicapping them she smiled chasing speed i guess thats what we all do i thought youd like to see it from this angle first its well its beautiful isnt it the fog the trees slipping through it the all but empty grandstands its not what i pictured she turned to the woman beside her the slim lovely blonde in denim jacket and jeans nothing seems to be most people see only one aspect of racing two minutes around the oval over and done in a flash thrilling certainly sometimes terrifying triumphant or tragic often a man or woman is judged the same way by one aspect or one act there was no bitterness in her voice now but simple acceptance ill take you around to the shedrow thats where the real action is and the real characters kelsey discovered aging jockeys whod failed at the post or put on weight hustled for the forty dollars theyd earn per ride as exercise boys others hardly more than children with an eager look in the eye loitered hoping for their chance horses were discussed strategies outlined a groom in a tweed hat gently walked a crippled horse singing to it in a soothing monotone there was no particular excitement or anticipation just routine one she realized went on day after day while most people slept or nodded over their first cup of coffee she spotted a man in a pale blue suit and shiny boots in earnest conversation with a placideyed man in a tattered cardigan now and again the man in the suit would punctuate his words with a jab of a pudgy finger a flashy diamond ring in the shape of a horseshoe winked with every move bill cunningham naomi said noting who had captured kelseys attention cunningham kelsey frowned and flipped through her memory isnt that the name i heard that groom gabe fired yesterday mention longshot used to be cunningham farm bill inherited it oh about twentyfive years ago i guess the disdain in her voice leaked through he was doing a firstclass job of running it into the ground when he lost it to gabe now he has an interest in several horses owns one or two mediocre ones outright he lives in maryland the trainers carmine works for bill and several other owners right now carmines listening to bills instructions his pontificating and hes agreeing with everything then carmine will do as he pleases because he knows bills an ass oops she let out a sigh he spotted us ill apologize ahead of time naomi in a strutting stride that showed off his boots cunningham closed in on them his eyes glittered like polished marbles as he took naomis hands a beautiful sight on a gloomy morning bill the years had given naomi a high tolerance for fools and she offered her cheek we dont often see you at workouts got me a new horse claiming race at hialeah she took the win as the rider pleased i was just telling carmine how she should be worked today dont want her rated of course not naomi said sweetly bill this is my daughter kelsey daughter he puffed out his cheeks in feigned surprise like everyone else in the area he already knew about kelsey you must mean sister glad to meet you dearie he slapped a hand to kelseys and pumped vigorously going to follow in your mas bootsteps are you im just here to watch well theres plenty to see well have her hooked by dusk he added with a wink to naomi you check with me before you make any bets this afternoon honey ill show you how its done thank you nothings too good for naomis little girl you know if i hadnt shied at the gate i might be your papa you take care now in a pigs eye naomi muttered under her breath as bill strutted away to harass his trainer he likes to think we were an item when the closest we came was me not quite avoiding one sloppy kiss i appreciate your taste what the hell was he saying about his horse oh naomi set her hands on her hips and enjoyed a good laugh bill likes to toss the lingo around thinks it fools people into believing he knows something lets see in plain english he picked up the filly in a claiming race meaning the owners had put it up for sale the horse won easily and bill met the asking price he feels the horse shouldnt be rated or slowed during the workout she frowned at his back hes the type who pays a jockey extra for every hit of the stick if a horse isnt whipped over the finish line bill feels cheated im surprised you were so polite it doesnt cost me anything she shrugged and i know what it is to be an outcast come on moses should have a rider up by now they moved through the paddock area where exercise boys were being given a leg up onto their mounts with little between them kelsey noted the saddle was so tiny hardly more than a slip of leather the boys as they were called regardless of sex stood in the high stirrups while mounted trainers walked beside or behind them toward the track thats one of ours naomi pointed to a trotting bay virginias pride if you cant resist betting today you might want to put a couple of dollars on him hes an amazing athlete and he likes this particular track do you bet mmmm naomis eyes were on moses who rode a halflength behind the bay ive always hated to refuse a gamble lets watch him run there were other horses on the track the mist was lifting now and they cut through it like bullets through mesh exploding through it shredding it kelseys breath caught at the sight of it the sounds of it huge bodies on thin legs spewing up dirt necks straining forward with their tiny riders bent low her heartbeat picked up the pulse of the muffled thunder of hooves there excitement lifted her voice as she pointed thats your horse yes thats ours the tracks fast today but i imagine moses told the boy to keep him just under two minutes how would the rider know he has a clock in his head gabes voice came from behind her though kelsey started she didnt take her eyes off the horse rocketing around the track he looks good naomi hell look even better by derby time her eyes narrowed that ones yours isnt he double or nothing gabe leaned on the rail as his horse sped past hell look better by may too kelsey didnt see how both horses looked magnificent now eating up the track tossing pieces of it toward the sky they were airborne those terrifyingly delicate legs lifting off the earth like wings she could have stayed there for hours watching horse after horse lap after lap true it took only a minute or two and the clockers stood with their stopwatches the trainers with theirs but it was timeless to her like a lovely animated painting in a worn frame picked your favorite yet gabe asked her no she didnt look at him didnt want him or the memory of what shed heard in the night to spoil the mood im not much of a gambler then i dont suppose youd like to bet that youll hit the windows before the afternoons over she shrugged then found she couldnt resist bill cunningham offered to give me some tips cunningham gabe let out a roar of laughter then i hope youve got deep pockets darling he leaned against the fence he considered taking out a cigar but decided it would spoil his enjoyment of kelseys scent soft and subtle it was the kind that crept into a mans senses and lingered long after the woman had slipped away mornings the best time naomi murmured shading her eyes as the sun broke through the thinning mist and dazzled clean slate possibilities gabe looked down at kelsey its all about possibilities later they walked back to the shedrow horses steamed in the cool air as they were unsaddled and walked legs were checked for strains sprains and bruises a roans hooves were oiled a groom posed another crouching down searching for injury a farrier with leather apron and battered toolbox hammered a shoe like a painting isnt it gabe asked as if hed plucked the image from kelseys brain yes it is everything you see here would have been true a hundred years ago five hundred thoroughbreds legs can go anytime so we obsess about them look there wheres the trainer looking she turned to watch a horse being led in the trainer behind at the horses feet and hell keep his eyes there he nodded in another direction they were probably around a thousand years ago a man in a racing cap dogged moses at the heels he was talking fast puffing to keep up who is he jockey agent they hustle from barn to barn trying to convince everyone they represent the next willie shoemaker casually he tucked naomis hair behind her ear can i get you some coffee id love some kelsey sure thanks is it all right if i get a closer look at your horse while hes being walked go ahead naomi settled down on an upturned bucket the mornings work was nearly done and the waiting would start shed gotten very good at waiting there was a pleasure in it now watching her daughter circle with the hot walker asking questions naomi imagined the child had always been full of questions but never aloof as she was now for a moment that morning as they stood in the mist watching the first horses round the practice track shed felt something relax between them then the stiffness had come back subtle but then there were so many subtleties to her daughter so many contrasts kelsey laughed it was the first time naomi had heard the sound easy without reservations shes enjoying herself gabe commented as he passed naomi a cup of coffee i know its good to see it im sitting here telling myself that it wont always be so awkward between us she eased her dry throat with the hot sweetened coffee i just want to touch her to hold her just once and i cant she might let me out of pity that would be worse than rejection shes here gently he ran a hand down her hair over her shoulder she doesnt strike me as the type to be here if she didnt want to be i dont expect her to love me again but i do want her to let me love her she reached for the hand on her shoulder covered it with her own kelsey tried to ignore the intimacy of the pose when she walked back to them it was their business she reminded herself she kept a smile on her face and reached out for the coffee gabe offered thanks ive just been given the winner in every race today i should leave here im told flush jimmys always got a tip naomi said and theyre right as often as theyre wrong oh but these are sure things kelsey grinned as she lifted her cup he swore hed never give miss naomis daughter anything but a cinch tip im supposed to bet on necromancer in the first because the fields slow and hes generous and should win laughing she arched a brow did i get that right no one would guess its your first day gabe said soberly oh im a quick study she glanced around the pace was definitely slowing down she noted what happens now we wait naomi rose stretched come on ill buy us some doughnuts to go with this coffee waiting it seemed was a way of life around the track by ten the workday was over for the horses not scheduled to race trailers pulled in and pulled out the track was groomed by noon the grandstands began to fill the glassedin restaurant behind them served lunch catering to those who preferred their racing experience away from the noise and smells of the masses in the shedrow horses were prepped once again swollen legs were iced down in buckets according to personal strategy some were kept on edge others soothed like babies jockeys donned their silks now the anticipation was there the excitement that had been missing from the mistcoated morning horses pranced fidgeted athletes eager to run some calmed when their jockeys were tossed onto their backs others pawed and quivered from the paddock area they walked toward the track single file some led by grooms some unaccompanied now the grandstands buzzed newcomers sprinkled among regulars all of them hoping today would be their day the post parade the foundation of the dozens of racing rituals began with the horses stepping onto the track at the buglers call they circled it in order of post position those eager to bet studied racing forms horses jockeys hoping to pick a winner if a horse was sweating he might be nervous advantage or disadvantage each player had his own opinion bandaged forelegs could be trouble ah that one hauling at his bit might be badtempered today or he might be fast that one looks like a winner at the finish line barely five minutes after it had begun the parade dissolved like colorful confetti tossed in the air it didnt matter to kelsey there was too much to see odd the track wasnt really flat at all it was wide textured with furrows and air pockets a circular mile of speed and dreams she could all but smell the dreams as she stood at the rail from the jockeys from the grandstands some were fresh and floral others stale powdered dry with dust and she understood standing there what a powerful drug it was to want to win i think ill take that first tip naomi laughed she had been expecting it take her up will you gabe nobody should face their first window alone im sure i can handle it kelsey said when gabe took her hand everybody thinks that he wound his way up inside where lines were already forming at the windows let me give you a quick lesson on playing the horses have you figured out how much cash youd play she frowned annoyed about a hundred double it whatever you figure youll play double it then consider it gone now youve got your racing form yeah i got it she didnt understand it but she had it normally youd need about four hours in a quiet place to study it reviewing the races in order eliminating horses ranking others best to whittle it down to two or three no binoculars huh no i didnt think never mind you can borrow mine he eased her into a line draped an arm companionably over her shoulder he didnt smile he wanted to but he didnt she was listening to him as a prized student would to a veteran teacher now you want to forget betting the doubles or the exactas any of the combinations and you want to bet to win of course i do thats right aggressive betting its its own reward betting to show is for wimps he had the satisfaction of seeing the man in the line beside him wince and curl his shoulders did you check the odds board no she said feeling like a fool your horse is at four to one thats fine betting favorites is for cowards too bad you told me you werent much of a gambler or i wouldnt have let you eat or drink before betting what never eat or drink before you pick a winner kelsey her eyes narrowed youre making this up nope its all gospel now he grinned and its all bullshit bet to play because its fun close your eyes and pick a number horses are athletes not machines you cant figure them thanks a lot amused now she stepped up to the window ten dollars on necromancer she shot a look at gabe to win with his arm still around her shoulder gabe reached for his wallet fifty on number three to win clutching her own ticket she frowned whos number three couldnt say he slipped the ticket into his pocket you just bet a number just a number a hunch want to make a side bet on who comes in first your tip or my hunch another ten she shot back and you said you werent much of a gambler he got her back to the rail just as the horses entered the starting gate foolish it might have been but her heart was thudding her palms damp at the clang of the bell she strained forward dazzled by the blur of color no misty workout now but a crowd of muscled bodies fighting for position their riders a burr on their backs in seconds they reached full stride with frontrunners hugging the rail the sound was overwhelming thunder in front roaring in back then they were at the turn number threes got it gabe said in her ear kelsey shook him off theyve barely started she could hear jockeys screaming threats or encouragement while their whips flashed down the stretch the wire in sight and kelsey had forgotten the bet entirely every emotion was caught up in the race itself the showmanship of it the drama of speed she saw a horse coming from behind straining digging in hardly aware of the decision she began to root for him thrilled by that flash of courage and heart he nipped the leader on the outside and took the wire by half a length oh did you see him she threw her head back and laughed he was beautiful gabe hadnt seen the finish but hed seen her the polite mask had melted away with excitement revealing the passion and energy of the woman beneath he wanted that woman more than hed ever wanted a winning hand lips pursed naomi considered the look in gabes eyes that was something shed have to think about your horse finished fifth she told kelsey it doesnt matter kelsey drew a deep breath she could still smell the glamour it was worth it did you see how he came up like that it was almost out of nowhere number three gabe said and waited until her eyes met his my hunch paid off that was number three she turned toward the winners circle torn between annoyance at losing to him and her enjoyment of watching the horse win this must be your lucky day you could be right so she slid her eyes up to his and smiled who do you like in the next race sometime during the afternoon she devoured a hot dog and washed it down with a watereddown soft drink she felt a surprising stab of pride very personal when virginias pride dominated his field it was so obvious she thought even to her untrained eye that there wasnt another horse in the race to compare with him another less identifiable emotion pricked her when gabes horse crossed the wire first as dusk fell the grandstands were littered with losing tickets cigarette butts and shattered hopes can i interest you two ladies in some dinner oh distracted naomi buttoned up her jacket she was already looking for moses im going to be at least another hour here why dont you take kelsey instinctively kelsey sidestepped i dont mind waiting for you no go ahead have fun ill see you at home in a couple of hours really i but naomi was already hurrying away i appreciate the offer gabe but youre too well mannered to refuse he took her arm no im not then youre too hungry a single hot dog doesnt fuel all that energy and i can help you count your winnings i dont think thats going to strain anyones math in any case she was hungry she let him guide her through the parking lot to a bottlegreen jaguar nice car shes fast he was right kelsey leaned back and enjoyed the ride through the pearling twilight shed always liked to drive fast top down radio blasting wade had lectured her countless times as hed stuck to the heart of the speed limit sensible she thought now responsible but hed never understood that now and again she had to cut loose do something anything full out hed preached moderation and she had agreed except when she couldnt an impulsive spending spree a speeding ticket a lastminute urge to fly to the bahamas those quicksilver changes in her had been the cause of most of their domestic quarrels small stuff shed always thought incorrectly she realized now what had her impulsive surprise visit to atlanta gotten her freedom she reminded herself and determinedly closed the book on it when she began to pay attention to the scenery again she realized they were nearly at bluemont i thought we were going to have dinner we are do you like seafood yes is there a restaurant out here one or two but were eating in i called home earlier how does grilled swordfish strike you thats fine she straightened in her seat listening to the alarm bells in her head how did you know id be coming to dinner i had a hunch he cruised down the road zipped through the iron gates and up the drive you can take a look at the house before we eat his gardener had been busy beds had been tidied for spring so perennials could flaunt their new growth a few brave daffodils had already bloomed their bright yellow heads nodding charmingly funny shed never have picked gabe as the daffodil type the front door was flanked by beveled glass panels etched in geometric designs with the light inside glowing through them they glinted like diamonds she remembered now that his jockeys silks had resembled diamonds as well a dramatic red and white how did you pick your colors the silks a straight flush diamonds eight through king he opened the door a hand of cards i drew the ten and jack against the odds people will tell you thats how i came into this place winning a hand of cards did you more or less she stepped inside into a tiled atrium all open space dizzying ceilings with arched skylights the copper rail that circled the second floor followed a gently curving staircase huge terracotta pots hung suspended spilling out greenery quite an entrance she managed i dont like to be closed in ill get you a drink all right she followed him through a wide arch into a living area this too opened into another room through archways glass doors invited the night inside lamps already lit softened it there was a fire crackling in a hearth of river stone a table was set in front of it for two she noted a white cloth candles champagne chilled in a bucket beside it did you also have a hunch that naomi wouldnt be joining us she usually goes into conference with moses after a day at the track he opened the bottle with a quick celebrational pop do you want to look around or would you rather have dinner right away ill look around since im here she accepted the glass noting there was no matching flute by the second plate youre not celebrating sure i am i dont drink why dont we start upstairs and work down he led her out up the curving stairs she counted four bedrooms before they climbed a short flight into the master suite this was a splitlevel affair the bedroom three tiled steps above the sitting area a stone fireplace would warm the foot of the lakesized platform bed and the skylight would invite a restless sleeper to watch the moon like the rest of the house it was a mix of the classic and the modern a chippendale table held an abstract bronzeandcopper sculpture a persian carpet glowed on the floor beneath a freeform coffee table of polished teak meissen vases beside modern art the art the painting drew her even from across the room kelsey recognized it as a work by the same artist who had done those in her mothers home so much passion she thought as she studied the frenetic brushstrokes the violent juxtaposition of primary colors not a very restful piece for a bedroom it seemed to belong here n c she murmured did naomi paint this yes didnt you know she painted no no one mentioned it shes very talented i know several art dealers who would be begging at her door she wouldnt thank you for it her arts personal all arts personal she turned away from it has she always painted no you should ask her about it sometime shell tell you whatever you want to know ill have to decide what that is first sipping her champagne she wandered the room i dont know what that dignified cape cod looked like but i doubt it could have measured up to this more at ease she turned back did you horrify the neighborhood by having it razed appalled everyone within twenty miles and enjoyed every minute of it damn right whats the use of having a reputation if you cant live up to it and what is your reputation slippery darling very slippery anyone would tell you that being alone with me in my bedrooms the first step to perdition its a long way from the first step to the last fall not as far as you might think with a shrug she tossed back the rest of her drink tell me about the card game over dinner he held out a hand im a sucker for atmosphere and a lot closer to that last fall than most intrigued she put her hand in his that doesnt sound very slippery to me slater im just getting started downstairs he refilled her glass some invisible servant had already set two silverdomed plates on the table lit the candles and switched on music they sat down to gershwin the card game all right how much do you know about poker i know what beats what i think she took a bite of the delicately grilled fish and closed her eyes this definitely beats the track cooking all to hell ill tell the cook you said so anyway about five years ago i was in a game a marathon big stakes heavy hitters around here not around here here in the dignified cape cod she narrowed her eyes isnt gambling illegal in this state call a cop do you want to hear this or not i do so you were in a big illegal poker game then what cunningham was having a run of bad luck not just during the game but for several months his horses were breaking down he hadnt had any finish in the money for more than a year he had a pile of outstanding debts he figured like most do when theyre on a downswing that all he needed was one big score hence the poker game exactly i had interest in a horse and hed been running well so i was he smiled devilishly flush i wanted a farm like this always had i went into the game thinking that if i didnt lose my stake i might finesse enough for another horse work my way up sounds sensible in a skewed sort of way reckless was how it sounded she thought admirably reckless obviously you won more than a horse i couldnt lose it was one of those sweet moments when everything falls in your lap if he had three of a kind i had a full house he had a straight i had a flush his trouble really started when he couldnt let it go he was down about sixty sixtyfive hundred charmed he took her hand kissed it lavishly thousand darling and he didnt have it to lose not cash anyway so he upped the stakes wouldnt take no for an answer and of course you tried your best to bring him to his senses i told him he was making a mistake he said he wasnt gabe moved his shoulders who am i to argue there were only four of us left by then wed been at it for about fifteen hours this was going to be the last hand five thousand to open no limit on raises that was twenty thousand before you even got started and over a hundred and fifty by the time it got down to me and cunningham her fork stopped halfway to her mouth a hundred and fifty thousand dollars on one hand he thought he had a winner kept bumping the pot i had the last raise bumped it another fifty myself i thought it might put him out of his misery but he matched it she lifted her glass and sipped slowly to wet her dry throat she felt she could almost be there sweatypalmed and drymouthed with a small fortune riding on the turn of a card thats a quarter of a million dollars he grinned you are a quick study i felt sorry for him but im not going to say i didnt relish the moment when i laid down that straight flush to his three kings he didnt have the cash gabe tipped more champagne into her glass he barely had the assets so we made a deal you could say cunningham bet the farm and lost it you just kicked him out gabe inclined his head studied her what would you have done i dont know she said after a moment but i dont think i could have thrown the man out of his own house even after hed gambled with money he didnt have even then so youre a soft touch we made a deal gabe said again that satisfied both of us and because i played against the odds i got something id wanted my whole life thats quite a story i guess you met the unlucky bill cunningham at the track no at least not initially i used to work for him here she set down her fork you used to work here i walked hots shoveled manure polished tack for three years i was one of cunninghams boys he had a fine line back then of course he never gave a good goddamn about the horses they were just money to him he cared a lot less about the people who took care of them our rooms were like little cells cramped dingy he didnt believe in putting any of his capital into unnecessary improvements i dont think it bothered you at all to take his house i didnt lose any sleep over it when i left here i did some time at three willows now thats a farm chadwick had the touch so does your mother when i left i was about seventeen then i figured id come back one day money dripping out of my pockets and buy myself one place or the other and you did in a manner of speaking what did you do while you were away thats another story fair enough relaxed with food and wine she propped her chin on her fist i bet you hated that cape cod every fucking inch of it laughing she leaned back again and picked up her glass i think im starting to like you i hope you didnt make all that up i didnt have to want dessert i cant with a little moan she pushed away from the table to wander the room when i first saw this house i thought it looked arrogant and territorial i think i was right she closed her eyes for a moment my point of no return what nothing she shook her head and walked closer to the windows it must be quite a feeling to look out any window and see so much of your own what do you see out of yours a restaurant a small shopping center with a terrible little boutique and a wonderful bakery its practically next door to the metro and i thought i wanted convenience he put his hands on her shoulders then turned her so that they were facetoface but you dont no the quick tremble caught her by surprise when he skimmed his hand up the side of her neck what then i havent decided he framed her face letting his fingers dip into her hair i have his mouth lowered to hers soft at first testing hardly more than a nibble that gave them both the choice to step back but she didnt not with his taste still vibrating on her lips and the low drugging ache of unexpected need churning she didnt step back but forward her arms winding recklessly around his neck her mouth melding hotly with his so much to feel shed forgotten there was so much to feel or perhaps shed never known there was nothing civilized or tentative about this embrace it was groping and wild an explosion of sensation that mocked the gentle candlelight and soft music she stripped his mind clean there was nothing left for him but naked sensation the smell of her the taste which mixed together like some exotic drug the feel of her straining against him the sound of his quickened breathing as she dragged him greedily closer the need for her sharp and edgy as a knife peeled away the layers of manners behavior and ethics hed carefully crafted and bared the reckless man beneath he needed to touch her his hands streaked down over in a desperate race to possess she arched under them eager for more hurry she wanted to beg him to hurry not to let her think not to let her reason then he ran a hand over her face combing her hair behind her ear the image of him performing that same careless gesture for her mother only hours before flashed into her mind the horror and the shame were like two vicious heavy blows she shoved away fighting for air dont she stumbled back when he reached for her dont touch me she could still taste him still want him how could you do this how could i do this i want you he had to fight every instinct in his body to keep from lunging forward and taking what had nearly been his you want me because it was true urgently true she had no choice but to strike back im not a mare to be hobbled and serviced and i didnt come here tonight so you could find out if the daughter takes after the mother to restrain them gabe stuck his hands in his pockets clarify im not excusing myself but at least i have the decency to stop this before it goes any further you have no decency at all she shoved her tumbled hair back fury fueled by an acid guilt turned her voice into a whip is this all just another game to you slater lure the daughter wine and dine her charm her into bed and see if shes as good as the mother did you place bets calculate the odds he took a moment before he answered when he did neither his face nor his voice revealed any of the clawing anger you think im sleeping with naomi i know you are im flattered youre what kind of a man are you you have no idea kelsey none at all i doubt very much youve come across my kind in that nice comfortable little world of yours he stepped forward curling his hand around the back of her neck it was a small nasty way of paying her back but he was feeling small and he was feeling nasty however stiff she held her spine her body began to tremble take your hands off me you like my hands on you he said softly right now youre afraid excited but afraid and wondering what you would do if i dragged you upstairs hell why go to all that trouble when theres a floor right here his voice was smooth and cool as cream but there was a light in his eyes a dangerous burn what would you do kelsey if i took you right here right now fear clawed up her throat shredding her voice i said take your hands off me he could read the terror on her face it was clear as a scream even when he released her and stepped back it didnt quite fade nor did the feelings of disgust that simmered inside him ill apologize for that only for that he studied her for a moment the color hed deliberately frightened out of her cheeks was coming back youre quick to judge kelsey since youve made up your mind we wont waste time discussing fact or fantasy ill take you home chapter seven naomi was tying the belt of her robe when she heard the front door slam surprised by the angry sound she hesitated before going out into the hall was it her place she wondered to question kelsey after an evening out she had no precedent if shed lived through those teenage years with kelsey through the latenight talks the arguments and worries through the triumphs and tragedies of adolescence shed know but she had no guideposts only instincts the sound of kelseys feet rushing up the stairs decided her she opened her own door certain she could keep the whole experience very casual no prying just a quick how was your evening one look at kelseys face erased all intentions what happened before either of them could think she moved forward to take kelseys arms are you all right still revving on temper kelsey went instantly on the attack how can you associate with him much less god you all but asked me to spend the evening with him gabe naomis fingers tightened she trusted gabe implicitly without question but a small female dread curled in her gut what did he do he kissed me kelsey shot back her color flared at the ridiculously lame understatement of what had happened between them kissed you naomi repeated while relief and amusement twined through her and thats it dont you care frustrated kelsey jerked back im telling you he kissed me i kissed him back we were groping at each other and it wouldnt have stopped if i hadnt remembered out of your depth naomi she thought if they couldnt deal as mother to daughter perhaps they could begin as woman to woman come in and sit down i dont want to sit but kelsey followed naomi into the bedroom i do rearranging her thoughts naomi settled on the padded stool of her vanity table kelsey i know you might still be raw from your divorce but you are divorced and free to develop other relationships kelsey stopped her restless pacing and gaped im free this isnt about me its about you me whats wrong with you now there was insult added to temper insult that the woman who shared her blood could be so shallow dont you have any pride actually naomi said slowly ive often been told i have too much but i dont see how that applies at the moment im telling you that your lover wanted to sleep with me and it doesnt apply naomis mouth worked silently before she could get it around the words my lover god knows how you can let him touch you kelsey barreled on youve known him for years and you must see what he is oh hes attractive and he may be charming on the surface but he has no scruples no honor no loyalties naomis eyes flashed her jaw stiffened who are you talking about slater on the edge it was all kelsey could do to keep from screaming gabriel slater how many lovers do you have just one naomi folded her hands and drew a deep breath and you think its gabe after a moments consideration she began to smile then to kelseys astonishment she began to laugh im sorry im sorry im sure this isnt funny to you helpless she pressed a hand to her stomach but its wonderful really im so flattered kelsey spoke through gritted teeth he said the same thing did he chuckling naomi wiped a tear from her eye you mean you actually asked him if he was sleeping with me god kelsey hes in his thirties im nearly fifty what difference does that make she couldnt stop it naomis smile spread like a sunbeam now im really flattered do you actually believe a gorgeous god knows hes gorgeous hotblooded man like gabe would be romantically interested in me she studied naomi as dispassionately as her mood allowed taking in the classic features the slim elegant body in the simple white robe i didnt say anything about romance kelsey said flatly oh naomi nodded struggling to compose herself well now so you assume that gabe and i are what engaged in a hot sexual affair she pursed her lips im feeling younger all the time before you bother to deny it ill say two things head high kelsey looked down at her mother first its none of my business who you sleep with you can have twenty lovers and its none of my concern second i heard you last night in here with him oh naomi blew out air that is awkward awkward the word all but exploded out of her mouth this is awkward realizing she was going to have to be very clear and precise naomi lifted a hand lets handle your statements in order first despite what you think or have been told ive never been promiscuous you may not choose to believe me but your father was my first lover there was no one else until two years after i got out of prison hes been my only lover since she stood so they were eye to eye if thats true its even worse how can you not care that he would cheat on you this way no man would cheat on me more than once naomi said in a tone kelsey not only believed but understood it wasnt gabe you heard in here with me last night kelsey it was moses she couldnt speak it was impossible to ignore the truth when it was slapped so neatly across her face silently she sank to the bench herself moses your trainer yes moses my trainer my friend and my lover but gabe hes always touching you to risk a cliché were very good friends gabe is excepting moses my closest friend im sorry you misunderstood jesus kelsey squeezed her eyes shut as everything shed said rushed back to humiliate her oh jesus no wonder he was so angry the things i said risking rejection naomi brushed a hand over kelseys hair i dont suppose you bothered to ask him no her own words came back to her stinging like bullets no i was so sure and i was so ashamed that hed made me forget myself even for just a minute ive never with wade it was always it doesnt matter she said quickly the point is i jumped in with both feet and said some filthy things to him you were in a difficult position ill call him and explain no ill go over in the morning and apologize facetoface hateful isnt it apologizing almost as bad as being wrong it was always a chore to swallow pride im sorry theres no need where im concerned youve walked into a world filled with strangers kelsey you trusted your instincts whatever you did tonight you did because you have a strong moral code a finely developed sense of right and wrong youre making excuses for me im your mother naomi said quietly maybe well both get used to that in time go get some sleep and if you dont want to face the lion in his den alone tomorrow ill go with you but she went alone it was a matter of selfrespect at first she thought shed drive over but that would be so quick despite lying restless most of the night she had yet to come up with the exact words or tone she wanted to use she decided to ask for a mount and clear both head and nerves with a ride from farm to farm she found moses rubbing liniment over the throat of a roan gelding foolishly she found herself hesitating how did she approach him now that she knew he was naomis lover for the moment she just stood back and watched him his hands were gentle darkly tanned wide at the palm at his wrist he wore a bracelet of hammered copper there was nearly as much gray as black in his braid he had a distinctive face though no one would have called it handsome with its prominent nose and weatherscored skin his body was tough and wiry with little of the lithe muscular grace of gabes hard to figure isnt it there was a touch of amusement in mosess voice he didnt have to turn for kelsey to deduce it would be reflected in his eyes a beautiful woman like her rich classy and a halfbreed runt like me he set the liniment aside and reached for a bowl of watery gruel cant blame you for being surprised surprises me all the time im sorry naomi figured she should let me know she told you about us wincing kelsey rubbed a hand over her face how much more embarrassing could it possibly get mr whitetree moses lets make it moses considering the situation come on boy murmuring he urged the gruel on the gelding try a little now just a little at a time i fell in love with her when i first came to work here as a groom shed have been about eighteen then id never seen anything like her in all my life not that i expected her to look at me twice why should she kelsey watched him nurse the horse saw the kindness the strength the simple sturdiness i think i can see why making the gesture she stepped into the box until they were shoulder to shoulder whats wrong with him king cole heres got laryngitis laryngitis horses get laryngitis how can you tell see here taking her hand moses guided it over the throat you can feel its swollen yes poor thing she made soothing noises as she rubbed gently is it serious can be if its severe the air passage gets blocked and he can choke you mean die alarmed she pressed her cheek to the geldings but its just a sore throat in you in him its different but hes coming along arent you fella he cant take food yet but gruel or some linseed tea tea for a horse kelsey thought shouldnt the vet see him not unless it worsens we keep him warm use eucalyptus inhalations smear camphor on his tongue three four times a day hes not coughing anymore and thats a good sign how much of the doctoring do you do yourself we only call matt in when we cant handle it i thought a trainer trained a trainer does everything sometimes it seems the horses are the least of it you spend a day with me sometime youll see id like that it had been an offhand remark nothing hed expected her to pick up on thoughtful he eyed her i start before dawn i know and you probably dont want me tagging along but i was wondering if there was something i could do while im here muck out stables or clean tack i wouldnt expect to be trusted with the horses but i hate doing nothing her mothers daughter moses mused well theyd see theres always something to do around here when do you want to start this afternoon maybe tomorrow theres something i have to do this morning her mood shifted downward at the thought id rather shovel manure than do it but it cant be avoided come down when youre ready then i appreciate it i wonder is there a riding horse i could borrow this morning i do know how to ride youre naomis daughter that means you know how to ride and you dont have to ask for permission to take a horse id rather ask well saddle up justice then he decided hed suit you the roan gelding liked to run hed been retired for three years but he had never accepted his lowered status as a riding mount he was often used to pony a contender onto the track for the post parade and though he preferred to run he performed his duties with dignity hed never been a champion as moses explained to kelsey but neither had he been common and he had finished steadily in the money throughout his career she didnt care if hed lost every race not when he took her flying over the hills his body running like an oiled engine beneath hers he responded eagerly to the slightest pressure of her knees moving from churning trot to fluid gallop as happy as she to have the morning and the rising fields stretched out before them this was a pleasure she realized shed denied herself for too long and one she wouldnt deny herself again no matter how her muscles might ache later even when she left three willows shed find a way to indulge herself in this one delight maybe shed give up her apartment entirely move out of town there was no reason she couldnt buy a small place of her own and a horse she might have to have it stabled of course but that could be arranged if she absorbed enough from moses she could even work at a stable she gulped in the cool wine of early spring the smell of grass and young growing things why in the world did she ever think she had to stay in an office or gallery hour after hour when she could be outside doing something for the sheer joy of it she shook back her hair and laughed as they sailed over a narrow creek and thundered up a rise then she reined in spotting the spread of buildings below longshot leaning forward she patted justices neck and studied the scene the ride had done her a great deal of good but it hadnt solved the essential problem she still hadnt a clue how to approach gabe so well play it by ear she muttered and clucked justice into a dignified trot gabe saw her come down the rise he stayed where he was by the fence watching a yearling respond to the longe he wasnt any more calm than hed been the evening before nor he realized as she rode closer so slim and straight and golden on the majestic thoroughbred did he want her any less he took another drag on his cigar expelled smoke lazily and waited as she dismounted and walked the gelding toward gabe kelsey supposed she had been more miserable but past miseries never seem as huge as current ones you ride well he commented an old trooper like this takes a steady hand i usually have one if you have a few minutes id like to talk to you go ahead why should he make it easy she asked herself and swallowed another lump of pride privately please fine he took the reins and signaled a groom cool him off kip yes sir kelsey lengthened her stride to keep up as gabe turned away from the stables you have a nice operation here it all looks very similar to three willows want to talk shop no she let the attempt at small talk wither and die i realize youre busy ill try not to take up much of your time then she closed her mouth and said nothing more until he slid open a glass door at the rear of the house it opened into the tropics lushly blooming plants tumbled from pots and basked in the sunlight that streamed through the glass roof a tiled pool glinted in the center ovalshaped and invitingly blue its beautiful she trailed a finger over a flashy red hibiscus i guess we didnt get this far last night continuing the tour didnt seem appropriate he sat on a striped lounge chair and stretched out his legs this is private she watched the smoke curl from the tip of his cigar toward the gently rotating fans suspended from the ceiling i came to apologize nothing absolutely nothing tasted less palatable he merely arched a brow for my behavior last evening as if considering he tapped out his cigar in a silver bucket of sand you demonstrated varied behavior last evening can you be more specific she rose helplessly to the bait youre hateful slater cold arrogant and hateful thats quite an apology kelsey i did apologize i came over here choking on it but i apologized you dont even have the decency to accept it as you pointed out last night im lacking in decency lazily he crossed his ankles im to assume from this sudden turnabout that you confronted naomi and she set you straight her only defense was to angle her chin you could have denied it would you have believed me no infuriated all over again she whirled away from him but you could have denied it you have to be able to see what it felt like to believe what i believed and to find myself what crawling all over you she all but spat the words as she spun around i wont deny it i jumped right into your arms i didnt think couldnt think im not proud of it but i wont pretend it was onesided i have needs too and urges and dammit im not cold he wasnt sure which surprised him most the sudden vehemence of her last statement or the tears glittering in her eyes im the last one youd have to convince of that why in hell would you have to convince yourself appalled she fought back the tears thats not the point she said the point is i made an enormous mistake i said things to you that you didnt deserve and that i regret she dragged both hands through her hair then let them fall god gabe i thought youd been in her room the night before id heard moses he finished she shut her eyes sighed the fools always the last to know i thought it was you and the idea that youd go from her to me that id let you she trailed off again im sorry she looked so lovely the sun gilding her hair regret darkening her eyes he nearly sighed himself you know i really wanted to stay pissed off at you i figured it was going to be easy and christ knows safer he pushed out of the chair you look tired kelsey i had a lousy night me too he reached up to touch her cheek but she stepped back dont okay i feel like an idiot saying it more than an idiot knowing it but im in a vulnerable state right now and you seem to set me off he bit back a groan i appreciate you sharing that with me darling its sure to help me sleep at night dont touch me gabe i might start crawling all over you again she had to smile something like that why dont we start this whole business from the top she offered a hand friends he looked down at her hand then back into her eyes i dont think so watching her he edged closer listen she could already feel the heat moving up from her toes i dont want to get involved its lousy timing for me cautious she took a step back too bad im real pleased with the timing myself im telling you she stepped back again met empty air kelsey caught the grin in his eyes seconds before she hit the water it was pleasantly cool but no less of a shock she surfaced dragging wet hair out of her eyes you bastard i didnt push you thought about it but didnt helpfully he offered a hand to haul her out her eyes lit she grasped it tugged she might as well have pulled at a redwood dont bluff kelsey he simply released her hand and sent her under again this time she took it philosophically and dragged herself over the side sat nice pool i like it he sat crosslegged beside her come back sometime take a real swim i might just do that its almost better in the winter you can feel smug watching the snow fall outside i bet idly she wrung out her hair then flicked water in his face gotcha he merely took her hand pressed the wet palm to his lips and watched her eyes go smoky gotcha he echoed she scrambled up while her heart flailed around in her chest ive got to get back youre wet its warm enough out she resisted barely the urge to retreat again when he unfolded his legs and rose a textbook spring day he wondered if she had any idea how desirable she was flustered with nerves ill drive you back no really i want to ride id almost forgotten how much i enjoy it i want to take advantage of it while im here and she pressed a hand to her jittery stomach oh god ive got to stay away from you not a chance he hooked a finger in the waistband of her jeans and jerked her an inch closer i want you kelsey sooner or later im going to have you she forced a breath in and out maybe he grinned place your bets and released her ill get you a jacket down at the stables she got out fast ten minutes later she was galloping back toward three willows gabe waited until shed disappeared over the first rise before he turned away finelooking filly that the voice was like a twisting knife in his side a sneak attack impossible to defend against but he didnt startle easily gabes face was a neutral mask as he looked at his father not much change he noted rich slater still had style maybe it leaned toward snakeoil salesman but it was style nonetheless he was a big man broad through the shoulders long through the arms his natty gabardine suit was just a little snug around the chest his shoes shone like mirrors and his hair glossily black was trimmed under a snappy gray fedora hed always been striking and had used his looks the stunning blue eyes the quick smile to charm the unwary nearly six years had passed since gabe had seen him but he knew what signs to look for the lines etched deep that no amount of pampering or praying could smooth out the broken capillaries the overbright sparkle in the eye rich slater was exactly as hed been six years earlier and for most of his life drunk what the fuck do you want now is that any way to greet your old man rich laughed heartily and as if gabe had tossed out the red carpet wrapped his arms around his son there was the unmistakable scent of whiskey under the peppermint on his breath it was a combination that had always turned gabes stomach i asked what you wanted just came by to see how you were doing son he slapped gabe on the back before he leaned away he didnt sway didnt totter rich slater could hold his drink he liked to say until the second bottle and there was always a second bottle youve done it this time gabe hit the jackpot no more shooting craps in alleys for you hey son gabe took rich by the arm and pulled him aside how much though his eyes flashed once he feigned hurt now gabe cant a father come visit his own flesh and blood without you thinking im after a handout im doing fine ill have you know built me up a stake out west been playing the horses just like you he laughed again all the while judging and calculating the worth around him but i wouldnt like settling down your way you know me boy got to keep footloose he took out a cigarette snapped a goldplated lighter hed had monogrammed at the mall so who was the sexy blonde always had an eye for the ladies he winked and they always had an eye for you just like your old man even the thought of it had gabes blood boiling how much do you want this time now i told you not a dime not a dime rich thought as he looked toward the near paddock where the yearling was still being worked a man could make a splash with a couple of horses like that a real splash no he didnt want a dime he wanted a great deal more fine horse that i recollect how you used to pay more attention to the horses at the track than the game and whenever he had gabe remembered hed been treated to the back of his fathers big hand i dont have time to discuss my horses with you i have work to do when a man makes a score like youve done here he doesnt need to work or to sweat rich thought bitterly or to hustle for petty cash but im not going to hold you up no indeed thing is im planning on being in the area awhile looking up some old friends he smiled as he blew out smoke since im going to be in the neighborhood i wouldnt say no to spending a few days in that fancy house of yours have a nice visit i dont want you in my house i dont want you on my land richs easy smile dimmed too good for me now are you is that it got yourself all dolled up now and dont want to be reminded where you come from youre an alley cat gabe he jabbed a finger into his sons chest you always will be dont matter if you live in a fine house and fuck fancy women youre still a stray you forget who put a roof over your head food in your belly i havent forgotten sleeping in doorways or going hungry because youd gotten drunk and lost every penny my mother had slaved for he didnt want to remember he hated that the memories dogged him like his own shadow i havent forgotten sneaking out of some stinking room in the middle of the night because we didnt have the rent money theres a lot i havent forgotten she died in a charity ward coughing up blood i havent forgotten that i did my best by your mother your best sucked now how much is it going to cost me to make you disappear i need a place to stay his nerves were taking over bringing a whine to his voice unable to help himself he reached for the flask in his back pocket just for a few days not here nothing about you is going to touch this place christ almighty he took a long drink then another ill tell you straight ive got some trouble a little misunderstanding about a game in chicago i was working it with this other guy and he got sloppy you got caught cheating and now somebodys looking to blow off your kneecaps youre a coldblooded son of a bitch the flask was from the second bottle rich was working through it quickly you owe me and dont you forget it i just need to lay low for a few weeks till it cools off not here youre just going to kick me out let them kill me oh yeah gabe studied his father with a humorless smile but ill give you an even chance five thousand ought to help you go to ground and keep you there rich looked around the farm the welltended buildings the glossy horses he was never too drunk not to calculate his take it isnt enough itll have to be keep away from the house and my horses ill go write you a check rich tipped up the flask again while gabe strode away it wasnt enough he thought as the whiskey turned to bitterness in his blood the boy had hit the big time and all he wanted was a piece of the action and hed get it rich promised himself hed given the boy a chance now theyd play out the game another way chapter eight it was foolish to be nervous yet philip continued to check his watch between sips of white wine kelsey wasnt late he was early it was even more foolish to think she might have changed in some way during the two weeks shed been gone that she might look at him differently somehow or find him lacking as hed found himself lacking when hed watched the woman hed once loved taken away to prison there was nothing he could have done and no matter how many times hed told himself that the words rang hollow the guilt had eaten at him for years soothed only by the care and love hed given his daughter yet even now two decades later he could see naomis face as it had looked the last time hed seen her it was a sixhour drive from washington to alderson west virginia six hours to travel from the tidy civilized world of university life to the gray and bitter reality of a federal facility both were regimented both cloistered for their own purposes but one was fueled by hope and energy the other by despair and anger no matter how hed prepared himself it had been a shock to see naomi vivid arrogantly alive naomi behind the security screen the months between her arrest and her sentencing had taken their toll her body had lost its subtle feminine roundness so shed appeared angular and bony in the shapeless prison uniform everything had been gray her clothes her eyes her face it had taken every ounce of will inside him to meet her silent steady gaze naomi he felt foolish in his suit and tie his starched collar i was surprised you wanted to see me needed to you learn quickly in here that what you want is rarely a consideration she was three weeks into her sentence and for the sake of her sanity had already stopped crossing off days on her mental calendar i appreciate your coming philip i realize you must be dealing with a lot of backlash right now i hope it wont affect your position at the university no he said it flatly i assume your attorneys will appeal im not hopeful she folded her hands linking her fingers tight to keep them from moving hope was another weight on her sanity that shed coldly dispatched i asked you to come here philip because of kelsey he said nothing couldnt one of his deepest fears was that she would ask him to arrange for kelsey to visit to bring his child into this place she had a right he knew in his heart she had a right to see her child and he knew in his heart he would fight her to the last breath to keep kelsey away from the horror of it how is she shes fine shes spending a day or two at my mothers so i could make the trip im sure milicents delighted to have her the sarcasm whipped back into her voice the ache crept back into her heart determined to finish what shed begun naomi banished both i assume you havent explained to her as yet where i am no it seems no she believes youre visiting someone far away for a while well a ghost of a smile flitted around her mouth i am far away arent i naomi shes only a child however unfair he would use her love for kelsey i havent found the right way to tell her i hope in time to im not blaming you naomi interrupted she leaned closer the shadows under her eyes mocking him im not blaming you she repeated for any of this what happened to us philip i cant see where it all started to go wrong ive tried i think if i could pinpoint one thing one time one event it would be so much easier to accept everything that happened after but i cant she squeezed her eyes shut waiting until she was sure she could speak without a tremor in her voice i cant see what went wrong but i can see so many things that went right kelsey especially kelsey i think of her all the time pity the overwhelming weight of it smothered him she asks about you naomi looked away then around the drab visiting room someone nearby was weeping but tears were as much a part of this place as the air she studied the walls the guards the locks especially the locks i dont want her to know im here it wasnt what hed expected from her off balance he fumbled between gratitude and protest naomi ive thought this through very carefully philip i have plenty of time to think now i dont want her to know they took away everything and put me in a cage she drew a deep steadying breath it wont take long for the scandal to die down ive been out of your circle for nearly a year as it is memories are short by the time she goes to school i doubt therell be much more than a murmur if that about what happened in virginia that may be but it hardly deals with now i cant just tell her youve disappeared naomi and expect her to accept it she loves you tell her im dead my god naomi i cant do that you can suddenly intense she pressed a hand to the security screen for her sake you can listen to me do you want her to visualize her mother in a place like this locked up for murder of course i dont want it she cant be expected to understand much less cope with it at her age but but naomi agreed her eyes were alive again passionate burning in a few years shell understand and shell have to live with it if i can do anything for her philip i can spare her from that think she insisted think she could be eighteen by the time i get out all her life shell have pictured me here would she feel obligated to come here herself to see me i dont want her here the tears came then breaking through the dam of selfcontrol i cant bear it even the thought of her coming here seeing me like this what would it do to her how would it damage her i tell you i wont take that chance let me protect her from this philip dear god let me do this one last thing for her he reached out so that their fingertips met through the iron mesh i cant stand to see you in here could any of us bear to see her sit where you are no he couldnt but to tell her youre dead we cant predict what that would do to her or how any of us would live with the lie not so big a lie she drew her fingers back stemmed the tears part of me is dead the rest wants to survive quite desperately wants to survive i dont think i could if she knew shell be hurt philip shell grieve but youll be there for her in a few years shell barely remember me then she wont remember me at all can you live with that ill have to i wont contact her or interfere in any way i wont ask you to visit me here again nor will i see you if you come ill be dead to her and to you she braced herself their time was almost up i know how much you love her and the kind of man you are youll give her a good life a happy one dont scar it by making her face this please promise me and when youre released well deal with that when it happens ten to fifteen years philip its a long time yes it made his stomach knot to imagine it what he thought would it do to a child all right naomi for kelseys sake thank you she rose then fighting nausea goodbye philip naomi but she walked straight to the guard through the door that clanged shut behind her she hadnt looked back dad kelsey put her hand on philips shoulder and gave it a little shake what century are you in flustered he rose kelsey i didnt see you come in you wouldnt have seen a fleet of mack trucks come in she kissed him drew back then with a laugh kissed him again its good to see you let me look at you did she seem happier he wondered more settled the thought caused a quick ungenerous tugofwar inside him i cant have changed that much in two weeks just tell me if you feel as good as you look i feel great she slipped into a chair and waited for him to settle across from her the country air i suppose someone elses cooking and manual labor labor youre working on the farm only in the most menial of capacities she smiled up at the waitress a glass of champagne nothing else for me thank you philip looked back at his daughter are you celebrating pride took his race at santa anita today kelsey was still flushed with pleasure at the win i muck out his stall when hes at three willows so i feel some part of responsibility for the victory in may virginias pride is going to take the derby she winked thats a sure thing philip sipped his wine hoping it would open his throat i didnt realize youd become so involved with the horses theyre wonderful she took the glass the waitress set in front of her lifted it in a toast to pride the most gorgeous male ive ever seen on four legs anyway she let the bubbles explode on her tongue so tell me how is everyone i thought candace would be with you i suppose she understood that i wanted you to myself for a couple of hours she sends her love of course and channing he has a new girl of course he does what happened to the philosophy major he claimed she talked him to death he met this one at a party she designs jewelry and wears black sweaters shes a vegetarian that ought to last about five minutes channing cant go much longer than that without a burger candace is certainly counting on that she finds victoria thats her name unsettling well kelsey opened her menu and skimmed she wouldnt find anyone settling right now where channings concerned hes still her baby the most difficult thing any parent ever does is to let go thats why most of us just dont he covered her hand with his ive missed you i havent really gone anywhere i wish you wouldnt worry so much old habit kelsey he tightened his grip on her hand i asked you to have dinner with me for a couple of reasons im not sure you wont find one of them unpleasant but i felt youd prefer to hear it from me she stiffened you said everyone was all right yes its about wade kelsey hes announced his engagement he felt her hand go limp apparently its to be a small wedding in a month or two i see odd she thought that there should still be so much emotion to swirl and collide inside her well that was quick work she hissed out a breath annoyed by the edginess of her own tone stupid of me to resent it even for a minute human id say however long you were separated the divorce is barely final that was just a paper i know that the marriage ended in atlanta more than two years ago she picked up her glass considered the wine bubbling inside i was going to be civilized and wish him the best nope she drank deeply i hope she makes his life hell now i think ill try the blackened redfish i feel like something with a little bite to it are you going to be all right im going to be fine i am fine she closed her menu after theyd given their order she found herself smiling at her father were you afraid id throw a tantrum i thought you might need a shoulder to cry on i can always use your shoulder dad but im finished crying over whats done maybe working really working for a livings changing my outlook youve been working for years kelsey since you graduated from high school ive been playing at jobs for years none of them mattered to me and this does mucking out stalls matters to you the snap in his voice warned her she chose her words carefully i suppose i feel a part of a system there its not simply one race or one horse theres a continuity and everyone has a part in it some of its tedious some of its rushed and its all repetitive but every morning its new i cant explain it and he would never understand it all he knew at that moment was that she sounded so much like naomi im sure its exciting for you different it is but its also soothing and demanding might as well get it done she told herself and she continued quickly im thinking of giving up my apartment giving it up and what moving permanently to three willows not necessarily why did it have to hurt him she wondered then sighed why had it hurt her to hear wade was about to remarry that hasnt been discussed but ive been giving some thought to moving out to the country i like seeing trees out of my window dad seeing land instead of the next building and i enjoy very much what im doing now id like to keep doing it see if im good at it naomis influencing you kelsey you cant let these kinds of impulses seduce you into rushing from one way of life to another you cant possibly understand the world youre toying with after so short a time no i cant claim to understand it fully but i want to she held back as their salads were served and i want to understand her you cant expect me to walk away from her until i do im not asking you to walk away but i am asking you not to leap in without considering all the consequences theres more than the romance of a horse at dawn or that last gallop over the finish line theres ruthlessness cruelty ugliness violence and its as much a part of who i am as the smell of books in the university library why its kelsey isnt it naomis lovely daughter bill cunningham sauntered over a drink from the lounge in one hand his diamond horseshoe winking on the other no mistaking that face perfect timing she thought and forced a smile hello bill dad this is bill cunningham an associate of naomis bill my father philip byden why ill be goddamned its been years bill stuck out a hand dont believe ive seen you since the day you snatched naomi out from under my nose teacher arent you yes with the coolness he reserved for careless students philip nodded im a professor at georgetown university big time bill grinned laying a hand on kelseys shoulder for a quick intimate squeeze you got yourself a real beauty here phil its a pure pleasure seeing her around the track heard your mamas top threeyearold outdistanced the field at santa anita today yes were very pleased things are going to shake down different in kentucky dont let her talk you into laying your paycheck on three willows colt phil ive got me the winner you give your mama a kiss for me honey ive got to get back to the bar little meeting as he walked away kelsey picked up her salad fork and began to eat with every appearance of interest thats the kind of person you want to associate with dad you sound like grandmother standards kelsey never lower your standards but philip didnt smile dad the mans an idiot very similar to the pompous blustering idiots ive run into at the university in advertising at galleries you cant escape them i remember him philip said stiffly there were rumors that he bribed jockeys to lose or to deliberately force another horse into the rail she frowned and shoved the salad aside so add sleazy to pompous and blustering hes still an idiot and not someone i intend to cultivate a friendship with he runs in the same circle as your mother parallel lanes perhaps theres a great deal i dont know about her or trust about her at this point but i do know that three willows is more than a farm to her the horses more than business assets its her life it always was im sorry kelsey reached out helplessly to take his hands im sorry that she hurt you im sorry that what im doing now has brought all that hurt back im asking you to trust me to look at the whole to make my own choices i need a goal in my life dad i may have found it he was afraid she had and that when she reached it he would no longer recognize her just promise me youll take more time kelsey dont commit to anything or to anyone without more time all right she hesitated you havent asked about her i was working up to it philip admitted i wanted your impressions she seems very young she has this incredible well of energy ive seen her start at dawn and keep going until after dark naomi loved to socialize im speaking of work kelsey corrected she never socializes at least she hasnt since ive been there to tell you the truth with all the work i dont see how anyone would have the strength left to party shes usually in bed before ten no point she thought in mentioning that naomi wasnt always sleeping alone shes very controlled very contained naomi controlled contained yes she paused waiting while their entrées were served i take it she wasnt always but thats exactly how id describe her now how do you feel about her i dont know im grateful she isnt forcing the issue you surprise me patience was never part of her makeup i suppose people can change i may not understand her but i do admire her she knows what she wants and she works for it and what does she want im not sure kelsey murmured but she is from the shadows of the bar cunningham watched kelsey and her father talk over their meal a pretty picture he thought all dignity and class he rattled the ice in his bourbon quite a looker rich slater said from beside him something familiar about her he laughed carefully pacing himself with his own drink it wouldnt do to muddle his thinking just now i guess theres something familiar about all beautiful young women after a man passes a certain age naomi chadwicks daughter spitting image of her naomi chadwick richs eyes gleamed with pleasure and with bitter memory he was here after all to dredge up memories and to profit by them theres a filly a man doesnt forget my sons neighbor now small world he enjoyed another swallow of whiskey quality stuff since cunningham was buying you know i think i saw her around the boys place a couple of weeks ago hed have his eye on her if i know gabe hes been cozy with the mother guess it follows hed be cozy with the daughter and gabe slater wouldnt have had the chance to be cozy with either cunningham thought now if it hadnt been for a hand of cards things would be different things were going to be different if he plays his cards right cunningham continued picking at his own scab he could erase the border between the farms rich eyed kelsey with more interest so his son was making time with the ice bitchs daughter that would be something he could use now wouldnt that be something that kind of merger would make them the top outfit in the state id say it might cunningham lifted one finger signaling another round wouldnt care for it myself id just as soon see that connection shaken a bit he reached into the nut bowl popped three into his mouth casual he told himself keep it casual it wouldnt do for rich slater to know just how much he was banking on the deal now this business were talking about it might just accomplish that in the long term calculating rich admired the diamond ring on cunninghams finger and would that extra benefit be worth an appropriate bonus it would well now well just see what we can do about that he shot kelsey another look well just see what we can do im going to need those traveling expenses billy boy reaching inside his jacket cunningham took out an envelope he slipped it into richs eager hands under the bar the unsettling sense of déjà vu had him glancing over his shoulder count it later no need no need at all you and me go back a ways billy i trust you once the envelope was safely tucked away he lifted his glass again and may i say its a pleasure doing business with you again heres to old times by noon the next day kelsey was concentrating on her lesson on the longe line the fiveyearold mare on the other end was patient and knew a great deal more about the process than she did it wasnt the horse being trained but kelsey bring her to a trot change her direction moses demanded the girl had potential hed decided she wanted to learn therefore she would shell do anything you want you get a yearling in there he wont be so accommodating then give me a yearling she called back and flipped her whip i can handle it keep dreaming but perhaps in a few weeks hed assign her one if she was still around she had good hands he mused a good voice quick reflexes how long has she been at it naomi asked about thirty minutes naomi rested a boot on the lowest fence rail both kelsey and the mare still look fresh theyve both got stamina i appreciate your taking the time to teach her moses its no hardship except i think shes got her eye on my job she laughed then saw he wasnt quite joking do you really think shes that interested in training every time i spend an hour with her i feel like a sponge thats been wrung dry the girl never quits asking questions i made the mistake of giving her one of my breeding books a few days ago when she came back with it she all but gave me a goddamned quiz pumped me about blood factors dominant and codominant alleles did you pass just i used to watch you do this grinning he tugged on his earlobe ah the fantasies a man without fantasies is a man without a soul i had a hell of a soul where you were concerned you still do ill prove it to you later here comes matt i didnt know youd sent for the vet i didnt naomi ran her tongue around her teeth he said he was in the neighborhood and thought hed stop in to check out that case of sore shins moses glanced back at kelsey ah the fantasies he thought again yeah right smothering a laugh naomi welcomed the vet well matt whats the verdict shes doing fine a blisters not necessary nice of you to take the time to stop by moses commented i was over at longshot one of his colts was injured serious naomi asked could have been a puncture it was small easily overlooked there was a lot of infection he kept his eyes on kelsey as he spoke admiring i had to lance it too bad jamison said the horse was supposed to ship off to hialeah tomorrow three aces instantly sympathetic naomi laid a hand on matts arm gabe was going down with him that horse has been running like a dream theyll both be staying home for now ill give gabe a call later try to cheer him up he could use it matt switched his attention back to kelsey everyone seems healthy around here when kelsey acknowledged him with a quick wave he grinned she looks like shes been doing that all her life when moses took pity on him and signaled kelsey to stop she walked the horse over to the fence shes so sweetnatured she rubbed her cheek against the mares i wish youd give me a brat moses so i could feel i was accomplishing something all journeys begin with one step well see how many more you take before you trip hes always boosting my confidence she tipped back the cotton cap she wore well matt is this a professional or a social visit a mix i had to stop in at longshot oh as casually as possible kelsey led the mare out of the paddock problem an injury he repeated his explanation but three aces looked wonderful the last time i saw him run when did it happen from the look of it three or four days ago he ran at charles town three days ago won by a full length frowning she stroked the mare a puncture about the size of a sixpenny nail just above the fetlock how does that happen could have happened in transport some sharp edge thats likely unlikely it was deliberate you mean that someone might have injured the colt so he couldnt run or worse unlikely matt repeated it wasnt that serious how do you treat it she listened carefully as he spoke of lancing and antiseptics the difference between punctures and tears see what i mean moses muttered to naomi shell be cramming veterinary books next his eyes narrowed as he looked toward the stables expecting anyone no naomi pursed her lips and studied the young man approaching lean narrowshouldered pretty face levis and a sweatshirt ordinary enough she mused but the boots gave him away they would have cost a cool three hundred anyone know the cowboy hmm curious kelsey turned then let out a shout of pleasure channing she raced forward cracking matts heart when she threw her arms around the young man what are you doing here thought id check the place out before i head down to lauderdale spring break havent you outgrown that yet outgrown girls in bikinis i dont think so man look at you you look like an ad for country living he slung an arm around her shoulders and glanced at the trio by the fence dont tell me thats your mother thats naomi come on ill introduce you she kept her arm around his waist channing this is naomi chadwick moses whitetree and matt gunner channing osborne my stepbrother welcome to three willows naomi extended a hand amused and charmed when channing brought it to his lips kelseys told me about you only the good parts i hope youve got a great place here thanks well give you a tour i hope you can stay awhile im loose unable to resist he reached over the fence to stroke a hand down the mares nose just heading down to florida for a week or so to ogle coeds kelsey put in channings in premed so he calls it anatomy lessons he grinned and reached up to scratch the mares ears hey youth is fleeting ask anyone am i breaking something up not at all naomi assured him youre just in time for lunch matt youll join us wont you wish i could ive got to get over to the bartlett farm one of their foals is colicky hey youre a vet channing perked up i always thought it would be cool to treat animals they dont complain as much as people right he added quickly when kelsey shot him a surprised look theres that but people dont generally bite and kick ill take a rain check naomi thanks kelsey good to see you again nice to meet you ill walk you up kelsey bring channing along when youre ready if i know you youre ready now want to take that tour after you eat sounds good to me i didnt know you were interested in animal medicine he shrugged embarrassed just in passing its a kid thing they began to walk slowly i remember you wanting to save birds when they bashed into the picture window and that old fleabag mutt you brought home one time with the limp yeah he smiled but the humor didnt reach his eyes mom put the skids on that off to the pound i guess he walked the last mile on three legs id forgotten that she laid her head against his shoulder she was afraid hed turn he must have been a hundred years old he wasnt a pureblood channing corrected then shrugged no big deal she could never handle animals around the house with her allergies besides like i said it was a kid thing why hadnt she ever heard that resigned tone in his voice before she wondered maybe she hadnt listened to it do you want to be a doctor channing family tradition he said easily i never thought about being anything else oh except for an astronaut when i was six osborne men are surgeons and thats that candace would never push you into doing something if she knew your heart wasnt in it with a half laugh channing stopped and looked at her kels you were eighteen when they got married and you had one foot out the door mom runs things she does it subtly and she does it well but me and the prof we pretty much do what were told youre angry with her over something what is it hell she yanked the allowance from my trust fund because i balked at taking a full course load this summer i wanted to work you know get a taste of the real world i had a construction gig lined up you know so i could wear a hard hat and make rude kissy noises at the secretaries who walked by at lunchtime i just wanted a couple of months away from the books that sounds reasonable enough maybe if i talk to her for you no shes not too happy with you at the moment either this business he said gesturing to encompass the farm she sees it as a strain on the prof the magnificent milicent is feeding that little neurosis kelsey blew out a breath so were in the same boat listen are you really set on lauderdale and bikinis if youre about to suggest that i go home kiss and make up no i was going to suggest that you spend spring break here i dont think naomi would object if you hung out with me and the horses playing big sister yeah got a problem with it no he leaned down and kissed her forehead thanks kels chapter nine the grooms name was mick hed been born and bred in virginia and liked to boast that hed forgotten more about horses than most people ever learned it might have been true certainly throughout his fiftyodd years as a racetracker hed tried every aspect of the game in the early years hed risen from stableboy to exercise boy he often boasted of how hed gotten up on horses for mr cunningham during the mans heyday before hed hit twenty hed still been small and light enough to jockey though hed never moved from apprentice to journeyman hed worn the silks he didnt like people to forget it for a short unmemorable time hed bluffed his way into the trainers position at a small farm in florida hed even owned a gelding for a year or at least fifteen percent of one maybe the horse had never lived up to his potential proving himself to be nothing more than a morning glory who worked out fast and raced slow but mick had been an owner and that was the important thing hed come back to cunninghams when hed heard the farm had changed hands his position as groom satisfied him particularly since gabriel slater had the look of a winner and always had in micks memory he enjoyed the fact that the younger hands often deferred to him they might have called him peacock behind his back because he always sported a bright blue cap and tended to strut but it was done with affection his thin lined face was known at every track from santa anita to pimlico that was just the way mick wanted it tracks slow boggs commented and meticulously rolled a cigarette mick nodded the hard morning rain had tapered off to an incessant drizzle and that was fine slaters double or nothing shone on a muddy track it was the slow time between workout and post mick sat under an overhang watching the rain drip from the eaves and thinking about the ten dollars burning a hole in his pocket he figured to put it on doubles nose and watch it grow he pulled out a crumpled pack of marlboros to join boggs in a smoke it was quiet the jockeys would be in their quarters or taking a steam to sweat off one more pound before post time the trainers would be poring over the books and the owners huddled inside enjoying the dry warmth and coffee there was little activity around the shedrow but it would liven up again soon funny seeing miss naomis girl around mick said conversationally she rode over to longshot a couple of weeks ago rode off again soaking wet boggs nodded blew out smoke heard she was up on that roan gelding of yours handled him fine rides like her mother makes a picture they sat two lifelong bachelors and smoked in silence a full five minutes passed before mick spoke again somebody else came by the barn that day yeah boggs wouldnt ask who it wasnt the way they communicated havent seen him around for a while but i recognized him all right he tossed the minute stub of his cigarette into a puddle and watched it sizzle out forgot his connection with the man till i seen them together hit me then all right i remember when mr slater was working as a stableboy for mr cunningham yep about fifteen years ago came over to three willows after stayed a time year or two hard worker didnt chew your ear off still doesnt say nothing less its supposed to be said always was a loner he chuckled a bit never did think id be working for him made something of himself that he did lots wouldnt think he coulda done it the way he used to hang around and hustle up card games just another track rat theyd figure but i knew different always liked the boy myself boggs rubbed at a bruise on his forearm where a yearling had nipped him had a look about him still does yeah i was there the day lipsky tried to stick him didnt say no more than he had to then either boggs spat on the wet ground more an assessment of lipsky than out of necessity mans got no business being drunk and handling a stud thats the truth mick fell silent again thought idly about lighting up another smoke mr slater hes got no use for drunks i forgot how his father used to slide into the bottle till i saw him round the barn that day rich slater boggss interest perked up he came around longshot thats what im telling you the day miss naomis girl rode off wet had himself all polished up like a bible salesman to better enjoy the relay of information mick decided to indulge in that second smoke they talked for a little bit couldnt hear what mr slater had to say no reading that boys face either gamblers eyes hes got he chuffed out smoke then inhaled deeply secure in his old friends interest you could hear the old man though alaughing and ajawing about how he was in the money and hed just come by to see how his boy was doing come by to soak him more likely gotta figure it didnt like the way he was looking round the place like he was adding up figures on a computer polly had a yearling on the longe inside straight mr slater named him that pollys got fine hands she does she does boggs agreed seeing nothing odd about micks circuitous story he nodded a greeting to one of the track grooms as the man passed a good yearling manager might be moses is grooming miss kelsey for that at three willows old chips talking about retiring again always is just blowing smoke so mick rounded back to his point mr slater he goes on up to the house old rich he hangs around sipping outta his flask silver one shiny he corners jamison for a while pumping him i figure then mr slater he comes back gives the old man a check and boots him out subtlelike but he gave him the boot for all that never had much use for rich slater me neither some say the apple it dont fall far from the tree but with these two i figure it took a long roll hes got class mr slater does and he listens when you tell him something asks me the other day what i might think about that puncture in three aces foreleg thats a good horse he is that so i tell mr slater it dont look like no accident to me he just looks and he thanks me real politelike he rose bones creaking im gonna take me a look at double i think ill get me some coffee they parted mick wandering into the gloom of the stables the rain drummed on the roof muffling the sounds of horses shifting in their boxes another groom was adjusting a blanket on a filly mick stopped a moment studying the lines a little widefronted he decided the filly would probably paddle no problem like that with double he was an even sixteen hands high pure black with wellsloped shoulders and a short strong body that had plenty of heart room most of all double had courage mick sauntered back toward the box he liked to give double a little pep talk before a race and to look into the colts eyes and see if it was a day to put a bet down well now boy we called out some rain just for you mick opened the box door and scowled what the hell you doing in here lipsky you got no business around mr slaters horse lipsky remained crouched and eyed mick as he ran a hand up and down doubles leg just taking a look thought i might lay down a bet you go ahead and do that but you clear out im going im going lipsky angled his body away but micks eyes were keen what the hell you doing with that in one fierce move mick clamped a hand on lipskys arm the knife glinted thinbladed and bright in the dim light you bastard going to cut him were you i wasnt going to hurt him wary lipsky shifted his eyes over the door of the box there wasnt much time i was just going to fix it so he wouldnt race today or ever he thought once hed severed a tendon slaters got it coming you got what you had coming mick corrected and nobody messes with my horses you lowlife you did three aces too dont know what youre talking about look it was a bad idea no harm done though you can see for yourself i never touched him ill take a look all right now well go see what mr slater wants done about this lipsky jerked back furious that the scrawny old man had such an iron grip you aint turning me in the hell i aint im turning you in and you put a mark on this colt ill spit on your grave if mr slater decides to kill you i aint touched his fucking horse desperate lipsky struck out as the two men began to grapple double danced nervously to the side the knife sliced through the air and deflected by micks forearm the point nipped across the colts flank shocked by the pain double reared mick cursed and drew in the breath to shout then there was no air at all as the blade plunged in just above his belt jesus as stunned as his opponent lipsky yanked the blade free and stared at the spreading blood jesus christ mick i didnt mean to stick you bastard mick managed he stumbled forward just as the colt aroused and terrified by the scent of blood reared a hoof caught mick at the base of the skull after one bright flash of pain he felt nothing even when he fell face forward and the colts thrashing hooves trampled him panic nearly had lipsky racing from the box but he held on cowering in the corner it wasnt his fault he told himself hell he wasnt no murderer hed never have pulled a knife on old mick especially seeing as he was stonecold sober if mick had just listened it wouldnt have happened wiping his fist across his sweaty mouth he backed toward the door he eased the bloody knife into his boot before slipping silently out of the box back hunched he hurried out into the rain he needed a drink this is great channing stood in the wet grandstands eating a hot dog i mean he said through a mouthful whod have thought there was so much to it its been like watching rehearsals for some hot broadway play charmed by him naomi smiled if she could have handpicked a sibling for her daughter it would have been channing osborne im sorry we couldnt provide better weather hey it just adds to the drama horses thundering through the rain colors flying mud spewing he grinned and washed down the hot dog with coke i cant wait well it wont be long now kelsey assured him in fact they must be about ready to prep the horses for the post parade you want to go take a look sure its really nice of you to let me hang out naomi im just glad you chose us over sun sand and bikinis this is better in a gesture she found charming he offered her his arm when i get back next week i can brag to all my sunburned hungover pals how i juggled two gorgeous women what about the vegetarian kelsey asked him who victoria his grin was quick and careless she dumped me when she realized i was an unconvertible carnivore very shortsighted of her naomi decided thats what i said im a prize right kels he glanced down at his stepsister and saw that her attention was focused elsewhere well well he thought studying gabe he hadnt seen that look in kelseys eyes for a long long time somebody you know hmmm oh distracted she reached up to adjust the brim of her cap just a neighbor gabe broke off his conversation with jamison and turned to watch them approach damn the woman looked good wet he shifted his gaze from her to the man with his arm around her shoulder too young to be competition he decided he doubted if the guy was old enough to buy beer but there was a territorial sense in the drape of the arm and a look in the eyes that was a combination of curiosity and warning the stepbrother gabe concluded and he stepped forward to meet them havent you dried off yet he said to kelsey and watched the vague annoyance flit over her face its a new day slater this is channing osborne gabriel slater its nice you could pay your sister a visit i thought so it amused gabe that channing increased his grip several unnecessary degrees for the handshake hows the mare naomi ive been meaning to come by and take a look myself shes definitely in foal and healthy i heard about three aces when matt stopped by yesterday is he healing well gabes thoughts darkened but his eyes remained placid yeah hell be back in top form in a few weeks youve got double or nothing running today dont you gabe looked back at kelsey because he wanted to touch her and to irritate her he skimmed a knuckle down her cheek keeping track of the competition darling you could say that your colts running head to head with ours want another side bet you still owe me ten fine in the spirit of things well say double or nothing youre on want to take a look at the winner ive already seen virginias pride thanks he grinned took her hand come on as he tugged her away channing frowned has that been going on long im beginning to think so looking after them naomi rubbed her wet nose does it worry you she took the whole divorce thing hard i dont want somebody taking advantage of that how much do you know about him quite a bit really naomi sighed ill fill you in later now i suppose well go with them so you can stop worrying good idea he glanced down at her as they walked into the barn youre okay naomi pleased she took his hand so are you channing you know i want to whip your butt out on the track slater but i am sorry about three aces i dont suppose theres anything i can do but fallen for them havent you kelsey tipped up her brim to get a better look at him for who the horses she shrugged and continued to walk toward the rear of the stables so what if i have it looks good on you the way it softens you up deliberately he slowed her down he wanted another moment before they reached the box when are you coming back she didnt pretend to misunderstand him but she did choose to evade ive been busy moses gives us a lot to do would you rather i came to you no edgy she glanced over her shoulder naomi and channing were only a few paces behind no she repeated and this isnt the time to discuss it do you think your brother would go for my throat if i scooped you up and kissed you right here certainly not dignity was failing her but i might youre tempting me kelsey instead he brought her hand to his lips tonight he murmured i want to see you tonight ive got company gabe channings visiting tonight gabe repeated you come to me or i come to you your choice he stopped at the box keeping her hand in his hello boy ready to he trailed off as he spotted the line of blood still red and fresh against the black coat goddammit he yanked open the door and had hardly taken a step inside before he saw the body crumpled in the bedding stay back without looking he flung out an arm to block kelsey what happened to him the poor things bleeding focused on the colt she pressed forward when gabe was forced to snatch at the halter to keep the horse from rearing she saw the form sprawled in the bloody hay oh god oh my god gabe hold him snapping out the order gabe wrapped kelseys limp fingers around the halter what is it alarmed by the pallor of kelseys cheeks naomi surged forward the breath hissed between her teeth ill call an ambulance she pressed her hand over kelseys can you handle this kelsey blinked nodded then cleared her throat yes yes im all right but she was squeamish enough to keep her back to what lay in the corner of the box oh man channing swallowed hard then put himself between kelsey and gabe who crouched over the body im only premed he said quietly and squatted down but maybe it took only one close look to realize that he could have been as skilled and experienced a surgeon as his father had been and he would still have been helpless there was blood everywhere pools of it coagulating in the stained hay the gouge in the back of the skull had welled with it a bright blue cap now streaked with red lay partially under the bedding that horse must have gone crazy channing said grimly kelsey get out of here get away from him no ive got him fighting to keep her breath even she stroked the colts neck hes shaking hes terrified dammit he just killed this guy no he didnt gabes voice was low and hard hed gently rolled mick over the grooms pulledup shirt exposed a vicious stab wound in the abdomen but somebody did later kelsey stood shivering in the drizzle trying to pretend she was drinking the coffee channing had pressed on her you should get away from here he said again let me take you home or at least inside the clubhouse no im all right i need to wait that poor man she looked away out into the shedrow it didnt seem energetic or glamorous now it was simply muddy dreary people were gathered in tight little groups eyeing the barn waiting gabes been in there a long time with the police he can handle himself he glanced over to where naomi sat on a barrel under an overhang maybe you should go over with your mother she looks really spooked kelsey stared at the entrance to the barn she wanted to be in there to hear what was being said to know what was being done gabe and i found him she murmured i feel like i should help then go help naomi kelsey let out a long breath all right youre right but it was hard to walk over to face that blank look in naomis eyes here she held out her untouched coffee brandyd be better but i dont have any handy thanks naomi accepted the cup and forced herself to sip it had nothing to do with her she reminded herself again the police wouldnt come they wouldnt take her away this time poor mick did you know him very well hes been around a long time she sipped again no it didnt have that slapping warmth of brandy but it helped he and boggs played gin rummy once a week gossiping like little old ladies i guess mick knew as much about my horses as he knew about gabes he was loyal she drew in a shaky breath and he was harmless i dont know who could have done this to him the police will find out after a moments hesitation she laid a hand on naomis shoulder do you want me to take you home no naomi reached up covered her daughters hand with hers they both realized it was the first time theyd touched without reservation im sorry kelsey this is a horrible experience for you for all of us i would have spared you from it she looked up her eyes meeting kelseys im not much good under these circumstances then ill have to be kelsey turned her hand so that their fingers meshed naomis were stiff with cold youre going home she said firmly the police may want to talk to me so channing will take you i dont want to leave you here alone im not alone gabes here and moses boggs she glanced over to where the old man stood alone in the rain grieving its pointless for you to stay when youre so upset you go home take a hot bath and lie down ill come up as soon as i get back she softened her tone leaned closer and i dont want channing here hed feel as if he was doing some manly act if he took you away that was a nice touch hating herself for the weakness naomi rose all right ill go my being around a crime scene only causes more speculation in any case but please dont stay any longer than you have to i wont dont worry alone kelsey settled down on the barrel her mother had vacated and prepared to wait it didnt take long a uniformed officer stepped outside scanned the groups of people and focused in on her miss byden kelsey byden yes the lieutenant would like to speak with you inside all right she ignored the speculative looks and slid off the barrel inside the routine of death was already under way the last police photos had been taken the yellow tape cordoning off the far end of the barn was in place gabes eyes blazed once when he spotted her i told you there was no need for her to be here you both found the body mr slater lieutenant rossi stepped over the tape and nodded to kelsey he was a twentyyear veteran of the force with a craggy handsome face and sharp cops eyes his hair dark and thick and streaked with dignified gray was only one of his many vanities his body was a temple fueled with vitamins health juices and a stringent lowfat diet and honed by exercise he might spend most of his time behind a desk with a phone at his ear but it didnt mean he had to go to seed he loved his work and thrived on procedure and he hated murder ms byden i appreciate your waiting i want to cooperate good you could start by telling me exactly what happened this morning you were here since dawn thats right she told him everything from unloading the horses through the morning workouts we stayed down at the track awhile it was my stepbrothers first trip and we decided that he might like to watch the horses being prepped for post time and that would have been about what time close to noon things are quiet between about ten and noon we walked up here from the track and ran into gabe he was in the shedrow talking to his trainer she glanced over rossis shoulder to look for him and saw with dull horror the shiny plastic bag being carried out on a stretcher cursing under his breath gabe ducked beneath the tape and blocked her view this doesnt have to be done now and certainly not here no its all right gamely kelsey swallowed her nausea id rather get it over with i appreciate that so you ran into mr slater just outside here yes we talked for a few minutes ragged each other because we had a horse running in the same race i came in with gabe to look at his colt my mother and stepbrother were a little behind us your mother yes it was actually her horse that was to run against gabes she owns three willows naomi chadwick chadwick it rang a distant bell rossi jotted it down so the four of you came in yes but they were behind us a bit they didnt get to the box until after after we did i guess gabe and i saw the wound on the colts left flank at the same time he went in and stopped tried to block me but i was worried about the colt so i followed behind him i saw the blood and the body in the corner i held the horses head because he was starting to rear and channing and naomi came up she went right away to call an ambulance and channing went into the box thinking i suppose that he might be able to help i thought i suppose we all thought for a moment that the horse had done it until gabe turned the body over and we saw she would never forget what shed seen we saw he hadnt gabe told channing to call the police and there was no one around the stall when you and mr slater came in no i didnt see anyone some of the grooms were inside of course but it was still a little early for prepping did you know the deceased ms byden no but ive only been at three willows for a few weeks you dont live there no i live in maryland im just spending a month or so there ill need your permanent address for the record then when she gave it to him he slipped his pad back into his pocket i appreciate your time ms byden id like to talk to your mother and your stepbrother now i had channing take her home she was very upset in an unconscious move kelsey shifted her stance placing her feet a bit wider straightening her shoulders in any case they were both with me all morning neither of them could have seen anything i didnt youd be surprised what one person sees that another doesnt thank you he dismissed her by turning back to gabe my information is that a man named boggs might have been the last person to see the victim alive does he also work for you he works for three willows hes outside kelsey informed rossi ill tell him to come in she hurried out eager to be away from the flatvoiced questions and shrewd eyes boggs was where shed seen him last simply standing in the rain theres a lieutenant rossi who wants to speak to you she took his hands vainly trying to warm them between hers im so sorry boggs we was just talking just sitting over there and talking we had a card game on for tonight tears streamed down his face along with the rain whoda done that to him miss kelsey whoda done old mick that way i dont know boggs come on ill go in with you she slipped her arm around him and guided him back toward the barn he dont have no family miss kelsey a sister but he hadnt seen her in moren twenty years ive got to take care of things for him see that he gets buried proper ill take care of it boggs gabe stepped outside intercepting them before they entered you tell me what you want him to have and well arrange it boggs nodded it was only right he thought high of you mr slater i thought high of him come and see me as soon as youre able well set everything up heda appreciated it head bowed boggs walked inside the lieutenant says youre free to go gabe took kelseys arm and steered her away ill take you home i should wait for boggs he shouldnt be alone now moses will see to him i want you out of here kelsey away from it i cant be im as close to it as you are youre wrong he half dragged her across the muddy shedrow the box is mine the colt is mine and dammit mick was mine slow down she dug in her heels and managed to grab him by the jacket he might have shown little more than a flare or two of emotion inside the barn but he was on slow burn now and ready for flash point no cool gamblers eyes now she thought they were hot and lethal youre getting out of here now and youre staying out of it she could have argued she certainly could have struggled against the grip he had on her arm but she waited until theyd reached his car then she simply turned and wrapped her arms around him dont do this to yourself she murmured he held himself rigid prepared to jerk away and shove her into the car do what dont blame yourself gabe who else but his body relaxed and curled itself to hers he pressed his face into the cool damp comfort of her hair jesus kelsey who else am i going to blame he was trying to protect my horse you cant know that i feel it he drew her away his eyes were calmer now but whatever was going on just behind that deep cool blue had kelsey trembling and im going to find whoever did this to him whatever it takes the police work their way i work mine chapter ten death couldnt interfere with the routine of a thoroughbred farm not the death of a horse or a man dawn still signaled workouts there were races to be run legs to be wrapped coats to be quartered and strapped talk around the paddocks or shedrow at sunrise might have been of murder and old mick but the pace didnt flag it couldnt there was a foal with a case of eczema a yearling filly who still refused a rider and a colt competing in a maiden race grieving and gossip had to be accomplished while filling feed tubs and walking hots maybe you want to see to strapping pride now that hes been cooled miss kelsey though his eyes were shadowed his face drawn boggs was up and about his duties he offered kelsey the reins he always seems happier when you do it all right boggs her hand covered his gnarled one is there anything i can do for you his eyes drifted past her as they focused on something private aint nothing to do miss kelsey just dont seem right thats all dont seem right she simply couldnt turn away would you mind coming with me im still a little nervous about grooming the next derby winner they both knew it was an excuse but boggs nodded and trudged along beside her it was raining again the same slow incessant drizzle that had marred the previous afternoon though it was closing in on ten am the mist hung stubbornly inside the barn stableboys were busy mucking out so the air was perfumed with the smells of manure hay and mud at queenies box kelsey paused and handed the colts reins back to boggs thisll only take a minute she took a carrot out of her back pocket offering it to the mare while she nuzzled the soft ears there you go old lady you didnt think id forget did you the mare nibbled the carrot then kelseys shoulder curving her neck in response to the caress though she was aware of boggss interest kelsey completed what had become a daily routine with a kiss on queenies cheek i know ive already taken plenty of ribbing about female equiphilia after a last pat kelsey turned back to boggs and the colt and maybe im hooked but ive caught more than one male groom cozying up to a horse your granddaddy loved that mare boggs led pride to his box where kelsey had already cleaned out the soiled night bedding and replaced it with clean wheat straw for day hed sneak her sugar cubes every afternoon we all pretended not to notice what was he like boggs he was a good man fair he had a quick temper in him and could crack like lightning as he spoke his eyes scanned the box noting that kelsey had seen to the colts fresh water and hay net his job usually but he was sharing it with her as he shared the colt wouldnt tolerate laziness no sir but if you did your work you got paid well and on time known him to sit up all night with a sick horse and to fire a man on the spot for a shoddy grooming kelsey crouched down running her hands down prides legs to check for swellings or injuries boggs had already washed the leg wraps and hung them with the clothespins he kept clipped to his pant leg sounds as though he was a hard man to work for satisfied she rubbed the light dampness of rain from the colt with straw not if you did what you was hired to do he watched as she took the dandy brush from prides grooming kit youve got the touch miss kelsey he said after a moment i feel as though ive been doing this all my life she soothed the colt with murmurs and strokes as he shifted and shied his temperament like most aristocrats was highstrung hes a little restless this morning sharps what he is his minds already at the starting gate kelsey continued to remove mud from the colts saddle area belly and fetlocks im told he ran well yesterday she set the dandy brush aside and took up a hoof pick i guess it seems cold thinking about races and times after yesterday cant be no other way you were friends with him a long time about forty years boggs took out a tin of tobacco and helped himself to a pinch he was already an old hand when i come along ive never lost anyone close to me kelsey thought of naomi but it was impossible to remember whatever grief shed felt at three i dont want to say i can imagine what you must be feeling but i know if you want some time off naomi would give it to you no place else id rather be than here that policeman he had a look about him hell find who done that to mick kelsey dampened a sponge and wiped the colts eyes outward from the corners she enjoyed the way he looked at her while she tended to him the recognition and the trust theyd begun to build between them lieutenant rossi i didnt like him i dont know why well theres cold blood in there but cold blood means hell think and keep thinking step by step till its done kelsey set the sponge aside and picked up the body brush and currycomb she remembered the light in gabes eyes there had been a need for revenge there she decided and she understood the sentiment too well will that be enough for you boggs itll have to be there you are channing leaned against the box door he watched her a moment the steady hands the new muscles working in her shoulders you look just like you know what youre doing i do know what im doing and the fact never failed to delight her missed you at breakfast overslept his grin was more charming than sheepish my body clocks not used to eating at five am listen matt dropped by im going to go hang out with him on a couple of house calls barn calls whatever have fun he hesitated youre okay right sure im okay ill be back in a couple of hours oh and moses said if i found you he wants you back on the longe line slave driver she muttered as soon as im finished here she had no time to brood a thorough strapping of a horse took an experienced groom an hour and kelsey about a quarter hour longer then it was time for the midday feeding oats bran and nuts that needed to be mixed measured weighed she added a tablespoon of salt prides vitamin supplement and electrolytes because he tended to be a finicky eater she treated him to a helping of molasses to sweeten the feed later she would bring him an apple not just to spoil him she thought moses had explained that horses required succulents added to their feed pride preferred apples to carrots he had a taste for the tart granny smith variety now youre set she murmured when he settled into his midday meal and you eat it all hear he munched eyeing her weve got a lot riding on you sweetheart and i think youd like standing in the winners circle with a blanket of red roses he snorted what kelsey took as the equine equivalent of a shrug she chuckled giving him one last caress you cant fool me boy you want it as much as we do rolling her shoulders she left the barn to face the rest of the days work she doubted that moses had anything sadistic in mind when he whipped her through the morning but the result was the same by three her still developing muscles were sore she was covered with mud and her system was sending out urgent signals for fuel after thoroughly scraping her boots she went into the house through the kitchen and headed straight for the refrigerator with a little cry of pleasure she pounced on a platter of fried chicken she had her mouth full of drumstick when gertie came in miss kelsey outraged by the sight of her little girl leaning against the counter in filthy jeans gertie bustled to a cupboard for a plate thats no way to eat its working for me kelsey said with her mouth full this is great the best chicken ive had in my entire life she swallowed this is my second piece sit down at the table ill fix you a proper lunch no really sometimes manners simply didnt apply kelsey bit in again im too dirty to sit anywhere and too hungry to clean up first gertie ive taken three cooking courses one of them at the cordon bleu and i could never make chicken like this flushing delightedly gertie waved a hand sure you could it was my mamas recipe ill walk you through it sometime well you outdo the colonel all to hell at gerties blank look kelsey laughed kentucky fried gertie i could compose a sonnet to this drumstick go on youre teasing me red as a beet now gertie poured kelsey a glass of milk just like that brother of yours why youd think the boy hadnt eaten a homecooked meal in his life hes been in here charming you out of house and home hasnt he i like to see a boy with a healthy appetite hes got that and so kelsey thought did she as she debated whether or not to eat one more piece is naomi around had to go out mmm so kelsey thought it was just the two of them perhaps it was time she took advantage of the opportunity and asked gertie some questions ive wondered gertie about that night alec bradley gerties face sobered thats done and gone you werent home kelsey prodded gently no gertie picked up a dishcloth and began polishing the already spotless range and ive cursed myself every day for it there we were my mama and me at the movies and eating pizza pie while miss naomi was all alone with that man you didnt like him hmmph she sniffed and slapped her rag on the stove slick he was slick like youd slide right off if you was to put a hand on him miss naomi had no business with the likes of him why do you suppose she went around with him had her reasons i suppose shes got a stubborn streak does miss naomi and i expect she was feeling stubborn about your daddy then she was feeling low about losing a horse at the track he went down and they had to shoot him she took that hard thatd be about the time she was seeing that man gerties derision was plain she refused had always refused to call alec bradley by name he was handsome but handsome is as handsome does i say i tell you what the crime was miss kelsey the crime was putting that sweet girl in jail for doing what she had to do she was protecting herself she said she was so she was gertie said flatly miss naomi wouldnt lie if id been home that night or her daddy it wouldnt have happened that man would never have laid a hand on her and she wouldnt have needed the gun gertie sighed took the rag to the sink and rinsed it out thoroughly used to make me nervous knowing she had that gun in her drawer but im glad she had it that night a mans got no right to force a woman no right no kelsey agreed no right at all she still keeps it there what uneasy kelsey set down the halfeaten chicken leg naomi still has the gun upstairs not the same one i expect but one like it it was her daddys law says she cant own a gun now but she keeps it just the same says it reminds her i say what does she need to be reminded of such a time for but she says some things you dont want to ever forget no i suppose shes right kelsey said slowly but she wasnt certain she would sleep more peacefully knowing it maybe its not my place to say it but ill say it anyway gertie sniffled once then snatched a tissue to blow her nose you were the sun and the moon to her miss kelsey you coming back here like this its made up for a lot theres no getting back what was lost no taking back what was done but old wounds can still be healed thats what youre doing was it kelsey wondered she was still far from sure of her own motivations her own feelings shes lucky to have you gertie she murmured lucky to have someone who thinks of her first and last wanting to clear the tears from gerties eyes she lightened her voice and very lucky to have someone who can cook like you oh go on gertie waved a hand then dashed it over her eyes plain food thats what i do and you havent finished that last piece you took you need more meat on your bones kelsey shook her head just as the chimes sounded from the front door no gertie ill get the door otherwise ill eat this platter and all she took the milk with her guzzling as she went she passed a mirror and rolled her eyes dirt streaked her cheeks the cap shed tossed aside in the mudroom hadnt prevented her hair from becoming hopelessly tangled she hoped as she wiped at the mud with the sleeve of her manurestained shirt that the visitor was horserelated far from it grandmother kelseys shock mixed with chagrin as milicent winced at her appearance what a surprise what in the name of god have you been doing working kelsey saw the spotless lincoln outside the driver stoically behind the wheel out for a drive ive come to speak with you head erect milicent crossed the threshold with the same unbending dignity that kelsey imagined french aristocrats had possessed when approaching the guillotine i felt this was much too important to discuss over the phone believe me i do not enter this house lightly or with any pleasure i believe you come in please and sit down at least naomi was out of the house on some errand kelsey could thank fate for that can i offer you something coffee tea i want nothing from this house milicent sat her starched linen suit barely creasing with the movement she refused to satisfy petty curiosity by studying the room and focused instead on her granddaughter is this how you spend your time youre as grimy as a field hand ive just come in you might have noticed its raining dont take that tone with me this is inexcusable kelsey that you would waste your talents and your upbringing worse still that you would send this family into a tailspin while you play out this little drama grandmother weve been through all this kelsey set the milk aside and moved over to stir up the fire whether it was the rain or the visit the room was suddenly chilled im well aware of your feelings and your opinions i cant believe you came all this way just to reprise them for me you and i have rarely been sympathetic to each others wishes kelsey no thoughtfully kelsey replaced the poker and turned back i suppose we havent but in this i cant believe you would go against me your name was in the paper this morning your name in connection with a murder at a racetrack news travels kelsey mused shed been up and at the barn before the first paper delivery i didnt realize that if i had i certainly would have called dad to reassure him i was there grandmother the man who was killed was a groom at the neighboring farm my part in the investigation is very incidental that you were there at all is the entire point kelsey at a racetrack associating with the sort of people they attract kelsey tilted her head they attract me now youre being childish milicents lips compressed i expect more of you i expect you to think of the family what does that poor man being killed yesterday have to do with the family your name was linked with naomis and her name in connection with a murder brings up old scandals i shouldnt have to spell all this out for a woman of your intelligence kelsey do you want your father to suffer for this of course not and why should he why would he grandmother an old man was brutally murdered by sheer coincidence i happened to find him naturally i had to give a statement to the police but it ends there i didnt even know him and as far as dad goes hes completely removed from this stains are never completely removed this world kelsey is not ours you were warned what to expect what kind of people you would mingle with now the worst has happened and because your father is too softhearted to take a stand its up to me im going to insist that you pack your things and come home with me today how little things change naomi stood in the doorway pale as marble her slategray suit only accented the delicate fragility of her frame but fragility can be deceptive when she stepped forward she was as elegant and as powerful as one of her prized fillies i believe i overheard you say something quite similar to philip once milicents face went still and hard i came to speak with my grandchild i have no desire to speak to you youre in my home now milicent naomi set her purse aside and with seamless poise chose a chair youre certainly free to say whatever you like to kelsey but you wont run me off those days are over prison taught you little i see oh you cant begin to know all it taught me her blood was cold now without sentiment that pleased her shed never been sure how she would react if she confronted milicent again youre the same as you ever were calculating sly unprincipled now youd use philips daughter to satisfy your own ends kelsey is her own woman you dont know her well if you believe she can be used no i cant kelsey stepped between them not to block the venom but to speak her mind and dont talk around me either of you im not a pawn in anyones game i came here because i wanted to and ill stay until i decide to leave you cant order me to pack grandmother as though i were a child or a servant color leaped into milicents cheeks and rode high i can insist that you do whats right for the family you can ask me to consider whats right and i will youve pushed yourself on her milicent rose her eyes boring into naomi using sentiment and sympathy to draw her to you have you told her about the men naomi the drinking the total disregard for your marriage your husband and child have you told her that you set out to ruin a man to destroy my son but only succeeded in ruining yourself thats enough kelsey stepped back hardly realizing the gesture put her squarely in naomis corner whatever questions i have whatever answers im given dont involve you ill make my own judgments grandmother milicent fought to keep her breathing even her heart was thumping dangerously fast she too would make her own judgments if you stay here youll force me to take steps ill have no choice but to alter my will and to use the power i have to revoke your grandfathers trust it was sorrow rather than shock that settled in kelseys eyes oh grandmother do you think the money matters so much do you think so little of me consider the consequences kelsey she picked up her bag certain the threat would bring the girl quickly to heel hey kels youll never guess what i channing came to an almost comical halt two strides in front of milicent grandmother enraged milicent whirled on naomi so youd have him as well philips daughter and now the son he considers his own grandmother im just quiet milicent snapped at him you paid once naomi and i swear to god youll pay again after she swept out channing hunched his shoulders ah bad scene huh and one of the more colorful ones drained kelsey rubbed her hands over her face channing you did call candace and tell her you were here didnt you i called her he stuck his hands in his pockets then drew them out again i just told her i was okay and settled in i didnt mention where i was settled i thought id avoid the complications he blew out a breath as kelsey continued to stare at him i guess id better let her know before it gets any stickier kelsey shook her head as he clattered up the stairs channings prone to leaving out vital pieces of information she glanced back at her mother want a drink naomi managed a smile and eased her shoulders back against the cushion why not two fingers of whiskey ought to take out some of the sting well try it kelsey walked to the sideboard and poured im sorry for that so am i kelsey the money might not be important to you but its your heritage i dont want to be responsible for your losing it absently kelsey ran a fingertip over one of naomis crystal horses following the flow of glass from withers to tail i have no idea if she can block my trust fund and if she can well i havent exactly been squandering the interest to date with a shrug she handed naomi a glass i dont particularly want to lose it either but ill be damned if shell rein me in with dollar signs cheers she rapped her glass against naomis cheers with a shake of her head naomi began to laugh letting her eyes close she ordered her body to relax oh christ what a day shed spent the last two hours with her lawyers working out the details on how to align her own wishes with the ones her father had outlined before his death now she thought if milicent made good on her threats to cut kelsey off shed have to make further adjustments she opened her eyes again and tossed back the first swallow i was awfully proud of you the way you stood up for yourself same goes when i saw you in the doorway i thought jesus shes like a lightning bolt frozen cold sharp and deadly shes always affected me that way not that everything she said was completely off the mark ive made mistakes kelsey very bad mistakes kelsey turned the glass in her hand around and around did you love dad when you married him yes oh yes for a moment naomis eyes softened he was so shy and smart and sexy kelsey choked on a laugh dad sexy those tweed jackets that dreamy poetic look in his eyes that calm patient voice reciting byron that unflagging kindness i adored him when did you stop it wasnt a matter of stopping naomi set her halffinished whiskey aside i wasnt so patient or so kind and the dreams we had were different ones when things began to go wrong i wasnt smart enough to compromise to bend it was one of my mistakes i thought i could hold him by proving i didnt need him i opened the distance raced away from him and i lost i lost philip i lost you i lost my freedom a very high price for pride she grimaced as the doorbell rang again it looks like the day isnt over yet ill get it for the second time that afternoon the visitor was unwelcome lieutenant rossi ms byden sorry to disturb you i have a few followup questions for you and your mother were in the sitting room is there any progress lieutenant she asked as she led the way were investigating trained eyes took in the sedate comfort of the room as well as the two glasses of whiskey the halffull glass of milk naomi rose as he entered as a man he appreciated her grace as a cop he admired her control lieutenant rossi though her skin had gone cold she offered a hand wont you sit down would you care for some coffee i appreciate the offer ms chadwick but ive had my quota for the day i just have a few more questions of course they always had a few more questions she sat again keeping her spine erect what can i help you with you were fairly well acquainted with the victim i knew mick keep the answers short naomi reminded herself say nothing more than necessary he was employed at longshot for the last five years approximately i believe thats correct he also worked for the previous owner cunningham on and off off rossi continued when he was fired about seven years ago bill cunningham let mick go as i recall because he felt mick was too old at the time my trainer offered mick a position here but he decided to leave the area the information i have is that he worked the tracks in florida during that twoyear period i believe so would you know if he had any enemies mick she dropped her guard for a moment the question was so absurd everyone loved old mick he was an institution a kind of monument to the best in racing hardworking toughminded bighearted no one disliked him but someone killed him rossi waited a beat fascinated by the way naomi drew herself in the horse was injured mick gordon was assigned to that horse as groom my report is that there was a long shallow slice on the left flank approximately twelve inches in length he took out his book as if checking facts preliminary reports indicate that this wound was caused by the same weapon used against the victim obviously someone was trying to hurt the colt and mick tried to stop him kelsey put in moses told me that colts very levelheaded hed never have trampled mick if he hadnt been hurt or frightened that may be rossi had to wait for the autopsy report before he could be sure if the knife had killed mick gordon or the horse had murder or attempted murder he intended to close the case mr slaters colt was competing with yours that day ms chadwick yes or he would have been if it hadnt been necessary to scratch him and your horse won didnt he she kept her eyes level steady by a neck as we say he paid three to five you and mr slater have a history of competition particularly in the last year between these two horses hes edged you out of the top spot several times double or nothing is an admirable colt a champion so is my virginias pride theyre incredibly well matched i dont know much about racing myself he smiled placidly but from an amateurs standpoint it seems it would be to your benefit to he tipped his flattened hand back and forth shift the odds thats an uncalledfor accusation lieutenant in automatic support kelsey dropped a hand on her mothers shoulder absolutely uncalledfor its not an accusation ms byden its an observation horses are sometimes deliberately injured drugged even killed to up anothers chances arent they ms chadwick unscrupulous and criminal behavior happens in all walks of life she fought against trembling cops eyes could detect even the slightest fear those of us in racing prefer to say it happens much more often in the show ring than at the track three willows doesnt need to resort to tactics like that kelsey said furious and ive told you that my mother was with me all morning dozens of people saw us they did rossi agreed as a veteran of the racing world ms chadwick wouldnt you agree that an owner or a trainer interested in improving his chances would hire someone to do the job rather than risk harming a horse himself yes i would you dont have to answer questions like this the outrage of it seared kelseys throat im sure your mother is well aware of her rights rossi said coolly and the procedure of a murder investigation im perfectly aware of both lieutenant and equally aware that those rights dont always protect the innocent her lips curved humorlessly certainly not the halfinnocent i could remind you that my colt wasnt the only other contender in that race and that not once in the fifty years that three willows has been in operation have we been cited for any infraction but im sure you know that just as i know an exconvict always carries a cloud of suspicion is there anything else i can tell you not for the moment a hell of a woman he thought and tucked away his pad he was going to have to schedule extra time to study her file a little more closely i appreciate the time one thing ms byden you did say you met mr slater outside the barn yesterday before the two of you went in to look over the horse yes he was talking to his trainer thank you ill see myself out that was outrageous kelsey exploded the moment the door closed how could you just sit there and take it he all but accused you of paying for murder i expected it and he wont be the only one to consider the possibility after all im once guilty dont be so calm dammit im not the pretense is all ive got weary she rose she needed a quiet room a bottle of aspirin and the cowards escape of sleep but she paused took a chance by framing kelseys face in her hands youre not even considering it a possibility are you that i might have had a hand in this no there was no hesitation then im wrong naomi murmured it seems i have a great deal more than pretense go for a ride kelsey work off some of that anger she went for a ride but her temper continued to rage she headed for longshot with a dual purpose handing over justices reins to a willing groom she strode from barn to house too stirred up to think of the propriety of knocking on the front door she went in through the pool house moving from spring to high summer then up a short flight of stairs into the steady warmth of a casually furnished great room she realized then because she hadnt a clue which direction to take that she was trespassing upbringing warred with instinct until she turned left and headed down a corridor so she thought shed work her way to the front door go outside and knock unless of course she found gabe in the meantime it wasnt his voice she heard not immediately it was boggss his grainy tones coming through an open door he wouldnt want no fancy service mr slater none of that flowers and organ music stuff once when we were sitting around he told me how he thought hed want to be cremated and maybe his ashes could be spread over the practice track here sos hed always be a part of the place sounds kinda funny i guess if thats what he wanted thats what well do thats good then ive got some money set aside i dont know what it costs to do things that way but let me do this for him boggs gabe interrupted im not sure id be sitting here today if it hadnt been for mick id appreciate it if youd let me take care of him i know it aint the money mr slater maybe its not my place to say but he was real proud of you told me he knew the first time he saw you hustling to walk hots at the track that youd amount to something i sure am going to miss him so am i well i better get back he stepped out of the doorway flushed a bit when he saw kelsey miss he muttered tipping his cap and hurrying off ashamed at having so blatantly eavesdropped on a private conversation she stepped into the doorway to apologize he sat at a beautiful old desk the arched window behind him letting in the watery sunlight wherever there wasnt glass welcoming the light there were books the twolevel library was stunning and unmistakably masculine the man who owned it had his head in his hands embarrassment melted into compassion she stepped forward murmuring his name her arms were around him before he lifted his head i didnt know you were so close to him im sorry im so sorry he hadnt felt grief not in years not since his mother it surprised him how deep it could cut he was good to me i must have been about fourteen the first time he grabbed me by the scruff of the neck he took an interest in me i dont know why and talked jamie into hiring me and he made sure i learned goddammit kelsey he was seventy he should have died in bed i know she drew away gabe rossi was just at the house busy man gabe dragged his hands through his disheveled hair he left here less than an hour ago i think hes got some idea that naomis involved when gabe said nothing she moistened her lips i need to know if you think so composed again he studied her no i dont and neither i see do you rossi has a couple of ideas the other is that i arranged the business myself he waited a beat double or nothings heavily insured youd shoot yourself in the foot first she let out a sigh that was the other reason i came over i could tell when he was questioning me that he was toying with the idea i guess i came over to warn you i appreciate it he rotated his shoulders once to ease the lingering tension kelsey standing there in splattered work clothes compassion in her eyes took care of the rest you look good darling yeah muds becoming on you he took her hand played with her fingers why dont you sit on my lap awhile amused she tilted her head is that the setup or the punch line slater in answer he tugged cradling her when she tumbled yeah he inhaled deeply nuzzling her hair it smelled of rain and of spring this is exactly what i needed sit still kelsey youll cause a lot more trouble by wriggling around believe me im not a lap sitter so learn testing he grazed his teeth over her earlobe pleased with her quick shudder you only came over to tell me about rossi thats right this time he exhaled deeply okay but im going to have to find a way to make you pick up the pace here im starting to suffer i think youre tougher than that she rested her head in the curve of his shoulder it was entirely too comfortable entirely too tempting im not playing games thats too bad i usually win chapter eleven sure you dont want a blindfold kelsey tucked an arm around channings waist a last cigarette he tipped down his redframed oakley sunglasses youre a riot kels no really i feel like im sending you off to the firing squad alone i can handle mom he unstrapped his helmet from the back of his harley and the profs no problem and grandmother with a grimace he slipped on the helmet hey ive been dodging those bullets for years as long as my brilliant mind keeps me in the top fifteen percent of my class they cant hassle me much the trusty shield of a fourpointoh shed used it herself what about this summer moms just going to have to accept that theres more to my life than hitting the books my brother grinning she tapped her fingers on the side of his helmet the hard hat actually naomi offered me a job here this summer here channing osborne stableboy i like it i like her in a lithe move he straddled the bike you know i stopped by here to be sure you were all right i had this image planted of some hardfaced hardliving bitch with a drink in one hand and a fortyfive in the other sowed kelsey said dryly by the magnificent milicent with a few seeds tossed out by mom theyre as solidly aligned against you being here as they were for you marrying wade the weenie he glanced back toward the house it made a lovely picture with the willows greening the daffodils and hyacinths spearing up in their easteregg hues of yellow and blue and pink shes not anything like shes painted is she it doesnt seem so kelsey murmured im glad you came channing im glad you got to meet her hey it was the most interesting spring break ive ever had he leaned forward to kiss her goodbye and ill be back see you in a couple of months i she wanted to tell him she couldnt guarantee shed be here but hed kicked the engine to life with a final salute he roared off down the drive lost in her own thoughts she walked back to the house had she decided to stay kelsey asked herself the month naomi had asked of her was almost up yet neither of them had mentioned plans to leave and what was waiting for her back in maryland in that tidy bethesda apartment job hunting solitary meals and the occasional lunch with a friend who would sympathize over the divorce then mention a cousin office pal old friend who just happened to be single the idea was more than depressing here she had work and a world she already loved a lifestyle that suited her nature people who accepted her for what she could do and there was gabe she wasnt quite sure what was going on there but it would be a great deal more difficult and certainly inconvenient to try to figure it out if she moved away it would be dishonest to say he didnt fascinate her his moods impossible to read one minute bold as a banner headline the next she appreciated his humor the easy charm the equally easy arrogance hed moved her in so many ways the way hed grieved for old mick standing solemnly in the soft dawn light while boggs had ridden slowly around the practice track spreading the old mans ashes hed held her hand she remembered trusting her to understand the ritual that kind of loyalty and love couldnt be learned yet he could be hard ruthless enough to gamble and win a small fortune even that intrigued and the underlying recklessness that had pushed him to raze another mans house and build his own then of course there was that basic animal attraction the kind shed never felt before for any man even her husband kelsey naomi paused at the foot of the stairs the girl looked so solemn she thought missing channing already no i was thinking of she trailed off blew her breezetousled hair out of her eyes nothing really realigning her thoughts she studied naomi slim strong selfcontained it was nice of you to offer him a job this summer not that nice he has a strong back willing hands and i enjoy having him around the house has been empty a long time i think he wants to be a vet so he told me he told you with a baffled laugh kelsey shook her head hes never mentioned it to me not once ive always thought he was revved to be a surgeon like his father sometimes its easier to tell those secret hopes to someone who isnt so close he loves you admires you could be hes afraid youd be disappointed in him i couldnt be her breath came out in an impatient gush candace has been talking for years about him carrying on the osborne tradition i just assumed he wanted it too why do people try to shoehorn their children into slots family honor a terrifying obligation she opened her mouth closed it again family honor hadnt that been why shed married wade how many times had she been told how perfect he was for her until shed believed it good family good prospects excellent social standing it had been her duty after all to marry well and to marry properly god had she loved him at all and when you cant hold up that obligation kelsey said slowly its the worst kind of failure i dont want that for channing hell do whats right for himself you did eventually you can talk about eventually when youre my age kelsey she wasnt quite sure of her approach casual she decided was probably best im going down to hialeah i want to watch virginias pride run and i want to stick close to him after what happened at charles town oh so she wasnt to have the last week after all that makes sense when are you leaving in the morning i thought you might like to go with me to florida well its not spring break but it should be quite a spectacle as cautious as naomi she nodded id like to see it good how would you feel about taking the rest of the day off kelseys brows lifted she hadnt seen naomi take more than an hour off in over three weeks for what else naomis laugh was quick bright and young shopping whats the fun of taking a trip if you cant splurge on some new clothes first kelseys grin flashed ill get my purse in a dingy hotel room off route lipsky gulped down warm gilbeys gin the ice machine a few feet outside his door was on the fritz not that he cared warm or chilled the liquor went down the same i tell you sooner or later theyre going to come looking for me youre probably right you got sloppy rich straightened his bolo tie neatness counts friend i was just going to take care of the horse with his free hand lipsky reached for the cigarette smoldering in a chipped glass ashtray crammed with butts just enough so he couldnt race thats all but that wasnt your job rich reminded him with an affable grin eyes and ears open remember just eyes and ears until i told you different you didnt bitch when i fixed his other colt resentment gleamed in lipskys redrimmed eyes you gave me another hundred for it you were tidy fred i did tell you i believe not to take chances but he spread his arms wide thats behind us now and gabes favorite colt wont be wearing a saddle for another week or so it fit nicely into the master plan the damaged horses even the murder such things stirred gossip and excited the press feeling generous rich reached into his pocket he carried his lucky money clip the oversize silver dollar sign hed picked up in houston there was nothing he liked better than to have it straining with bills normally he would load it with singles putting a fifty or if he was lucky a cnote on the outside he was really in the groove now he thought the money clip was fat with hundreds he peeled one off and laid it on the table lipsky stared at it with a mixture of hunger and guilt i wouldnt have hurt the peacock nobody coulda paid me to hurt old mick an unfortunate accident in sympathy rich patted a hand on his shoulder lipsky gulped more gin i never killed nobody maybe i cut a few when they deserved it but i never killed nobody before he could still see micks face the shock the pain the way his eyes had rolled back right before the horse reared and felled him and he could see the blood pumping and pooling micks trademark blue cap going red with it he snatched the bottle and poured another shot he shouldnt have poked his nose in an excellent rationalization rich poured a glass for himself he hated to see a man drinking alone even a revolting specimen like lipsky but he kept his cigarettes and his monogrammed lighter tucked away now its time to consider the next move the cops are going to come looking for me plenty of people saw me around the track that day at the shedrow you were hustling rides rich reminded him perfectly permissible youre a familiar face at the track fred otherwise the guards would have blocked you from entering the barn yeah and sooner or later somebodys going to remember that i did then theyll notice i aint been back he tamped out his cigarette spilling ash and old butts over the rickety table then theyll remember i carry a blade your deductive powers are admirable my advice is to run lose yourself in florida california kentucky maybe mexico theyve got tracks south of the border i aint living in no foreign country im an american ah patriotism rich toasted with his glass of gin youre a resourceful man fred otherwise i wouldnt have put you on the payroll but im afraid well have to sever our relationship under the circumstances its going to take more than a hundred richs smile never wavered but his eyes turned gelid now fred you wouldnt put the arm on me would you desperation was leaking sweat down lipskys back he could smell himself i cant take the rap for this alone if im going to run i need money fuck rich i was working for you you got a part in this is that the way you see it the way i see it i need ten thousand to hide and to keep my mouth shut about you if i dont hide good enough it aint too much to ask rich rich sighed hed been afraid it would come to this i understand your position fred i truly do listen let me make a phone call see what i can come up with he bolstered his smile with another pat on lipskys shoulder give me a little privacy huh yeah okay i gotta piss anyhow he rose and staggered into the bathroom rich didnt pick up the phone instead he took a small vial out of his inside coat pocket it really was a shame but he couldnt afford to call lipskys bluff even if he paid odds were the man would sing like a bird the minute the cops nailed him and theyd nail him rich thought as he tapped the liquid into lipskys gin come on back fred we got it all taken care of he was beaming when lipsky reeled back into the room ill have the money for you tomorrow relief and liquor had lipsky tumbling into his chair no shit rich hey we go back a ways dont we rollers like us we take care of each other he lifted his glass heres to old friends yeah eyes tearing in gratitude lipsky brought his glass to his lips i knew i could count on you yeah richs smile hardened as he watched lipsky literally drink himself to death you can count on me fred palm trees and striped awnings brilliant sunshine and trailing bougainvillea men in white suits and women in sundresses the ambience added to the glamour of the track but hialeah park was still about racing at the gulfstream receiving barn horses arched their necks pranced sniffed the air athletes psyching themselves up for competition many of the sights and sounds were the same as charles town vendors still hawked daily racing form handicappers still hovered working the odds but the weather itself the sheer glory of it drew a different breed from the chilly spring in virginia kelsey amused herself watching a woman teetering on icepick heels leading a filly around the walking ring her shoulderlength rhinestone earrings flashed nobody could call a horse a dumb animal looking at that kelsey glanced up at gabe meaning what do you see when you look at her face the horse or the woman the horse obliging kelsey looked back at the filly plodding head down behind the giggling woman embarrassment you got it thats cunninghams latest acquisition the horse or the woman both she let loose a laugh and realized how glad she was shed come maybe it was the quick peek at summer or the simple pleasure of discovering herself a part of a closeknit group but she was glad i heard youd be here but i didnt see you at morning workout i just got in an hour ago he told her what do you think of miami well some of the grooms were grumbling this morning about losing sleep gunshots outside their quarters and i cruised the beach yesterday and it hit me that i must be an adult i had no desire to strap on rollerblades other than that she drew in a deep breath i love it its a beautiful park the bottom line racetrackers dont have much use for the outside world anyway i wouldnt go that far youre not a racetracker he looked down at her at least not yet she frowned unsure if shed been complimented or insulted rather than pursue it she watched the losers returning from the first race the winners she knew would be taken to the spit box so that samples of urine and saliva could be tested for drugs but it was the losers she thought about now her heart aching a little to see them limping in their flanks sweaty faces dirty if a filly could feel embarrassed by being led around in public by a tartedup barbie doll she wondered how deeply these suffered the pangs of failure sad isnt it she murmured like watching soldiers struggling back from the front all that color and show and in just a couple of minutes its done its a hell of a couple of minutes too bad you missed the florida derby now thats a show acrobats a camel race camels really never bet on one they walked past the tack rooms around the backstretch it was nearly time for the second race and pride was in the third she wanted to see reno before moses gave him that leg up it had become her personal superstition to add her last wish for good luck before he walked his horse from the paddock not going to head for the windows gabe asked her nope ive picked my horses pride in the third and three aces in the fifth she stopped to buy a lukewarm pepsi from an ancient black man ive got my own system now gabe accepted the can took a swallow and handed it back to her and what is that sentiment i just bet my heart its a lot to lose she shrugged gamblings no fun without the risk damn right come here they were nearly at prides saddling stall and there was plenty of traffic cut it out slater but hed already caught the ponytail shed looped through the back of her cap im just going to kiss you the risks on both sides she thought she heard some of the grooms hooting with laughter before her mind went blank shed wondered if that first that only intellectsapping kiss had been a fluke a coincidence a onetime trip apparently not there was something about his mouth she opened hers to it eagerly swamped in the taste the texture the heat it moved against hers clever and tormentingly slow as if there was all the time in the world to sample on a moan of agreement she plunged her hands into his hair holding on until the sounds of the track were no more than misty white noise i want it was all he could think hed spent so much of his life wanting decent food a clean bed the simple peace of living without fear as hed grown those wants had grown with him hed wanted women and power and the money that would ensure both but hed never craved anything certainly not anyone as he craved now one woman one night hed have gambled everything he had for the chance of it how much longer he murmured against her lips i dont know she struggled to catch her breath i dont know you sure you do i didnt know you existed a couple of months ago she drew away surprised her legs didnt fold under her im not she straightened her cap with a shaky hand as applause rang out behind them we need to talk about this later without an audience well he skimmed a fingertip over her jaw i accomplished something anyway the words already going out that youre off limits that im she set her teeth is that what that was for some sort of macho claim staking no it was for me darling but it worked see you around she kicked the soda can shed dropped when hed kissed her idiot she muttered fighting for dignity she turned and nearly ran into naomi its odd naomi began while kelsey struggled for words watching that if youll pardon the analogy i often have the same sensation when i see one of my horses led to the track its like watching your child get on the school bus or recite in a class play you suddenly realize that theyre not just your child anymore and that theres so much you dont know about them he just did it to annoy me though her heart was still swelling naomi smiled oh i dont think so she took a chance and lifted a hand to kelseys cheek confused yes but not ready to talk about it would you like me to speak with gabe he wont appreciate it but hes fond enough of me to put up with the intrusion no ill handle it she glanced around there were still a number of grinning faces pointed her way dont we have a race coming up she snapped youre not being paid to gawk as kelsey stalked over to the saddling stall naomi let out a grin of her own on the track pride ran like a dream bursting through the gate with a fierce look in his eyes and reno driving him on at the first turn he was fighting for position but after that it was over down the backstretch there were three lengths of daylight between him and the closest contender looks like a rich mans horse she heard someone comment behind her yes she thought he did but money had nothing to do with it gabe joined her at the fifth race as cool and casual as if theyd recently shared a sandwich rather than a torrid public embrace reno ran a smart race he and pride make a good team she shot gabe a look the best team on the circuit well see he murmured keep your eye on cunninghams big sheba tell me what you see frowning kelsey watched the horses being loaded in the gate the big bay filly was fractious nervous she took a swipe a badtempered kick at a groom and sent him sprawling shes wound up thats not unusual she shifted her gaze to three aces he was giving his own handlers a fight your colts feeling frisky himself just watch the bell sounded horses charged cunninghams filly took the lead her long legs extended digging up dirt kelsey narrowed her eyes behind the binoculars big sheba was sweating heavily by the first turn shes fast why is he pushing her so hard she winced as the jockey used the bat quick and often hes doing what hes been told at the halfway mark she began to flag just a fraction but enough for the field to close kelsey felt her eyes begin to tear big sheba had gallantry but she didnt have wind and they were hurting her on the backstretch she fell a halflength behind gabes colt then a length sheer heart kept her in the place position by a nose when they crossed the wire thats inexcusable furious she whirled on gabe there have to be rules weve got plenty of them none say you cant push a horse past its limits rumor is shes got lung trouble so the idiot has his jockey run her full out at seven furlongs he wants the fucking derby so much hell kill her to have a shot at it i thought he was just a fool hes a fool all right an ambitious one he wants that first jewel dont we all yeah the difference is just how far well go to get it he left her to head down to the winners circle kelsey turned her back on the track suddenly it had lost a great deal of its glamour chapter twelve jack moser ran a clean place maybe some of his clientele rented a room by the hour but that was none of his nevermind jack figured what went on behind closed doors went on behind closed doors at the ritz hotel just as it did at his place only they paid more for it he didnt have bugs wouldnt tolerate carryingson after the decent hour of midnight and paid extra so his guests could have cable at twentynine dollars a pop for a single it wasnt a bad deal children under eighteen stayed for free he gave his guests the amenity of a sliversized bar of ivory soap along with the bathmatsize towels and for their convenience he had a deal going with the nearby diner to deliver meals after six am and before ten pm maybe he slipped some of the cash under the table and didnt push for id but that was his business the sheets were laundered the bathrooms disinfected and there was a good sturdy lock on each and every door he liked the summers best when vacationing families heading north or south spotted his blinking vacancy sign mostly they just tumbled out of their aging station wagons and into bed didnt have to worry about them spraying beer on the walls or tearing up the sheets hed been watching people come and go for twelve years and figured he knew a thing or two about them he knew when a couple rented a room to cheat on a spouse when a woman was hiding out from the guy who was as likely to put his fist in her eye as look at her he recognized the losers the drifters the runners hed pegged room as a runner none of my nevermind jack told himself as he hooked the passkey from the pegboard the guy had paid cash for three nights in advance so what if hed had the smell of fear around him or if hed had a way of looking over his shoulder as if he was expecting somebody to shove a knife in his back hed paid his eightyseven bucks plus tax and hadnt made a peep since which was the problem room s time was up and according to skinnybutted dottie the housekeeper his lock was still bolted and the do not disturb sign was out just the way it had been for three days well he was going to have to be disturbed jack thought as he strode across the parking lot to the line of identical gray doors and shaded windows room could come up with another days rent or get his butt moving jack moser didnt extend credit he knocked first sharp authoritative nobody but jack knew the secret pleasure it gave him to hustle along a deadbeat manager he said crisply and caught dottie poking her head out of where her cart was parked to give him the eye probably dead drunk she called out jack sighed and straightened his sloped shoulders just do your job dottie ill handle this he knocked again missing the face she made at him manager he repeated then slipped his key into the lock the smell hit him first gagging him his first thought was that had ordered something from the diner that had disagreed with him violently his second was that it would take a frigging case of lysol to cover the stench then he had no thought at all he saw what sat slumped at the tiny scarred table eyes staring body bloated whoever had checked into had metamorphosed in three days into a thing as horrible as anything jack had ever seen on a latenight horror movie he staggered back overwhelmed by the sight and the odor a strangled cry caught in his throat and he threw up on his shoes it didnt stop him from running he continued to run even after dottie hurried into room and began to scream the body had already been bagged by the time rossi pulled up at the motel it had been through sheer doggedness and a touch of luck that he was there at all his ears didnt perk up at every suspicious or unattended death that came into homicide but the name fred lipsky had rung a bell it was a name on his list one hed been unable to check out now it seemed he had his chance the medical examiner dr agnes lorenzo was packing up rossi nodded to the small athletic woman with graying hair and puppydog eyes lorenzo rossi i thought this was newmans case it ties into one of mine what have we got he hooked his badge to his pocket and moved through the uniformed men stationed at the open door the body was already zipped ready for transfer to the morgue the air still smelled ripe but it wasnt a smell that affected him much anymore he scanned the room taking in the unmade bed the bag of clothes tossed in the corner the dust left over from the forensics team a bottle of gin threequarters empty a single glass and an ashtray full of lucky strike butts dont ask me for cause of death rossi dr lorenzo began i can tell you it occurred fortyeight to sixty hours ago no wounds no sign of a struggle cause of death shed known he would ask and smiled thinly his heart stopped rossi they all do he ignored the jibe and formed a picture a man drinking alone angry guilty afraid why did a man rent a cheap room to drink in when he already had a cheap room thirty miles away and if lipsky had been running it meant he had something to hide since hed taken her sarcasm well dr lorenzo decided to give him a break he had about three hundred in his wallet and an expired credit card there was a copy of daily racing form in his bag four days old and a knife in his left boot rossi sprang to attention like a setter on point what kind of knife six inches long thin blade smooth edge rossis cops heart began to swell forensics would have the knife and if there was any trace of blood man or horse theyd find it who found him manager names moser he might still be in the office over there with his head between his knees not everyones as tough as you lorenzo youre telling me she stepped outside again sorry the spring air was marred by the whoosh of traffic on route shed left a body on the slab and now she had another to add to her backlog every day she thought was a picnic ill need a copy of the autopsy report two days twentyfour hours lorenzo be a pal were nobodys pals rossi she turned away and got into her car hey he grabbed her door before she could close it hed known agnes lorenzo for three years she didnt have many buttons that could be pushed but hed uncovered a few you know that stiff you did last week gordon mick gordon old man gutknifed she pulled out a cigarette a habit she no longer bothered to feel guilty about the one who got his skull cracked and most of his internal organs smashed for good measure yeah i remember i think this stiffs the one who did him she blew out smoke she hadnt gotten a close look at the knife there had been no need for her to examine it but she remembered the wound she had dozens of wounds filed in her head never to be forgotten she nodded the weapon could be right okay rossi ill burn the midnight oil for you but i cant promise all the tests will be done thanks he closed her door forgot her and zeroed in on the office and jack moser gabe learned about lipsky ten minutes after he returned from florida the press had found a gold mine in dottie the housekeeper the news that lipsky had died in a motel room spread from barn to track from groom to exercise boy gabes twiceweekly housekeeper brought him the news and the paper before hed done more than tossed his bags on his bed fury flared like a gasolinesoaked match he was working on banking it when rossi tracked him down nice to see you again mr slater lieutenant gabe offered the paper hed brought down with him then sat in the sundrenched living room odds are youre here to tell me about this you win rossi set the paper aside and made himself comfortable fred lipsky worked for you up until a few weeks ago up until i fired him which im sure you know he was drunk and objected to the termination thats right he pulled a knife i knocked him down and i thought mistakenly that that was the end of it his face still sternly controlled he edged forward if id had any suspicion that he would have used that knife on one of my men or one of my horses he wouldnt have walked away you dont want to make statements like that to a cop mr slater it hasnt leaked to the press yet but the knife in lipskys possession at the time of his death was the weapon that killed mick gordon as yet no one can definitely place lipsky at the scene at the time of the murder but we have a weapon and we have motive revenge case closed gabe finished i like them neat before i close them this one isnt neat how well did you know lipsky not well he came with the farm the statement made rossi smile an interesting way of putting it when i took over here i kept on anyone who wanted to stay it wasnt their fault cunningham played lousy poker intrigued rossi tapped his pencil against his pad thats a true story then sounded made up no point in mentioning a deal like that would be on the shady side of the law no point at all gabe agreed ill talk to your trainer again and the men im interested to know if anyone who did know him thinks he was suicidal you want me to think lipsky killed himself the rage began to work in him again gnawing away why out of guilt remorse thats shit lieutenant he was as likely to stick a gun in his mouth or put a rope around his neck as he was to dance on broadway you said you didnt know him well mr slater not him but i know the type hed been raised by lipskys type they blame everyone else never themselves and they dont take that last dive because theyre always figuring the angles they drink and they cheat and they talk a big game but they dont kill themselves an interesting theory and one rossi subscribed to himself lipsky didnt eat a gun or string himself up he drank a nasty cocktail of gin and what im told is called acepromazine are you familiar with it gabes voice was carefully blank its used to relax horses its a tranquilizer yeah so im told funny i thought when a horse broke his leg you put a gun behind his ear the noise annoys the customers gabe said dryly and every break isnt terminal theres a lot that can be done so that a horse doesnt have to be put down quite often he can race again or breed when theres nothing else to be done a vet gives the horse an injection theres not supposed to be any pain ive always wondered how the hell anyone knows that you wont be able to check with lipsky do you keep any of that stuff around here its administered by a vet as i said nobody puts a horse down on a whim lieutenant im sure youre right it would be a hell of an investment to lose yeah gabes voice was cool have you ever seen it happen no the horse stumbles on the track falls the jockeys off him like a flash panicked fighting it back everything gets quiet and grooms race out from everywhere it doesnt have to be their horse its everybodys horse then you call the vet and when theres no choice when it cant be put off the vet finishes him behind a screen for privacy have you ever lost one that way once about a year ago during a morning workout thats a more dangerous time than a race the riders relaxed everybody is he could still remember it the helplessness the impotent anger this was a pretty filly the queen of diamonds i called her the groom in charge of her cried like a baby when it was over that was mick gabe resisted the urge to ball his hands into fists so if youre telling me that somebody finished off lipsky the way you finish off a terminal horse i have to say they sent him off in better style than he deserved do you hold a grudge mr slater yes lieutenant i do gabes eyes were steady and shielded you want to ask me if i killed lipsky i have to say no im not sure what the answer would be if id known what youve told me today and if i had found him first you know something mr slater i like you is that so it is rossi offered one of his rare smiles an expression that never sat quite comfortably on his face some people dance all around questions some fumble some sweat but not you rossi picked a mote of lint from the leg of his trousers you hated the son of a bitch and might have killed him if youd had the chance and youre not afraid to say so thing is not only do i like you i believe you he rose now it could be youre bluffing me through this and ill find out if you paid a quick visit to that motel but i always circle around so that doesnt worry me he took another long careful study but i dont think so lipsky wouldve gotten one peep at you through the judas hole and barricaded himself in for the duration do you mind if i go down and talk to your men now no i dont mind gabe stayed where he was rossi knew the way he closed his eyes and concentrated on relaxing one vertebra at a time he gave rossi an hour before he went down to the barn himself the atmosphere was charged with the combination of excitement and dread that blooms around death men stopped their gossiping and instantly looked busy when gabe appeared he found jamison in conference with matt over the injured colt the inflammations down matt was saying its healing well go to changing the dressing once a day using the same antiseptic hes going to scar matt nodded eyeing the long healing slice along the flank more than likely goddamned shame jamison picked up the syringe to bathe the wound primelooking horse like this itll add to his prestige gabe commented moving up to take the colts halter himself he ran his knuckles down doubles cheek as a man might caress a woman the colt responded by butting his hand playful as a puppy battle scars he murmured it wont affect his time or his ambition how soon can we put a rider up on him dont be in a hurry matt jerked aside as the colt swung his head and aimed for his shoulder no longer a puppy but nine hundred pounds of temperament the teeth missed by an inch or so this ones always testing me like to take a chunk out of me would you fella he gave the colt a goodnatured slap on the neck when he was sure gabe had tightened his grip hell run in kentucky for you gabe if i was a betting man id put money on him myself gabe accepted matts diagnosis then turned to his trainer jamie ive been laying out a new training schedule for him itll either work or it wont thatll have to do then did rossi talk to you jamisons eyes turned grim as he completed the new dressing yeah he was down here asking his questions got everybody all stirred up peterson figures it was a mob hit kip thinks it was a woman lynette didnt take to that and took some skin off his nose theyve been arguing over it with the boys taking sides nobody thinks it was suicide jamison shot gabe a look and stepped out of the box nobody that knew him he could have gotten his hands on some acepromazine matt reminded jamison hed have known what it would do surely he had to know the authorities would catch up with him eventually a man like lipsky could have lost himself at a hundred tracks jamison looked back at the colt he was dressing the wound himself as penance for his part in it i should have fired him months ago everything mightve been different then and mick might have been alive that parts done gabe said but its not over whoever gave lipsky that last drink is part of it ill tell you what i told rossi matt scratched his chin as they headed outside it had to be someone who knows horses and who had access to veterinary supplies he smiled wanly which doesnt narrow it down too much it includes all of us gabe watched matts jaw go slack and several hundred others thanks for stopping by matt swallowed nervously no problem ill check on the colt in a couple of days i um think ill drop by three willows oh eyeing matt gabe took out a cigar and lit it casually is there a problem over there no no i just well gabes smile came easily most of the tension drained away shes a pleasure to look at isnt she matt flushed a curse of pale skin it isnt a hardship channing told me he thinks she might stay around awhile hed done his best to pump channing for details but the young man was either very discreet or very dense when it came to his stepsister oh i think shell stay awhile gabe was going to make certain of that and you look all you want he swung an arm over matts shoulder as he walked matt to his truck a saint couldnt blame you for it but watch where you touch doc as matt fumbled for a response gabe opened the truck door for him mine he said simply you he broke off flushed crimson i didnt realize kelsey never i never if i thought you had id have to hurt you gabes smile was friendly even sympathetic but the warning was clear give kelsey my best when you see her sure scurrying to leave matt scrambled into the truck but you know maybe i should just get back ive got a pile of paperwork then ill let you get to it gabe stepped back grinning as he watched the truck zip up the long lane you scared the boy white jamison thumbed out one of his favored cherry life savers just saving him some trouble down the road that may be studying the last of matts dust jamison let the cool slick flavor dissolve on his tongue does she know youve put your brand on her gabe chuffed out smoke remembering with fondness her reaction to his very deliberate public kiss shes a bright woman bright women are the ones who give a man the most trouble i havent had any trouble in a long time and he hadnt known just how much hed wanted some i might just drive over myself and see if i can stir some up the distraction would do him good he decided and he turned to look at his trainer hed been focused on the colt in the barn and on matt now he could see the lines of weariness the shadowed eyes you look beat jamie hed been sleeping poorly and hed found it harder yet to choke down a decent meal since micks murder ive got a lot on my mind one thing you can get off of it is any responsibility for what happened to mick when jamison merely looked away gabe tossed down his cigar and ground it out the expression in jamisons eyes only churned up his own feelings of guilt okay you used poor judgment in keeping him on i used it in firing him in front of the men you want to consider that the trigger fine but it wasnt the finger that pulled it i see him mick every time i close my eyes jamisons voice was low strained the way he must have looked when lipsky and the colt got done with him it should never have happened gabe he let out a sigh there was no answer for that he knew there was none the derbys in three and a half weeks that colts got to be ready and its my job to make him so but i look at him and i think how proud mick was to be grooming him saying nothing gabe looked out over the hills his hills the derby was more than a race more even than a goal it was the holy grail hed been chasing all of his life now after a lifetime of struggle and five years of concentrated effort it was nearly within reach maybe it would be empty when he finally grasped it but he had to know the colts got to run jamie if you cant work with him ill pass him to duke duke boyd the assistant trainer was competent they both knew it but he didnt have that extra flair jamison had been born with one way or another hell be ready for churchill downs ill do my job jamison said and rubbed his tired eyes i need your heart in it jamison dropped his hands youll have it goddammit and my soul as well he turned away and stalked back to the barn kelsey knew she wasnt supposed to fall in love with the horse but intellect had nothing to do with it she was as fascinated with the new wobblylegged foal as she was with the older colts and had been kicked only once in return for her affection perhaps because shed taken that philosophically and had hauled herself up and brushed herself off moses began to increase her training he liked her style the way she responded to the horses and what was more important he liked the way they responded to her still he was pleased when he saw she was as much nerves as eagerness when he took her to the yearling stable hed consulted with the yearling manager and between them theyd culled out this particular filly a bold little chestnut weighing in at a trim seven hundred and fifty pounds the light was gold almost liquid with dawn it poured onto the fillys coat inflamed it eyes dazzled kelsey stood just inside the box she was sure shed never seen anything quite so beautiful in her life shes got spirit moses said as he worked with a handler to calm her as she was saddled and shes got heart thats why naomi called her honor naomis honor as if responding to her name the filly butted moses hard the vibration sang up his shoulder he gave a firm jerk on the shortened reins and continued youll be the first weight shes had on her back now dont go thinking shes sweet and eager to please shes used to having her freedom we cant know what to expect shes a lot stronger than you he glanced back at kelsey as if dismissing her slight frame in the padded jacket and hat so you have to be smarter he stroked a hand over the yearling neck to withers and kinder that was why hed chosen kelsey no one could work successfully with yearlings without kindness the stall was quiet moses spoke so softly they might have been in church he clucked to the yearling then to kelsey signaling her to move in and make her connection her heart was thudding so loud and hard in her throat she was sure it would spook the yearling but her hands were gentle her movements slow she spoke barely above a whisper watching honors ears prick to the sound of her voice youre so pretty so pretty honor i cant wait to ride you were going to be friends you and i the yearling snorted reserving judgment her ears laid back when moses slipped the bridle over her head easy now kelsey murmured nobodys going to hurt you before long youll be a queen around here i bet that feels strange doesnt it she continued to soothe while moses tightened the saddle you should try panty hose ill lay odds theyre more uncomfortable than this little saddle the light changed subtly warmed im going to give you a leg up moses told her remember what i said to do yes she had to take a deep clearing breath i dont sit in the saddle yet the bellying comes first thats right remember its an announcement youre telling her this is what shes here for slow now and remember where the door is if you need to get out quick the idea of that had kelsey taking one more breath before she put her knee and her welfare in mosess hands the yearling shied surprised annoyed as kelsey draped herself over the saddle kelsey felt the agitated movement under her and refused to think about being sprawled over several hundred pounds of irritated horse she followed mosess instructions and her own instincts easing herself up and around shifting her weight to saddle and stirrups honor danced kicking out with a hind leg trying to shift to get a good clean shot at moses instinctively kelsey leaned forward spoke softly firmly in the yearlings ear stop that you dont want everyone to think youre common it wasnt magic the voice and the tone didnt immediately calm her but after a few more arrogant maneuvers the yearling settled she likes me kelsey announced shes thinking about how to shake you off her back no kelsey grinned down at moses she likes me well see he made kelsey sit until he was satisfied all right lets get to work this as moses explained was kindergarten kelsey would simply sit in the saddle while the handler walked honor on the yearling track the high walls preventing both of them from being distracted from the job at hand once the yearling had become accustomed to a riders weight she would be turned loose by the handler and kelsey would guide her theyd learn together how did she do naomi asked when she joined him like youd expect shes got plenty of chadwick in her moses put a hand over hers squeezed briefly in one of his rare displays of public affection i thought youd come down and watch for yourself i was too nervous she watched kelsey control the yearling with a light tug on the reins shes been here a month moses she hasnt said anything about leaving naomi hooked her thumbs in her front pockets with everything thats happened in the past couple of weeks i keep waiting for her to pack up and go youre not looking close enough naomi he smiled a little when kelsey forgot the training and leaned forward to press her face into the yearlings mane shes not going anywhere at mosess signal kelsey straightened then walked the yearling sedately over shes gorgeous isnt she yes the pride that welled up in naomi was almost frightening she lifted a hand to stroke the yearling and let her fingertips brush against kelseys you look wonderful together i feel wonderful after moses had fed honor a carrot as a reward kelsey held out a hand dont i deserve one i guess you do at that she accepted one and bit in now that ive stopped being terrified i can enjoy it after patting honor on the neck she tried not to gloat can i work her tomorrow moses and the day after he said shes your responsibility now really she wanted to leap off and kiss him but settled for beaming at him i wont let you down you do and ill dock your pay now she grinned im not getting paid youve been on the payroll for two weeks he had the satisfaction of seeing her jaw drop you get your first check on friday but it isnt necessary im just you do the work you get the pay he said it firmly he was after all in charge of this particular matter of course youre starting at the bottom thats about where you started isnt it naomi rock bottom she replied with a grimace my father insisted i earn every penny of my salary paltry as it was the idea was when it all came to be mine id appreciate it more he was right kelsey considered it was probably best more of a business arrangement how paltry you should probably clear about two hundred a week moses told her she lifted a brow when do i get a raise with a laugh naomi stepped closer hed have appreciated you gently she skimmed her fingertips over the yearlings throat she likes you kelsey sent moses a smug smile thats what i said i missed twentythree birthdays naomis tone shifted kelseys attention back and now her eyes were wary twentythree christmases a lot to make up for steadying herself she looked up and met her daughters eyes id like to start if youll let me will you take her take her staggered kelsey stared honor you want to give her to me id like you to accept her no strings i realize it might be a bit awkward to keep a horse in an apartment she struggled to keep her voice light but she can stay here as long as you like moses can work with her if thats what you want but shed be yours if youll take her swamped with emotion kelsey dismounted slowly her palms grew damp on the reins and she felt the warm breath of the yearling across the nape of her neck id love to take her thank you youre welcome i have to get back i have a lunch meeting kelsey took a step forward then stopped suddenly pushing the reins into mosess hand she had to dash to catch up with naomis long strides she laid a tentative hand on naomis shoulder and did what came more simply more naturally than shed imagined she kissed her thank you she said again but the rest of the words slid down her throat when naomi embraced her held her hard and where kelsey thought as she felt the urgency the need pulse from her mother had this passion come from how could it have been there all along and never showed im sorry naomi murmured and stepped back quickly ill have the ownership papers drawn up right away im late she managed and hurried away conflicting emotions battered her kelsey stood helplessly wishing she understood herself much less the woman whod given birth to her i dont know what to do youre doing fine moses handed her back the reins now go groom your horse chapter thirteen days passed quickly kelsey had a horse of her own an intriguing romance with a fascinating and frustrating man and a fresh curiosity about the mother she was beginning to love she hadnt expected to love naomi to wonder about her certainly perhaps to come to respect her but it was impossible to live in such close proximity with a woman of naomis breed and not have emotions become tangled there wasnt much time to dwell on it as the bluegrass stakes approached the gateway for the allimportant derby both three willows and longshot were hives of activity kelsey wasnt ready to admit it but she was already visualizing honor covered in a blanket of red roses a couple of derbies down the road today she was taking an important step toward that goal a starting gate was set up outside the practice oval at three willows though there was no longer any bite of winter the air was still cool kelsey tugged nervously at her jacket hoping she wasnt transmitting any of her tension to honor a thoroughbred was born to run she reminded herself this was just a lesson in format no amount of champion blood could carry a horse over the finish line if it didnt learn how to go through a steel cage and come out running heard you think youve got a contender here gabe sauntered over and rubbed a hand over the yearlings nose honor laid her ears back and eyed gabe then approving of scent and touch perked them up again and sidled closer i know ive got one kelsey put a proprietary hand on honors halter i havent seen you around in a couple of days miss me not particularly kelsey could be grateful she hadnt fallen into that humiliating habit of waiting by the phone yet were all pretty busy these days weve got double back in full training she dropped all pretense and caught his hand oh thats wonderful im so glad he pleased himself by taking a nip at her knuckles remember you said that after he wins the derby my moneys on pride and so was her heart though i might set some aside for double to place were sending him out to keeneland for a race jamie wants him to have a solid test before the bluegrass stakes are you going she said casually im going everywhere the colt goes including the winners circle at churchill downs he stroked a hand down her hair in much the same way he had caressed the horse want to keep me company she turned to check the cinches on honors saddle im planning on joining naomi in the winners circle he gave her hair a sharp tug to keeneland darling a couple of days more or less alone he moved closer she carried the scent of horses about her now twined with her own fragrance of citrus and spring i wonder how many times i can make love with you on one quick outoftown trip the muscles in her thighs turned to warm wax is there a record there would be eyes on hers he leaned down and caught her bottom lip between his teeth you have he nipped once and watched her pupils widen the most incredible mouth leave the girl alone trying to look annoyed moses gave gabe a hefty shove on the arm you going to fraternize with the competition kelsey or are you going to do your job she picked up her hat and lifted her chin i can do both she turned toward her horse and moses obliged her with a leg up cocky he muttered at her confident she corrected and anything but she walked honor toward the steel cage the gate doors were open to ease the yearling into the notion of moving through the confining tunnel honor swung her head once and tried to veer off testing kelsey knew the balance of power oh no you dont she muttered im still in charge here you dont want to embarrass us both in front of company do you a touch of the knees a firm hold on the reins and kelsey pressed her on bringing honor to a full halt when they were closed in by the gate its not so bad is it she murmured and you hardly have to spend any time in here at all what really counts is once youre through slowly they walked out the other side circled and repeated the process shes got good hands moses commented she looks more like naomi than ever on the back of a horse gabe tucked his hands in his pockets there might have been a better way to spend the morning than watching kelsey guide the flashy yearling through the lesson but he couldnt think of one hows it going between them slow steady its not a flashy sprint but id say they passed the first turn when naomi gave her that yearling she has high hopes for that horse shes got higher hopes for the girl gauging the timing moses angled himself to face gabe i know shes got a father but he isnt here so im taking it on myself to tell you to mind your step kelsey isnt one of the disposable types and it would upset naomi if you hurt her girl gabes face closed up when he spoke there was none of the resentment he felt none of the temper only mild curiosity in his voice and youre assuming i will moses plucked a cigar from gabes pocket and stuck it in his own dont pull that inscrutable shit on me my tribe held the trophy for inscrutable while your ancestors were still huddled in caves eating their meat raw and im not assuming anything the two of you look good together he shifted his eyes to check on kelseys progress just make sure you think it through you dont know if a roll in the hays going to hurt anybody until youre picking the straw out of your hair gabes lips quivered into a smile which tribe did that one come from the inscrutable one or the lost one just dont push her over the wire too fast shes got heart irritated with himself moses trudged across the grass to finetune kelseys work yes she had heart gabe agreed studying her as she listened intently to the trainers advice and blue blood there were plenty who knew him who would say he had no heart at all and no one would mistake his blood for blue it hadnt stopped him before he didnt intend to let it stop him now there were any number of women who were willing to overlook those particular flaws in his breeding many who had more he thought coolly who would shrug aside a drunk abusive father a short stint in a cell and a lingering taste for playing against the odds but he didnt want any number of women he decided while kelsey guided her mount into the gate and steadied her in the confining tunnel he wanted this woman he waited taking out a pair of sunglasses as the sun grew stronger the morning was slipping away and he needed to get back to his own operation but he drew on his store of patience staying on the sidelines until kelsey dismounted she did well kelsey said pressing a kiss to the yearlings cheek before offering her a carrot she wasnt afraid at all i want to see you tonight what she turned her head her cheek still brushing honors glossy hide id like to take you out tonight dinner a movie a drive your choice a date he continued when she only studied him with eyes that grew more speculative i realize ive neglected that particular ritual with you a date she rolled the idea around such as you pick me up we go somewhere and do some planned activity then you bring me home and walk me to the door thats more or less what i had in mind well it would be different she cocked her head considering i have to be up at five so well need to make it an early evening i wouldnt mind seeing a movie say a seven oclock show maybe a pizza after now it was his turn to consider it wasnt the sort of evening hed expected her to choose maybe it was about time they learned about each other an early movie and a pizza ill pick you up around six he tipped up her chin kissed her almost absently hey slater she called after him do i get to pick the movie he kept walking but glanced over his shoulder no subtitles on a first date she laughed at him what kind of woman do you think i am mine he shot back and she stopped laughing there was nothing romantic about a pizzeria crowded with teenagers which had been precisely kelseys point keep it casual shed decided avoid a situation where things could become too intense and try to find out what made gabriel slater tick this is perfect she settled into the booth with paper place mats of italy printed in red and green id almost forgotten there was life beyond racing horses it happens to all of us amused at finding himself dining with a woman in a place that sported pictures of grinning pizzas and calzones on the wall he stretched out his legs youve taken to it quickly and in a big way a talent of mine or a flaw depending on your point of view why do anything if you dont do it full out she relaxed and propped her feet on his bench that way you either reap the glory or you crash and burn is that what youre after kelsey glory she smiled i always get glory and satisfaction confused she glanced up at the waitress back at gabe your pick ill eat anything i wont bring us a small large kelsey corrected him large he said with a nod pepperoni and mushrooms a couple of pepsis very conservative kelsey noted when the waitress walked off i like to know what im eating it came he supposed from a lifetime of scrambling for scraps speaking of which wasnt it you who ate about two gallons of popcorn less than an hour ago still smiling she toyed with the simple gold chain around her neck movie popcorn doesnt count its simply part of the experience like the music score was there a music score hard to tell so im shallow she said with a shrug i like action films i actually wrote a script once for this course i was taking lots of good battling evil in car chases and gunfire what did you do with it absently she tapped her foot in rhythm with the guns n roses number blaring from the jukebox i got an a then i put it away i decided against sending it off because if anyone actually bought it theyd start changing everything and it wouldnt be mine anymore the waitress served their drinks in big red plastic cups besides i didnt want to be a writer what then lots of different things she moved her shoulders then leaned forward for her cup it always depended on my mood and the courses i was taking her smile was quick and slightly off center im very big on taking courses if you want to know a little about anything from computer science to interior design im your girl makes sense you grew up with a college professor he lifted his cup knowledge is sacred thats part of it i suppose but mostly i figured if i tried enough things sooner or later id hit on the right thing and have you yes she sighed my family would be quick to point out that ive said that before but this is different ive said that before too she murmured but it is nothing ive done has ever felt as right as this as natural as real god knows ive never worked as hard in my life to remind herself she glanced down at her hands they were toughening up she thought she liked to believe she was toughening up with them what about you have you hit on the right thing he kept his eyes on hers for an instant she thought she saw secrets behind them and hungers that had nothing to do with the scents of garlic and melted cheese its possible do you always look at a woman so that she thinks you could start nibbling away at her from the toes up his lips curved slow easy but his eyes didnt change no ones ever asked he laid a hand on her ankle which rested on the seat beside him and began to caress it but now that you mention it it might be an interesting way to end the evening the waitress plopped down their pizza along with a couple of white plastic plates enjoy your meal she said automatically and hurried off to fill her next order i love the atmosphere here cautious kelsey put her feet on the floor and sat up but i got off the track i was asking about your farm have you found what you wanted there he used a plastic knife to separate some slices then slid one onto her plate one onto his it suits me why you know darling you might have made a mistake giving up writing at least journalism you cant have the answers without asking the questions she took her first bite stinging with redpepper flakes stringy with cheese and sighed with approval at least with some people dont you like questions slater he avoided that one and skipped back to the one before it suits me because its mine its that simple no its that complicated you dont want to spoil the evening with a rundown of my life story kelsey bad for the appetite i have a strong stomach she licked sauce from her thumb you know mine gabe at least several of the highs and lows theres no moving to the next stage for me without some understanding of who im moving with she continued to eat while he frowned at her thats not an ultimatum or a guarantee its just a fact im attracted to you and i like being with you but i dont know you if she did he knew there was a good chance her other feelings would dim considerably long odds well hed played them before when the prize was rich enough let me tell you something about yourself first the only child of a devoted daddy well connected sheltered spoiled the last rankled a little but she wouldnt deny it all right its true i got almost everything i wanted when i was growing up emotionally materialistically i suppose a lot of it was to make up for the lack of having a mother but i didnt notice the lack a big house in the suburbs he went on good schools summer camp three squares and ballet lessons if he was trying to annoy her he was succeeding coolly she chose another slice you forgot piano swimming and equestrian its all part of the whole proms the college of your choice and a big splashy wedding to top it off dont forget the long tedious divorce whats your point slater you havent got a clue where i came from kelsey ill tell you and you still wont understand it but he would tell her he decided and see how the cards fell maybe id go to bed at night not quite hungry there might have been enough money for food that time or id managed to steal or beg enough kids make good panhandlers good thieves he added watching her eyes adults feel sorry for them or overlook them a lot of people are put in the position where they have to ask for money she said carefully its nothing to be ashamed of thats because youve never had to ask or take he rattled the ice in his cup then set it down at night id probably be listening or trying not to listen to the fighting going on in the next room or my mother crying or the neighbor earning an hours pay with some faceless john if i was lucky id wake up in the same bed i went to sleep in if i wasnt my mother would come in in the middle of the night and wed sneak out before we were tossed out because my father had lost the rent money again she saw the picture he was painting for her and it was dark with harsh edges where did you grow up nowhere it might have been in chicago or reno or miami in the winter we stuck to the south because the weathers better and the tracks run longer it might have been anywhere places all look the same if youre broke and running of course the old man would say we were just moving on that he was working on a big score my mother scrubbed toilets so we didnt starve and he took most of her pay and blew it on the horses or the cards or how far a fucking grasshopper would jump it didnt matter what the bet was as long as he could flash a few bills and play the big shot he spoke without passion the bitterness barely a flicker in his eyes he liked to cheat mostly he was good at it but if he wasnt my mother scraped enough together to keep him from getting his arms broken she loved him and that was the most bitter of all the pills he had had to swallow lots of women loved rich slater he continued to eat as if to prove to himself it didnt matter anymore he liked to hurt them some women keep coming back for another fist in the face they wear their black eyes and split lips like badges my mother was one of those if i tried to stop him hed just beat the hell out of both of us she never thanked me for it used to tell me i just didnt understand she was right he added i never understood it there must have been somewhere you could have gone a shelter social services the police he simply looked at her the flawless complexion the breeding that went down to the bone some people get swept into dirty corners kelsey thats the way the system works no it doesnt have to it shouldnt youve got to look for help expect it to be there have the nerve to ask for it my mother didnt do any of that she kept her eyes down expected nothing asked for nothing it was kelseys eyes that held him now the horror and the pity that darkened them but you were only a child someone should have done something i wouldnt have thanked them for it i grew up being taught to spit if i saw a cop to think of social workers as interfering paper pushers whose job it was to keep you from doing what you wanted so i avoided them sometimes i went to school sometimes i didnt christ knows he didnt care and my mother didnt have the energy left to reel me in so i did pretty much as i pleased the old man liked me to hang out with him sometimes to shill or to drum up a game of my own and if i was there i could make sure some money was left once he got too drunk to care you must have thought of running away of getting away from him sure i thought about it but i figured if i stayed i could keep him from beating her to death and i did for what good it did any of us my mother died in a charity ward pneumonia i gave it six months squirreling away the money i made hustling games or jobs at the track then i took off i was thirteen and tall for his age he remembered canny already old the old man caught up with me a few times the problem was i had a taste for the horses so i usually ended up at a track so did he hed knock me around shake me down i could usually buy him off buy him off if id been having a run of luck id have money a couple of hundred would send him off to a game of his own or the nearest bar of course gabe thought the price had gone up since then every time i cut loose id start over with one thing in mind one day id have my own he wouldnt touch me nobody would youre not eating im sorry she reached out and caught his hand firmly in hers im really sorry gabe it wasnt pity he was looking for he realized now that hed wanted her to be horrified wanted her to look at him and cringe back hed have an excuse then wouldnt he to step away from her and stop the headlong race to a future he couldnt see i spent some time in jail over a poker game i wasnt quick enough to spot as a sting he waited for her to comment on that but she said nothing i was a small fish but i got reeled in with the big ones when i got out i was smarter i worked some short cons but i was more into gambling than the grift working at stables was a good way to earn a stake and i liked the horses i stayed clean because i didnt like prison i didnt drink because every time i started to i smelled my old man and i got lucky finished he sat back and lit a cigar understand better now did he really think she couldnt see the anger the scarredover hurt people might pass by their table and see a man chatting over a meal enjoying the company but if they looked into his eyes really looked how could they miss that cold steely rage determined she put her hand back on his maybe i cant understand the way you mean but i think i know it was a nightmare to live with an alcoholic who hes not an alcoholic gabe cut in his tone frigid theres a difference between an alcoholic and a drunk kelsey no twelvestep program is going to change the fact that hes a drunk a mean one who likes to beat up on women or anyone weaker than he is and it wasnt a nightmare it was life my life she withdrew her hand youd rather i didnt understand he turned his cigar stared at the tip he hadnt realized that simple unquestioning sympathy would bring so many memories and the feelings that went with them swirling to the surface youre right id rather you look at me and take what you see or leave it were both a product of our upbringing gabe one way or another im not going to care about someone because of what they seem to be not again and if you want me youre going to have to accept that i care he tapped out his cigar that definitely sounds like an ultimatum it is she shoved her plate aside and picked up her jacket its a long drive home wed better get started she would think a great deal about the little boy who had hustled and conned his way through childhood a child who had gone to bed at night listening to whores and drunks instead of lullabies how much of the boy remained with the man she didnt know more she thought than gabe believed more she was certain than anyone would ever be allowed to see he had quite simply refashioned himself the smooth easy manners the stunning house on the hill his stable of champions how many of the upper crust of the racing circle knew his backalley upbringing if they did was it considered some amusing eccentricity whatever gabe wanted to the contrary she was beginning to understand him and whether he could see it or not she already cared it was nearly one am when bill cunningham hurried to answer the banging at his front door over his naked paunch he wrapped a chinese red silk robe a peek through the window made him glad marla his latest honey was a sound sleeper he liked to think it was great sex that had her snoring away in his big water bed but more likely it was the ludes she ate like candy whatever the reason it relieved him that he was alone to greet his late and unwelcome visitor i told you never to come here cunningham hissed while smoothing down what was left of his hair once the derby was over he was going to treat himself to a weave now now billy boy nobody saw me rich was past the midpoint of a solid drunk he didnt wobble didnt so much as slur a word but it showed in the sunbright glitter in his eyes and if they did hell no law against a man visiting an old poker buddy is there he grinned casting his gaze around the opulent foyer old bill had bounced back pretty well rich noted and figured he could squeeze his pal for a few more bills how about a drink are you crazy despite the fact that only marla was in the house and she was cruising on barbiturates cunningham whispered do you know the cops have been here here he repeated as if his overdone home were as sacrosanct as a church asking questions because some bigmouthed groom told them id let lipsky shovel shit for a couple of days told you that was a mistake but a little one he held up two fingers close together squinted at them wheres the bar bill im dry as the fucking sahara i dont want you drinking in my house richs grin only widened but his eyes turned hard now you dont want to talk to a business partner like that bill especially since i have a new proposition for you cunningham moistened his lips weve got our deal just what i want to talk about over a friendly drink all right all right but make it quick he shot a look up the stairs as he walked by them going into a sunken living room done in golds and royal blue and quiet ive got a woman upstairs you dog rich gave him a friendly poke in the ribs dont suppose shes got a friend ive been dry there awhile too no and keep your distance i dont want her to know about you or any of this shes built but shes not bright best kind of woman with an appreciative sigh rich dropped down into a widebacked chair covered in gold velvet you sure know how to live pal i always said that billy boy he knows how to live just make sure you dont go around saying it now cunningham poured two drinks both twelveyearold scotch it seemed like a waste on rich but he needed to impress always you were supposed to handle lipsky i did pleased with himself rich swirled the scotch sniffed it then swallowed it classy dont you think to put him down like you put down a horse cunninghams hand shook as he lifted his glass i dont want to hear about that im talking about before jesus rich nobody was supposed to get killed old mick was like a saint around the track an unforeseen complication rich said getting up to refill his glass and lipsky certainly paid for it but seeing that he did adds to my overhead bill its going to cost you another ten thousand are you nuts cunningham sprang up spilling some scotch you did that on your own rich to protect your investment it would have taken the cops five minutes to have lipsky pointing the finger at me it points at me he said affably it points at you so another ten billy its a fair price he swallowed hard the money that had come into his hands for big sheba had been a miracle but the miracle had a price you might as well ask for ten million im leveraged to the hilt rich had expected that and was ready to be reasonable i can wait until after may no problem whats a couple of weeks between friends now he crossed his legs ive come up with an idea billy a little variation on our theme that will pay off for both of us you want to collect at churchill downs and so do i but i also have a job to do and a score to settle with that boy of mine i dont give a good goddamn about your family problems as long as the job gets done but the idea of paying gabe back began to creep through him warming more thoroughly than the scotch this business with lipsky damn near ruined things not to worry not to worry lazily rich waved his glass ive got it covered with as i said a little alteration what kind of alteration well now rich sighed sipped im going to tell you and i think youre going to appreciate the irony of the deal billy boy i really think you are later when cunningham crawled back into bed he was shivering he wasnt a bloodthirsty man he assured himself it wasnt his fault two people were dead just the luck of the draw as rich had said maybe he was crazy to have tied in with rich slater but he was desperate and the timing had fallen so perfectly in his lap hed considered it a sign richs adjusted plan made a hideous kind of sense what choice did he have cunningham asked himself if he lost at churchill downs there would be no more marlas no more big country house no more strutting into the paddock big sheba was hed thought his ace in the hole hed sunk his money every spare dollar and all he could borrow into that filly and she had short lungs he squeezed his eyes shut cursing himself for gambling on the horse he needed the derby just the derby to recoup once that was done hed breed her he could live well on the price of her foals it had been done before he thought going back over richs plan and hed slipped through that without much more than a ripple one race he thought just one good race needing warmth he wrapped himself around marla until her snoring lulled him to sleep chapter fourteen it was a longer drive than kelsey remembered from rural virginia to suburban maryland a long time to think she didnt doubt she would meet with resistance and unless things had changed in the last few weeks formidable resistance candace was sure to have contacted milicent to tell her kelsey was on her way better to face them all at once kelsey decided to shock them disappoint them outrage them a perfect description she thought with a wry smile candace would be shocked her father disappointed and her grandmother outraged and she she hoped would be happy when she pulled up in the drive her father was working in the flower bed he wore an old sweater patched at the elbows and grimykneed chinos to weed the justbudding azaleas the surge of love came first as she dashed from her car and across the neatly trimmed lawn to hug him they stayed knee to knee admiring the flourishing shrubs i love this house she murmured resting her head on his shoulder just recently i realized how lucky i was to grow up here she thought of gabe and brushed a hand over salmoncolored blooms how lucky i was to have you to have flowers in the yard she smiled a little ballet lessons you hated ballet lessons after six months he remembered but i was lucky to have them he studied her face brushed at the hair that tumbled over her shoulders is everything all right kelsey yes weve been worried about you this recent violence i know she cut him off its horrible what happened to both of those men i wish i could tell you it doesnt affect me but of course it does but i am all right i like seeing that for myself phone calls arent the same he gathered his gardening tools in a wire basket well youre home now thats what matters lets go around through the back or candace will skin me alive for tracking the floors kelsey slipped an arm around his waist as they walked i see grandmothers car yes candace phoned her when you said you were driving in theyre inside planning for the spring charity ball at the club he shot her a sympathetic smile i believe finding you a suitable escort is at the top of their list she winced automatically then remembered the spring ball thats in may isnt it yes the first saturday that was the day when spring came to kentucky she thought the same day every year derby day she supposed missing the ball would be another sin on her part dad she waited as he set down his tools in the little mudroom that was as spotless as the rest of the house im not going to be in town that weekend not in town he moved through to the kitchen to wash his hands kelsey you havent missed a spring ball since you were sixteen i realize that im sorry but i have plans he said nothing only dried his hands on a towel the disappointment she thought had already begun i have plans she repeated id better tell all of you about them at once all right then trying not to worry he went with her to the sitting room candace and milicent were already there chatting over tiny crustless sandwiches and dresden cups of tea jasmine kelsey deduced after a discreet sniff of the air it occurred to her that if shed been at the barn at this time of day she might be wolfing down a sloppy coldcut sub and strong black coffee her tastes among other things had changed quickly kelsey with a delighted laugh candace rose to kiss both of her stepdaughters cheeks kelsey caught the subtle scent of lair du temps that mixed with the tea and her grandmothers signature chanel drawingroom scents kelsey thought shed gotten entirely too used to barnyard ones she embraced candace with more enthusiasm almost in apology you look wonderful new hairdo instinctively candace patted her short sable locks you dont think its too ingenue do you i swear princeton can talk me into anything its perfect kelsey assured her remembering suddenly that she hadnt visited princeton or any other hairdresser for that matter in weeks hello grandmother the greeting like the kiss on the cheek was stiff and dutiful youre looking well too youve gained back some weight i see milicent sipped her tea appraising kelsey over the rim its flattering be careful you dont let it go too far though small bones dont carry weight well most of its muscle kelsey flexed her biceps just to irritate it comes from shoveling manure and hauling hay smiling she turned to a dubious candace id love some tea dont worry i washed up after the morning workout of course of course sit down dear philip youre not carrying that garden with you not a speck he accepted the tea and a tiny sandwich without complaint when channing returned home that evening philip knew hed have company on a refrigerator raid the azaleas are early this year i dont think theyve ever looked better you say that every spring affectionately candace patted his hand you know were the only house on this block without a gardener and there isnt a yard that can compete with ours not when philip gets done working his magic a nice hobby milicent agreed ive always preferred tending my own roses she turned her attention to kelsey at least she thought the girl had had enough sense to dress suitably shed been nearly certain kelsey would flaunt her prickly stubbornness by driving out in muddy boots but the apricottoned jacket and slacks were flattering and tasteful as it happens she began candace and i were just discussing the floral arrangements for the spring ball were on the committee you have a good eye for such things kelsey well delegate you to work with the florist i appreciate the confidence but ill have to pass im afraid i wont be here for the ball candace laughed again poured more tea of course you will dear its expected i realize you might feel a little awkward with the divorce finalized and wade attending with his fiancée but you mustnt let it bother you in fact milicent and i were just working on a solution to that problem kelsey started to explain then stopped oh were you yes indeed all enthusiasm candace added a lump of sugar to her tea it was certainly sweet of channing to escort you last year but we hardly want that to become a tradition in any case people will talk less if you have a more conventional date the perfect hostess she offered around the tray of cucumber sandwiches as it happens june and roger millers son has just moved back to the area you must remember parker kelsey hes been practicing oral surgery in new york for the last few years and has just taken a position with a prestigious practice in dc she added with a sly smile parkers never married yes i remember him excellent family social status the right schools the right profession the right everything it wasnt his fault kelsey supposed that she saw him as a wade monroe clone ive already spoken with the millers pleased with the maneuver milicent sipped the delicately fragrant tea parker will escort you its all arranged typical kelsey thought fighting a rising anger it was all so typical im sure mr and mrs miller are delighted to have parker back in the area and youll have to give him my best but i wont be here im leaving for kentucky this week and wont be back until after the first weekend in may kentucky milicent snapped her cup down in its saucer why on earth are you going to kentucky the derby even in your circles grandmother its an acceptable event i imagine itll be a very hot topic of conversation at the ball after three willows colt wins it she looked at her father hoping he would understand im going to be there when he does this is inexcusable milicent shot back the bydens are founding members of that club back to your greatgrandfather we have always attended the ball things change kelsey fought to keep her tone reasonable rather than hard i have a job a responsibility and a need im not willing to overlook any of them for a dance at the country club and candace as much as i appreciate your concern i dont want an arranged escort im involved with someone oh candace blinked and struggled to look pleased well of course dear thats delightful you must bring him i dont think so in sympathy she squeezed candaces hand i dont think hes the country club type one of your stable hands i suppose milicent said bitterly no unable to help herself kelsey didnt leave it at that hes a gambler youre just like your mother spine ramrod stiff milicent rose i warned you she said to philip you wouldnt listen to me about naomi and you wouldnt listen to me about her daughter now we all pay the price milicent standing quickly candace hurried out of the room after her motherinlaw kelsey set her tea aside shed been sorry almost before the words were out not because of milicents feelings but her fathers that wasnt very tactful of me she began honesty was always more your forte than tact his voice was weary and stirred up more guilt youre disappointed i wish there was a way i could do what i need to do and not disappoint you its a situation that cant please everyone he rose turning his back to her as he walked to the windows he could see his azaleas the tight buds just freeing up the inner blossoms the blossoms wouldnt stay trapped but would burst through the wellmeaning protection and spring defiantly to life youve connected with her he said softly i cant say i didnt expect it so much about you is the same so much more than your looks a part of me a part im ashamed of wants to tell you that youre making a mistake that you dont belong there that part of me doesnt want to see how happy it makes you that you do belong there i feel as though ive found what im supposed to do that i dont need to race around the next corner to see if theres something there more interesting more important thats all i was doing with my life we both know it you were searching kelsey thats nothing to be ashamed of im not ashamed of it but im tired of it im good with the horses with the work with the people i cant go back to my apartment to busywork jobs to weekends at the club i feel as if im opening up because it hurt him to look at them now he turned away from the flowers breaking free yes i didnt know how dissatisfied i was especially with myself that may be candace swept back in her jaw was set her eyes angry but you had no reason to be rude your father and i and your grandmother are only trying to help you through a difficult time i think kelsey said slowly the problem is that this isnt as difficult for me as you think then you might think of others about how philip feels about how all of this looks to outsiders candace philip said this isnt necessary isnt it maybe youre right candace im very much concerned how dad feels im sorry but i dont have your sensibility about what outsiders think i dont want to embarrass you she continued or cause problems between the two of you yet you encouraged channing to deceive me and stay at that place boggy ground kelsey thought and cursed channing for leading her onto it i encouraged him to stay yes now he has some notion about going back there working there this summer flushed with emotion candace gripped the back of a chair she might have lured you away kelsey but i wont have her corrupting channing good god at wits end kelsey dragged her hands through her hair where does this come from you havent even met the woman but youve cast her as some bmovie siren who seduces young boys and destroys all she touches she didnt open her home to channing to corrupt him or to spite any of you she did it for me and she offered him the job because he showed an interest in the farm well i wont have it candace detested sounding shrewish resented the fact that kelseys stubbornness made her so i wont have my son loitering around racetracks and associating with gamblers and a convicted murderer kelsey dropped her hands thats certainly between you and channing yes it is its quite true i have no right to tell you what to do her lips quivered shed done her best by kelsey her very best to be a friend a guiding force instead of the textbook stepmother and now it seemed shed failed even if i did youd continue to do as you choose as youve always done philip stepped forward as perplexed as he was hurt by the outburst candace were losing the perspective here its only a club dance im sorry philip her angry embarrassment over the scene with milicent pushed her forward milicent was more than her motherinlaw she was her friend and her ally i feel i must have my say in this its much more than a dance its a matter of loyalty and proper behavior this situation cannot go on youve hurt your father enough by choosing naomi over him is that what you think im doing she whirled on her father is that what you think cant you believe that im capable of caring for both of you of learning to accept and forgive youve nothing to forgive philip for candace put in staunchly he did everything that was right i did what i thought best he murmured this is difficult for me kelsey i cant tell you it isnt but i still want whats best for you im trying to find out what that is or if not whats best at least whats right i dont want to hurt you in the process im sure you dont candace said wearily shed never really understood her stepdaughter why should that change now the problem here kelsey is the same as its always been you look straight ahead toward a goal and dont notice the consequences of achieving it and when you have it you dont always want it the thumbnail analysis stung more than any whip of anger which makes me cold and shallow her voice trembled no matter how she fought to control it its not the first time thats been pointed out to me so its hard to argue thats not true philip took her by the shoulders and certainly not what candace meant youre strongminded kelsey and you can be stubborn those are virtues as well as flaws candace took a mental step in retreat she knew from experience her preferences would never hold against a united front were concerned about you kelsey if i criticized too harshly its only because of that concern and the fact that the situation is becoming difficult for everyone the recent publicity has stirred up old memories people are beginning to talk and that puts your father in a delicate position two men were killed steadier kelsey stepped back i had no control over that nor do i have any over the gossip it generates two men were killed philip repeated can you expect us not to worry no i can only tell you it had nothing to do with me or three willows violence happens everywhere the racing world isnt a hive of vice and debauchery theres no time or energy for either when youre up at dawn every morning its work hard work some of it tedious some of it exciting and all of it to me rewarding theres no partying every night with champagne and mobsters hell most nights were sound asleep before ten ive watched foals being born and seen grown men sing a sick horse to sleep at night its not a disney movie but its no orgy of sin either philip said nothing he knew hed lost it might have been naomi standing there defending a world he had never understood and could never belong to im sure it has its merits candace tried for calm ive watched the kentucky derby myself on television and theres no denying the horses are magnificent the entire event exciting why the hanahans had an interest in a racehorse a few years ago you remember philip were not condemning the entire profession she supposed it was called were concerned about your associations you did say you were involved with a gambler kelsey let out a huff of breath i said that to needle grandmother what i should have said was that im interested in a man who owns a neighboring farm im sorry i caused trouble now ill apologize in advance because im about to cause more im not renewing the lease on my apartment im going to stay on at three willows at least for the time being i may look for a house later in the year but im going to keep working at the farm candace put a hand on philips arm a gesture of support and unity no matter what the consequences ill do my best to minimize them i realize you wont want to visit me there so ill come to you as often as i can ill be out of town for a while but ill call she picked up her purse and twisted the strap in her hands i dont want to lose you either of you you cant this will always be your home as philip gathered his daughter close candace said nothing it seemed to take longer to drive back a sobering interlude where kelsey wavered between tears and anger most of the anger died by the time she pulled up at three willows it left too much room for hurt she turned from the front door she didnt want to go inside just yet and face naomi certainly it would be poor form to discuss with her what had been said about her and the world she lived in better kelsey decided to get over it first to just sit with the fading daffodils and blooming dogwoods until the inner storm passed she lost her chance for solitude when gabe stepped onto the patio ive been looking for you oh i thought youd gone he joined her on the narrow stone bench that looked out over early pinks and columbine im not leaving until tonight hed wanted to see her again a simpleenough reason to juggle his plans taking her chin in his hand he had a good look shed been crying both that and the fact that it unnerved him came as a surprise whats wrong she shook her head shifted away do you spend much time on selfreflection not if i can avoid it its hard to do that when your faults are held up in front of you like a mirror you look at them and you see yourself he slipped an arm around her shoulders and kept his voice light whos been mean to you baby ill go beat him up with a half laugh she nuzzled against him then drew away im not a nice person gabe and i hardly ever think about trying to be it used to surprise me when someone would tell me i was spoiled or stubborn or singleminded and i could say to myself thats not true im just doing what seems right to me restless she rose leaving him on the bench while she took a few steps along the bricked path that wound through the infant flowers when wade said i was cold and selfabsorbed rigid unforgiving all those things i could rationalize that hed said it to justify his own adultery i wasnt hot enough in bed so he found someone who was i wasnt sympathetic enough interested enough in his career someone else was i refused to overlook the fact that id found him cozied up with another woman if i was too rigid to understand his physical needs well that was my problem ive never had any trouble tossing the baby out with the bathwater break a marriage vow the marriage is over and thats that well i am rigid she spun back ready to dare him to disagree theres right and theres wrong theres truth and there are lies theres law and theres crime take seat belts cautious he nodded all right take seat belts maybe before it was passed into law id forget to use mine youre busy youre in a hurry youre just going down the block why bother but the minute the law was passed kelsey straps herself in every time no question and you figure that makes you rigid before they passed the law it was just as stupid not to use them the law didnt change the basic common sense but i could ignore common sense never the law well speed limits she admitted but whenever i overlooked them i rationalized it if i went to atlanta to try to fix my marriage if i knew something was wrong with it and i was willing to make the effort to work on it why wasnt i willing to forgive what i found there because hed made a promise hed taken a vow and hed broken it that was enough for me gabe rubbed a hand over his chin do you want me to tell you that you were wrong to dump the bastard kelsey i cant for two reasons one i agree with you and two i want you myself i can say that if it had been you and me and id walked in on you cozied up with another guy hed be dead and youd be sorry does that help any she closed her eyes scrubbed both hands over her face how did i get into all of this my guess is youve had a rough morning whereve you been i went to see my father she wanted to cry again ridiculously and turned away until she had the tears fought back i wanted to tell him facetoface that i was giving up my apartment and staying on here at least for now so he gave you a hard time no not really not him hes the kindest man in the world im hurting him she let the tears come now the hell with them i dont want to i dont want to make him unhappy but i just cant bend enough not enough to make it all right for everyone he didnt say anything but simply rose and gathered her close he never battled words against tears it was best to let them flow until they ran clean this is stupid sniffling she searched her pocket for a tissue then took the bandanna gabe offered this whole thing started over a stupid dance the derby and the dentist why dont we sit down again and you can decode that for me its tradition she said and plopped down on the bench again and living up to family expectations im not going to claim that my childhood was fraught with peril but theres always been the byden name to live up to especially where my grandmothers concerned she balled the bandanna in her hand wished she could ball her anger and resentments with it and heave it away shes still miffed at me for divorcing wade putting that blot on the family honor needless to say shes furious about my being here struggling to lighten her own mood she forced a smile i have been in the best gothic tradition cut out of her will well he picked up her hand and toyed with her fingers you can always move in with me be a kept woman that ought to show her christ id have my name expunged from the family bible for that when he realized hed been only half joking he released her hand cant have that can we so what about the dance the derby and the dentist sounds like the title of a very bad play trying to relax she lifted her hair off her neck and shoulders then let it fall again when i went to see dad i had the bonus of grandmother and candace my stepmother eating cucumber sandwiches and planning the floral arrangements for the spring ball at the country club which they fully expected me to attend theyd even arranged for my escort since ive refused to date since i walked out on wade theyd hold it he held up a hand for my personal interest run that last part by me again about not dating i havent gone out with anyone in two years partly because until the divorce was final it felt wrong and partly mostly because i didnt want to sex has never been a driving force in my life he picked up her hand again kissed it we can fix that im trying to explain she tugged on her hand found it firmly caught in his and gave up the dentist an oral surgeon is the son of friends whos recently relocated to dc he meets all the byden standards you by the way dont thats the nicest thing youve ever said to me lets go back to my place and celebrate youre making me feel better i wasnt ready to feel better smiling she laid her head against his shoulder anyway i had to tell them not only that i wasnt interested in doctor acceptable but that i wouldnt make it to the spring ball at all its the first saturday in may the derby now all the pieces fall into place yes the derby that started a row a fairly civilized one initially but grandmother was getting under my skin so she gazed slyly at him from under her lashes i told her i was involved with a gambler just to piss her off youve got a nasty streak he caught her face in his hand and kissed her hard before she could decide to evade or not i like it they didnt grandmother stormed out my father looked devastated and candace was so angry weve butted heads before but this time she aimed low and she hit the mark the longer i stay here the more it disturbs the family and since im too rigid to bend i wont look for a compromise sometimes there isnt any compromise nice people find them a delicate situation he thought studying the young geraniums in the patio pots a family situation and he had very little experience with family did it ever occur to you that your family isnt looking for a compromise either he watched as she turned her face slowly to his all or nothing isnt that basically how theyve put it i hadnt thought of it that way no because youre so cold youre so rigid youre so hard that youve automatically taken all the blame for it they can toss out the guilt threaten to disinherit you tell you how selfish you are but its all your fault to her knowledge no one had ever taken her side against the family certainly not wade it had always been she whod caused the scenes ruffled the feathers strange that it had never passed through her mind that their side of issues was as unyielding as her own im doing what i want regardless regardless of what he demanded perhaps hed never had a family to shelter him but neither had he had one to lock him in with guilt and obligation regardless of the fact that some people have to make adjustments if you trotted off to your dance with the designated dentist would it make any difference no she said after a long moment it would just postpone the next scene are you staying here to spite them of course not insulted she snapped her head back of course not she said again this time more subdued this must seem awfully foolish to you all of this chaos over propriety and tradition i just figure youve beaten yourself up long enough over who you are and what you want feeling better much she let out a big cleansing sigh im glad you were still around slater i wanted to see you again before i left his fingers slid over the nape of her neck teasing out chills youre screwing up my schedule kelsey oh she kept her eyes on the hands shed folded in her lap im starting to think about you before my eyes are open in the morning i figure there are three times when a mans most vulnerable when hes drunk when hes lost himself in sex and at that instant right before he wakes up i dont drink and i havent had any interest in sex with another woman since i saw you but youve caught me in that one instant when the defenses are down shed had men recite poetry to her who hadnt stirred her so deeply emotionally romantically sexually shed lifted her gaze to his as hed spoken drawn by that soft alluring voice now she was caught now she was defenseless im afraid of you shed had no idea shed felt it much less that shed been about to say it good that makes us even he framed her face slowly combing her hair back with his fingers drawing out the moment so that they would both remember birdsong spring flowers the slant of the afternoon sun then the jolt of mouth against mouth the quick leap of a heart the long slow moan of mutual pleasure what happens inside me when i do that scares the hell out of me he rested his brow against hers while the new and almost familiar emotions worked through him the fact that as soon as ive done it i want to do it again scares me even more me too its probably best youre going away for a few days theres so much to think about ive about finished thinking kelsey she nearly had her breath back and nodded me too with some regret she eased away good luck at keeneland and thanks for the shoulder i needed it i guess i needed you chapter fifteen naomi didnt question kelseys decision to accompany the team to kentucky shed wanted her there badly but hadnt allowed herself to take it for granted naomi no longer took anything for granted the only disagreement between them occurred when kelsey insisted on paying her own expenses naomi simmered over it privately during the packing and preparations throughout the flight and while theyd checked into their hotel it wasnt until shed asked kelsey to join her in her suite that the simmering boiled over this is absurd agitated naomi paced ignoring the light meal and bottle of wine shed ordered up to help keep the discussion amiable youre here with three willows farm youll be helping boggs with pride its a simple business expense im here kelsey corrected because i want to be here because i wouldnt miss the bluegrass stakes or the derby for anything in the world and im extra baggage as far as prides concerned moses and his team dont need me i do naomi shot back before she could stop herself do you know what it means to me to have you here to have you want to be here to know after all this time and all the loss that youll be standing with me not just at post time but through all the wonderful foolishness that goes on before that final two minutes id rather have you here from now until the first saturday in may than win a dozen derbies and you wont even let me settle your hotel bill more than a little taken aback kelsey stared as her mother stalked around the room shed never seen naomi so overwrought so brimful of emotion finally here was the woman who had laughed for her wedding photo who had flirted recklessly with men who had killed one it just didnt seem right to me kelsey began but stopped the moment naomi whirled on her why isnt it right because i wasnt the conventional mother because i was in a cell when i should have been teaching you to tie your shoes thats not what i i dont expect you to forgive that naomi snapped back i dont expect you to forget it youre not required to love me or even to think of me as your mother but i thought you were beginning to think of three willows as your home and how kelsey wondered had she started this whirlwind by simply using her own charge card i do she said carefully ready to parry the next explosion that doesnt mean i want to take advantage of it or you but the explosion didnt come naomi sat deliberately fighting back her anger if you dont want to accept the trip from me id like you to accept it from three willows your association there might very well have cost you at least part of your inheritance i regret that so this is a payment on guilt all right kelsey threw up her hands when naomis eyes went to smoke this is silly i didnt realize you were so worked up over it pay the bill if its important to you she tossed back her hair you know ive always wondered where my temper came from dad is placid as a lake and you youre so cool so controlled so in charge its worth losing a fight to have seen that i come by my temperament honestly im glad i could solve one of lifes little mysteries for you after a jerky shrug naomi plucked a strawberry from the fruit plate shed ordered win or lose a fight makes me hungry want to eat yeah kelsey chose a slice of apple i want to tell you something she began in a tone that had naomis hand pausing as she poured wine i do think of you as my mother i wouldnt still be here if i didnt naomi leaned forward and kissed kelseys cheek then steadying her hand she filled their glasses to the women of three willows she tapped her glass against kelseys ive waited a long time to drink to that the days before the bluegrass stakes passed in a blur kelsey met more people than she could ever remember she rose each morning at dawn to watch the workouts worrying comparing pride to every other colt and filly who soared through the mist she haunted the shedrow studying jockeys judging trainers and badgering boggs for tidbits of news or speculation whenever she could corner him she harassed reno prodding him for his thoughts grilling him over strategy she worried over him over the colt over the track hey he asked her whos going to ride that colt you or me she pouted a bit rocking back on her heels as the two of them spent a private moment with pride you are but but youd rather have your hands on the reins the pout turned into a small smile maybe she stroked prides nose enjoying its warmth its softness i guess ive got the fever youre burning up with it reno hooked his thumbs in the pockets of his navy silk suit he had a woman waiting for him and a great deal on his mind thats part of it isnt it the nerves the ambition she took the apple shed been saving and held it out to pride the love it gets to you reno agreed it would be of no use telling her that sooner or later other things would interfere with the innocence of it the numbers the angles the odds shed find out for herself he thought and gave her a friendly pat on the back you keep our boy happy kiddo and remind him about that kentucky colt keep him on edge with a wink reno sauntered out of the barn you dont have to worry about that flash in the pan kelsey assured pride he cant compare to you pride crunched his apple obviously in complete agreement midnight hour a kentuckybred colt was the local favorite hed been the surprise winner of the florida derby outdistancing both pride and double by a neck the small easily spooked roan was getting a lot of national press and kelsey had to admit this one was a beauty the classic lines the unpredictable disposition the fire in the eyes the colt used a shadow roll on the track to prevent him from shying at shadows and things that werent there but he could run shed seen that for herself bill cunninghams filly had her supporters as well one didnt have to admire the man to admire his horse sheba had heart and courage and could break through the gate like a tornado but the sound of her wheezing after a hard workout chilled kelseys blood there were others who showed heart and grit not the least of which was gabes double but kelseys money was on pride she told herself it wasnt simply loyalty not even simply love but the eye she was beginning to develop under mosess careful tutelage the colt was one in a million as she was sure her own honor was the day of the stakes she stood beside her mother eager to have her confidence justified he looked so good this morning kelsey took long deep breaths she wanted to enjoy the post parade the pageantry the anticipation but she couldnt stop talking moses said he had reno hold him back a little because he wanted to keep him on edge the fields hard and fast just the way he likes it i heard some of the clockers the sentiments riding with midnight hour but the cool heads are split almost even between pride and double she rubbed a hand over her mouth still sudden force might be the missing link thats the chestnut colt in from arkansas he looked ready this morning and we cant count out cunninghams filly shes got such heart amused and impressed naomi ran a soothing hand up and down kelseys arm just take a deep breath itll all be over in a few minutes i just have time to wish my two favorite ladies good luck gabe slipped between them kissed them both looks like were both seven to five he commented studying the odds board what do you say the winner buys dinner and the loser springs for the champagne naomi gave him a quick grin ive always preferred to have a man buy my drinks good one kelsey murmured then rather than taking a breath she held it the horses were being led to the gate from the shelter of the stands rich watched his son the boy had always had taste in females and the devils own luck with them just like his old man rich thought and patted the derriere of the tipsy little blonde hed picked up the night before keep your eye on number three he told her ive got me an interest in that horse a real close interest the bell sounded the horses surged forward and the woman beside him squealed and began to cheer boozily for number three rich narrowed eyes shielded behind mirrored lenses the local favorite had the lead with the colt from arkansas pressing close to the rail the pack was hardly more than a blur of color and pounding legs but he never lost sight of number three cunninghams filly ran valiantly clipping the lead down to a neck by the first turn but already virginias pride was bursting out of the pack eating up the light spewing up turf rich nodded slowly a smile beginning to curve his mouth double won the rail and streaked up the inside on the backstretch even the thunder of hooves was lost in the wild cheers of the crowd for an instant one of those gorgeous photographic moments three horses were neck and neck strides almost in unison silks blazing then pride drove forward a nose a neck a halflength they crossed the wire within fractions of a second virginias pride double or nothing big sheba win place show rich tossed back his head and laughed honey ive hit the big time she pouted swirled her beer number three didnt win rich laughed again fingering the ticket for the thousand dollars hed put on prides nose thats what you think darling old richies hunches always pay off oh god kelsey still had her hands covering her mouth toward the end shed nearly given in to the urge to place them over her eyes he did it he won on a whoop of laughter she tossed her arms around naomi congratulations its just the prelude to the derby i can feel it so can i naomi squeezed back hard ignoring the sudden intrusion of cameras and press come with me to the winners circle i want you with me you couldnt keep me away she swung back to gabe for someone whod just lost by half a length he looked awfully pleased with himself your colt ran a good race he did yours ran better he tugged the braid that rained down her back this time see you at dinner the victory glow wasnt allowed to distract anyone from the job at hand theyd stay in kentucky until after the derby moving from keeneland to churchill downs dawn still meant workouts clockers black coffee and trainers watching from the backside rail only this was the derby workouts were no longer a private affair even as exercise boys roused themselves from bed reporters were setting up equipment television newspapers magazines all wanted features all wanted that definitive interview that perfect picture kelsey knew what hers would have been the soft dawn that most magical time for horse and horseman with mist rising blurring color muffled sound and the signature twin spires of the track spearing up through it tubs of hot water added steam birds sang their morning song spring had come to louisville but there was still a vague chill at this hour bracing exciting it touched off more white steam from the flanks and shoulders of horses returning from a gallop pampered and pushed they slipped through the mists as magically as any pegasus rising from hooves to wings but they were athletes it was easy to forget that these halfton creatures balanced on breadstick legs had been born to run of the thousands of thoroughbreds foaled every year only a few a special few would ever walk through the morning fog at this track on this week only one would stand on saturday with a blooming blanket of red roses over its glistening back grooms carried the tubs and the wrappings moving through the thinning swirl among the horses while the sun streamed softly burning away the dawn turning dew to diamonds a cat meowed boot heels crunched and then the sound of hooves on dirt eerily disembodied at first then growing swelling as the grayish mists parted like water a colt swimming through them that was her picture the memory kelsey would take with her quiet and comforting amid all the colors and the pageantry what are you doing kelsey said nothing at first simply took gabes hand in hers she should have known he would walk into the scene and make himself part of the memory taking a picture i dont want all this to get lost with the parties and the press and the pressure youre up early for someone who couldnt have gotten to bed before two who can sleep in answer gabe nodded toward a stableboy who was leaning back against the barn wall dozing she laughed and took a deep gulp of air swallowing the scents of horse liniment leather manure its too new to me i saw your jockey working double this morning they looked good i saw you leaning on the backstretch rail you looked good i dont know how you have the energy to flirt with all thats going on this is like mardi gras a kiwanian convention and the super bowl rolled into one she began to walk parades hotair balloon races owners dinners trainers dinners that steamboat race yesterday ive never seen anything like it i won five thousand she snorted figures who was foolish enough to bet against you he grinned moses she tugged down the brim of her cap well with his ten percent of saturdays purse he can afford it youre getting cocky darling ive always been cocky youre going to the museum for the draw arent you wouldnt miss it he hadnt missed the drawing of the field in five years his presence or lack of it would make no difference as to which position his colt was assigned but it was his colt theres breakfast in the old paddock before hungry moaning she pressed a hand to her stomach ive done more grazing than a holstein since i got to louisville i think ill skip it if you she trailed off noting his attention had wandered no she realized it was more than that it had focused frozen beamed in like a laser on something back at the shedrow something wrong no for an instant hed thought hed seen his father that familiar swagger the pastel suit so out of place among denim and cotton but it had been only a glimpse and surely rich slater wouldnt be wandering around the barns at churchill downs at an hour past dawn no he said again and shook off the automatic dread if you dont want to eat come watch me he didnt think any more about it before the morning was over gabe was busy analyzing his colts numberthree position with jamison and his jockey we got the rail kelsey stood with boggs in the barn nibbling on one of the apples she had in her pockets while the old groom hooked wraps on a line its a sign from god boggs took one of the clothespins clipped to his pant leg and meticulously hooked a royal blue wrap i figure god watches the derby like everybody probably got his favorite he ran his fingers over a saddle well worn the irons rubbed and polished by his own hand i might just put some of these dead presidents i got in my pocket down on that colt i thought you never bet dont with the same slow care he draped a blanket over the line not since april he shot her a look to see if she realized that was the year her mother had killed alec bradley when there was nothing in her eyes but mild interest he continued was at keeneland too over to lexington for the stakes race three willows had a derby hopeful then too fine colt i loved that colt moren i ever loved a woman name was sun spot i guess i got me a fever cause i put a months pay on him he came out of the gate like a whirlwind like he could already see the wire at the first turn the colt beside him stumbled bumped him hard spot went down knew as soon as i saw him go hed not race again shattered his near foreleg nothing to do but put him down your ma put the gun behind his ear herself was her colt and she cried when she did it but she did what had to be done he sighed gustily so i aint never bet since maybe its bad luck if i do she put an arm around boggs and together they studied the tools of his trade the drying wrappings the blinkers the blankets and cotton padding nothings going to happen to pride he nodded taking the apple kelsey offered him its a mistake to love a horse miss kelsey he polished the apple on his shirt and handed it back to her they break your heart one way or another she only smiled tossed the apple up caught it is this for me boggs or for pride his gummy grin split his face he does like his apples then id better go give it to him when she started out boggs shifted then scratched his throat you know i saw somebody today i aint seen in a while somebody i knew back in that spring of oh stalling boggs took the apple from her and twisted it in his gnarled hands so that it came apart in two neat halves mr slaters old man gabes father you saw him here thought i did but my eyes arent what they were funny hed be here i recollect he was around the day spot went down kicked up a fuss too like as if miss naomi had planned to lose the race and the horse that day course he was drunk but rich slaters persuasive they checked the horse for drugs kelsey stood the sun at her back her face in shadow and what did they find they didnt find nothing in that colt the chadwicks run clean but they found them in the colt that bumped him amphetamines who owned the colt cunningham he spat on the ground funny isnt it fingers pointed at cunningham at first but it turned out the jockeyd done it benny morales damn good rider he was left a note that said so before he hung himself in cunninghams tack room god thats horrible theres plenty that dont smell so sweet around racehorses miss kelsey rich slater he had it figured that the chadwicks bribed benny to drug his horse sos even if he won hed be disqualified ifn they found out thats pure shit of course but a man like thats got to point the blame at somebody thing was most everybody lost that day probably wasnt him i saw but i figured if it was you might want to keep your distance i will rich slater had no intention of crossing paths with anyone from three willows he was there as a spectator and although it would certainly have been wiser for him to be well away from louisville on saturday he wanted a frontrow seat he was on a roll a wad of bills in his pocket a willing woman in his bed and a raucous round of parties at his fingertips hed made it finally to the big time and the best part the sweetest part was the people who would go down as he went up he had to admit he was brilliant and he made sure he didnt get drunk enough to share that opinion with anyone but himself not only would he pay off an old debt and slap down his ungrateful son he would also make a small fortune doing it and really he was doing nothing at all hed simply put the right instrument in the right hands the chadwick bitch would pay naked he padded over to the honor bar to raid the stingy bottles of liquor his companion for derby week was passed out on the bed her tight little body sprawled on the tangled sheets hed proved his manhood there he told himself and toasted the reflection in the mirror he still had it with the glass in his hand rich preened in front of the mirror his vanity was blind to the loose flesh sagging at his waist he saw the body of a thirtyyearold trim and tough the body hed passed on to his son who had blown him off with a fivethousanddollar check wouldnt let your dad spend a night under your roof ill own the fucking roof when im done he tossed back the whiskey and watched his throat ripple as he swallowed the boy thought he was better than anybody always had in a couple of days he wouldnt be so high and mighty in a couple of days the worm would have turned he really had to thank circumstances past and present for giving him the opportunity cunningham was a bonus one that had fallen beautifully into his lap of course the man was a fool but fools were the best birds to pluck and he was going to be plucking cunningham for many years to come a nice steady sideline of blackmail would bring in a nice steady income but the payoff oh the payoff would come just before six pm on saturday a job he was sure everyone would agree well done he opened another bottle poured another drink he wondered if naomi chadwick would remember him if he walked right up to her took a handful of that pretty little butt would she remember him he was tempted to try it to walk right up and give her a quick squeeze and a wink he didnt like the idea that a woman any woman could forget rich slater he remembered her all right he remembered that fancy spoiled bitch advertising herself in lowcut dresses or skintight jeans strutting around the track like a filly in heat spreading her legs for any man who could still get a hardon hed wanted her bad wanted to lift those frilly skirts and dive in show her what a real man could do but when hed offered shed looked at him as though he were something smeared on the bottom of her boot after a walk through the paddock and shed laughed at him laughed until hed wanted to smash his fist into that beautiful face maybe he would have rich thought absently pounding one clenched hand into the palm of the other maybe he would have if that halfbreed jew hadnt come along problem here miss naomi no moses no problem just a track rat hows our boy doing shed sashayed off flicking her tail to coo over her prize colt and rich had had no choice but to go home to the dingy rooms hed rented and smash his fist into his wifes pale homely face instead thought she was too good for him shed cost him his pride that day but hed cost her a great deal more later when hed fixed the race that hadnt been his intention of course nobody could have predicted morales would lose control of his hypedup horse and knock into hers so hard but then again he thought now then again it had turned out fine better than fine because hed been smart hed been cagey and hed used the circumstances against her hed paid her back all right but he wasnt through the ten years shed spent in prison had been only partial payment the rest of the debt was coming due saturday kelsey passed on the derby day breakfast at the governors mansion not only couldnt she eat she couldnt bear the idea of being so far away from the track post time for the first race was precisely eleventhirty like the grooms jockeys and trainers kelsey was there by six the idea of going back to the hotel at noon for a nap was impossible instead she stayed with boggs and some of the other crew nibbling on the fried chicken shed bought still here moses dropped down on the ground beside her and poked in the bucket for a thigh where else she was eating from nerves rather than hunger and washed down the chicken with ginger ale you could sit in your box its already a hell of a show the infields packed grandstands filling up too nervous besides some reporter will just stick a microphone or a camera in my face you wont avoid them here either your mamas got pull you could hide out in the matt winn room uhuh kelsey licked her fingers thats for businessmen might as well be sitting in a boardroom thats no place to watch the race hows naomi wired you wouldnt know it to look at her but shes wound tight half of thats you being here she wants you holding that trophy with her we could do it couldnt we im not going to tempt the gods and say so he squinted up at the sky good day dry clear weve got a fast track i was out there earlier while they were prepping it its beautiful all those neat furrows i was going to watch some of the early races but it just made me jittery because her stomach still had too much room to flutter she chose another piece of chicken have you seen gabe hes sharing the box with naomi hell be back around to harass jamie and stand in the paddock while his colts saddled things were so busy yesterday i barely saw him and never alone i didnt know whether to bring it up since i have a pretty good idea how he feels but boggs mentioned that he thought he saw gabes father when moses asked so quickly kelsey was flustered well uh thursday late morning he said he wasnt sure moses she scrambled to her feet because hed already gotten up and was heading toward the barn the mans trouble he spat out bad medicine bad medicine she wanted to smile but she couldnt make her lips obey come on moses some people carry trouble with them and like to pass it out rich slaters like that he moved quickly to prides box satisfying himself then forcing himself to relax horses picked up on emotions he wanted pride edgy revved but not spooked if hes around i dont want him near here the guards wont let anyone in who isnt authorized boggs wasnt even certain besides what trouble could he cause none moses stroked the colts nose murmured to him softly guess im wired too slaters old news bad news but old boggs told me about the race in lexington when sun spot broke down hard that was hard on her slater tried to stir up a hornets nest there but they stung the wrong person benny morales was a good jockey he was making a comeback that year hed been out for a while with a broken back cunningham put him up on his colt i was never sure if benny doctored that colt because he needed the money that bad or if he just needed to beat the chadwick colt it hardly mattered why moses thought now the worst had happened hed been riding for three willows when he took a bad spill at a morning workout it was a year and a half before he was back on his feet mr chadwick offered him a job assistant trainer but benny wanted to ride wanted to prove himself so cunningham put him up was he capable i cant say he ate a lot of painkillers worked himself to death to get back down to weight there werent a lot of takers so cunningham bought him cheap it ended up costing a lot more than a cut of the purse well he stroked pride again thats old news weve got a new race here the race its almost time to take our boy to the paddock a horse would take this walk from barn to paddock on the first saturday in may only once less than three years before he would have frolicked cheerfully alongside his mother in green pastures one of the first steps in a dream as a yearling he might have danced in meadows raced his companions or his own shadow training growing as muscle and bone developed learning the poetry and power of movement that was exclusive to the breed he would come to the bridle eager or fitful feel the first weight of man on his back in a dawnwashed stall one day he would be walked to an iron gate and urged to accept the confinement he would have trained on the longe on the practice oval he would learn the scent of his groom feel heat in his legs and the crop on his back he would do what he had been born to do he would run but he would take this walk to this race only once there was no second chance at they were in the paddock pride moving into his stall to be saddled tattoos were checked as were the colors and markings of each of the seventeen entrants no different from any other race and different from any other there had been only one scratch no one mentioned the colt from california who had broken down at the morning workout with an injured foot bad luck inside the jockeys quarters riders stepped on scales one hundred and twentysix pounds no more no less including tack reno stepped up watched the scale and smiled the hours in the steam room had been worth it moments later the silks bright riders made their way from the second floor of their quarters to the paddock the waiting was nearly over in the stands people grew restless excited jubilant celebrations continued in the infield some of them heated from liquor smuggled inside hollowed loaves of bread or diaper bags the odds board flickered and the betting windows were packed it was the horses were saddled their lead ponies outfitted brightly with braided tails and flowers despite the powderpuff clouds riding high overhead the air was thick tension had weight dont worry about taking the lead moses told reno let the kentucky colt set the pace through the first turn pride runs well in the pack hell thread like a needle reno agreed though his voice was cool casual he was sweating under his silks and talk to him talk to him hell run his heart out if you ask him to reno nodded struggling to keep his cocky smile in place there was so much riding on that quick two minutes riders up at the paddock judges announcement moses slapped a hand on renos shoulder then vaulted him into the saddle they would head back through the tunnel now on the way to the track ready naomi clasped a hand over kelseys yeah she took a deep breath then another yeah me too after two steps naomi shook her head wait one minute in her trim red suit and elegant pearls she made a dash across the paddock she was laughing when she caught up with moses threw her arms around him and kissed him naomi blushing with a combination of pride and embarrassment like a schoolboy caught pinching the head cheerleader he wiggled away whats wrong with you theres people watching she finished and kissed him again the hell with your reputation moses she was still laughing as she dashed back to kelsey well that settles that amused and oddly touched kelsey fell into step with her does it a running argument weve had for more years than i care to count he hasnt wanted our relationship made public because its unseemly for a woman in my position she tossed back her hair god she felt young and free and incredibly happy nothing but male pride of course which they all wear in their jockstraps kelsey snorted out a laugh why dont you just marry him hes never asked me and i suppose i have too much female pride to ask him speaking of males she saw gabe walking toward them id like to say before he can hear me that there is one of the most gorgeous examples of the species that ive ever seen theres something about the eyes kelsey murmured and the mouth and the cheekbones her smile curved slyly and of course theres that incredible butt ive noticed naomi giggled just because im nearly old enough to be his mother doesnt mean ive lost my eyesight ladies gabe cocked his head when two women had gleams like that in their eyes something was up want to share the joke they looked at each other and shook their heads in unison nope each hooked an arm through one of his and strolled to their box to the strains of my old kentucky home deep in the stands surrounded by picture hats and silk jackets rich slater swirled his third mint julep the seats bill cunningham had arranged for him werent choice but hed sprung for a new pocketsize set of binoculars with them he watched gabe escort the women up to their glitzy box quite a picture they made he thought naomi in her flashy red suit the daughter in her flashy blue both blond heads gleaming like a couple of sexy bookends for the tall dark man between them he wondered if the boy had taken them both to bed yet a blond sandwich with four milky legs and arms hed bet they could fuck like rabbits look honey arent they the cutest things with the flowers in their hair cherri whod lasted out the week with him due to tireless sex and a high tolerance for sloe gin fizzes tugged on his arm dutifully rich shifted his attention back to the game at hand they sure are baby cute as can be the entrants were ponied around the track their flowerbedecked escorts carrying liveried riders the arkansas colt danced and tried to nip at the colt in front of him the pony rider helped the jockey calm him the entrants cantered around the track to the cheers of the crowd its incredible kelsey said all of it just incredible she shook her head at gabes offer of a drink i cant swallow i can hardly breathe oh god theyre loading them in the gate everyone was in place horses jockeys assistants officials in the stewards stand two judges stood outside peering through binoculars waiting for the start a third remained in the stewards room with two television monitors others were stationed at poles and the finish line from the announcers booth it is now post time once they started the derby with a whip now it was the press of a button and the words everyone had waited for and theyre off a plunge through the gate the roar of the crowd and the first feet of the race were eaten up by flashing hooves kelseys heart leaped to her throat and stayed there so much color so much sound could be lost in the blur of dazzled eyes and speeding pulse the pack swept past the grandstands for the first time around the clubhouse turn the first quarter whizzed by in a fraction more than twentytwo seconds with the kentuckybred favorite in the lead with her binoculars all but glued to her eyes kelsey searched the pack for pride his colors blazed as he began to surge forward almost hoofbeat to hoofbeat with gabes colt cunninghams game big sheba thundered between them hes moving up hes moving up she was screaming but didnt know it her voice was lost in the wall of sound naomis fingers were on her arm digging in pride nosed out midnight hour at the halfmile in fortyfive seconds flat reno curved over his back she could see the turf fly the swing of silk as bats were whipped the incredible power of long slender legs bunching reaching lifting midnight hour dropped back to fourth horse and rider battling for the rail at threequarters pride inched ahead a neck a halflength but the longshot colt dug in and stole back the distance a twohorse race some would say with the valiant filly behind by two lengths at the mile the arkansas colt surged from the pack making a bid for a comefrombehind that had the crowd frenzied then that last sprint for the wire all or nothing it happened fast just before the sixteenth pole pride stumbled those plunging forelegs folding like toothpicks reno balanced in the irons sailed over his head and rolled like a stone into the infield as horses and riders fought and veered in the dust cloud to prevent a collision the colt made one fitful attempt to rise then crumpled on his ruined legs and stayed down double or nothing sailed under the wire in two minutes three and threequarter seconds as grooms scurried from everywhere onto the track to aid the injured champion chapter sixteen there was no thrill of victory for gabe in the winners circle a gold trophy a blanket of roses the color of blood cameras whirled capturing the derby winner the champion virginia colt with his redandwhite silks stained with dirt and sweat the jockey leaned forward over doubles glistening neck to accept his own dozen blooms his face grim rather than triumphant as he stroked the colt mr slater was all he could say when gabe gripped his hand ah christ mr slater gabe only nodded you ran a good race joey a derby record joeys eyes circled by the grime where his goggles had shielded them registered no pleasure at the news reno pride i dont know yet take your moment joey you and the colt earned it gabes arms went around the colts neck ignoring the sweaty dirt well deal with the rest later he turned to jamison trying to block the cameras aimed at him the questions hurled you were closer jamie could you tell what happened his face nearly translucent with shock his eyes glazed with it jamison stared down at the roses in his arms he broke down gabe that sweet colt just broke he looked up then a flare of desperation burning through the shock double wouldve taken him hed have nipped him at the wire his voice was a plea i know it i feel it it doesnt matter now does it but gabe laid a hand on his shoulder in support the taste of victory might have been bitter but he couldnt refuse it the guards kept the press and the fans at bay kelsey could hear the tide of their voices from behind the privacy screen see the shadows moving on it there were cheers there were questions there were demands but all that was another world behind the thin white wall between life and death here there was only her mothers quiet weeping moses he rocked naomi stroking her hair holding on to her and her grief oh moses why i shouldnta bet boggs stood tears streaming down his face prides saddle clutched to his heaving chest i shouldnta gently kelsey ran her hand over prides neck so soft she thought so still dirt streaked his coat a testament to the effort he should be washed she thought dimly he should be washed and brushed and pampered with the apples he loved so much she lingered over one last caress then forced herself to rise kelsey picked up the dirtstreaked blinders and laid them gently over the saddle take his things back to the barn boggs it aint right miss kelsey no it isnt and her heart was aching with the horrible wrongness of it but you take care of his things like always we need to get my mother away from here somebodys got to stay somebodys got to see to him im going to stay eyes blurred with tears he stared at her then nodded thats fittin like a page bearing away his warriors sword and shield he turned and left them holding on to her own control kelsey crouched moses she needs you will you take her back to the hotel theres a lot to handle here kelsey ill handle what i can the rest will have to wait she put a hand on naomis back and gently moved it up and down as if to smooth out the trembles mom only moses was aware it was the first time kelsey had used the term go with moses now ravaged by guilt and grief naomi rose limply when moses lifted her to her feet she looked back down at the colt virginias pride she thought her pride he was only three she murmured maybe i cant hang on to anything longer than that dont though she had her own demons to fight kelsey gripped naomis hand there are a lot of people out there you have to get through them yes her eyes went blind i have to get through them kelsey walked her past the screen and winced at the sudden press of bodies and sound she knew she would remember this all of her life the thrill of the race the shock of the fall the cheers and screams of the crowd that had fallen into sudden terrible silence the way the grooms had raced toward the fatal spot and all the confusion and movement of getting both horse and rider from the field how many times would she close her eyes and see the way prides legs had buckled at that crazy angle or hear her mothers soft breathy weeping kelsey gabe had rushed from the winners circle to the stables holding on to one thin thread of hope it snapped the moment he saw her face goddammit he pulled her against him held on they had to put him down she allowed herself one moment just one with her face pressed against his chest no he was already gone boggs reached him first but it was already over im sorry christ im sorry reno she drew in a steadying breath theyve taken him to the hospital the paramedics dont think its serious but were waiting for word she straightened then brushed the tears from her cheeks i have to deal with the rest of this now not alone she shook her head if she let herself lean shed crumble i need to do it for my mother for the colt ill see you back at the hotel later im not leaving you here i have boggs the rest of the crew the heat died from his eyes he stepped back increasing the distance nodded briskly ill get out of your way if it turns out you need anything jamie will be around thank you it was a nightmare when kelsey staggered back to the hotel near midnight her emotions were like a raw wound she knew the officials had already spoken with moses and her mother theyd told her theyd told her she hadnt just lost a prized colt it hadnt simply been chance or fate or boggss bad luck it had been murder pride had been injected with a lethal dose of amphetamines a drug that had overworked his heart one that as hed galloped valiantly around turns down the stretch had fed off his own adrenaline and sped greedily through his nervous system until at the sixteenth pole that heart had stopped now three willows and everyone involved would face questions speculation investigation had they drugged their horse misjudging the dose gambling somehow that the drug wouldnt be found in prides saliva or had someone else a competitor doctored the horse and the odds someone who wanted to win so badly he would assassinate the colt and risk the life of the man on his back she hesitated in front of the door to her mothers suite what else could be said there naomi had moses to comfort her to reassure her she turned to her own room but couldnt face it under the fatigue was a ruthless energy that continued to whip at her mind riding it she walked quickly down the hall and knocked on gabes door he wasnt sleeping he hadnt expected her not after shed sent him away certainly not after hed gotten the news about pride but she was there her eyes shadowed her face so delicately pale he thought he could pass his hand through it he simply stepped back and let her in youve heard yes i heard sit down kelsey before you collapse i cant im afraid if i sit still ill never get moving again someone killed him gabe thats what it comes down to someone wanted pride out of the running so badly they murdered him he crossed the parlor to the wet bar and busied himself opening a bottle of mineral water my colt won yes im sorry i havent even congratulated you but then she saw his eyes and stopped cold do you think i came here to accuse you even to ask if you had something to do with it while his blood raged his hands were steady casually pouring sparkling water over ice its a logical step the hell with that and the hell with you if you think so little of me i think so little of you his laugh was quick and harsh what i think of you and about you kelsey is hardly the point the facts are your horse is dead and mine raced me to somewhere in the neighborhood of a million dollars in just over two minutes thats a pretty good motive for murder and you wont be alone in thinking it so she shoved away the glass he offered to her spilling water onto the carpet facts and logic then you forgot an ingredient slater character so i did he set her glass aside and sipped leisurely from his own well mines black enough let me tell you something about yourself gabriel slater high roller tough guy youre a marshmallow about those horses youre as dazzled by and devoted to them as any twelveyearold girl dreaming about black beauty she tossed back her head delighted to see those carefully controlled eyes widen in shock excuse me you love them you fucking love them did you think it wouldnt get around that you tried to buy cunninghams filly because you were worried she was being mishandled the shield dropped down again but shed seen behind it and plowed on you think your crew doesnt talk to ours about how you play with the foals like they were puppies or sit up at night when youve got a sick horse youre a sucker slater ive got an investment youve got a love affair and another thing she continued poking a finger into his chest i dont appreciate you telling me what you think i should think when i know you wanted to win that race as much as i did and fixing a race isnt winning for somebody whos spent his life playing the odds you should know that so if youre going to stand here feeling sorry for yourself when you should be feeling sorry for me ill just leave you to it hold on he grabbed her arm before she could storm out youve got a fast trigger darling setting his own glass aside he rubbed his chest and a hell of an aim you got me okay so can we sit down now you can sit i still need to walk this off not entirely sure if he was embarrassed or amused by her accuracy he lowered himself to the arm of the sofa im sorry kelsey i know that doesnt cover much but im so goddamned sorry im trying not to think about how bad i feel right now im worried about naomi shell fight back i guess we all will she paced by the table picked up one of the glasses and soothed her scratchy throat it was horrible when they told me about the drug it was like losing him all over again theyre checking the sharps boxes every needle but even if they find something what difference will it make prides dead if the racing commission finds the needle that killed him it might lead to who used it she shook her head no i dont think so i cant believe anyone would be careless enough to toss it into a sharps box or if they did to leave fingerprints or any other evidence restless she stuffed her hands in her pockets then pulled them out again when i find out who and i will find out i want them to suffer she picked up her drink again looked down into the glass and watched the tiny bubbles rise he raced his heart out literally raced it out she shuddered once then pulled back the grief reno dislocated his shoulder snapped a collarbone but thats all thank god joey let me know youll have him up again in a few weeks kelsey maybe by the preakness shift gears she ordered herself think about tomorrow you know our colt high water he could make a decent showing atta girl he murmured she smiled well have a lot of work to do i watched them take pride away today and it hurt ive never lost anyone i cared about i didnt realize the first time i did it would be a horse and i did care i know so did you she walked over and laid a hand on gabes cheek im sorry if i was cold when you offered to stay with me id have fallen apart if you had but i knew i could get through it by myself i figured you didnt want me around reminding you id won im glad you won its the only bright spot in the day if i could have id have watched you walk into the winners circle id love to have seen them hand you the trophy on a quick laugh she reached into her pocket god i forgot see she showed him two tickets one on pride one on double i hedged my bets he stared at the tickets as touched by them as he would have been by a declaration of undying love same money on each horse i guess they both mattered the same amount to me he looked up the color her earlier temper had brought to her cheeks had faded again leaving her face as pale and delicate as fine glass the hand in his had toughened with work but was long and narrow and elegant she still wore the trim blue silk and slim heels shed donned for the race he lifted a hand and ran it over the hair that was escaping from the intricate french braid it was the color of wheat struck by afternoon sunlight the touch and the sudden silence had her pulse jumping she was tired she reminded herself drained shed spent hours facing reporters avoiding them answering questions fighting off speculation in what promised to be only the first course of a media feeding frenzy so why did she feel so energized its late i should go she hadnt meant to jerk back but she found herself in retreat when he rose i should check on naomi she has moses nonetheless now he smiled slowly his eyes warming on hers nonetheless he repeated its been a long day the longest the kind that stirs up every emotion and wrings it out to dry do you know how arousing it is to watch everything youre feeling on your face he moved closer but didnt touch her nerves needs doubts urges how could they not be on her face when they were storming through her like gale winds im no good at this gabe you might as well know that up front no good at what at she bumped into a chair cursed skirted around it at this seduction surrender satisfaction business and the timing sucks he agreed the timing sucks he could step back and let her go hed suffer but he could do it youre going to have to tell me you dont want me right now youre going to have to say yes or no kelsey right here im trying to if youd just let me think she jerked back again when he pressed his palms to the wall on either side of her head you figure its risky and you havent quite figured the odds the old familiar recklessness was moving through him now churning like an engine win or lose hed let it race the stakes are high and its always safer to fold is that what you want to be safe hardly aware she was moving she shook her head slowly from side to side because her eyes never left his she saw the quick flare of triumph in them the hell with the odds he pulled her against him lets gamble she tossed aside logic and caution she didnt want them now she wanted exactly what he was giving her a hungry mouth urgent hands whatever the risks shed already lost herself in the game her breath caught in a gasp of shock when he shoved her back to the wall and dragged her jacket from her shoulders she hadnt expected this hairtrigger urgency from him from herself but her own fingers were tearing at his shirt rending cloth and buttons in a heedless race for that basic feel of skin then he was under her hands the taut muscles the narrow planes on a surge of greed she locked her mouth on his and fought for more she didnt want soft words slow hands something was erupting inside her and she wanted it to happen fast to happen hot take me that thought only that pounded in her brain in her blood she heard her own laugh husky breathless and strange when his mouth seared a line of fire down her throat over the shoulder bared by her crumpled blouse it was the sound of it that snapped whatever thin hold he had on the civilized with what was nearly a snarl he grasped her hands and pulled them above her head she was trembling but her eyes were almost black with passion and challenge with her wrists trapped beneath his fingers he tore her blouse down the center sending tiny gold buttons flying her body quivered like a string rudely plucked but her gaze never faltered there was silk beneath the silk a sheer little fancy that barely covered her breasts before skimming down to disappear beneath her skirt he watched her face as he skimmed a hand up her leg and found the top of her stocking the laceedged hem of the silk he watched her eyes unfocus as he cupped the fire hed ignited as he plunged recklessly into it she cried out shocked shattered bucking frantically against his probing hand like a mustang with the first weight of man on her back sensations slapped at her smothered her staggered her with heat and light and a grinding glorious need that clenched its sweaty fist in her stomach panicked pleasured she shook her head while her body exploded her release was like a geyser boiling from deep inside thundering up closer and closer to the surface unstoppable when she was sure she was drained when even the colors kaleidoscoping behind her eyes began to dim he drove her up again his hands ruthless and rough tugged at her skirt his mouth worked eagerly at the silk dipping over her breasts then beneath until she was caught hot inside it the flavor of her flesh was exotic spiced with sweat and soft as water he could hear her quick thirsty pants the dazed whimpers that caught time after time in her throat while her heart plunged desperately under his hand his mouth there was the sheer animal pleasure of her nails scraping down his back of her body straining shuddering pumping against his greedy hands those hands tangled with hers in a frantic race to yank away his slacks the instant he was free he drove himself into her hard deep his fingers digging bruises into her hips twin moans trembled on the air when he mounted her dragging her legs up to open her fully then his mouth was on hers again swallowing gasps as they rode each other to the hot sweaty finish her head drooped onto his shoulder her body so filled with frenzied energy went limp as wet paper if he hadnt been pressed against her with the wall solid at her back she would have slid bonelessly to the floor who won she managed with what breath he had left he laughed a dead heat good christ youre amazing she didnt have the energy to question that as her mind began to clear it occurred to her that shed just made violent frantic love standing up and what was left of her clothes and his were scattered ruined at their feet this has never happened to me before nothing like this has ever happened to me good realizing they could spend the night leaning against the wall like drunks he scooped her up no i mean she trailed off noting hazily that she still wore one strappy high heel carelessly she kicked it off i mean ever when i was married we just i mean never mind dont stop there he carried her into the bedroom i love comparisons when theyre in my favor thats the only one i have other than wade there wasnt anyone other than wade he stopped in the process of lowering her to the bed his eyes focused there was no one before him this was her problem in the bedroom kelsey thought grimly she talked too much so so gabe straightened and kissed her again maybe it was a dated male fantasy to imagine yourself the only one but he decided to eliminate wade and enjoy it he dropped her onto the bed from a highenough perch to make her bounce twice before settling your ex wasnt just a bastard he was an idiot thanks i guess when he continued to look down at her she started to tug on the strap of her camisole only to discover it was broken i think youre going to have to lend me a robe or something so i can get back to my room he was smiling when he climbed onto the bed and covered her really gabe i cant walk down the hall wearing this she felt the wrinkled ruin of silk bunch between them whats left of this she corrected it looks incredible on you he skimmed his hand up until her breast was snuggled in his palm but this time i figure ill get you all the way out of it this time her heart stuttered as he stroked his thumb lazily over her nipple i couldnt possibly you couldnt possibly his brow arched as he lowered his grinning mouth to hers wanna bet shed have lost several times by the time dawn began to seep through the windows she was sprawled over him her body still quivering from the last assault her mind too numb to sleep i have to go i need to get to the track you need to sleep then you need to eat then well go to the track can we get coffee her words were beginning to slur as fatigue sneaked through to overpower everything else sure in a little while he stroked her hair her back not to arouse now but to lull turn it off for now darling what time is it he glanced at the clock and lied without compunction about four he said although it was past six okay couple hours she felt herself drift down a widening tunnel light as a feather just a quick nap he shifted her gently brushing the hair away from her face spreading the tangled sheet over her her face was still pale the shadows under her eyes like flaws on marble for a few minutes he watched her sleep and watching her sleep he fell in love uneasy with the sensation he backed away from it and the bed he reminded himself that great sex no matter how much affection was involved was a long way from love hed wanted her now he had her that didnt mean he had to know precisely what happened next she needed a friend every bit as much as she needed a lover since he intended to be both hed better get started on being a friend gabe took a shower and when he came back to dress she hadnt moved without a thought to her sensibilities he walked into the parlor and picked up her purse her wallet a palmsize pack of tissues a leather appointment book and he discovered to his amusement a hoof pick her key was tucked inside a little zippered pocket along with a lipstick a small vial of perfume which he indulged himself by sniffing and a twentydollar bill items he supposed a woman like kelsey wanted to keep handy he slipped her key into his own pocket and left her sleeping alone his initial stop was naomis room moses opened the door at the first knock he looked strained and tired but he offered gabe a hand and a genuine smile i didnt get a chance to congratulate you your colt ran a beautiful race he had top competition it wasnt the way i wanted to win no moses led him inside with a slap on the back its a hard one gabe for all of us now that we know something about how it happened well its harder yet theres no more news i take it the investigations rolling and three willows will roll one of its own in his seamed face his eyes were hard as onyx all i know is somebody meant that horse to die goddamned waste whatever i can do whatever anyone at longshot can do you have only to say the word i want the answers every bit as much as you do gabe glanced toward the bedroom door as it opened naomi stepped out if shed been a boxer he might have said she was in fighting trim none of the frailty that had haunted her the day before showed now she wore a dark purple suit as close to mourning as she had available and a look of grim determination as gabe had said shed fought back im glad youre here she crossed to him put her arms around him and rested her cheek against his this is hard on both of us she drew back keeping her hands on his shoulders a lot of the talks going to circle around you too i want a united front so do i i hate what happened i hate it for me for you and i hate it for racing but were going to deal with it ive just scheduled a press conference id like you to be there where and when she smiled then touched his cheek at noon at the track i think its important that we do it there well be taking pride home immediately after the autopsy she paused took a long breath we should both be prepared for a lot of press in the coming weeks and with the preakness even more speculation her eyes hardened you damn well better win that one gabe i intend to satisfied she nodded im going to give kelsey another hour or so before i call her room she took on a lot yesterday i hate to ask her for more shes got more the nerves that trickled down his back struck him as ridiculous he slipped his hands into his pockets fingered kelseys room key kelsey stayed with me last night shes sleeping now im going to get some things for her out of her room then make sure she eats the silence dragged on five seconds ten naomi broke it with a sigh im glad you were with her im glad its you you might not be when i tell you its going to stay me she arched a brow are you talking about marriage gabe for the first time in hours she laughed ah the face pales such a man thing she patted his arm as he continued to stare at her youd better get out of here honey before i start to ask you more embarrassing questions if you could have kelsey here by eleven we could all go out to the track together oh and get her the navy suit with the coral blouse naomi nudged him out the door closed it then rested back against it oh moses what a horrendous twentyfour hours this has been and now for just a minute i feel so good do you think she knows hes in love with her all kelsey knew was that she was furious with him not only had he let her oversleep but hed taken off with her key she was stuck without a decent stitch of clothing in his room she stepped out of a frigid shower which had done little to cool her off and wrapped herself in the hotel robe hanging on the back of the door with her hair bundled in a towel she paced from bedroom to parlor and back again she debated calling naomis suite but shied away from the idea of explaining that she was essentially naked and marooned in gabes room when she heard the parlor door open she marched in fire on her tongue id like to know what the hell you think youre oh she and the room service waiter stared at each other with equal parts of distress im sorry miss the gentleman said i should come right in and set up breakfast quietly because you were sleeping oh well thats all right im up she folded her hands and her dignity and where is the gentleman i cant say miss i only had my instructions would you prefer i come back later no she wasnt letting that coffee out of the room no this is fine im sorry i startled you while he set up she debated whether to gather up the scattered clothes or to pretend not to notice them opting for the latter she accepted the check added a tip she hoped would make gabe bleed and signed it with a flourish thank you miss enjoy your breakfast she was pouring her first cup of coffee when gabe strolled in so youre awake you pig she gulped the coffee black and hot enough to blister her tongue wheres my key right here he drew it out of his pocket then laid her suit over a chair i think i got everything youre an organized hotel guest cosmetics toothbrush by the way youve got great underwear i figured this little navy thing went with the suit he held up a teddy and grinned want to put it on she snatched it out of his hand youve been pawing through my things i collected your things your mother suggested the suit my kelsey gritted her teeth and prayed for patience youve been to see her shes doing fine more than ready to handle the backlash shes set up a press conference at the track for noon hows the coffee he poured some for himself were to meet her at eleven in her room and go out together she suggested the suit but not whatever baubles you wanted to go with it so i picked what i liked she told you what clothes to get for me kelsey drew in air then expelled it slowly which means you told her i was here he sat then lifted the silver dome from a plate to reveal ham and eggs i told her you were with me last night his gaze flicked up is that a problem no but no giving up she pressed a hand to her temple my heads spinning sit down and eat youll feel better when she did he reached over and closed a hand firmly over hers were in this together got that she stared down at their joined hands he hadnt meant the press conference not just the press conference and they both knew it another risk kelsey thought but she lifted her eyes until they were level with his yeah i got it chapter seventeen you never said you were going to kill the horse cunningham mopped his sweaty face it seemed he spent all his time sweating these days in front of the cameras with a big sloppy grin on his face at celebration parties where people thumped him on the back and bought him drinks in bed staring up at the dark ceiling reliving that final stretch of the derby over and over hed wanted to win but had gratefully settled for second place yet the cost had ballooned into more than hed ever expected to pay you never said he repeated while sweat soaked his shirt and pooled nastily at the base of his spine disqualify him you said so sheba would have a chance to place you wanted the details left up to me rich reminded him he was drinking topgrade kentucky bourbon now and enjoying the view of dc from a lofty hotel suite he could afford it he could afford a great many things now and you got what you wanted your filly placed at the derby nobodys going to call you a sucker now are they nobodys going to snicker behind your back you were just supposed to see the colt was disqualified i did rich grinned big time the chadwicks lose suspicion points at them at my cocky young son and you billy boy come out smelling like a rose he chose a candied almond from a bowl now lets be honest here billy you dont mind giving gabe a backhanded slap do you after all he cost you the family farm and a good dose of your dignity five years ago no i dont mind taking him down a peg but both of us know that filly of yours didnt have a chance in holy hell of winning that race rich continued likely with three willows and longshot in the running she maybe takes third if shes beat all the way to the wire more likely fourth or fifth that wasnt good enough was it not with the hole hed dug himself cunningham thought no but no rich crunched down on another almond his face as earnest as any usedcar salesmans you needed an edge and i supplied it now truth is i didnt expect her to do better than show but that girl ran with her heart shell breed champs he said with a wink thats the bottom line right youll syndicate her now and make yourself a pot of money as long as shell lift her tail for a handsome stud it was true all true but cunninghams glands were still in overdrive if it comes out rich ill be ruined hows it going to come out am i going to tell somebody he grinned again you havent been bragging to that pretty little piece in bed have you some men cant keep their mouths shut once theyve dipped their wick no cunningham swiped a hand over his mouth i havent told her anything not that he thought shed notice marla was more interested in spending his money than how he came by it but people are asking questions and the press is hounding me of course they are rich said heartily all you have to do is shake your head and look sad and reap some free publicity you can always add a little flourish about how you know naomi chadwick and gabriel slater and cant imagine either of them would stoop so low you make sure you link gabes name in there id appreciate that cunningham licked his lips inched forward howd you do it rich now now billy boy thats my little secret and the less you know the better right youre just a lucky guy who picked up a horse at a claiming race and carried her through to the derby the preakness is in two weeks rich grinned brows wiggling thats greedy friend and dangerous you know how risky it is to race that horse again she has another in her he forgot his guilt and his fears he forgot the men who had died and the sight of the colt falling at the sixteenth pole i only need her to show no can do chuckling rich wagged a finger in the air even if you put her in and she didnt break down that leg of the triple crown has to run clean otherwise they might start looking at you billy boy and who knows if they look at you they might start looking for me that happens and well he rattled the ice in his glass we wouldnt be friends anymore a lot of moneys at stake you want more money bet on the longshot colt i know my boy hell put everything hes got into winning vindicate himself richs grin turned sour he poured more bourbon into the melting ice always had a tight ass about winning clean taught him every trick i know every fucking one but he figures hes better than me see too good to salt the game his eyes narrowed went hard as he drank well see who comes out on top this time well see there wasnt any use arguing not when rich started pouring with a free hand what am i supposed to do you scratch her from pimlico billy say she pulled up lame in a workout and you dont want to risk her look disappointed and righteous then put her out to pasture until its time to choose her a lover youre right it hurt but cunningham put aside his greed better not take the chance im going to syndicate her get the bitch pregnant next spring he smiled a little i might even make a deal with your boy rich to breed her with his derby colt in a few years now youre talking he leaned forward and slapped a hand on cunninghams knee ive worked out a little bonus billy bonus instantly wary cunningham drew back we had a deal rich i kept my part no argument there not a one but look here billy you raked in a bundle at that race between the purse and the betting window ive got to figure your take at three maybe four hundred grand his smile widened as cunningham began to sweat again and with the syndication deal the foals shes going to drop in oh say the next ten years youll be sitting real pretty couldntve done it without me could you i paid you you did indeed but lets tally up the cost here i had to pay lipsky that was your idea i had nothing to do with it im like a subcontractor billy rich explained patiently what i do all leads back to you you dont want to forget that now lipsky took out that old groom and i took out lipsky now we wont get into details about the others on my payroll but theyre necessary expenses and i have to pass them on weve got ourselves two dead men and a dead horse and whats standing between them and you is me he beamed ticking off murder on his fingers so keeping me happys got to be pretty important to you it ought to be worth another hundred thousand a hundred thats bullshit rich just plain bullshit ive got all the expenses do you know what it costs to keep a thoroughbred even just one fucking horse plus the entry fees you dont want to nickelanddime me billy boy you really dont richs smile was as friendly as a deathshead he kept his hand on cunninghams knee squeezing as rich intended to squeeze his wallet for some time to come a hundred thousands a bargain take my word ill give you another week to figure out how to cook your books you bring it on by here the day before the preakness in cash he sat back delighted with himself ive got a hankering to lay down a bet on my boys colt family ties you know he was laughing as he dumped more bourbon into his glass her own family ties had given kelsey a splitting headache shed expected the trip to potomac to be difficult but it had been much more than that her father had been furious as angry as kelsey had ever seen him it had hardly mattered that his temper hadnt been directed at her as candace had coolly pointed out she was the cause of the problem milicent had made good on her threat she hadnt been able to break the terms of kelseys grandfathers will but she had altered her own in victorian and melodramatic terms milicent no longer had a granddaughter with her car still idling in the drive at three willows kelsey rested her aching head on the steering wheel it had been a horrible horrible scene milicents cold fury as she made the announcement her fathers shock then his outrage and candace already prepared aiming little darts of blame toward kelseys heart on a quiet moan of pain kelsey straightened and turned off the ignition she hadnt realized it would hurt so much she and milicent had been at odds for so long it would have made more sense to be relieved but she wasnt relieved she was wounded wearily she got out of the car thinking aspirin at least would take care of her throbbing head she heard the music the hard driving beat of vintage stones mick and the boys were grinding out their sympathy for the devil kelsey followed them around the side of the house there was a splattered drop cloth over the stones of the patio a boom box belched out rock and roll from the glasstopped table at an easel her hair pulled back in a stubby ponytail an oversize mans shirt hanging to her knees naomi fenced with a crimsontipped brush she might have been wielding a sword kelsey thought dueling with the canvas that had already exploded with color and shape her face turned in profile was set in stone her eyes spewing smoke it seemed a very intimate battle and kelsey started to back away but naomis head whipped around and those angry eyes pinned her im sorry kelsey began drowned out by the music naomi reached over and turned it down to a pulsing throb i didnt mean to disturb you its all right the passion was fading quickly from her eyes as if when not facing the canvas she was calm again im just having a private tantrum she set down her brush then picked up a cloth to wipe her hands i havent painted in a while its wonderful kelsey stepped closer studying the streaks of violent color the still glistening brushstrokes so primal exactly youre upset dammit kelsey shoved her hands into her pockets im beginning to think i have a sign on my forehead that broadcasts my feelings you have an expressive face so had she naomi remembered once i take it the family meeting didnt go well it went down the toilet ive caused a rift between my father and my grandmother a big one and i think a smaller but no less difficult one between him and candace by staying here by being who i am she picked up the neglected glass of iced tea naomi had brought out with her and drank milicent has not only cut me out of her will but out of her mind and heart as far as shes concerned i no longer exist oh kelsey naomi laid a hand on her arm im sure she doesnt mean it glass clinked against glass as kelsey set the tea down are you sympathy and concern hardened into fury of course she means it its just like her im sorry ive caused you this kind of trouble i caused kelsey exploded this is mine its time everyone started to understand that i can think and act and feel for myself if i didnt want to be here i wouldnt be im not here to spite them or to placate you im here for me naomi took a deep breath youre right absolutely right if i wanted to be somewhere else id be somewhere else but i wont be threatened or bribed or guilted into giving up something thats important to me my family is important to me three willows is important to me and so are you well naomi reached for the glass herself and her hand was unsteady thank you kelsey resisted barely the urge to kick a pot of geraniums its hardly a matter for gratitude youre my mother i care about you i admire what youve been able to do with your life maybe im not satisfied about all the years between but i like who you are im certainly not going to go scrambling back and pretend you dont exist because milicent would prefer it to keep herself from buckling into a chair naomi braced a hand on the table you cant imagine cant possibly imagine what its like to hear from a grown daughter that she likes who you are i love you so much kelsey her anger skidded to a halt i know i didnt know who you would be when i saw you again all the love i had was for that little girl id lost then you came here and you gave me a chance im so dazzled by the woman you are so proud of you if you left tomorrow and never came back youd still have given me more than i ever thought id have again im not going anywhere leading with her heart kelsey stepped forward and opened her arms im exactly where i want to be with her eyes tightly closed naomi absorbed the feel the scent of her daughter i want to say ill make it up to you that ill find a way to soften her heart dont its not for you to worry about steadier she eased back you can be mad with me im so goddamned mad riding on the mood swings she whirled away to pace and hurt i cant believe how much it hurt for her to think i cared about her money for her to use it and my feelings against me to try to control me with them control is essential to milicent it always has been she couldnt break my grandfathers trust i bet that burned her not having the power to change that and dad was so upset he shouted at her hes never raised his voice to her yes he has there was a grim satisfaction in naomis smile its probably been some time im glad he stood up for you i wish i could say i was it was horrible to see them fight that way and to see the distance all this has put between him and candace to know right or wrong that im responsible grandmothers so unbending so unwilling to see someone elses side and hadnt the same been said about her kelsey remembered and shuddered then she has two choices naomi put in shell bend or shell die lonely i have to believe theyll make up kelsey murmured i have to im not sure grandmother and i will ever come to terms again not after today she actually used pride against me she said that youd probably gotten one of your hoodlum friends her exact words by the way to drug the horse after all if youd killed a man appalled kelsey trailed off why would i stop at the idea of killing a horse naomi finished why indeed im sorry disgusted with herself she rubbed at her still aching temples im wound up it doesnt matter im sure shes not the only one whos had the thought one of the reasons im out here venting she said gesturing toward the canvas is that a rumors circulating that i might have arranged for prides death to collect the insurance kelsey dropped her hands then balled them into fists thats hideous no one who knows you would believe that its not an unheardof practice unfortunately theres a lot of ugliness in this world too kelsey the rumor will pass she picked up her brush again contemplating simple arithmetic will scotch it eventually even though he was heavily insured pride was worth a good deal more alive at the track and at stud than he is dead but it stirs memories mine others calmer she began to paint again this was my therapy in prison more it was a way to survive a way to channel emotions you dont want to bring attention to yourself inside with anger grief with fear especially not with fear can you tell me about it kelsey asked quietly what it was like for a moment naomi continued to paint in silence shed wondered when kelsey would ask not if the need to know the answers to find the solutions were as much a part of her daughters makeup as the color of her eyes so she would paint another picture with words rather than with her brush they strip you she said it quietly reminding herself it was done over not just your clothes though thats one of the first humiliations they take everything away from you your clothes your freedom your rights your hope you have only what they give you the tedious routine of it youre told when to get up in the morning when to eat when to go to bed at night it doesnt matter what you feel or what you want kelsey stepped up beside her the birds were singing now celebrating spring the air was ripe with flowers and paint you eat what they give you naomi continued and after a while you get used to it you forget what its like to go out to a restaurant or just to wake up at night and go down to the kitchen she let out a little sigh without realizing it its easier if you forget if you keep too much of the outside with you itll drive you crazy because you know its not yours anymore you can see the mountains flowers trees the seasons changing but theyre all outside and really have nothing to do with you you cant be who you were anymore and even if you ache for companionship you dont get too close to anyone because people come and go she changed brushes and began to paint with the energy that was boiling up inside some of the women kept calendars but i didnt i wasnt going to think about the days passing into weeks the weeks into months the months into years how could i some had pictures of their family their children and liked to talk about them or what they would do when they got out i didnt do that i couldnt do that it was simpler for me to focus on the routine but you were lonely kelsey murmured you must have been so lonely thats the deepest punishment the loneliness and the conflicting lack of privacy its not the bars you think its going to be the bars closing you in but its not she took a deep breath and made herself continue if you had free time you read or you watched tv fashion magazines were big but i stopped looking at them after the first couple of years it was too hard to watch the way things were changing even something as frivolous as hemlines did you have visitors my father moses nothing i could say would stop either one of them from coming god knows i wanted to see them no matter how i suffered after they were gone i watched my father grow old i suppose that was the hardest part watching the years pass on his face that was my calendar my fathers face the last year was the hardest i was coming up for parole and it looked as though id get it knowing freedom was almost within reach and yet being afraid to be cut off from the world youd lived in for so long that was hard how would you know what to do now and when to do it the days dragged giving you too much time to think to hope again to sweat out those last months then they let you put on civilian clothes my father brought me a new suit gray pinstripes very lawyerish my hands shook so badly i couldnt button the blouse the sun hurt my eyes when i walked out it wasnt as if theyd kept us in a hole it was a decent prison with decent people in charge at least for the most part but the sun was different that day stronger brighter i couldnt see anything through it and then i saw too much she exchanged brushes again her eyes focused on her work do you really want to hear the rest of this go on kelsey murmured finish i saw my father how frail and old he was the new cadillac blindingly white he drove me home in i know he spoke to me and i to him but i cant remember any of it only that everything seemed to move too fast and the roads were so crowded and i was afraid afraid they would take me back afraid they wouldnt we stopped and ate at a restaurant linen napkins wine flowers on the table he had to order for me as if i were a child i couldnt remember what i liked and i started to cry and he cried so we sat and wept on the white linen cloth because i couldnt remember what it was like to sit in a restaurant and order a meal i slept most of the rest of the drive exhausted from freedom then i woke up and he was turning through the gates i could see that the trees had grown the dogwoods that had been saplings the ones id planted myself were adult trees that had bloomed year after year without me new paint in the living room a vase that hadnt been there before every little change terrified me i didnt go down to the barn not for days until moses came to the house and bullied me into it there was a foal id helped birth now he was sixteen hands high and at stud new equipment new men new everything i stayed in the house for a week after that slept with the light on and my door open at first i couldnt stand for a door to be closed but after a while it got better i had to learn to drive again i was terrified but i did it the first time i went out alone i drove to your school i watched the baby id left behind as a young girl learning to flirt with boys i made myself accept that youd learned to live without me and i tried to start over naomi set her brush down and stepped back its done kelsey wasnt certain of that the painting might have been finished but not the emotion behind it nor as far as she was concerned was the story done it wasnt a matter of clearing naomis name a man had been killed and a woman had paid the price but she wanted to see that the pieces fit still it was a shock to find charles rooneys name in the phone book the private investigator whose evidence had weighed most heavily in naomis trial still had an office in virginia alexandria now the discreet ad in the yellow pages declared rooney investigative services handled criminal domestic and custody licensed and bonded and confidential the first consultation was free perhaps she thought shed take advantage of that miss kelsey when gertie hurried into the kitchen kelsey quickly slapped the phone book closed you startled me sorry that policemans here again her homely face expressed simple and loyal annoyance says hes got some more questions ill see him naomis down at the barn no need to bother her you want me to make coffee kelsey hesitated only a moment no gertie lets get him in and out sooner the better gertie muttered under her breath rossi stood when kelsey entered the sitting room he had to admire the way she wore jeans though hed been equally impressed with the clip from the press conference and the way she and her mother had looked trim and blond in their silk suits ms byden i appreciate the time i dont have much of it lieutenant but im willing to stretch it if you have news for us i wish i did he had nothing but frustration no unaccountedfor prints in lipskys motel room no witnesses no trail id like to offer my sympathies for your loss at the derby im not much of a horse lover but even cops watch that race it was a terrible thing yes it was my mothers devastated she looked sturdy enough at the press conference with a frigid nod kelsey sat and gestured for rossi to join her did you expect her to fall apart publicly actually no but i did find it interesting that slater sat in on it were neighbors lieutenant and friends gabe is also an owner and the fact that his colt won under such tragic circumstances made it difficult for all of us we asked him there to show our support and he accepted to show his youll excuse me ms byden but from what ive seen in the press you and mr slater seem to be more than friends the byden genes swam to the surface adding a cool arrogant tilt to her head is that an official statement lieutenant just an observation its natural enough youre both attractive people with mutual interests she didnt rise to the bait but he hadnt expected her to i was hoping you could help me out with the details of what happened at churchill downs i thought you werent interested in horses lieutenant murder interests me even in horses he waited a beat particularly if it ties in with a homicide case i want to close you think what happened to pride is tied in with old micks murder how lipskys dead exactly from what im told its not easy to get to a derby entrant no its not the security is tight we have guards her brow furrowed it was gabes colt lipsky was after not ours and i was under the impression lipskys death was considered a suicide you think it was murder theres debate on that was all he would say id like to snip any loose ends if you could tell me who had official access to the colt before the race i would of course my mother moses boggs reno she blew out a breath the official who checks identification the handlers at the gate the outrider the one who ponied him onto the track that was carl tripper the other members of the crew she ticked off names the guards well yes i suppose and unofficially she shook her head but her mind was working youd have to be very slick to get through security on derby day lieutenant it may look like a freeforall on television but the horses are closely watched the drug its hard to tell when it was given to the horse thats part of the problem she took a steadying breath it was still hard to talk about it pride had traces of digitalis and epinephrine in his bloodstream it killed him overworked his heart he was edgy but he usually is before a race moses keeps him that way now why would that be some horses run better when theyre wired up others need to be soothed and calmed pride ran best wired how do you know about that a lot of it comes from the horse they know when theyre going to race theyre not fed as much theyre prepped differently theres atmosphere and you might hold them back at the workout when theyre itchy to have their head no chemicals her face went very still no drugs lieutenant we dont doctor our horses here with anything that isnt approved and necessary for their health what someone gave pride pumped up his heart rate his adrenaline the race the strain of driving him hard for more than a mile killed him which was precisely what the colts autopsy report had told him shouldnt the jockey have known something was wrong her jaw tightened she wouldnt permit anyone to blame reno not after what hed been through shed seen for herself the way hed suffered the way hed continued to suffer pride ran because thats what he was born to do what hed been trained to do since he took his first steps he didnt falter he didnt fight reno you only have to look at the tape to see he was putting everything he had into winning that race and killed himself trying reno was lucky he wasnt killed as well rossi studied his notebook hed watched the tape of the race over and over slowing the speed freezeframing finally he nodded ive got to agree with that if hed have gone onto the track instead of the infield i dont see how hed have escaped being trampled and the way he went down i figured a broken neck so did i as it is he wont be up for another month at the earliest that should do it for now im going to want to talk to some of the names you gave me check out their perspective i appreciate your interest lieutenant id rather you didnt question my mother unless its vital it was her horse ms byden i think you understand what im saying she rose ready to defend youre perfectly aware of the background here and how difficult it is for my mother to undergo police interrogation a few questions amounts to the same thing for her and whether you can understand it or not shes grieving you can ask me anything you like or you can go to the racing commission i cant make any promises but theres no need to disturb her at this time thank you she started to walk him to the door lieutenant you werent involved in my mothers case were you no i was still at the police academy back then green as iceberg lettuce i was curious who was in charge that would have been captain tipton jim tipton retired now i served under him when he was a lieutenant and after he made captain a good cop im sure he was thank you lieutenant thank you ms byden rossi walked back to the car nibbling on the seed of an idea kelsey byden had something on her mind he mused it wouldnt hurt to do a little digging back himself chapter eighteen why do i get the feeling the only place im going to get you in bed is in a hotel mmmm kelsey twirled her bouquet of blackeyed susans part of the centerpiece gabe had stolen for her from their last preakness party i suppose things have been a little hectic and you have been busy giving interviews im going to give more of them tomorrow thats what i like a confident man they strolled across the lobby to the elevators and double is being housed in stall forty the base of secretariat affirmed seattle slew are you superstitious slater damn right i am he stepped into the elevator and tugged her in behind him his mouth was hot on hers before the doors whispered shut the button she managed crushing flowers as she pawed her way under his shirt you forgot to push the button he groped swore and managed to press the right floor i didnt think i was ever going to get you alone two weeks is two weeks too long kelsey i know she let out a breathless laugh when his teeth scraped her neck naomi needed me and theres hardly been time to think with the investigation and trying to get the colt ready for tomorrow ive wanted to be with you the doors opened and she jerked back her cocktail dress was a great deal more than off the shoulder she tugged it back into place amazed that shed lose control in an elevator and grateful that the hall beyond was empty you dont know whether to be pleased with yourself or embarrassed she fluffed her hair back into place stop reading my mind she ordered and caught the doors before they shut again your room or mine it was as simple as that she realized theyd both been waiting all evening for the chance to pick up where theyd left off in kentucky mine she decided this time you can wake up in the morning without any decent clothes to wear is that a promise to rip them off me she swiped her key card through the slot and tried to come up with a suitable answer even as the light beeped from red to green the phone began to ring hold that thought she told him and dashed to answer hello she tossed the crushed flowers onto a coffee table tugged off one earring then passed the phone to the unadorned lobe her fingers went still as they closed over the second sapphire cluster wade how did you know i was here very carefully very deliberately she removed her other earring and set it down on the table i see i didnt realize you kept in touch with candace of course thats cozy isnt it yes im being sarcastic her eyes flashed to gabe then dropped without a word he crossed to the minibar opened a bottle of chardonnay and poured her a glass wade you didnt call at she checked her watch elevenfifteen to make small talk and i really have no intention of discussing my mother with you so if thats all miserably she accepted the glass from gabe of course that wasnt all it was never all with wade do you want my blessing no im not going to be gracious and this is as civilized as it gets she thought about swallowing her venom but instead let it spew as his oh so reasonable voice nattered in her ear does the lucky bride know that you have a habit of boffing your associates on business trips yeah im real good at holding a grudge you bastard you oily selfcentered jerk how dare you call me up on your wedding eve to soothe your conscience hows this no i dont forgive you no i refuse to share in the blame thats right wade im as rigid and unforgiving as ever but i have stopped wishing youd die a long painful and ugly death now i just want you to get hit by a truck while youre crossing the street if you want absolution find a priest she hung up slamming the receiver hard enough to strike a whining ring well gabe murmured into the silence thats telling him he toasted her with a can of coke does he make a habit of calling you every couple of months she kicked the table then ripped her shoes off her aching toes and heaved them across the room to chat if you can believe that we cant be married but why cant we be friends ill tell you why because nobody cheats on me nobody ill keep that in mind gabe watched her wondering if he should let her cool down or if he should just scoop her off to bed and help her expel some of that energy hes getting married tomorrow he thought i should hear it straight from him so he called candace they still belong to the same club you know she gulped down wine found she didnt have the taste for it she told him where i was she told him as if he had some unbreakable right to know as if i give a damn about him getting married do you gabe reached out to keep the glass shed slammed down from tipping over onto the rug no she needed something to throw anything and settled on the complimentary travel guide i care that he can call me out of the blue and make me feel even for an instant that it was my fault he was with another woman i care that when he does i think back and remember how perfect it was supposed to be a nice young couple from good families having their splashy society wedding the romantic twoweek honeymoon in the caribbean the charming little row house in georgetown the right friends the right clubs the right parties and i hate when i look back and i realize i never loved him her voice broke and she fisted her hands at her temples i didnt even love him how could i have married him gabe how could i have when i didnt feel even a fraction for him what i feel for you his eyes flashed then the light narrowed down to a pinpoint of heat be careful kelsey i dont cheat but that doesnt mean i play fair i dont give a damn that youre upset if you say too much ill hold you to it i dont know what im saying unnerved trembling she dropped her hands i only know that when i listened to him just now i realized id married him because everyone said he was right for me and because it seemed like the next natural step i wanted it to work i tried to make it work but how could it he never once made me feel the way you do her voice dropped to a whisper no ones ever made me feel the way you do he set down his drink suddenly aware that his fingers had pressed dents in the can everyone will tell you im wrong for you i dont care i hate country clubs im not going to take you to spring balls im not asking you to i could get the urge tomorrow and put everything ive got on one spin of the wheel her hands relaxed at her sides she could almost see him doing it i think the wheels already spinning slater maybe youre not enough of a gambler to put it on the line you dont know what you feel for me clawed by his own emotions he grabbed her nearly lifting her off the floor youre working on it christ i can almost see the gears turning in that head of yours but you dont know i want you her heart was lodged in her throat pounding ive never wanted anyone the way i want you ill make you give me more and once ive got hold kelsey you wont shake me loose if you were smart youd take a good look at what youre getting into with me and youd run she started to shake her head but he swept her up too late for you too she murmured and shifted just enough so that her lips could reach his throat im not running away gabe im running after and she knew what to expect now what to anticipate what to yearn for heat and speed and frenzy she wanted the ache knowing he could soothe it away then incite it again until every pulse throbbed like a wound and she reveled in knowing it was the same for him that breathless burning need the panic the thrill that they brought to each other from the first greedy touch tumbling over the bed groping gasping they fought with buttons and snaps until clothes scattered like fallen leaves the quest was for flesh the taste of it the feel and scent that was a prelude to that most basic of desires he traced his hands over her the firm silkyskinned breasts the narrow rib cage and hips in the dark he could see her with his fingertips every inch every curve and muscle like a blind man seeking texture and shape he explored the body he already knew she was everything hed ever wanted ever fought for ever gambled for and she was quivering beneath him ready eager amazingly his her body surged up agile quick when their positions were reversed she straddled him in one fluid move she imprisoned him inside those hot wet walls arching back to take him hard to the hilt her hands groped for then grasped his their fingers tightly interlacing as she rocked them both toward madness his last thought was that it was indeed too late much too late for both of them morning dawned dreary heavy clouds thickened the sky and the air muting all the color to a gunmetal gray occasionally rain pricked its way through the layers and fell in sharp darts that stung and chilled men and machines raked the track turned it up anew sleeked it with furrows pimlico drained well and its groomsmen attended it as carefully as tenderly as a man might tend a muchloved horse rain didnt deter the crowds or the press by post time for the first race the stands were full brightly colored umbrellas seemed to float like balloons on a gray sea inside the clubhouse people stayed dry feeding on crabs and beer while they watched the action on monitors the weather had kelsey opting for jeans and boots rather than the linen dress shed expected to wear it gave her an excuse to linger at the barn and weave blackeyed susans through justices blond mane to decorate him for his regal task of ponying high water to the track and in her opinion there was nothing like a rainy day to make you stop and think six months earlier she hadnt known naomi existed shed taken no more than a passing glance at the world she was now a part of shed been drifting haunted by a failed marriage and what she had begun to see as her own failed sexuality her job had amused her nearly satisfied her yet shed been thinking of moving on there was always another job another course to take another trip to plan she liked to tell herself shed made all those restless lateral moves to stimulate her mind but in reality shed done so simply to fill holes holes she hadnt wanted to acknowledge holes she certainly hadnt understood she had considered carefully whether she was doing the same now using naomi the farm even gabe to plug those cracks in her life would she as her family seemed to think become disenchanted dissatisfied with the routine and move on yet again or could she trust the feelings that were blooming inside her the growing attachment to her mother a simple almost quiet evolution from anger and suspicion to affection and respect why not just accept that shed found and perhaps begun to earn a place on the farm and gabe wasnt it possible to relax and enjoy what was happening between them shed had no doubts the night before when theyd tumbled into bed no doubts when shed turned lazily to him at dawn and made slow languid love perhaps it was that inflexible sense of values her own unwavering perception of right and wrong how could she allow naomi to depend on her when she couldnt be certain how long shed stay how could she take a lover and glory in lovemaking when neither of them had so much as whispered a word about love maybe she was too rigid if she couldnt take pleasure in the moment without questioning every motive what did that say about her own makeup and was she sulking just a little because her exhusband was being married perhaps had already taken those vows a second time while she braided flowers into a geldings mane it was time to push that aside once and for all she warned herself time to look forward she wasnt drifting now she had a purpose and questions that needed to be answered shed deal with them logically starting at a twentyyearold root first thing monday morning she promised herself she would make that call to charles rooney the rain had stopped again when they walked to the paddock watery sunlight sneaked through breaks in the clouds and fell on dripping eaves gutters rang musically and turned the ground to mud kelsey sneaked a look at boggs he seemed old more frail than he had two weeks before she knew hed been assigned as high waters groom as much for his skill as to help heal the wounds the rains a plus she said hoping to lift the shadows from his eyes high water likes a wet track and so she remembered did double hes a good colt absently boggs patted his neck steady and kind might be hell surprise us all today last word he was five to one boggs shrugged hed never paid much heed to the odds he aint run much this year so they havent seen what he can do still hes finished in the money more times than not hell move if hes asked but hes no pride boggs didnt have to say it kelsey understood then ill ask him kelsey went to the colts head and held his bridle so that she could look in his eyes they seemed so wise to her and as boggs had said kind youll run wont you boy youll run as hard and as fast as you can and thats enough for anyone youre not going to ask him to win naomi laid a hand on kelseys shoulder a small gesture that still touched both of them no sometimes the winning isnt as important as the trying she spotted reno standing to the side his arm in a sling his face haunted and pale ill meet you in the box in a minute kelsey crossed to him and took his free hand i was hoping id see you couldnt stay away hed wanted to the last thing hed wanted was to stand on the sidelines and watch i figured to stay home maybe catch the race on the tube but i found myself in the car driving out here well have you up again soon reno a spasm crossed his face he looked away from her away from the horses away from the track i dont know if i have the heart for it that colt deserved better so did you she said quietly ive spent most of my life dreaming about a derby win you can ride dozens of horses cross dozens of wires but the derbys the one thats gone now theres another derby next year she reminded him theres always another derby i dont know if i want another chance his face tightened when he saw a figure over her shoulder good luck today he said and hurried away rossi noted the jockeys quick retreat and filed it despite the lack of welcome on kelseys face he walked to her miserable day it seemed to be clearing up until a moment ago he smiled acknowledged the thrust i was hoping for a few tips while i was wandering around youre unlikely to get any lieutenant she began walking resigned to the fact that he fell into step beside her you look like what you are a cop an occupational hazard i dont claim to know a lot about horses ms byden but that one of yours seemed a little on the small side he is just over fourteen hands but i dont think youre here to talk horses youre wrong horses are right at the center of this he offered her his bag of peanuts then cracked another for himself when she declined ive been doing some research there are a lot of ways to kill a horse ms byden some of which are on the gruesome side im aware of that much too aware now she thought it had been matt whod told her when shed pressed for answers told her of electrocution putting a horse in standing water then killing him with live battery cables a cruel and clever murder sometimes overlooked unless a vet spotted burn marks in the nostrils worse she thought was suffocating them with pingpong balls thrust up the nose they were impossible for a horse to expel causing a slow hideous death your derby colt rossi continued he wasnt just killed he was killed in full view of millions of people risky its my belief that when someone takes a risk a particularly unnecessary one its because hes anxious to make a point whod want to slap down your mother in public ms byden i have no idea but she stopped the statement shifted the suspicion from naomi and instead made her a victim is that what you think this is about its an avenue worth exploring she had the colt insured heavily but theres no cashflow problem at three willows and in the long term that colt could have generated a lot more your mother appears to be a sensible businesswoman now theres slater he had nothing to do with it thats an emotional response and precisely what hed expected backing off that a minute he reaped the reward you always want to look at who benefits from murder ms byden any kind of murder the problem with that is it puts a cloud over him and his derby win so i ask myself would it be worth it to him he had a good chance of winning anyway so would it be worth it to him to stack the deck in so obvious a way he doesnt strike me as an obvious man an emotional response lieutenant an observation ms byden hes not the only one who benefited theres his trainer his jockey they both got a piece of the pie and theres anyone who bet she gave a short laugh looking around at the crowds that certainly narrows the field more than you think he scanned the crowd as well enjoying himself if it ties in with my two homicides it narrows it a lot more than you think who did lipsky trust enough or who was he afraid enough of to let get close enough to kill him someone he worked with worked for there were a lot more than two horses in that race ms byden and a lot more riding on the derby than a blanket of flowers she stopped then turned to study his face why are you telling me all of this youre new to the game you might see a lot more than people think he paused to crack open another nut and youre involved your relationship with your mother isnt making everyone happy so hed been prying into her personal life as well she should have expected it thats family business lieutenant and has nothing to do with murder i could quote you statistics that would show you family business leads to murder more often than any other kind im just asking you to keep your eyes open theyre open lieutenant she stood her ground unwilling to have him walk into view of the boxes there was no point in upsetting naomi moments before the race now if youll excuse me i have to join my mother good luck he called out and chose another nut he had a feeling kelsey byden would be much harder to crack kelsey stepped into the box just as the horses were being loaded into the gate i was afraid you wouldnt make it ran into someone kelsey muttered and glanced from her mother to gabe it was like him she thought to be here to stand with them when this was so completely his moment she took his hand and gave it a quick squeeze side bet slater you still owe me from the first one double or nothing then its apropos she studied the field through her binoculars your horse by two lengths the tracks sloppy but ill say he runs it in a minute fiftyeight tops our colt takes third in two and twelve he lifted a brow thats a hard bet for a man to turn down since theres no way to lose the starting gun fired from the first plunge double and his rider took the lead it was as if kelsey thought they both knew they had something to prove this was a champion bursting from the pack in a heartbeat with no need to feel the bat on his back to pour it on by the first turn he was a halflength in the lead with the arkansas colt and the kentucky roan fighting for second again kelsey lost herself in the grandeur of it with her binoculars in place she urged the horses on not seeing as shed been afraid she would an overlapping image of pride going down there was only the mudsplattered athletes riders and ridden thundering around the oval there was rain in the air another misty steady drizzle that blurred her vision and soaked her skin a full length now and moving out his red wrappings smeared brown his rider balanced like a toy in the irons she heard herself laughing at the glory of it then like an arrow from a bow high water shot up the outside kelseys breath caught at the suddenness of the move he was gaining digging in kicking up turf fighting she thought dazed for honor down the stretch double lengthened his lead the crowd roared for him a flood of sound that overwhelmed everything else then for high water the fivetoone shot that streaked into third and kept gaining during that heartstopping final threesixteenths my god look at him my god mom just look at him i am tears mixed with the rain running down naomis face she wrapped her arm tight around kelseys waist as they finished double had the blackeyed susans but high water had edged out arkansas for second he did it kelsey let her binoculars drop the little guy did it she hugged naomi first laughing out the victory nobody believed it none of us believed it she whirled and with a whoop launched herself into gabes arms congratulations what was the time what was his time gabe held up the stopwatch amused when kelsey snatched it from him a minute fiftyseven and a quarter she laughed again rain dripping from her hair onto her face gabriel slater youve just won the second jewel in the triple crown what are you going to do now and i know youre not going to disney world im going to belmont he lifted her high spun her around once then kissed her were going to belmont inside the clubhouse rich slater toasted the image of his son and kelsey on the monitor then downed the aged scotch a handsome couple he thought a very handsome couple they made much as he and naomi would have done if she hadnt turned her icy nose up at him but there were other matters to contemplate other matters to celebrate hed put ten of the hundred thousand hed bled out of cunningham on doubles nose he was quite satisfied with the profits for now i hope you dont mind kelsey opened the champagne with a cheery pop shed already had several glasses in her mothers suite but the night was young im going to finish this entire bottle and i may get considerably drunk gabe sat crossing his feet at the ankles hed been fantasizing about a long hot very steamy shower for two but he could wait it might be interesting to see how many more inhibitions kelsey let fly after a bottle of dom just because i dont drink doesnt mean i wouldnt enjoy watching you indulge yourself im going to she poured then watched the bubbles froth recklessly over the lip of the flute you know ive never really been drunk ive been close but i always pulled myself back she took a long swallow waved her hand breeding dont want to get too loose at the club people will talk dont want to get too loose at a party other people will talk this time she waved the bottle bydens do not solicit gossip what do they solicit respect admiration and above all discretion she closed one eye to narrow her vision and poured more wine the hell with that let em talk we won isnt it incredible yes it is he smiled at her she was barefoot now and her hair had dried in a glorious tangle of pale gold everyone was so down before trying not to be but it was so hard i saw reno in the paddock and it just broke my heart she drank again sighed and decided she liked the way champagne made the room circle glass in hand she executed two slow pirouettes to help it along do that again he wanted the pleasure of watching the way her hair flowed out settled flowed out settled with a giddy laugh she obliged him see those lessons were good for something taught me discipline too mental and physical you know you could break bricks on this body im sure i can find more interesting things to do with it she laughed again knowing he could would we were talking about the race i hope it made reno feel better you could see how happy naomi and moses were even boggs poor old boggs blaming himself cause he bet on pride it had nothing to do with it people are always looking for ways to tie things together like rossi rossi mmmm she poured another glass then absently began to unbutton her shirt it was getting warmer by the swallow he was there at the race i talked to him or he talked to me he seems to be there every time you turn around watching working out his theories why should anyone want to hurt naomi or make people wonder gabe adjusted his focus her shirt was open to the first sweet curve of breast but he wanted to concentrate on her words is that what he thinks who knows she gave a careless shrug i dont think he really tells you what he thinks if you follow me she said after a moment he just says things to sort of plant them in your mind and drive you crazy but at least he doesnt seem to be looking at naomi as some sort of horse assassin she smiled winningly hes still got one eye on you slater i never doubted it but only one eye she closed one of her own to demonstrate he doesnt think youre obvious quite a compliment coming from that source he decided he could concentrate on kelseys emerging flesh after all youve got a couple more buttons there darling im getting them ive never stripped for a man before let me be the first she chuckled and with her eyes half closed fumbled open the snap of her jeans it irritated me seeing him there rossi i mean it started me thinking back over the derby all the things that happened watching the horses come back through the mist after morning workout the smells the sounds the nerves boggs hanging up prides wrappings and talking about his last bet how he thought he saw your father what the blood kelseys careless striptease had been heating froze like a river of ice what did you say about my father oh boggs thought he saw him at churchill downs he thought it was bad luck but i dont suppose he was there or hed have let you know kelsey gabe rose took her glass out of her hand and set it aside what did boggs say about the old man nothing much she blew out a long breath her head was spinning a lovely feeling but gabes eyes were so intense they burned through the fog just that he thought hed seen him around the shedrow he had her arms now when sometime that morning but he wasnt sure he said he only got a glimpse and his eyes arent good anymore she shook her head trying fruitlessly to clear it what difference does it make none gabe said gentling his hold or all all the difference in the world i just wondered the past has a way of squeezing the throat she lifted a hand to his face we shouldnt let it we have now yes we do it could wait gabe told himself odds were it was nothing but whatever it was he would deal with it when they returned home lets see he cupped her chin studied her flushed face and blinking eyes darling youre going to have one hell of a headache come morning well then she hooked her arms around his neck in one lithe leap she encircled his waist legs locked then wed better make it worth it right its the least i can do lets go into the shower he lowered his head and nipped at her bare shoulder ill show you what i have in mind chapter nineteen she thought about telling gabe certainly it wasnt a matter of dependence to tell a man you were so intimately involved with about your intentions it wouldnt have been weak to ask him to come with her to lend a little moral support when she faced her past but she hadnt told him because intellect aside it felt dependent it felt weak and it was when you scraped away all of the excess her problem in any case he hardly had a minute he could call his own it wasnt every year there was a viable contender for the triple crown who had two jewels already in place his hands were full with the press his mind full of tensions and possibilities and his days full overseeing the interim three weeks of training before the belmont stakes she didnt want to distract him from the goal a goal shed begun to realize that meant a great deal more to him than money and prestige to gabe the triple crown would be proof that he had taken something and not only made it his own but made it extraordinary underlying that she didnt want him to toss her own advice back in her face it wasnt wise to let the past strangle you but she couldnt break free of it not completely the longer she knew naomi the more she grew to care for her the less kelsey could believe that her mother had coldly killed a man or hotly for that matter there was no disputing the fact that naomi had pulled the trigger that she had ended a life not only did naomi admit it not only had a jury convicted her but there had been a witness kelsey decided she couldnt lay the past to rest until shed spoken with charles rooney she enjoyed the drive it was difficult not to appreciate no matter how crowded the highway the green banks and bursting blooms of full spring she had the top down and chopin soaring the better shed decided to keep her mind off what she was about to do she hadnt lied precisely in giving rooneys secretary the name kelsey monroe when shed made the appointment it was merely a precaution a way to be certain rooney didnt immediately connect her with naomi a bending of those stiff codes of right and wrong she thought shed always been amused by and disdainful of people who considered white lies acceptable or convenient and here she was using that same slippery rope to climb to her own ends evaluate later she told herself nor had she been completely truthful when shed made excuses to take the afternoon off errands and appointments had simply been evasions she knew naomi assumed she was going to meet the family and shed let naomi think just that whatever the outcome of the afternoon kelsey doubted shed pass it along to her mother for the first time since theyd lost pride naomi seemed relaxed again no one expected high water to repeat his preakness performance in the grueling mile and a half at belmont the point had been made the victory won now they could reap the rewards and she could steal a few hours and dig into the muck of the past shed already mapped out her route in and through the city though she wasnt very familiar with alexandria she found the building easily enough and slipped into an empty spot in the underground garage nerves pressed on her irritating her with damp hands and a skittish stomach she took her time deliberately setting the brake locking the car tucking her keys into the zippered compartment of her purse what could be worse she asked herself what could be worse than knowing your mother killed a man whatever charles rooney told her couldnt be much of a shock it was only that she somehow wanted it to come together tidily in her mind then once and for all she would be able to accept the woman naomi had become and stop dwelling on the woman she had been the elevator took her to the fifth floor up from the echoing concrete of the garage to the hushed carpeted hallways glass doors and windows etched with names flanked both sides inside them people worked with all appearance of industry at word processors and telephones it made her shudder how would it feel to be on display all through working hours to anyone who happened to wander down the hall how would it feel to be trapped behind that glass with spring rioting outside struck by her own thoughts she shook her head it hadnt been so very long ago that shed been inside and just as much on display as the exhibits shed taken her little tour groups to see in the museum how completely a few short months had changed her outlook and her desires rooney investigation services took up the south corner of the building it was not as she had assumed a small operation nor did it convey that vaguely seamy atmosphere so often created in television and movie portrayals of detective agencies no rye in the file cabinets here she decided as she entered the glass doors into soft background music and the scent of gardenias the romantic fragrance wafted from the waxy blooms tumbling out of jardinieres on either side of a pastel sectional sofa there were prints of monets floating water lilies on the walls and a reproduction queen anne coffee table fanned with glossy copies of southern homes the woman seated at the circular ebony workstation in the center of the room was as polished as the furnishings she glanced up from her monitor and aimed a professional but surprisingly warm smile at kelsey may i help you i have an appointment with mr rooney ms monroe yes youre a few minutes early if youd just take a seat ill see if mr rooney is ready to see you kelsey sat next to the gardenias picked up a magazine and for the next ten minutes pretended to be absorbed in the fussy decor of an antebellum mansion outside of raleigh all the while her nerves and her conscience pricked at her she shouldnt have come she certainly shouldnt have given a name she no longer used or wanted she had no business poking fingers in naomis affairs she should get up and tell the stunning and efficient receptionist that shed made a mistake surely she wouldnt be the first person to make a panicked dash from a detectives office and even if she were what did it matter she should be back at the barn working with honor not sitting here smelling gardenias and staring at a picture of someones overly decorated living room but she didnt get up not until the receptionist called her name again and offered to show her in there were several doors on either side of the inner corridor no glass here kelsey noted whatever went on inside those rooms was private discretion would be an integral part of the business and because it was why did she expect charles rooney to tell her anything even after twentythree years because she had the right she told herself and straightened her shoulders because she was naomi chadwicks daughter mr rooney ms monroe to see you the receptionist opened one half of the double oak doors scooted kelsey inside then retreated it was a simple room furnished more like a den than an office with glassyeyed big game fish mounted on the walls models of ships lining shelves the man who rose from behind the desk might have been everyones favorite uncle slightly paunchy slightly bald roundfaced and narrowshouldered his tie was slightly askew as if hed recently tugged against the restriction he had a quiet friendly voice meant to put the most nervous client at ease im sorry i kept you waiting ms monroe would you like some coffee he gestured toward a krups coffeemaker on the table behind him i keep a pot in here to keep the juices flowing no thank you nothing but you go ahead she made herself sit using the time he gave her while pouring his own mug to study him and his milieu such an ordinary man she thought in an ordinary place how could he have had such a devastating influence on so many lives now ms monroe you indicated you needed some help with a custody case he seated himself idly stirring his spoon around and around in the mug already a fresh legal pad was waiting for his notes youre divorced yes and the child who at this time has primary custody she drew in a long breath now that she was in the door it was time for the truth i am the child mr rooney with her hands clutching her bag she kept her eyes on his monroe was my married name i dont use it anymore as ive taken back my maiden name its byden im kelsey byden she knew the instant it clicked his hand hesitated his rhythmic stirring skipped a beat his pupils widened so that for a moment his eyes seemed black instead of green i see youd expect me to remember that name and that case of course i do you look remarkably like your mother i should have recognized you i hadnt thought of that youd have seen her quite a lot back then you had her under surveillance he didnt miss the faint distaste in her tone its part of the job this particular job took a sharp turn my father hired you mr rooney ms byden kelsey its difficult for me not to think of you as kelsey he said measuring her and his own heart rate as he spoke custody suits are never pleasant you were fortunately young enough not to be involved in the more difficult aspects i was hired as im sure you know to document your mothers lifestyle in order to strengthen your fathers case for full custody and what did you discover about her lifestyle that isnt something i feel free to discuss a great deal of its public record mr rooney i cant believe youre bound by client confidentiality after all this time hoping to influence him she leaned forward let some of the emotion she was feeling leak into her voice i need to know im not a child who needs to be protected from those difficult aspects any longer you must understand that i feel i have a right to know exactly what happened how he wondered had he looked at that face and not seen looked into those eyes and not known this was naomis child i sympathize but theres very little i can tell you you followed her you took pictures notes you made reports you knew her mr rooney and you knew alec bradley knew them he inclined his head i never exchanged a word with naomi chadwick or alec bradley she wasnt about to be put off with so shallow a technicality you saw them together at parties at the track at the club you saw them together that night when he came to the house you were technically trespassing when you took the pictures that convicted her he hadnt forgotten it he hadnt forgotten any of it i walked a thin line agreed and perhaps i crossed it in my zeal to do my job he offered a small smile while his memories swarmed through his mind with todays technology i could accomplish the same thing without the question of trespass he paused took a moment to lift his mug but the line still gets crossed kelsey its crossed every day you formed an opinion of her i imagine part of your job would be to remain objective but it would be impossible not to form an opinion of someone when youre monitoring her life he began to stir his coffee again even though the heaping spoonful of sugar hed added had long since dissolved it was over twenty years ago you remember her mr rooney you wouldnt have forgotten her or anything that happened she was a beautiful woman he said slowly a vibrant woman who got in over her head with alec bradley annoyed with himself rooney set the spoon aside staining his blotter with him yes in the public record you spoke of naomi chadwick was arrested for the murder of alec bradley and convicted and your photo of the shooting helped convict her it did he remembered vividly hoisting himself up into the tree his camera bumping against his chest his heart pounding you could say i was in the right place at the right time she called it selfdefense she claimed that alec bradley threatened her intended to rape her im aware of her defense the evidence didnt support it but you were there you must have seen if she was afraid if he seemed threatening he folded his hands on the edge of the desk like a man about to recite a wellrehearsed prayer i saw her let him into the house they had a drink together they argued i cant now as i couldnt then testify to what was said between them they went upstairs she went up kelsey corrected he followed her yes as far as i could tell i took a chance and used the tree thinking they would go to her bedroom because hed been in there before kelsey asked no not that i had observed but this was only the third night i had gone onto the property and the first that i knew the rest of the household was absent he kept his hands linked his eyes calm and level on hers several minutes passed i nearly climbed down again but then they came into the bedroom she entered first it appeared that they were still arguing he remembered the look on naomis face the way it had filled his viewfinder with beauty with anger with disdain and yes he remembered with fear her back was to me for a short time he cleared his throat then she spun around when she came back into view she had a gun i could see them both framed in the window he put his hands up backed away and she fired the chill ran through kelsey like a blade and then and then kelsey i froze im not proud of it but i was young id never seen i froze he repeated i watched her go to where hed fallen and lean over and i watched her go to the phone i got out of there and sat in my car until i heard the sirens you didnt call the police no not immediately it was foolish of me it could have cost me my license but i did go to them took in the film made my statement he loosened his hands abruptly aware that his fingers were aching from the pressure i did my job and all you saw was a beautiful vibrant woman who got in over her head and shot a man i wish i could tell you different your mother served her time its over not for me kelsey rose what if i hired you mr rooney right now today i want you to go back twentythree years take another look at the case i want to know all there is to know about alec bradley fear sprinted up his spine stiffening it let it rest kelsey nothing can be solved and certainly nothing can be changed by picking at old wounds do you think your mother will thank you for making her relive all of that maybe not but i intend to go back step by step until i understand will you help me he studied her but it was another woman he saw a woman sitting pale and composed in a crowded courtroom composed he remembered except for the eyes those desperate eyes no i wont im going to ask you to think this through consider the consequences i have thought it through mr rooney and i keep coming back to one conclusion my mother was telling the truth im going to prove it with or without your help thank you for your time he sat where he was long after the door closed behind her long after hed willed his hands to stop trembling when he was steady he picked up the phone and dialed her next stop was the university the long wait in her fathers cramped office calmed her considerably it was always a balm to be surrounded by books the scents and sounds of academia that was why it always lured her back she supposed in this world learning was the primary goal and every question had an answer philip entered chalk dust on his fingertips kelsey what a wonderful way to lift my day id have been here sooner but my seminar ran over a bit i didnt mind waiting i was hoping youd have a few minutes free i have the next hour which hed been planning to use to prepare for his final lecture of the day but that could wait if you can spare the rest of the afternoon ill treat you to an early dinner when im finished not tonight thanks i still have another stop to make dad i need to talk to you i dont want you to worry about your grandmother ill deal with that no im not worried about that its not important of course it is he took her by the shoulders his hands moving up and down her arms i wont tolerate this kind of a breach nor her using your heritage against you furious all over again he turned to pace the narrow confines of his office as he would while contemplating a thesis your grandmother is an admirable woman kelsey and a formidable one her blind side is the family and her tendency to confuse her own set of standards with love you dont have to explain her to me or excuse her i know that in her way she loves me its just that her way hasnt always been easy had never been easy kelsey corrected i also know she isnt used to being crossed this time shell either come to accept what im doing with my life or she wont i cant let it influence me he paused picked up a smooth glass paperweight from his desk i dont want you to be at odds neither do i if you and i went to see her together no sighing he took off his glasses polishing the lenses out of habit rather than need kelsey shes no longer young shes your family oh she thought the buttons loved ones push im sorry i cant compromise on this i know youve been shoved right into the middle of it and im sorry for that too she cant have what she wants dad and if were honest ive never been what she wanted kelsey im naomis daughter and shes always resented it i can only hope that in time shell come to accept that im just as much your daughter carefully he folded his glasses and set them on his cluttered desk beside a timeworn copy of king lear she loves you kelsey its the circumstances shes fighting i am the circumstances she said quietly im the motive the reason the child two people wanted long after they didnt want each other theres no getting past that its ridiculous to blame yourself not blame thats the wrong word but do i feel a certain sense of responsibility yes i do she said when he shook his head to you and to her thats why im here i need you to tell me what happened suddenly weary he sat rubbing his fingers over his forehead weve done this kelsey you gave me an outline a sketch you fell in love with someone despite some family disapproval on your side you married her you had a child with her somewhere along the line things went wrong between you she moved over to his side hating to hurt needing the truth im not asking you to explain all of that but you knew the woman you married you had feelings for her if you were willing to fight her for the child to go to court to hire lawyers and detectives there had to be a reason a strong one i want to know what it was i wanted you he said simply i wanted you with me selfishly perhaps not altogether reasonably you were the best part of us i didnt believe growing up in the atmosphere your mother thrived in was right for you was best for you had he been wrong he asked himself had he been wrong how many times had he asked himself that one question even after everything that had happened had borne him out your grandmother and i discussed it at great length philip continued she was violently opposed to naomi having primary custody of you in the end i agreed with her it wasnt an easy decision but it was one i believed in part of it was selfishness yes i cant deny it he looked up at her at the woman and remembered the child i didnt want to give you up to become a weekend father who would eventually be replaced by the next man in naomis life and the way she lived during those months after the separation seemed deliberately designed to challenge me her attorneys must have advised her to behave discreetly so she did precisely the opposite she courted the press incited gossip i detested the idea of hiring a detective but the documentation was needed i left that matter up to the attorneys you didnt hire rooney directly no i how do you know his name ive just come from his office kelsey he reached out and gripped her hand what is the purpose of this what do you hope to gain answers one answer in particular she tightened her fingers on his ill ask you do you believe naomi murdered alec bradley there isnt any doubt that she killed him kelsey said tersely but murder did she murder him was the woman you knew the woman you loved capable of murder he hesitated feeling his daughters fingers threaded through his i dont know he said at last i wish with all my heart that i did kelseys final meeting of the day was with her mothers lawyers shed gleaned little more there coming up hard against the unassailable wall of attorneyclient privilege she left the plush offices dissatisfied and determined there was always another avenue she reminded herself every problem had a solution all you needed were the factors the formula and the patience to see it through a pity she thought that shed always done so much better in philosophy and the arts than in math and science if she was discouraged it was because she was tired too tired she had to admit to face naomi with madeup tales of how shed spent her afternoon she drove through the gates of longshot instead if gabe wasnt home shed go on to three willows and make some excuse a headache perhaps and retreat to her room another white lie kelsey she asked herself grimly if she kept it up much longer shed not only become good at it shed accept it as normal behavior she started toward the house but instead of knocking she simply sat down on the front steps and watched the evening bloom there would be sunlight for another hour or two she mused she wondered if the whippoorwill that sang outside the window of her room had a mate nearby the call would come simultaneously with dusk sweet liquid longing the flowers were thriving here bursting through their bed of mulch to color and scent the air dainty primroses sassy pansies a trellis that would soon be covered with the spicy perfume of sweet peas lilac bushes were heavy with blooms and fragrance their petals littering the grass with deep purple such a quiet spot such a lovely spot for a man of such energy and passion she heard the door open behind her then his footsteps in a move that was as natural as the flowers blooming beside the deck she leaned against him when he sat and draped an arm around her i saw your car who planted the flowers i did its my land my father gardens in georgetown i had a lovely little courtyard in the back so naturally i took a course in horticulture and landscape design it was quite a showplace when i got done with it but it never looked quite as lovely quite as intimate as my fathers there are some things you cant get out of books i plant what appeals to me if i had it to do over thats just how id approach it ive been thinking about a rock garden out there he gestured toward the slope of the hill why dont you do it with me she smiled turning her face into his throat where the skin was warm and welcoming id head straight for the library i couldnt stop myself so wed argue about logic and whim then raid the nursery he tipped a finger under her chin to lift her face to his whats troubling you kelsey she could tell him she realized of course she could there was nothing she couldnt tell him i started something today and i know im not going to stop everyones told me i should let it alone but i cant i wont she took a deep breath and eased back until they were no longer touching do you believe my mother murdered alec bradley no she blinked shook her head just no without hesitation without qualification you asked i answered he leaned over to snap off a spray of freesia and handed it to her isnt it more important what you believe she shook her head again then dropped it into her hands you can say no simply no when you didnt even know her not really not really she lifted her head again what does that mean i knew of her id seen her around he angled his head and toyed with the ends of her hair ive been a track rat a long time kelsey i remember seeing her at charles town laurel here and there youd have been a child not the way you mean but its true i didnt know her didnt form a solid impression but i know her now and she needed specifics he thought she always would he wasnt certain he could give them to her and ive made my living reading people faces intonations gestures gamblers psychics cops shrinks we all have that skill in common or we dont last long naomi pulled the trigger but she didnt commit murder with her eyes closed she leaned against his body again the flower hed given her wafted out a delicate scent i believe that gabe part of me is afraid i do simply because i dont want to accept that my mother could have done what she was convicted of but that doesnt dilute the belief i went to see the detective today the one who testified against her his voice remained light she wondered how she could have so often missed the steel beneath it it didnt occur to you to ask me to go with you it did i wanted to do it alone she shrugged it didnt accomplish much he wouldnt tell me anything i didnt already know and he wouldnt when i tried to hire him help me find out more about alec bradley what do you want to know anything everything my mothers only part of this she moved away what kind of a man was he where did he come from what did he want naomi says he became abusive tried to rape her what triggered it have you asked her i dont want to do that unless i have to shell close up gabe shed tell me what she knew but it could bring whatever progress weve made to a dead stop i dont want to risk that she wasnt the only one who knew him kelsey had already considered that and rejected it i cant start asking questions around the track pumping the other owners or crews whatever id learn wouldnt be worth the talk it would generate whats your option i have the name of the officer who investigated my mothers case hes retired now lives in reston youve been doing your homework ive always been a good student im going to go see him gabe took her hand and pulled her to her feet were going to go see him she smiled okay chapter twenty been a while roscoe tipton slapped hands with rossi how come you dont have my old job yet im working on it captain well take a seat and well work on these brews tipton eased himself into the porch rocker he had a small igloo cooler beside it chilling a sixpack of bud hows the wife rossi accepted the can tipton offered and popped it which one oh yeah forgot youre a twotime loser with a chuckle tipton smacked his can against rossis and guzzled down divorce is almost part of the job isnt it i got lucky hows mrs tipton sassy as ever very simple very basic affection colored his grainy voice two weeks after i retire she gets a job amused tipton shook his head tells me its busywork now that the kids are grown hell we both know its to keep her from killing me with a blunt instrument so i got me my hobby shop in the back and shes selling shoes down at the mall he smiled drank again i got lucky roscoe not every woman can live with a cop active or retired tell me about it two wives and two divorces in twelve years had taught rossi that particular lesson too well youre looking good captain it was true tipton had put on a little weight in his three years off the force but it agreed with him the few pounds had filled out some of the lines the job had dug into his face he looked relaxed and at peace in a work shirt and jeans an orioles cap covered what was left of wiry hair that was a mix of ginger and gray a lot of people dont take to retirement tipton commented makes them old me im loving it i got my workshop built this chair you know really rossi tucked his tongue in his cheek as he examined the rickety rocker the fact that tipton had painted it a dazzling blue didnt disguise the way it listed to the left it must be rewarding oh it is ive got three grandchildren now too and time to enjoy them the wife and i are talking about taking a cruise this fall up the st lawrence foliage sounds like youve got it all captain damn right and if he had much more tipton was sure hed run screaming into the night a long peaceful retirements a mans reward for a job well done no one can argue about the job well done rossi sipped at the beer he preferred imported but knew better than to say so i dont guess you pay much attention to whats going down now but you might have read about a case im working on oh i glance at the headlines now and again pored over them greedy for any glimpse of murder and mayhem the groom who was murdered at charles town back in march stabbed trampled on top of it you closed that tipton remembered another groom wasnt it lipsky suicide that ones open rossi leaned back and watched a trio of starlings fluttering around an obviously homemade bird feeder on the front lawn an orange striped cat sat below eyeing them patiently on the porch he thought they were just two men passing the time with shoptalk no note no predisposition to suicide and the method doesnt fit heres how it shakes down he explained as precisely as a written report the events from lipskys firing to his death weve got a picture here of a man with a quick fuse a violent one who knows his way around horses not a man who makes friends or rises in his chosen profession one whos had a few scrapes with the law battery assault d and d a picture of a man whod run not whod pour himself a cocktail of gin and horse poison tipton chewed on that awhile but he could probably get his hands on it he could someone else could he was after slaters horse now could be that was personal he was pissed about being fired so he goes for the payback the old man catches him at it he panics now hes got a dead man on his hands why didnt he run captain why does he hunker down in a motel not an hour from charles town because hes waiting for somebody somebody to tell him what to do next and somebody poured him one hell of a drink there were no prints on the gin bottle it was wiped clean that particular angle had tipton smiling small mistakes he thought he had always been fond of small mistakes he watched his old cat waiting for one of the starlings to make one and understood precisely and youve got an open case of homicide have you taken a good look at this slater oh ive looked at him an interesting man lots of currents did some time for illegal gambling if it had been a couple of months earlier hed have ended up in juvie instead of a cell absently rossi tapped his fingers on the arm of his chair hes been clean since so far as the record shows grew up mostly on the streets mother died when he was a kid the father slid his way out of trouble had some arrests fraud forgery passing bad checks mostly con games pounded on a working girl in taos a few years ago but nothing sticks slater slipped out of the system at about fourteen tripped up and served his time then kept his nose clean i cant say he wouldnt have done lipsky but hed have been more direct about it who else have you got nobody who clicks did you catch the derby on tv captain roscoe theres only one sport thats baseball he tipped his cap i did hear something about a horse breaking its leg the horse was drugged captain overdosed and it was slaters ride that won the race well tipton mused over the last swallow of beer where are you circling to roscoe im not sure about that but its a big circle it goes back twentythree years naomi chadwick captain what can you tell me about her funny tipton set the empty can under his shoe then crushed it flat thats the second time ive heard that name today the daughter called me this morning he glanced at his watch she should be here soon kelsey bydens coming here she wants to talk to me about her mother tipton leaned back in the rocker enjoying the way it creaked that does take me back you should have stayed on the farm kelsey muttered theres barely a week until belmont jamie can handle things without me gabe smiled as he negotiated a turn in fact he prefers it i dont feel right about taking you away from work now i could have done this alone kelsey with patience gabe picked up her hand kissed it shut up i cant im too nervous this is the man who arrested my mother who questioned her who put her in jail now im going to ask him to help me prove he made a mistake and i lied to naomi again i told her we were going for a drive we are driving thats not the point she snapped im deceiving her and moses everyone and for what so i can satisfy this idiotic need to assure myself i dont spring from a line of murderers is that what this is about no she rubbed a hand over her eyes i dont know some of it hereditys a scary thing as soon as shed said it she winced i dont mean to imply that hereditys the only factor in the makeup of character environment she trailed off defeated i lose on both counts he murmured i wondered when youd add it up thats not what im doing thats not what ive done she hissed out a breath and cursed herself i dont know what im doing it has nothing to do with you or the way i feel about you lets backtrack a minute it had been a gamble a foolish one to hope this moment would never come if he was going to lose he intended to lose big you have doubts about yourself because of your family history dont he said when she started to interrupt lets lay the cards down you have doubts about me because of mine he was driving fast now laying on the curves on the back roads letting speed eat up some of the tension thats not true gabe i couldnt have slept with you if id had doubts yes you could its easy to ignore logic and doubts in the heat of the moment and were good in bed were better than good in bed but sooner or later logic clicks in again ive got bad blood kelsey and theres no draining it out his eyes stayed on the road though he was very aware that hers were on his face studying considering where you come from always stays with you you can clean it up dress it up but its always underneath ive seen things and done things that would shake that moral code of yours right down to the foundation i dont cheat and i dont lean on the bottle but thats about all i can say i havent done the simple facts are i wanted what cunningham had and i found a way to get it i wanted you in bed and i would have done whatever it took to get you there i see now she stared straight ahead the speed didnt frighten her but he did is it just sex he didnt answer for a moment they both watched the road twist ahead no i wish to christ it was she closed her eyes on a quiet shuddering sigh pull over she murmured when he ignored her she straightened in her seat pull over slater she said firmly and stop the damn car the tires screeched when he slapped a foot on the brakes and jerked the wheel to the shoulder where gravel spat if you think im letting you get out here youre a goddamned idiot ill take you into reston or ill take you back home ive no intention of getting out here fine thats fine youd better understand i have no intention of letting you go not here not anywhere i gave you your chance to run shed never seen him so completely unnerved no you didnt he snatched her lapels and jerked her around in her seat its all the chance youre getting fuck your right and wrong kelsey and your country club upbringing and anything else thats in my way youre not walking out on me without a fight her own temper began to rumble fine since youre going to take that insulting neanderthal attitude it hardly seems appropriate for me to tell you im in love with you his hands went limp for an instant every muscle in his body went numb her eyes were on his sulky signaling fight in progress but he was already down for the count you dont know what you are she hit him both gasped in surprise when her fist jabbed just under his heart im not tolerating that she smacked his hands aside im not tolerating that attitude im sick to death of people i care about assuming i dont know my own mind or heart i know it very well and though at this particular moment it galls me im in love with you now start this damn car and lets get this over with he couldnt have driven a tricycle give me a minute she huffed out a breath crossed her legs and folded her arms fine take your time itll give me the opportunity to plan several ways to make you suffer come here she jabbed out and connected with her elbow when he reached for her hands off okay i just imagined id be touching you when i told you i love you not particularly mollified but thoughtful she turned her head a fraction have you been imagining it for long a while i thought it would pass like a virus he held up both hands when she jerked around are you going to hit me again i might damned if she was going to laugh no matter how much his eyes tempted her a virus yeah only theres this thing about viruses id forgotten they dont go away they just sneak into some corner of your system and kick back in when your defenses are down he took her hand fisted it in his and brought it to his lips ive been trying to get used to this one and how are you doing better now he lowered his brow to hers christ what timing we should be home alone it doesnt matter she tilted her head so that her lips brushed his well make up for it when we are when he deepened the kiss she sank into it how can everything be such a mess and this be so right luck of the draw he eased back and looked into her eyes well make sure it stays right this is enough for now gently she lifted a hand to his cheek this is better than enough the first thing tipton noticed when the couple climbed out of the fancy foreign car in his driveway was that they were lovers the man did no more than lay a hand on the womans shoulder she did no more than glance up smile but tipton pegged it the second thing he noticed was that the woman was almost a dead ringer for naomi or the naomi he had put behind bars oh there were subtle differences and his trained eye nailed them as well the daughters mouth was softer a tad more generous the cheekbones were slightly less prominent the walk more fluid naomis gait had been an energetic even a nervous scissoring of legs one that had drawn the eye of every male within a mile of her but all in all he was glad kelsey byden had called first it would have been a shock to have glanced up and seen her strolling up his walk like the ghost of the woman hed never forgotten captain tipton her smile was fleeting as her gaze shifted lieutenant rossi i wasnt expecting to see you here small world isnt it irritating her only amused him and he helped himself to another beer he wasnt on duty after all why dont i make the introductions kelsey byden and gabriel slater my former commanding officer captain james tipton roscoe here was always one for procedure tipton grinned as kelsey lifted a brow at the nickname sit down have a beer mr slater doesnt drink rossi put in oh well i think the wife brewed up some iced tea why dont you go on in roscoe and pour our company a couple of glasses that would be nice pleased to put rossi in the position of serving kelsey made herself comfortable on the top step i appreciate your taking the time to see us captain no problem i got nothing but time hows your mother getting on very well you remember her then im not likely to forget but he shifted tactics preferring to get a lay of the land roscoe tells me congratulations are in order mr slater youve got a horse that might cop the triple crown not that i know a lot about it baseballs my game gabe knew something about tactics as well my moneys on the birds this year theyve got a solid pitching rotation and an infield so tight you can barely squeeze a mosquito through it they do delighted tipton slapped his knee by sweet jesus they do you see them tromp the jays last night goddamned canadians gabe grinned slipped out a cigar i caught the last couple of innings he offered one to tipton lit it for him that last triple took fifty out of my assistant trainers pocket and put it into mine tipton puffed im not a betting man myself gabe flicked on his lighter at the tip of his own cigar watched tipton over the flame i am he blew out smoke nodded when rossi came back with two tall glasses thanks roscoes a football fan i never could educate him into the thinkingmans sport im beginning to develop an interest in the sport of kings rossi took his seat again ill have my eye on the belmont mr slater a lot of us will now the lady didnt come out here to talk sports tipton offered kelsey a friendly smile youre here about murder what can you tell me about alec bradley captain he pursed his lips shed surprised him hed been sure she would focus on her mother intrigued he shifted gears and turned back the clock alec bradley thirtytwo formerly of palm beach hed been married once to a woman oh fifteen years his senior she paid him off with a nice settlement in the divorce apparently hed worked his way through most of it by the time he met your mother what did he do charmed the ladies tipton shrugged sponged off acquaintances played the horses when he could he owned his own tuxedo tipton paused for a sip of beer he was killed in it you didnt like him kelsey commented to amuse himself and to help align his thoughts with his words tipton blew three smoke rings he was dead when i met him but no from what the investigation turned up on him he wasnt the kind of man id ask home for dinner he made dallying with married women rich married women a profession theyd pay him off with money and presents introductions to other restless married women if they didnt pay him enough hed use blackmail in my day we called them gigolos i dont know what you call them now slime gabe said pleasantly and earned an approving nod from the captain slater had taste he decided in women and cigars that says it well enough the man had a way about him fancy manners fancy education a family line that went back to some puffedup english earl and he had that way with women married women who couldnt afford scandal my mother was separated captain and in the middle of a custody suit she couldnt afford the carryingson with bradley to come out if she wanted to win it but she saw him publicly socially tipton agreed it didnt seem to bother her that people assumed they were lovers no one could prove it he tapped cigar ashes into the crushed can of bud there were rumors about bradley sniffing expensive white powder up his nose no one proved that either until he was dead drugs kelsey paled but continued my mother said nothing about drugs i didnt read anything about them in the newspaper reports no drugs at three willows tipton sighed her eyes so much like her mothers were taking him back the place was clean your mother was clean bradley had a mixture of alcohol and cocaine in his system when he died if thats true he could have been irrational violent just as my mother said there werent any signs of struggle the lace of your mothers nightgown was torn he touched a hand to his chest she had a couple of bruises nothing she couldnt have done herself if she did that herself why didnt she knock over a few tables break some lamps smart girl he thought i asked myself and her that same question and what did she say the first time we were sitting downstairs they were still taking pictures in the bedroom shed put on a big robe over her nightgown as if shed been cold tipton remembered as if shed been shivering under that heavy quilted material when i asked her she snapped right back maybe i didnt think of it he smiled shook his head pissed at me is what she was those were the kind of answers she gave until her lawyers shut her up the second time i asked her was in the interrogation room she was smoking one cigarette after the other practically eating them whole when i asked her again she said she wished she had thought of it she wished she had because then someone might believe her he set his beer aside and sighed deeply and you know ms byden the thing was just like i told roscoe here before you drove up i did believe her kelsey unfolded legs she could no longer feel and forced herself to stand you believed her you believed she was telling the truth but you sent her to prison i believed her tipton repeated and his eyes narrowed focused cops eyes but the evidence was against her i spent a lot of sleepless nights looking for something to weigh on the other side all i had was my gut i did my job ms byden i arrested her i booked her i presented the evidence at her trial thats what i had to do is that how you live with it kelsey held her fists at her sides you knew she was telling the truth i believed tipton corrected thats a long way from knowing well roscoe that took me back a few tipton watched the jaguar back out of the drive then set his chair to creaking again how many times do you see real gray eyes no green in them no blue just smoke you dont forget eyes like that naomi chadwick got to you captain that doesnt mean she was telling the truth oh she got to me i was a happily married man roscoe never once caught any action on the side but i thought about naomi chadwick did i believe her because she played some elemental tune on my libido he sighed shrugged and crushed his second can of beer i dont know i was never sure the da was pushing for an arrest he wanted that trial and the evidence was there so i did my job rossi studied his second bud what did you think of charles rooney the pi he was a hotdogger there were plenty of fancy names on his client list back then mostly divorce cases i leaned on him and he stuck to his story he had the film he had his reports and the bydens lawyers backed him up he witnessed a murder and didnt report it we pressed that button claimed he was shaken up a guy thinks hes going to snap pictures of a bout of hot sex gets murder instead allegedly he was still sitting in his car when the blackandwhites arrived he logged the time down to the minute then waited three days to bring in the film tipton wiggled his wiry eyebrows how deep are you digging here roscoe as deep as it takes he set the halffull beer on the porch between his feet and leaned forward hands on knees twentythree years ago youve got a dead horse in a race drugs a suicide and a murder now weve got a murder a suspicious death with the earmarks of suicide a dead horse in a race and drugs does the pendulum swing like that captain or does it get a shove youre a good cop roscoe like a veteran firehorse tipton quivered at the sound of the bell how many of the players are around on this swing thats what we need to find out maybe you could take some time out from your workshop and give me a hand with the research tiptons smile was slow and settled comfortably on his round face i could probably work it into my schedule thats what id hoped youd say the jockey who hanged himself benedict morales benny maybe you could flesh him out for me kelsey straightened in her seat when gabe drove through the gates at longshot gabe i should just go home im not good company no youre not he braked turned off the ignition and i figure you might as well have your explosion here rather than at three willows where youd have to explain it to naomi im just so angry she bounded out of the car and slammed the door he believed her but he sent her to prison cops dont send you to prison darling juries do believe me ive been there the point is she spent ten years behind bars isnt that the point the point he said taking her arm and steering her into the house is that that parts done you cant change it how much are you willing to risk to turn back the clock and prove it was a mistake stunned she stared at him risk whats the matter with you the risk doesnt count it doesnt matter what happened to her was wrong it has to be put right black and white there was a twist in her gut one quick churn and if it is then it is he said simply but dont overlook the gray areas kelsey not everything you find out if you go on with this is going to fit neatly into one column or the other she stepped back from him and the distance was much wider than the simple movement you want me to stop i want you to be prepared for deliberately he closed the distance cupping her stiff shoulders in his hands not everyone you care about is perfect and not everyone who matters to you is going to thank you for sweeping away two decades worth of dust she shrugged irritably in a fruitless attempt to dislodge his hands im aware that naomi wasnt isnt a saint i dont expect perfection slater or look for it but i want the truth fine as long as you can handle it when you get it no use trying to shake me off he said and smiled when she shoved at his hands the first truth youre going to have to swallow is that youre stuck with the cards youve been dealt you and i are going to play out this hand im not trying to shake you off i just need to think about what to do next i can help you with that he urged her closer those clever hands slipping down her back cruising up again youre going to relax take a swim i dont have a suit with me darling im counting on that he was kissing her now in a way that always turned her mind to fluff after im going to talk you into trying out some of those culinary skills you once bragged about relaxing seemed like an excellent idea with a little murmur of pleasure she turned her head to ease his access to her neck you want me to cook for you i do then i want to take you upstairs and seduce you what are you doing now this is just a preview tomorrow when youre relaxed and your minds clear well start thinking again it sounds sensible he nipped his way back up to her mouth it wasnt particularly fair he knew to keep certain ideas to himself but he wanted to clear the tension out of her face and to celebrate the fact that theyd found each other for one night he wanted them both to concentrate on only that lets be sensible he stepped back sliding his hands down her arms until they were linked with hers i love you her heart took one long slow turn in her breast how can i argue with that chapter twentyone in the rosy light of dawn moses watched the mares lead their babies to water he knew the pecking order as well as they big bess with an arrogant swish of her tail was first always then carmen the hardheaded red followed by trueheart and so on down the line until shy selfeffacing sunny the foals scampered with them frisky and secure unaware moses thought that in a few short weeks they would be weaned and separated from mama in the next step toward their destinies some would be trained for the track some would be sold at yearling auctions one might show a different promise and be culled out as a jumper or for the show ring moses wasnt much on show horses himself it seemed as shallow to his mind as beauty pageants some would be gelded others bred and one maybe one would show the mark of a true champion there was always another derby he told himself always another chance for that win maybe that one the little chestnut with the blaze the one with the cocky tilt to his head naomi had named him tomorrows arrogance because of it he had the lines the breeding and time would tell if he had the heart in his own breast mosess heart was heavy hed put too much on the line at the derby he knew better both sides of his heritage warned against testing the gods yet he had tested them putting all of his hopes all of his heart into one twominute race and the cost had been staggering theyre beautiful arent they kelsey murmured from behind him its hard to believe that in another year theyll be ready for the saddle moses tucked his hands into his front pockets and kept his eyes on the foals so you decided to show up im sorry im a little late a little late today half a day yesterday and the day before that there were some things i had to take care of things he turned to her knowing he was about to take out some of his frustration on her certain she deserved it only one thing comes first for anybody who works here and thats the horses he strode off toward the barn with kelsey trotting guiltily after him im sorry moses really it was unavoidable her heels dug in when he stopped abruptly in front of her and swung about listen little girl this isnt one of your playgrounds you dont get to call time here and tie your shoe what you do is you pull your weight all day every day because if you dont someone else has to pick up the slack thats not the way i run things just what were you doing yesterday when you should have been with your horse when you should have been taking your orders from the yearling manager i was kelsey all but sawed at her tongue it was personal business from now on you get your hair fluffed and your nails painted on your own time im not wasting mine youve got stalls to muck but i i need to work with honor shes already on the longe you can cool her off when shes done now get a shovel he strode away disappearing inside his office grooms and stable hands whod stopped to listen immediately got back to work everyone enjoyed a public flogging but no one liked to get caught watching one well youve been accepted naomi stepped up to kelsey and ran a comforting hand up and down her spine he wouldnt have spoken to you that way unless he considered you part of the team he might have slapped me down privately kelsey muttered and goddammit i wasnt getting my hair done look at these incensed she fanned out her fingers the nails short clipped unpolished does it look like ive had a manicure recently im not here to play just because i needed a few hours off she stopped swore again it was important to me sometimes we can forget theres anything else going on in the world that doesnt happen right here youre under no obligation to throw yourself into this the fact is most owners arent nearly so involved with the daytoday work if youd rather you dont think i can handle it color bloomed and rode high on kelseys cheeks you dont think i can see it through im not saying that kelsey arent you why should this be any different ive always moved from job to job interest to interest why should anyone believe that i can stick that this means any more than writing ad copy or explaining impressionist art to tour groups if i can give up on everything else why shouldnt i give up on this she tossed back her hair because it is different because everythings different turning on her heel she stalked to the barn naomi only sighed it was she realized a surefire way to forget your own troubles when two people you loved dumped their own at your feet gauging temperaments she decided that kelsey could use some time wielding a pitchfork to cool off so she started with moses he was at his desk barking on the phone to renos agent no im not putting him up at belmont hes not ready and corelli rode high water to place in the preakness he knows the colt and he deserves the ride yeah thats final he slammed the phone down cutting off the voice yammering through the receiver im not putting up a spooked jockey with a bum shoulder i agree with you ready to placate she sat on the corner of his desk and so does reno he knows hes not ready in a gesture she hoped would serve as truce she covered his hand with hers werent you a little rough on kelsey out there his face closed and moses drew his hand away are you here as the owner or as her mother im here moses she said and left it at that i know shes taken some time off recently just as i know that somethings troubling her just she continued quietly as i know somethings troubling you lets stick with one issue naomi he pushed back from the desk shes been slacking off so maybe the blooms faded puzzled she studied his face not just annoyed she realized but worried and maybe she just had some loose ends to tie up we cant forget the fact that shes had to make a lot of adjustments in a very short time i thought you were happy even impressed with her work up until now up until now he agreed ive been anything but happy and impressed the last few days she needed a shot and i gave her one maybe youve forgotten thats one of the things i do around here if you want her treated differently i didnt say that annoyance snapped into her voice but i know you moses you dont slap someone down like that in public for a couple of infractions so whos decided to treat her differently he turned so that they faced each other with the desk between them as far as i see it thats a girl whos gotten pretty much everything she wants her whole life shes spoiled shes reckless and shes used to coming and going as she pleases just like i was he acknowledged that with a nod some but you finished what you started naomi maybe this is the first time shes found something worth finishing and maybe shes getting bored and is going to pack her bags do you think i dont know what its going to do to you if she turns away now the chill had naomi hugging her arms youre the one who told me she wasnt going to do that maybe i was wrong maybe i was just so damn happy to see you smile all the way again everything seemed to be moving in the right direction and then disgusted he dropped back down into the chair scrubbed his hands over his face goddammit she got in my way at the wrong time what is it moses she reached for him again this time he gripped her hand the gods laugh naomi especially when you forget that they can step in at any time and snatch away what you want most ive had my heart broke before he looked up at her again smiled a little you did it first but its been a while id forgotten how much it hurts pride she murmured you let me do all the grieving over him miserable he looked down at the joined hands i missed something naomi i had myself so revved up about winning that i had to be careless even for a minute it cost too much you can grieve moses but you cant take the blame that was my horse naomi his eyes cut back to hers your name might be on the papers but he was mine and i lost him i wasnt looking in the right place at the right time i didnt sense what i should have sensed even now i go back over that day i go back and back and back and i cant see it it had to be under my nose he rapped a fist against the desk under my fucking nose there was she knew only one way to handle him in a mood like this okay whitetree it was all your fault you were in charge i pay you to train my horses to know them to understand them and to guide them from birth to death i also pay you to oversee the men to hire and fire and to decide which team works for which horse for which race it looks as though ive also been paying you to foretell the future she cocked her head since thats the case i dont know whether to fire you or give you a raise im serious about this so am i she rose and skirted the desk to knead his knotted shoulders i want to know what happened moses i want to know who did it and i want them to pay what i dont want and cant afford is to have you someone i love and depend on losing heart weve got less than eleven months to the first saturday in may yeah he blew out a stream of breath i guess i should go apologize to that girl of yours leave it she can take a lump he smiled again she wanted to give me a few christ shes got your eyes i dont have a lot of regrets about things i havent done naomi in fact i can count the big ones on one hand ive never made a pilgrimage to israel never walked in the footsteps of my ancestors on either side and i never made a child with you her hands stopped and he reached back and gripped them hard im sorry no she lowered her head so that her cheek rested on his hair dont be why are there so seldom second chances on the big ones moses rich was thinking the same thing second chances were as rare as hens teeth it was a lucky man who could snare one rich slater was a lucky man he put two grand on the trifecta at laurel and moseyed back to the bar mostly trifectas were a suckers game but he was on a roll sticking with the ponies he thought the hell with cards fuck point spreads the horses were his babies now he ordered another bourbon his new sentimental drink of choice then drew out a fivedollar cigar the lighter that flared under it caused his brows to rise rich puffed the cigar into life then swiveled to smile affably at his son well now just like old times bring my boy here one of the same he ordered the bartender gabe merely held up a finger coffee black shit rich drew the word out to three syllables dont be such a pussy boy im buying coffee gabe repeated then studied his father he knew the signs flushed cheeks bright eyes big toothy smile rich slater was not only half drunk but he had money in his pocket i thought you had trouble coming out from chicago got that all straightened out dont you worry about me gabe everybody knows old rich slaters good for his markers oh gabe lifted a brow i thought the trouble had something to do with dealing from the bottom of the deck was that what hed told the boy rich wondered and searched back through his soggy memory well it didnt matter just a difference of opinion thats all all tidied up now this heres my race he gestured toward the monitor number three he muttered yeah number three gabe glanced up at the screen just as the gate sprang open ive heard youve been playing the track again come on baby hug that rail whered you hear that here and there somebody spotted you at churchill downs on derby day rich continued to watch the race urging his horse on with little jerks of his body his mind was working though picking carefully through the minefield gabe was setting for him hes got it hes got it now come on wire ha son of a bitch i can pick em pleased that the first horse on his ticket had come in a winner he signaled for another drink ive got the touch gabe ive always had the touch what kind of touch did you have in kentucky last month kentucky the broad amiable grin only widened i havent been down in kentucky for oh five six years or more shoulda stuck with the horses though thats the truth i saw you myself the morning of the race not by a flicker did rich show reaction his eyes stayed on his sons i dont think so buddy boy ive got me a nice set of rooms outside baltimore all the action i need is within an easy drive pimlico laurel charles town now maybe youre thinking of pimlico the preakness i was there sure was he winked had some money down on your colt too you didnt let me down maybe seeing as im rolling hot ill take a trip up to belmont think you can cop the whole crown do you gabe you do well have ourselves a real celebration there was trouble at the derby i know about that shocked i was too sitting in my room watching it on tv crying shame to see a horse go down that way he shook his head sadly over his drink damn shame but then it didnt hurt you any did it somebody helped that horse go down lips pursed around his cigar rich nodded now i heard about that too nasty business christ knows it happens he reached for the beer nuts popped two in his mouth gabe noticed he was wearing a ring on his pinky little diamonds shaped into a dollar sign oh not as much as it used to rich went on harder to get away with pumping a horse up with chemicals these days he puffed out smoke amusing himself by stringing gabe along now back in the days when your granddaddy and me used to play the ponies there were plenty of tricks didnt have so many tests then so many fucking rules on the horses and the jocks but that was forty years ago and more he sighed reminiscently too bad you never got to know your granddaddy gabe too bad he got a bullet in the brain over a difference of opinion thats the truth rich said with no sarcasm he was a man whod loved his daddy its like i always tried to teach you son sometimes cheatings just part of the game its a matter of skill and timing and sometimes its a matter of murder a horse a man ones not so different from the other to some people some horses ive liked better than some men i remember another race in lexington i was just a kid gabe picked up his cooling coffee watching his father over the rim but i remember you were nervous it wasnt that hot the bluegrass stakes is in the spring but you were sweating a lot you had me working the stands looking for loose change panhandling a horse broke down that day too happens he turned back to the monitor despite the chill from the airconditioning the back of his neck was damp ive seen it happen plenty in my day it was a chadwick horse then too no shit well thats bad luck hey cant you see im dry here rich slapped a hand on the bar a jockey hanged himself over it as i recall we didnt stick around long after that race a few days thats all that was funny too because our room was paid up itchy feet ive always had them you were flush after that the money didnt last long it never did but you had a nice fat roll when we headed out i must have bet some winners that day youre on a roll now too arent you new suit gold watch diamond ring he picked up richs hand manicure you got a point here boy braced against the stench of bourbon gabe leaned closer his voice was low icily controlled youd better hope i dont find out you were in kentucky on the first saturday in may you dont want to threaten me gabe oh yes i do with fear and rage circling through his system rich picked up his fresh drink you want to back off is what you want to do you want to let things lie and get your mind on that horse youre running next week keep your mind on that and on that pretty blond filly youre banging in a flash gabe had a hand wrapped around the knot of his fathers new silk tie the bartender hustled over we dont want any trouble here no trouble rich grinned into gabes face no trouble at all just a family discussion thats a prime piece youre putting it to son blue blood i bet a thoroughbred like thats got plenty of kick and lots of endurance maybe its time she met your dear old daddy gabes hand ached with the pressure of making a fist the fist ached to connect yet no matter how repugnant there was no escaping the fact that the man was his father keep away from her gabe said quietly or ill kill you we both know you havent got the guts for that but well make a deal you keep out of my business i keep out of yours rich smoothed down his tie when gabe allowed him to jerk free otherwise i might just have me a nice long talk with your pretty lady id bet wed have lots to talk about keep away from whats mine gabe took out a bill and put it on the counter beside the coffee hed barely tasted keep far away from whats mine kids rich beamed a fresh smile at the nervous bartender when gabe strode away they just never learn respect he picked up his drink tried to ignore the fact that his hand was unsteady sometimes you just got to pound it into them he muttered nursing his drink he turned back to the monitor and waited for his horse to come in it was nearly dusk when kelsey walked out of the barn for the last time shed put in a backbreaking twelve hours hauling manure and straw scrubbing down concrete polishing tack now every muscle in her body was weeping all she wanted was a blissfully hot bath and oblivion want a beer moses sat on a barrel two cold bottles dangling from his fingers hed been waiting for her no she gave him a nod as frosty as the brews thanks kelsey he held a bottle up i couldnt find my peace pipe reluctant she gave in and accepted one shed have preferred a gallon of water but the beer washed away the taste of dirt and sweat just as well moses narrowed his eyes at the purpling bruise on her upper arm what happened there pacer take a bite thats right so youre not going to be able to stay pissed off at me for long im too charming kelsey drank again no youre not works with your mother he grumbled listen i think you screwed up and i let you know it now im telling you youve done a good job and not just today for the most part for the most part thats right you learn fast and you dont make the same mistake twice but you still need somebody looking over your shoulder youve got a temperament problem but were used to that around here between the horses and your mother my her jaw dropped my mother she can be a mule when it suits her not that she flies off the handle much now the way she did when she was younger im sorry about that sometimes he looked down at his boots damn sorry about that its not that they broke her but they changed her toughened her i guess so she learned how to pull in i came down on you today more because of her than because of the job i dont understand if you turn away from her now itll kill her she wouldnt want me to say it but im saying it theres nothing that means more to me in this world than naomi i dont want to see her hurt again im not turning away im not trying to hurt her that may be a lot for you to take on faith but i wish you would i wish you could you know i figure anybody who can purge a horse and not run for covers got to be trusted see you in the morning sure she started away then looked over her shoulder its a pretty evening it is that women like to walk in the moonlight ive heard that there should be plenty of it in a couple of hours satisfied kelsey continued toward the house shed done her job all around she decided now she was going to let gertie stuff her with anything available in the kitchen then soak out all the aches in a marathon bath an hour later she was dozing amid a swirl of bubbles and scent her world had smoothed out again she was in the middle of a lazy yawn when the door opened gabe flustered she scooted up spewing froth dangerously close to the rim of the tub what are you doing gertie told me id find you up here he hooked his thumbs in his belt loops and simply enjoyed the view i was going to get you and bring you home with me but it doesnt look like youre dressed for the ride i often bathe naked its a habit of mine how about i wash your back and any other hardtoreach places i can handle it she pushed her hair out of her eyes and struggled not to give in to the urge to cross her arms over her bubblebedecked breasts listen why dont you wait downstairs until im finished he considered then shook his head and began unbuttoning his shirt nope im coming in you are not were in my mothers house for gods sake shes not here thats not the point hurriedly she scooped her bangs out of her eyes keep that shirt on slater gerties downstairs she hissed shell have to stay there there isnt room in that tub for the three of us he tossed his shirt aside and sat down to pry off his boots its not a joke its just not appropriate i need you kelsey her protest turned into a sigh she could see it now the tension in the set of his shoulders it was all but coming off him in waves dammit she murmured lock the door i already did his jeans joined hers on the floor then he was easing himself into the steamy water behind her his arms encircled her waist he buried his face in her hair god he drew in her scent wallowed in her texture while he fought off the fury that had roiled inside him since the confrontation with his father he needed it to go away just for an hour she could do that for him she could do anything for him gabe tell me whats wrong ssh he slicked his hands up to the slippery curve of her breasts skimmed wet fingertips over her nipples just let me touch you i only need to touch you he drowned her in tenderness hed never been so gentle before so patient so careful with her leaning against him he did only what hed said hed needed only touched her fingers sliding along a long thigh skimming down from knee to calf flowing up again to dip inside her so that the heat melted her bones shuddering she tried to turn to face him but he pressed her back not yet his mouth danced over her glistening shoulder along the nape of her neck where falling tendrils curled damply so she surrendered more completely than she had before letting his hands take her where he chose water lapped bubbles dissolved each time she climaxed felt her body tighten tremble explode she was sure it was the last yet he slowly patiently quietly built a new fire she could float on the smoke of it drift deaf to her own throaty moans when at last he shifted her letting water spill carelessly over the rim over the tiles she sank back through the clouds of smoke into the flames chapter twentytwo that horse was not going to win rich helped himself to cunninghams scotch after all a man shouldnt get himself hung up on one kind of liquor or one kind of woman or one kind of game the boy had never understood that he thought as he downed a double and poured another hed never been able to teach that little son of a bitch anything well he was going to teach him now good and proper there would be no triple crown this year no indeed he was going to see to that hed come to do a job and if it turned out it had the benefit of a little personal revenge so much the better he settled into cunninghams easy chair propped his shiny new gucci loafers on the footstool and smiled this was the life for him all right lord of the manor a fine house in the country a couple of spiffy cars in the garage a hungry woman in bed he was going to have it too once he tied up this last loose end he was taking his winnings out to vegas they knew him in vegas yes sir they knew good old richie slater in that town hed be a high roller penthouse suite at caesars a topheavy babe hanging on his arm when hed cleaned up there hed buy himself a house maybe right in nevada come to that one of those fancy digs with cactus and palm trees and a pool in the backyard then when the urge struck him or the level got low in his billfold hed just slip on into town and clean up again he sat there dreaming a bit about a wheel that always spun to his tune and cards that fell like angels into his hand what the hell are you doing flushed and breathless cunningham stood in the doorway rather than the commanding tone hed hoped for his voice came out in a squeak hey there billy boy all finished talking with your partners word is youre syndicating that filly for a million flat thats my business the deal was nearly set and nothing nothing he promised himself was going to interfere there was a loan to pay off and it was nearing deadline you got your money slater you and i are done lips puckered rich contemplated his last swallow of scotch now thats downright unfriendly billy what are you doing in my house cant an old pal drop by for a visit he grinned guilelessly that pretty little bedwarmer of yours was a lot more welcoming when she let me in on her way out shopping she said down to neiman marcus needless markup that is get it he chuckled at his own wit marla cunningham said with what dignity he could muster is my wife no shit after slapping himself on the knee rich rose to pour another drink got yourself a ball and chain with firstclass tits did you well congratulations billy boy youre a bigger fool than anybody couldve guessed if he wasnt a fool now cunningham thought hed certainly been one when hed slid back into a deal with rich slater but now and from now on everything was legitimate the syndication deal which cunningham had just shaken hands on down at his barn was every bit as big as rich had heard so it was time way past the time to cut old ties all of them im going to ask you to leave rich were square you and me and it isnt smart for us to be seen together nobody here but you and me rich winked and settled back in the chair again oh he knew what cunningham was thinking yes indeed he did billy boy figured he didnt need good old rich anymore now dont you worry im not here to squeeze you for more money you just rest easy on that it pacified him a little what is it then a favor thats all just a favor between old friends and former business associates theres a horse that needs to be taken care of bill he lifted his glass enjoying the way the sun burst through the window and struck the facets i dont want any part of it what you want and what youve got are two different things he shifted his eyes from his glass to cunningham im going to take out my sons colt billy and youre going to help me youre crazy shaken cunningham swiped at the sweat beading on his upper lip youre crazy rich and i dont want anything to do with it lets talk about that rich said and smiled kelseys suitcases were neatly packed and lined up next to gabes by the bedroom door they would leave for new york at seven am sharp six hours from now she thought as she gazed up through the skylight over the bed she sighed shifted and snuggled up against gabe it struck her amazed her as it always did to find him there warm solid hers that body she skimmed her fingers down his chest up again long and hard and tireless the face that could make her toes curl every time he looked at her and that was only the shell a terrific shell she mused tracing his jaw with her fingertip but what was inside it was equally impressive the strength the kindness the courage hed already beaten the odds time and time again overcoming a birthright of misery and meanness to make it on his own right now sleeping in his place of honor in the barn was a horse who had the same kind of strength and courage together they were going to make history its no use she murmured nuzzling her lips against his throat hmm automatically he stroked a hand down her back hed been enjoying the lazy caress of her fingertips for some time i cant sleep im too revved well then always willing to accommodate he rolled her over so that she was stretched on top of him enjoy yourself she chuckled wiggling away thats not what i meant kneeling she looked down at him letting herself linger over the long silhouette not that it isnt a tempting offer leaning down she gave him a smacking kiss ill take you up on it when i get back he made a grab but she was already scrambling off the bed get back from where i need to walk i want to look in on double she tugged jeans over naked legs and hips made his mouth water darling its one oclock in the morning i know her head popped out of the opening of a baggy tshirt in a little over eight hours well be at belmont so who can sleep tossing back her hair she pulled on boots he could have but it seemed a moot point ill come with you you dont have to i wont be long he sat up raked a hand through his hair ill come with you okay catch up with me she dashed out the door and down the stairs it was a perfect june night warm just a little breezy starshattered she heard the long doubletoned hoot of an owl smelled roses and nightblooming jasmine moonlight showered on the outbuildings lending them a timeless fairytale aura perhaps this was her fairy tale she thought her personal happilyeverafter it was true that tragedy had brought her here opened the door to her future but fairy tales were rife with tragedy orphans and spellbound princes betrayals and sacrifices evil intent and lost loves but right always triumphed maybe that was why the analogy appealed to her if this was her fairy tale she would see that right triumphed she wouldnt give up on finding the truth she would see captain tipton again and charles rooney she would talk to gertie to moses and yes to naomi to anyone who had had even the smallest role in the events leading to alec bradleys death she would convince naomi to allow her lawyers to speak freely but for now for the next week there was only the belmont and she was a part of it with a quiet laugh kelsey lifted her face toward the sky she had a place in the grandeur and the grit the sweat and the seduction of racings finest hour in a weeks time she promised herself she would watch gabe and his spectacular colt accept the last jewel in the crown a barn cat dashed across the path his long sleek form a gray bullet that shot her heart to her throat chuckling at herself she rubbed a hand there as if to ease it back into her chest again the stable door opened with a thin squeak the smells came first old friends rushing at her through the dark horse leather liniment manure rather than turn on the lights and disturb those sleeping she groped along the wall from memory and found a flashlight its beam cut a narrow swath her boot heels clicked after it from the second stall a pair of eyes gleamed goblinlike from the shadows her breath caught the beam bobbled fairy tales indeed she thought and was grateful gabe wasnt with her to see how she jumped at a couple of barn cats she smiled when she saw the cot pulled in front of doubles box the security system aside a warrior like this merited a personal guard well she wouldnt disturb the groom she promised herself just one quick peek over the cot and into the box and shed leave them both sleeping but the cot she saw with some surprise was empty alarmed she shone her light into the box double was there fully awake staring back at her sorry fella i guess im jumpy did your friend here go off for a smoke or a call of nature are you all packed she laughed and reached for the box door it wasnt latched was open fully three inches oh god a movement behind her had her swinging about flashlight gripped like a weapon the blood thundered in her ears as she zigzagged the beam and cursed the cats who hunted at night but a cat however quick and clever hadnt unlatched and opened the stall door her one clear thought was to protect to defend kelsey shoved the door open and rushed to the colts side even as she pivoted to shine her light into the corners of the box the blood in her ears exploded she was aware of one vivid flash of pain the high alarmed whinny from the colt then nothing while the figure dashed from the box breath harsh and panicked the colt danced lethal hooves arching over kelseys unconscious form halfway between the house and the barn gabe balanced two mugs of tea it appeared to him that they were going to be up most of the night but the herbal brew kelsey preferred was a better idea than coffee at this hour particularly if he could coax her back into bed and channel her nervous energy into a more intimate arena they hadnt been wasting much time on sleep in any case he thought not since the night hed joined her in her tub it had been tricky to convince her to move in with him for a few days hed shamelessly used the race as a reason for it his need for some moral support it worked he reminded himself grinning as he sipped from his mug he intended for it to continue working stage by stage until it was a permanent condition but hed calculated that a woman still raw from a divorce needed to be eased into the idea of a second marriage the biggest surprise was that he hadnt needed to be eased into the idea at all it had simply appeared fullblown in his mind or maybe in his heart hed never given a great deal of thought to the traditional boundaries of marriage wife family with an upbringing like his the idea of it was absurd even destructive but not with kelsey with her he wanted the promise the future the chance together they would share all of this he skimmed his gaze over the outbuildings the hills the fences together they would make more and maybe while they were doing it they could help each other bury the past the shrill frenzied cry of the colt split the quiet both mugs shattered on the gravel as gabe lunged forward with kelseys name bursting from his lips he dragged at the barn door slapped the lights iceedged panic chased him between the boxes sliced nastily into his spine she was sprawled on the straw facedown the colt backed into the rear of the box eyes rolling as he pawed his bedding the world upended draining the blood from gabes head out through the soles of his feet he moved like lightning shielding her with his own body as he gathered her up he took a blow to the shoulder unfelt as he lifted her her face was corpse white her body limp as rags ignoring the flailings of the colt he laid her on the cot his fingers trembled as he pressed them to the pulse at her throat please baby please it was there that quick flutter of life he kept his fingers pressed to it as if by removing them that life beat would drain away and buried his face in her hair there was only panic and relief panic and relief a bright and giddy pendulum swinging inside him he stayed as he was his fingers at her throat his face in her hair one arm cradling her gabe jesus christ gabe the frightened voice of his trainer snapped him back he lifted his head and watched the somehow dreamlike movements of jamison stepping into the box to calm the colt easy boy easy now jamison dragged the colts head down using his voice and his hands to soothe settle down but his eyes were anything but calm when they focused on gabe what happened here wheres kip hes supposed to be bunking outside the box i dont know where the hell he is but youre going to find him find him and the fucking night watchman forcing himself to move slowly gabe ran his hands over kelsey checking for broken bones he located the knot at the back of her head his fingers lingered there gentle as a kiss while his eyes sliced back to jamison and burned call a doctor and the cops now shes hurt jamison continued to stroke the quivering colt how bad i dont know call goddammit as if in answer kelsey stirred under his hand and moaned kelsey he had to yank himself back from snatching her up kelsey take it slow gabe her eyes fluttered open but her vision swam touching off nausea god she closed them again struggling to breathe evenly dont try to move yet im not believe me she concentrated on moving air in and out of her lungs when it seemed she had that down she cautiously opened her eyes again this time she brought his face into focus there was murder in his eyes she thought dimly then remembered the colt someone was in with the colt its all right hes all right gabe cursed viciously when she winced in pain im going to take you up to the house now im going to take care of you somebody was in there the groom was gone the door was open but i couldnt see who it was did they hurt him no gabe glanced at jamison who was sliding the box door closed make the calls jamie i want lieutenant rossi i want gunner too see that he gets out here and checks the colt over he looks fine jamison began but was already nodding his eyes were bloodshot and strained ill get him here gabe take her on up do what you can for her ill sit up myself with the colt tonight i want two men on him gabe lifted kelsey as carefully as a man handling spun glass no less than two at any time is that understood it is and find kip i want to talk to him all right with a heavy heart jamison watched gabe carry kelsey outside he turned to the colt rubbed his weary eyes then went to make the calls im all right really but kelsey kept her eyes closed on the trip from barn to house just a headache be quiet gabe told her fighting to keep his voice light just rest his jaw tightened as his boots crunched over bits of the shattered mugs if he hadnt stopped to make the goddamned tea if hed been with her are you sure doubles all right i didnt have a chance to see will you stop worrying about the fucking horse it exploded out of him and unlocked the gates do you think i give a damn about that horse right now id have killed him myself if hed have hurt you gabe shut up goddammit his face a mask of rage he shoved the door open she cringed chiefly because his shouting caused her head to swim theres no need to yell youre entitled to be upset but upset he laid her down on the couch in the living room the way his muscles were beginning to tremble he wasnt certain he could carry her up the stairs is that what you think i am upset a little out of sorts maybe because someone knocked you senseless yeah thats right im upset he fisted his hand and worked off a fraction of the emotions boiling inside him by ramming it into the wall the words shed been about to speak slid soundlessly down kelseys throat she stared from the dent in the wall to his battered knuckles i guess im upset because i found you unconscious in a stall with a panicked horse who might have trampled you to death at any minute she hadnt thought of that and the image it presented made her stomach lurch she began to tremble gabe dont i was a little upset because i thought for a minute the longest minute of my life that you were already dead the tears began to spill over one then two then a stream i guess upset was the wrong word christ abruptly hollowed out he rubbed his hands over his face but it didnt help he went to her then gathering her close holding her when she curled into a ball on his lap christ kelsey i lost my mind he kissed her gently now drying her cheeks with his lips im sorry let me get you some ice no dont go just dont go okay let me see if youre hurt anywhere else its just my head he must have been behind me it was stupid to rush in that way but i wasnt thinking i saw the cot was empty then that the stall door was open all i could think of was what had nearly happened to him before what happened to pride next time think what would happen to me he tipped her face up i couldnt handle losing you she took his hand pressed his torn knuckles to her lips i guess we could both use some ice yeah but they stayed where they were until rossi knocked on the door an hour later gabe walked back from the barn again this time with rossi at his side youve got a hole in your security mr slater im aware of that a hole big enough he thought for someone to slip through when the night watchman made his hourly outside rounds somebody could have come in from the outside somebody who knows your setup here youve got a lot of land a lot of ways in and out rossi scanned through the dark he didnt envy gabe that he much preferred his tidy apartment the claustrophobia and comfort of the city i like taking the easy way he continued and looking at the inside gabe was looking at the inside as well at every hand hed inherited from cunningham at every man and woman who had been hired on or fired in the ensuing five years youve already got a list of everyone who works for me do whatever you have to do with it i intend to ive arranged to have two men with the colt at all times id be one of them myself but im not willing to leave kelsey any longer than necessary i cant blame you for that rossi paused it was a pretty night what was left of it he might as well enjoy the breeze shes toughing this out pretty well id say shes taking her knock on the head better than your grooms taking his could be her heads harder theyd found kip groaning back to consciousness in the empty box adjoining doubles we didnt have any trouble shipping him off to the hospital shell be fine curious rossi brushed a shard of china with the toe of his shoe i was carrying a couple of mugs when i heard the horse gabe explained guess i dropped them mmm like i said shell be fine youre favoring your right shoulder instinctively gabe straightened it its nothing the colt caught me if it hadnt been his shoulder it might have been kelsey her head her face the thought roiled in his stomach youve done a background check on me havent you rossi standard procedure then you know a little something about my father enough to know he wouldnt win any daddy of the year awards hes in town has been for several weeks gabe spoke without inflection he might have been discussing the weather id say i was one of his first stops i brushed him off with some money not nearly as much as he wanted that tends to make him surly he knows his way around the track around the shedrow you think your father would try to hit at you this way he hates my guts gabe said simply hed hit at me any way he could especially if he could make a profit at it i thought i saw him at churchill downs during derby week so did one of the grooms at three willows i tracked him down at laurel a couple of days ago he denied it gabe reached for a cigar he didnt have hes lying understanding the gesture rossi took out a pack of cigarettes offered one ill check it out you do that lieutenant gabes eyes glowed steady in the flare of the match and keep this in mind while you do the odds are he knew lipsky rich slaters a man who likes to cheat winning the games more fun for him that way and hes been winning hes flashing money around ill see if i can find out where he came by it there was another race when i was a kid a horse from this farm was running against a horse from three willows gabe drew smoke into his lungs watched it drift away on the breeze when he exhaled the three willows colt stumbled shattered his legs they had to put him down my father flashed some money after that race too that would have been in lexington spring of gabe eyed rossi through a cloud of smoke thats right thats exactly right funny you didnt mention this before he didnt hurt kelsey before excuse me matt gunner strode up to them his hair was still in sleep tufts the colts fine gabe good i appreciate your coming out thats no problem matt glanced toward the house kelsey shes resting the doctor advised a trip to the hospital but she wont budge id like to look in on her when shes up to it sure he said his good nights then turned back to rossi youd better find him before i do you dont have any proof your father was involved in any of this gabe tossed down the cigarette crushed it out i dont need to prove anything kelsey heard him coming up the steps and gingerly shifted to a sitting position the pills the doctor had given her had smoothed the edges but she wasnt taking any chances double she said the minute gabe came into the room matt gave him a thumbsup and he had personally discarded the colts night feed bag and replaced it she sighed relaxed thank god ive been sitting here thinking of all the possibilities youre supposed to be resting he sat on the bed careful not to shake the mattress youve got shadows under your eyes again gently he traced them with his thumb why do i always find that so sexy machismo looking for vulnerability she smiled come to bed maybe we can both get a couple of hours sleep before we have to leave i want you to stay here kelsey not here he corrected at three willows youre not up to the trip and it would be safer and smarter for you to stay with gertie rossi can arrange for a couple of men gabe she framed his face touched her lips to his then spoke softly no way in hell listen to me i could she agreed i could listen to you and you could listen to me and we could bat this ball back and forth until morning id still go so why dont we just pretend weve argued and discussed youre being selfish he pushed himself off the bed and began to undress you dont want to miss the race so it doesnt matter that i wont be able to concentrate or enjoy it myself slowly she ran her tongue over her teeth that was a good one and guilt usually works with me but not this time youll worry whether im there or not and im going to be there for you gabe all the way goddamned mule that wont work either though name calling is an acceptable stage in a good fight i could counter that by calling you an overprotective ass but ill refrain because im a lady so her breath caught on a hiss oh god what did you do to your back he twisted his head but could get only a marginal glimpse at the dark spreading bruise on his shoulder took a kick when it wasnt there before she trailed off realizing just when and just how hed come by it now i will call you an ass what kind of numbheaded heroics is this the doctor was just here he could have treated it it wasnt heroics numbheaded or otherwise i was distracted cautiously he rotated his shoulder the sting wasnt so bad but the throb went deep and had teeth just needs some liniment jerk he started to snap back then sighed defeated i love you too slipping into bed he cradled her against him what are you doing getting some sleep im supposed to check on you every couple of hours we dont have much more than that anyway the liniment later i just want to hold you content with that she brushed his hair from his brow gabe im going with you i know go to sleep chapter twentythree no one would let her work for her first two days in new york kelsey was all but barred from the track outnumbered and outflanked by everyone from gabe down to the scruffiest stableboy it seemed the trip itself was to be her only victory with too much time on her hands and too much of it spent alone she decided she had two options she could go quietly mad or she could treat the enforced inactivity as a short vacation the vacation seemed healthier she made use of the hotel facilities swimming each morning to keep the muscles shed developed over the past few months in shape she shopped began a lovehate relationship with the nautilus equipment in the health club and generally fought off boredom it helped that gabe had decided to give a prerace party using the hotel ballroom on the evening before the belmont it gave kelsey the opportunity to plot out the details talk strategy with the florist and the hotel caterer gabe after one look at the yards of lists took the cowards route and left the entire matter in her hands nothing could have pleased her more she spent hours with the hotel manager the concierge the chef debating and dissecting what could and couldnt be done as gabe had put no ceiling on the budget she had already decided there was nothing that couldnt be done and set about convincing the staff id have been smarter handing you a pitchfork and letting you clean out stalls all week gabe grabbed a quick cup of coffee and watched kelsey pore over the final menu for the evening youd have gotten more rest stop fussing youre the one who started this i thought a party would be a good idea he moved over to stand behind her rubbing her shoulders as she muttered over her papers a little food some music an open bar i didnt realize id be backing a david o selznick production he narrowed his eyes how much champagne is that go away but she rolled her shoulders under his hands youre not going to drink it anyway you gave me carte blanche slater and im using it just be in your tuxedo by eight more like captain bligh than selznick he muttered now you sound like the caterer go meet your reporters im sick of reporters youre just jealous because they put double on the cover of sports illustrated instead of you i got the spread in people he reminded her and entertained himself by nibbling on her ear this is a great spot right here he murmured nipping his way up her left lobe i could be temperamental and miss the interview the quick delicious shivers distracted her gabe took advantage and had the first two buttons of her blouse undone before she shook herself free stop that i have an appointment in fifteen minutes ill work fast i mean it breathless she squirmed away scrambled out of the chair im getting my hair done he grinned just now it was tumbling out of the bright clothcovered elastic hed done that i like your hair exactly the way it is keep your distance slater the rest of my day is booked minute by minute and i didnt schedule any time for you to chase me around the desk adjust this may be just a party for you as ridiculous as it was she scooted so that the desk was between them but putting it together has kept me sane all week i have an emotional investment so do i he put his palms down on the desk leaned forward come here absolutely not ive got something for you oh please shed have rolled her eyes if shed dared take them off him thats very lame he straightened cocked a brow a present he took a small velvet box out of his pocket now arent you ashamed a present despite the instant flare of pleasure she eyed it warily is this a trick open it i was going to give it to you after the race but i thought it would be better luck for you to have it before it lured her she came around the desk to take it from him then lifted her mouth to his for a kiss thank you you havent opened it yet for the thought first her breath sighed out when she snapped the top open the horse glowed against the black velvet caught forever in midgallop airborne and magnificent the pin was fashioned of ruby jade carved so intricately so delicately that she almost expected to feel the bunch and flow of muscles as she ran a fingertip over it the diamond eye glistened with triumph its beautiful its perfect she looked up at him so are you that was my line he slipped his arms around her waist bringing her closer youre welcome he said as his mouth closed over hers of course she was late kelsey dashed into the beauty salon babbling apologies she was checking her watch anxiously by the time the manicurist was trying to do something elegant with her neglected nails honey why dont we go for some tips no ill just break them off her hair was bundled in huge foam rollers her face coated with a pale green cream shed somehow allowed herself to be talked into and time was ticking away just shape up whats there and slap on some clear polish dont you want something a little snazzier kelsey stole a peek at the manicurists lethally long carmineslicked nails no ill stick with subtlety with a shake of her head the woman dunked kelseys right hand in warm water whatever you say honey its kelsey isnt it a woman at the next station smiled at her im janet gardner overlook farms kentucky oh yes mrs gardner kelsey decided not to say she hadnt recognized the woman not with the flamecolored hair coated with glistening blue cream and her face plastered with shocking pink its nice to see you again a facelift without the scalpel they tell me janet laughed as she tapped a finger to the drying pink mask well see about that yours oh something about relaxing apparently i looked harried who doesnt by the belmont my hank and i are going to sleep for two weeks when we get back home we promised ourselves kelsey remembered hank now the stringy man shed danced with the night before hed had sunscored cheeks a pencilthin mustache and a voice as rich as molasses hed wanted to teach her to tango give your husband my best hes a terrific dancer oh thats my hank janet chuckled and preened all the ladies want a turn around the floor with him he likes to tell people i married him for his feet obliging the manicurist janet slipped off an emerald ring that could have doubled for a paperweight i saw your mother today at the track its hard to believe weve been making the rounds together for well that would be telling youve known naomi a long time since i married into this horse race of course she was born into it much more interested in gossiping than in the fashion magazine shed been thumbing through with her free hand janet set it aside her eyes brightened with curiosity you were too belatedly oh i think its more that you came back to it belatedly i remember seeing you at the track when you were in diapers really oh goodness yes naomi was prouder of you than of any wall full of blue ribbons we used to call you naomis thoroughbred but you wouldnt remember that naomis thoroughbred the idea both pleased and saddened her no i dont i met your father once or twice poor dear he always looked so lost he was a librarian my father is the head of the english department at georgetown university oh yes janet bubbled on oblivious of the stiffness in kelseys voice obligingly she dunked her fingers in the soaking bowl for her own manicure i knew it had something to do with books naomi doted on him we all thought it was a shame things didnt work out but then it happens all the time doesnt it according to the statistics hank and i are the lucky ones twentyeight years this september congratulations since there was no escape kelsey tried a shift in topic you have children three two boys and a girl our deedees married now and has two little girls of her own if shed had a hand free janet would have gone straight for the pictures in her wallet my boys tell me theyre still looking of course my youngest is barely twenty hes studying structural engineering not that i know anything about that she went on about her children at some length until kelsey relaxed into the rhythm but theres something special between a mother and daughter janet said cagily veering back dont you think i mean even after all these years of separation you and naomi look so sweet together to tell you the truth its been so long a lot of people forget she even had a daughter if they knew in the first place janet held up one hand examined the first coat of mauve polish yes dear thats very nice when she shifted her attention back to kelsey her voice took on a confidential air i hope you wont be offended if i tell you that most of us who knew naomi and the situation were rooting for her i mean the idea of taking a child from its mother just seems unnatural well aware that both manicurists had their ears pricked kelsey kept her voice cool im sure naomi appreciated it not that it did any good im sorry to say she was her own worst enemy during that trying time ive always thought it was anger at your father that made her behave so recklessly and the social scene was a bit wilder back then still alec bradley she clucked her tongue naomi should have known better than to flirt in that direction oh as if shed just remembered the outcome of that flirtation janet blinked and squirmed oh dear im sorry that would be a sore point the idea of a shooting death and a decade in prison being termed a sore point might have amused kelsey under different circumstances but she backtracked to the one statement that had caught her attention did you know alec bradley oh yes most of us back then at least knew of him he was dropdead gorgeous as my deedee would say tall dark and handsome with a smile that could melt a womans heart he knew it too believe me he knew it and he used it he even fluttered around me a bit but hank put a stop to that she giggled girlishly i admit i was a little flattered even knowing his reputation what reputation was that well dear eagerly she scooted forward in her chair his family would barely acknowledge him they may have had some financial reversals but the blood was still blue and there was that scandal with his first wife she hunkered still closer assuming the gossip position he had a taste for older women you know wealthy older women everyone knew his first wife settled on him generously in the divorce to save face not that it helped really because everyone knew hed been well servicing the fillies shall we say so he was a womanizer oh a champion and the buzz was he charged for the service he women paid him for sex another giggle slightly embarrassed janet preferred cagey euphemisms i dont know if it was quite that blunt but it was common knowledge that he could be bought as an escort there are a lot of single women even in racing unmarried divorced between husbands alec could be hired to fill the gap a handsome arm to hold for a party at the track he was as i said quite charming and he tended to bet heavily and badly when she smiled pink flakes cracked from her face and drifted onto her blackandgold bib like colorful dandruff now no one thought it was a business deal between him and your mother dear a woman like naomi could have had any man she wanted still could alec seemed quite besotted with her though he did continue to indulge in the side flirtations naomi wasnt one to put up with that sort of nonsense they argued heatedly about that and she gave him the boot this time janets flustering was quite genuine that is i mean you were there that night not interested in evasions or a sudden attack of conscience kelsey pressed the night he died yes i was janet moistened her lips surprised and a bit unnerved by kelseys direct question hank and i were in virginia on business a number of racing people were at the country club for a party there now looks like im done she held up her hands and speaking of parties im so looking forward to tonight that handsome young man of yours has us all on the edge of our seats they argued kelsey ignored the squawk of protest from her manicurist when she shot out a hand and gripped janets arm that night they argued yes dear sorry now that shed let her yen for gossip sink her over her head janet spoke kindly several of us were questioned about it after the difficulties they argued quite audibly and naomi told him in blunt terms that their relationship was finished theyd both been drinking perhaps a little more than was wise words flew naomi dashed a glass of champagne in his face and walked out it was the last i saw of her for a very long time in the bright clown mask janets eyes softened i was fond of naomi i still am the man wasnt worth it dear he simply wasnt worth one minute of her time i think the real crime is she didnt realize it until it was too late for the rest of the afternoon kelsey struggled to put the conversation in the back of her mind she wanted to take it out again to examine each and every word separately it made a difference didnt it somehow it made a difference that alec bradley had been for hire but however it altered the puzzle she so badly wanted to piece together there was too much interference to concentrate whatever her mood she had no intention of spoiling gabes moment or her mothers contentment she dressed early and left gabe a note in the center of the bed for him to meet her in the ballroom at precisely eight final details required her attention whether the caterer the florist and the hotel staff agreed or not it was to be perfect and as she stood in the center of the huge chandelierlit room it was the redandwhite colors of longshot predominated in tablecloths candles flowers to honor the three jewels in the triple crown banks of red roses sunny blackeyed susans and white carnations spilled from tables tumbled from baskets blacksuited waiters were lined up for inspection while the catering staff put the finishing touches on three enormous buffet tables but her inspiration her pièce de résistance and her biggest headache had been the gambling oversize play money was available for purchase and all for charity but the details had kept her racing for days with the bureaucracy naomis thoroughbred had nipped all opposition at the wire now she could stand and study the roulette wheels the dice and blackjack tables and know she was presenting gabe with the party of the season and one she thought that would suit him like a second skin while the orchestra tuned up she walked over and gave the wheel a reckless spin ill take red with a laugh she turned around and smiled at gabe youre on time youre beautiful he didnt cross to her not yet he just wanted to look she wore glimmering white a column that shimmered from the curve of her breasts to her ankles his gift was pinned at her heart her hair was a tumble of curls scooped back with glittering clips falling over bare shoulders diamond and ruby drops dripped from her ears really incredibly beautiful your colors she held out her hands to his what do you think i think you astonish me still holding her at arms length he scanned the room what have you done here besides driving every merchant and city official within fifty miles insane ive given you a casino for the night slaters and the proceeds theres a shelter for abused women and children in dc his eyes darkened then lowered to their joined hands you humble me kelsey i love you gabe moved he lifted her hands to his lips what spin of the wheel brought you to me the luckiest one of your life she glanced down smiled at the silver ball nestled in its slot red she murmured you win again you know gabe this isnt just for you no no she inched closer slipping her arms around his neck i want to watch you work here tonight i have a feeling im going to find it very arousing and she did hours later when the room was crowded with people the buffet tables decimated the dance floor spinning with couples she stood at gabes shoulder and studied his technique shed thought shed understood blackjack a simple card game of luck and logic where you tried to get as close as possible to twentyone if you went over you lost but she couldnt for the life of her understand why gabe held and won on a measly fifteen one hand and hit and won on sixteen the next its just numbers he told her nothing but numbers darling thats exactly what shed thought until shed seen him play theres no way you can possibly remember all the numbers the combinations he only smiled tapped his cards and added a four to his seventeen for twentyone here he pushed a stack of red and white chips at her you play for a while all right i will she took the seat he vacated then glanced up when naomi sat down beside her ive just lost a bundle at craps im giving this game ten minutes before i nag moses into dancing with me she tucked a sweep of golden hair behind her ear then crossed her legs after pushing out some chips she scanned the room quite a party your daughters amazing i know naomis brow furrowed as she studied her cards hit me she instructed then huffed out a breath busted its all for a good cause losing should warm your heart nibbling her lip kelsey contemplated her eight and five okay ill take one an eight another eight i won she was chuckling as she raked in her chips until she caught naomis narrowed eye well winning warms the heart too dance with my mother gabe and ill see how much of your money i can lose how could i turn down an offer like that he held out a hand curling his fingers around naomis you look wonderful tonight he said when they matched steps on the dance floor how would you know you havent looked at anyone but kelsey he said nothing for a moment i dont seem to have a smooth answer to that tilting her head back she studied him carefully id be disappointed if you did i like watching what she feels for you rush into her face and i like knowing what you feel for her causes you to miss a step in an odd way youve both been so structured you trip each other up but youre worried not about whats between the two of you about everything else she glanced back to where kelsey sat laughing at the blackjack table shoving more chips forward i know she tried to brush off what happened the other night but it terrifies me his eyes went cool deceptively so it should never have happened i should have been with her no it should never have happened naomi agreed but she was still looking at her daughter not at gabe i think she should stay at three willows or better yet go back to her father until this is settled hed thought the same but hearing it didnt make it easier even if she agreed to that we dont know how long it will take to settle any of it any of it he cursed himself another misstep as far as naomi knew there was only the current trouble over the horses who broke through my security and what they intended to do on the other hand it might be over tomorrow after the race is run im going to count on that i couldnt stand for anything to happen to her gabe i hate the idea that shes been touched by any of the ugliness just the kind of sordid business milicent always claimed was part and parcel of racing she shook her head back her eyes flashing but its not its not what its about not what were about but when it happens its all people remember are you worried about milicent bydens opinion hell no the old defiance came back but i wont let her be right and ill be damned if i let her smirk over another blot on my honor so i want this over for kelsey for you and for myself the room was cool and dark when kelsey woke she shifted lazily while images from the night before flowed through her mind color and light voices music the dizzying spin of the wheel the lightning toss of dice shed lost half of gabes winnings at cards hed doubled them back at craps most of all she remembered how hed looked dark and dangerous in evening clothes those mouthwatering and unreadable blue eyes following the spin of the wheel the fall of the cards then the way they would suddenly lock on hers and stop her breath and when theyd been alone when the evening and the noise and the crowds had been behind them hed lowered her to the bed those clever hands had played her then teasing out moans tempting out darker and darker needs he had done things to her done things for her shed never imagined allowing much less demanding now waking her body felt soft and tender bruised and cherished eyes closed she skimmed her hand over the sheet wanting him groggy she pushed herself up in bed and found herself alone he wasnt getting away that easily she told herself still half dreaming she crawled out of bed she stumbled out into the parlor of the suite belting her robe she grimaced as the light through the open drapes blinded her shielding her eyes she braced a hand on the doorjamb god what time is it just past ten naomi poured a cup of coffee from the pot on the room service tray your timings good kelsey breakfast just arrived breakfast ten she squinted through her splayed fingers gabe oh at the track since dawn but fully awake now she dropped her hand that jerk he promised he wouldnt go without me this morning of all mornings mmm naomi poured a second cup for her daughter according to him you were an illdisposed lump who told him to go away when he suggested it was time to get up i did not she took a sip of coffee did i hes probably making it up he probably wanted you to get a little rest hes my lover not my keeper then she flushed however unusual the relationship naomi was still her mother she cleared her throat and sat down what are you doing here i thought youd be at the track its not a big race for us a mile and a half she shrugged and spread blackberry jam on a triangle of toast wed just like to see high water hold his own i guess we could get lucky since the arkansas colt is scratched scratched when what happened oh he pulled up lame in yesterdays workout a sprained foreleg i guess i forgot to tell you pouting kelsey bit into a slice of bacon i feel like im outside the party with my face pressed against the window while everyone else eats the cake im sorry honey youll just have to tolerate all of us being worried about you when i think of what could have happened she sighed spread more jam all right all right we wont get into it i know that buttout look on your face ive seen it in the mirror often enough it didnt mean butt out kelsey said with a smile it meant dont worry it goes with the territory even for a comefrombehind mother so eat your breakfast i have instructions to see that you do gabe again i imagine you know he loves you yes i do do you know hes besotted this time the smile crept onto kelseys face do you think so naomi only laughed never mind you already know it its thrilling isnt it and terrifying to have a man tangled up over you that way yes and twice as thrilling and terrifying when youre just as tangled up over him i know it might seem soon to be this involved with someone after the divorce but kelsey not only am i not in a position to criticize but im going to point out that you and your exhusband were separated for two years still kelsey shook her head im secondguessing myself because it doesnt seem right it only feels right she toyed with her breakfast hoping she wasnt choosing the wrong moment when you separated from dad did you still love him im sorry she lifted her eyes someone said something to me yesterday that made me wonder if youd rather not answer i understand i told you once that whatever you asked id try to answer but this one was hard it wrenched at an old wound in the heart an almost forgotten one yes i still loved him i loved him for a long long time after it was foolish to do so and because i did i was angry with him with myself and determined to prove it didnt matter is that why you threw myself into parties naomi continued enjoyed fanning gossip about myself and other men courted small scandals yes at least partly i wasnt about to admit id failed i wanted philip to suffer to have sleepless nights thinking about me reveling in my freedom and because i undoubtedly succeeded in that i drove him further and further away until what i wanted most was impossible for me to have you wanted him back desperately i was vain enough to think i could have him on my terms and my terms only and alec bradley she saw naomi flinch and forced herself to finish was he someone you used to make dad suffer naomi switched from coffee to water he was a kind of final gauntlet flung a man with as sterling and blooded a pedigree as philips but with a faintly unsavory reputation kelseys stomach knotted she had to know and to know she had to ask did you hire him the discomfort in naomis eyes vanished hire him she repeated blank ive heard that he put certain skills on the market she gulped at her coffee so to speak the last reaction kelsey had expected was laughter but it came now rich and delighted across the table christ what a thought what a thought the very last thing i wanted from alec was stud service her amusement fled the very last thing im sorry that was a stupid question i didnt mean it precisely as it sounded i was thinking more of public displays than private ones no i didnt hire him though i did lend him money a time or two he was always in between deals you see she said dryly always in the midst of a little cashflow problem it might be vanity again coming back to color memory but as i recall he pursued me not that i evaded she added and chose a single raspberry from a bowl i wanted the attention i needed it and he was very charming even when you knew differently he could make you believe you were the only woman in the room i was certainly aware of his reputation of the fact that he could be bought that added to the appeal i suppose the fact that he was with me charming me hoping to conquer me because he couldnt help himself did wonders for my ego and a great deal of it she remembered had been simple ego in the end he refused to accept or wasnt able to accept that i didnt choose to be conquered and thats what killed him but rape isnt about sex no shed once thought it was or had wanted to believe it was because sex was easier he wanted to hurt me to humiliate me ive never really understood why he seemed so desperate that night there wasnt passion in his eyes there wasnt lust i think i could have fought them have outmaneuvered them it was the desperation in his eyes that made me reach for the gun naomi shuddered once then cleared out her clogged lungs with a long quiet breath id forgotten that im sorry i made you remember though she promised herself she would think everything through later kelsey covered naomis hand with hers let it go well both let it go this is a day to look forward not back why dont you come check out the outfit i bought for the race if i dont get into it soon well miss the first post chapter twentyfour reno wore a slategray suit and maroon tie his soft italian boots shone like mirrors the pencilslim woman on his arm was a head taller than he and kept her artfully painted face tilted toward the cameras he knew it was a pathetic cliché the short man proving his masculinity by latching on to tall stunning women he didnt give a damn right now he needed something to prove his manhood his worth his cojones the sling on his arm precisely matched the silk of his tie they were he knew the only silks hed be wearing that day he smiled and preened for the cameras as eager for the attention as the woman posed with him beneath the bravado the quick sassy answers about his next ride his next season he was a whirlwind of nerves and misery he watched the jockeys stride to the paddock knew what each and every one of them was feeling thinking the concentration the little mental games to keep the adrenaline up only one would win but others could prove their mettle with the ride some would come back another race another year others would fade gain weight lose interest take a fall they might choose to headline in the sticks preferring secondrate wins to firstrate losses the great ones would stay on one circuit getting rich drawing their own following avoiding or overcoming the broken bones and bad spills the middling ones would move from track to track following trainers harassing agents disappearing perhaps to resurface as a groom or valet or as an assistant trainer on some tiny farm in the boondocks but none of that showed now now they were warriors soldiers showmen eyes tensed and narrowed behind the plastic goggles bodies lean and tight and limber under the silks their feet encased in supple dainty boots the helmets were in place beneath the cloth eton caps the postposition number a cardboard garter on the arm some of them would have risen at dawn to work their partners themselves others would have slept late their relationship with their horse purely business and unemotional fear of the scale would have kept most of them away from food seduced them into another hour sweating in steam now they were weighed and ready reno watched them with grinding envy and despair he should be the one listening with the air of narrowed focus to the trainers final instructions it should be him garnering the praise admiration and hopes of the owners it should have been him flying down the track with the whip between his teeth his worst fear was that it would never be him again he forced himself forward that quick cocky smile fastened to his face miss naomi reno automatically naomi reached out clasping his good arm you look great id rather be wearing your colors you will soon she glanced toward the woman hed left entertaining some reporters pretty girl she looks familiar you might have caught her in a couple of commercials shampoo and toothpaste mostly shes trying to break into movies he shrugged his date off and looked at the colt hell run for you miss naomi yes i know he will just the man i wanted to see kelsey stepped forward i was hoping youd have some time in the next couple of weeks to look at my yearling again reno honor needs a rider who can coax the best out of her his stomach churned once hard sure sure ill do that i got nothing but time im going to go give joey a sendoff did i say the wrong thing kelsey murmured when he hurried off i dont know distracted naomi looked toward moses hes probably just strung out like everyone else im sure youre right im going to go wish gabe good luck meet you in the box make history for me joey gabe shook hands with his jockey joey flexed his fingers cracked his knuckles im going to do that mr slater you hold him back like i told you jamison added i dont want him to drive until the head of the stretch were not looking for a record here were looking for a win me and double here we could get you both he grinned and saluted when reno joined them get yourself a frontrow seat pal and have some of that fancy champagne you like waiting im going to do that reno kept his smile in place as he nodded to gabe good luck today mr slater youve got a horse in a million here his hand grew sweaty in his pocket id like a chance to go up on him myself one of these days well talk about that when youre back to a hundred percent a man gets spoiled riding the kind of horse ive been riding the past year or two his eyes locked on jamisons thats the way it is isnt it jamie we get spoiled you could say that reno jamison kept a hand around doubles bridle i won the belmont for you two years back remember everybody called it an upset an apprentice jockey and a longshot colt but the truth was it was my day my horse my race inside his pocket his damp fingers opened and closed opened and closed people forget though they forget all the races all the wins its the derby they remember its the derby that puts you on top his hand trembled when he took it out of his pocket when he laid it flatpalmed on the colts neck well you got yourself the derby and a lot more he forced a laugh win or lose they wont forget this belmont so you win it you win it big riders up at the call reno stepped back his face was white sheened with sweat turning quickly he strode away kelsey snatched at his arm as he passed her reno im sorry was all he said before shaking her off and rushing away from the paddock jockeys jamison launched joey into the saddle temperamental he looked ill kelsey murmured but there was no time to worry barely any time to think after the race she promised herself shed try to find him and see if she could help but now it was gabes moment she wasnt about to have it spoiled even though you went off without me this morning im going to wish you luck it would have taken a crowbar to get you out of bed at dawn and hed wanted the morning to himself to search for signs of his father but hed found none more relaxed gabe tilted his head to study her her hair was scooped up under a white straw hat its wide brim tipped flirtatiously over one eye her short snug red dress was topped by a waistlength white jacket his pin galloped over her breast now that i see what a few hours extra sleep did for you im glad i didnt have a crowbar handy a very clever way of sliding out of it slater i thought so he tucked her arm through his youre wearing my colors today theyre the only colors worth wearing she pressed a hand to her heart as they walked to his box why arent you nervous nerves wont change anything tell that to my stomach she muttered and dug in her bag for her binoculars im beginning to think i want this more than you do no you dont he kept a hand on hers as the horses were led to the gate the odds were locked in the betting windows closed overhead the sky was the clear dreamy blue of summer the oval the mile and a half of meticulously tended turf was fast today the crowd that massed in the grandstands was on its feet setting up a steady drone punctuated by shouts and cheers it was easy to forget how huge it all was for those who had seen the sport only on a television screen it would seem small intimate rather than the world that it was it had through ambition through luck and through a steady inner drive become gabes world now all the work the disappointments the triumphs and the hopes came down to this single race this single horse he watched double being loaded and remembered the night he had been born the way the laboring mare had wheezed the way the wind had blown keening against the walls of the foaling barn the snow and sleet hurling down the endless wait while the mare strained and labored then the first sight the terrifyingly fragile legs stabbing their way free in a gush of blood and the mares cry eerily human heralding that last pang of birth that small wet life had lain on the soiled straw taking the first breath that would lead double or nothing out of bold courage to the starting gate at belmont park long island and now three years later gabe remembered the thrill that had passed through him arrow bright when he had looked into the foals eyes i love that horse he didnt realize hed spoken aloud until kelseys fingers tightened on his i know you do the gate opened with a scream of metal almost at once there was a gasp from the crowd as double swerved to the right from his number six post position nearly unseating his rider whatever had spooked him the disastrous move had placed him behind a wall of horses with his jockey fighting for balance all of jamisons careful instructions on how to run the race became useless in the space of a heartbeat joeys only goal now was to get double or nothing back into the belmont there was a splitsecond decision whether to fight through the field or go around it rider and horse made it together swinging wide in a move depending on the outcome that would be seen as either valiant or foolish as if he knew what had to be done the colt bore down he charged down the field eating up the distance with wild speed when they passed the wire the first time he was a length behind the leader and gaining from his position in the box gabe kept his binoculars in place he was focused on only one horse the race itself was nearly forgotten shadowed under the bright flash of admiration there was more than beauty there there was courage win or lose he wouldnt forget it the half mile went in fortysix seconds flat with double and the leader pulling steadily away from the pack the crowd roared a frenzy of sound but gabe heard only kelseys voice beside him quietly murmuring encouragement it might have been only the two of them standing hand in hand watching a single horse at the far turn double made his challenge battling for advantage as they hit the top of the stretch it was here in its demanding heartbreaking homestretch that the belmont tested valor the kentuckybred colt was rallying from behind shooting toward the leaders like a spear but it was too late what had been born in the longshot colt that windy night in late winter what gabe had seen in his eyes during those first wonderful moments of life drove him faster than the whip laid across his back with heart with honor he thundered across the wire two lengths in the lead to take the belmont stakes and the triple crown for a moment gabe could only stare the emotions swirling inside him came too fast too hard to sift out only the thrill of victory that was his horse cantering easily now with its rider high in the irons that was his dream covered with sweat and dirt and glory whatever happened now no one could ever take away from him or the spectacular colt this dazzling moment thats a hell of a horse gabe murmured in a voice that felt rusty dazed he looked down at kelsey saw her cheeks wet with tears thats one hell of a horse yes even as the tears rolled a laugh bubbled up in her throat she lifted her arms circled gabes neck congratulations slater youve done it christ no amount of control could hold back the foolish grin that spread over his face jesus christ we did it he swung her up and around oblivious of the cameras she was still laughing when he covered her mouth with his in his room a few hundred miles away rich stared at the television screen he hadnt gone to new york with what hed expected to happen it was smarter safer for him to stay behind he nodded as the cameras cut from the victorious colt to its owner enjoy it while you can boy he muttered and toasted himself with twelveyearold scotch a smirk twisted his lips over the celebrational kiss the announcers breathless voice identifying gabriel slater and kelsey byden as very friendly rivals rich sat back and waited for the chaos the colt would be led to the spit bucket as he would be after any race and then rich thought and then gabe wouldnt be smiling so big even better this way he decided even better to snatch away the prize after it had been granted things had worked out perfectly thanks to naomis pretty little girl if she hadnt come out to the barn that night and interrupted what was planned for the colt hed never have raced but he had raced and hed won now moments from now the shocking announcement would be made that double or nothing had an illegal drug in his system not only would gabe lose but he would face scandal derision and shame preparing for his own victory rich topped off his drink liquor slopped spilled by a jerk of his hand as the official announcement was made nine five two his shocked brain didnt take in the nattering about purses and payoffs he gaped as the screen filled with the horse and rider each blanketed with white carnations he saw gabe his arm possessively around kelseys shoulders congratulating his rider then lean in as sentimental as a movie cowboy to kiss the sweaty colt his glass struck the screen and both shattered the air reeked of liquor as he lunged out of the chair for a minute he lost his mind kicking and beating the television until his knuckles ran red then he heaved it off the table his only motive was to destroy it to somehow destroy the machine that showed him such images when he finally stopped gasping and drained the air stank of smoke and scotch and his own violent sweat his knuckles were bleeding and his breath was coming in shuddering rasps he tripped over a broken chair and righted the bottle of scotch most had pooled on the rug but there was enough to clear the bile from his throat when he chugged from the bottle enough to clear his mind again heads will roll he promised himself and since he apparently could trust no one to carry out a simple task hed have to take care of things himself in the week that followed doubles triple crown win there was barely time to think the routine at three willows had to continue despite the celebrity of their neighbor the racing season didnt stop at belmont nor did the daily care and training of horses allow for sitting on laurels and kelsey had her own ambitions not the least of which was to mold her own champion shed been given her opportunity with honor and she was determined to make the most of it she had not forgotten her goal of piecing together the puzzle of the past charles rooney might have refused to take or return her calls but she had every intention of running him to ground he would talk to her again eventually she would visit captain tipton again as well and if necessary she would go to her father and ask him to relive those months of his life day by day until a clear picture emerged for the one that was taking shape now was of a woman who had loved her husband one who had certainly made mistakes mistakes of pride and vanity and stubbornness in trying to force his hand but no matter how coolly how calmly she tried kelsey had yet to find the piece that turned a willful even reckless young woman into a murderer hey sis channing kelsey turned sponge in hand to kiss him i havent had five minutes to tell you how glad i am youre here despite the ache in my back ive only been here a couple of hours his shirt was already streaked with sweat moses put me to work so fast it feels as if i never left i didnt think you were coming back with careful strokes kelsey sponged off her yearlings face were midway through june it took me a while to work it out candace is still against your being here we can safely say shes not too happy with me we had a hell of a battle im sorry no it was good a lot came out that had been festering in me anyway she wanted me to carry on the family tradition all my life thats been a given id be a brilliant surgeon like my father like his father and so forth she expected it i let her expect it it isnt what you want im going into veterinary medicine his eyes held steady as if he expected a protest or worse a quick indulgent laugh instead she stepped forward and kissed both cheeks good thats it i could give you the routine about how impossible and how frustrating it is to try to live up to other peoples expectations especially family in the past few months ive had firsthand experience with that but i figure you already know shell come around channing she loves you and under it all she only wants what you want maybe he shuffled straw under his foot i hated fighting with her i guess i hate knowing id have backed down if the prof hadnt stood up for me dad really it was like having the seventh cavalry charge in without the bugles and blazing guns he grinned he just talked in that slow patient way of his ive never seen him go against her that way i think it was the shock that he took my part instead of hers that turned the tide he loves you too nibbling her lip she went back to her work are they having problems channing things are a little strained between them but with me here theyll have the time and the privacy to work it out anyway she blames you more than the prof kelsey made a face i guess id better patch things up there moms not one to hold a grudge not for long anyway her sense of orders been shaken thats all its going to take her a while to get used to it excuse me reno stood at the opening of the box reno hi kelsey shifted her hands still busy brushing the yearling you remember channing my brother sure hows it going good hows the shoulder instinctively reno rotated it its coming along ill be ready to get up in a couple of weeks ive got some offers to ride the european circuit this season i heard moses mention it kelsey said were sending high water over in a few weeks i hope you take him up on it might thats honor isnt it naomis honor it sure is what do you think of her ill let you two talk horse channing cut in if moses catches me loitering hell dock my pay good seeing you reno yeah see you around he stepped into the box and crouched a thoroughbreds legs always came first he said nothing circled the horse ran his hands along the chest the flanks the withers before coming around to examine the eyes and teeth shes a pretty one reno said at last terrific form lots of heart room youve had her in the gate yeah she doesnt have any trouble there she spooks sometimes but since we started using a shadow roll shes settled the colt nudged her arm and obliging kelsey took a carrot out of her pocket shes gentle but theres fire in there moses thinks we should try her out in a couple of races next year are you interested shes a pretty one reno said again and felt twin tremors of hope and despair why do you want to put me up on her ive seen you ride for one and i like the fact that you dont just mount a horse for a race you come to workouts you come to the barn you treat it like a partnership she hesitated nuzzling the horse i know you loved pride reno it showed the way you felt about him and how you thought about him thats the kind of rider i want for honor he looked away fighting the urge to curl up in the straw and weep her words were like small sharp knives slicing at him i did love that horse he couldnt steady his voice and gave up trying hed have done anything for me he broke his heart for me reno you cant blame yourself for what happened i wouldnt have hurt him how were we supposed to know the race would kill him he stared blindly into kelseys face how were we supposed to know you couldnt she said gently sooner or later well find out who wanted to hurt him he let out a trembling breath sooner or later he took a step in retreat thats a fine horse will you ride her reno gave her a look of such crushing despair that she moved toward him but as she reached out he made one low animal sound in his throat and fled chapter twentyfive i tell you gabe it broke my heart kelsey cupped her wineglass in both hands and tucked her legs up under her on his long comfortable sofa it was a lovely evening the doors and windows wide open to welcome the flowerdrenched breeze but she could still see renos face the utter hopelessness of it washed in the striped sunlight of honors box he needs to get up again gabe was stretched out on the same sofa puffing smoke at the ceiling his feet in kelseys lap it wasnt that he didnt sympathize with renos plight but he was quite simply exhausted who could have known that the rapidfire round of publicity meetings phone calls and requests would be more tiring than a weeks ditch digging at the moment hed have preferred a shovel and a sweaty back to the mindnumbing figures and futures tallied by lawyers accountants and brokers just that afternoon hed had to turn down an offer for the rights to his life story and doubles for a tv movieoftheweek i dont know kelsey continued while gabes thoughts wandered i thought that too that he just needed to get up for another race until she rested her head against a cushion gabe had put on mozart for her she knew he preferred basic rock or the wail of blues to the classic melding of piano and orchestra it wasnt just an altruistic gesture you know my asking him to ride honor i want the best but i did think it would help him instead i made things worse you cant know that you didnt see his face when i think it through i know what losing pride did to me how much it hurt and even though i loved that colt i couldnt have been nearly as attached as reno was hes blaming himself gabe because he was on the colt when they went down she toyed with her wine im thinking of asking naomi if she could persuade him to find some therapy do you think she glanced toward gabe his eyes were closed am i keeping you up sorry he opened one eye i was drifting no im sorry she shifted began to rub his feet youre worn out i saw that when i walked in the door i should be asking you how your meetings went today instead of trying out my psych theories on you if you keep rubbing my feet you can try out anything you want on me she chuckled then set her glass aside so she could do a better job of it so how did the meetings go should we be celebrating a new record for syndication no it was fascinating he thought and rewarding to discover just how many erogenous zones there were on the sole of a foot im not syndicating double youre not her hands paused but gabe the last set of figures you mentioned were astronomical i dont want to share him his eyes opened again fastened on hers i listened to all the advice the offers the numbers and i decided to do what i want when somethings mine its mine thats a very impractical emotional decision whats your point she shook her head well there goes my plan to scoop up some shares of a triple crown winner that depends he used all of his willpower to keep his muscles relaxed to keep his voice light you can have half of him half her brows rose as she pressed her fingers to gabes instep i think thats a bit more than i can afford a lot of people will tell you youre right you cant afford the terms that had her lips moving into a pout i think im a better judge of what i can or cant afford okay what are the terms theres just one his eyes flashed to hers all you have to do is marry me reno went to the barn first the barn that had once been cunninghams no one stopped him the guards the grooms all knew reno he had a meeting with jamison he told them and they accepted it they accepted him he had a need to see horses again to smell them to touch them he did give some thought to going to jamison to pouring out body and soul but what difference would it make nothing could be changed nothing could be fixed hed spent a great deal of time during the last weeks blasting out scattershots of blame but in the end he understood that they all ricocheted back to him hed been the one who had taken the syringe hed been the one to plunge that poison into a beautiful courageous athlete it didnt matter how the instrument had come into his hands he understood that now he accepted that now hed murdered something hed loved and in doing so hed destroyed himself like father like son reno leaned against a patient mare and wept it came through the blood he thought it came through the breeding the excuses hed used were smoke and mirrors had he really believed hed been trying to avenge the father hed never known that was the weapon used against him as surely as hed used the needle on the horse weak he was weak as his father had been weak and damned as his father had been damned so there was only one thing left to do he would end it as his father had ended it complete the cycle begun by a man hed known only through photographs and grainy news clips the man whose ghost he had honored above even his own dignity as if in a dream reno left the barn and the soothing scent of horses he walked to the tack room the tack room that had once been cunninghams it was a full ten seconds before kelsey could find her voice it was she supposed a typicalenough proposal from a man like gabe challenging coolblooded and risky very deliberately she shifted his foot out of her lap and picked up her wine if i marry you i get a half share of double thats right hed been expecting at least hoping for a different kind of reaction a half share of longshot and all that goes with it she sipped studying him and a half share of you slater that irritated him the amused patience in her voice in her eyes he swung his legs off the couch and stood im not wade kelsey we go into this we take each other whole this wont be a tidy makethebestofabadhand deal with an option to fold i see once i ante up im stuck thats it exactly since im naming the stakes ill show you the cards im playing with i want you thats my high card its going to take a lot for you to beat that maybe you figure the odds are tilted you got stung once before and you dont want it to happen again but this is a different game with different players and from where im standing the stakes are a lot higher she kept her eyes on her wine and hed said she couldnt bluff she thought with some pride still she knew better than to let him get a good look at her face until she was ready to call you think id back off from marriage shy away from a full commitment because i lost once before thats incredibly insulting nearly as insulting as this halfassed proposal youre stumbling through you want flowers and candlelight a ring in my pocket hed meant to give them to her the fact that hed rushed his fences only infuriated him more im not giving you anything he gave you her eyes lifted then with just enough temper in them to mask her heart oh now whos hobbled by the past slater she slapped her glass on the table and rose why dont you just drag me off to to vegas that would be a perfect milieu wouldnt it we can say our i dos over a crap table he nodded stiffly fine if thats what you want what i want is a simple straightforward question to which i can give a simple straightforward answer so you can either ask me or you can go to hell narroweyed he studied her but for once he couldnt read her face how could he he realized when for the first time in his life someone else held all the cards will you marry me yes she said absolutely gauging her he let out some of the breath he hadnt been aware hed been holding thats it thats it she agreed so who gets to rake in the chips his lips curved slowly this seems like a good time to start splitting the pot he stepped toward her combing his hands through her hair taking a firm hold i love you kelsey you must or youd never have flubbed that so badly flubbed hell he kissed her hard ive got you dont i yeah with a laugh she threw her arms around him yeah you do he scooped her off her feet about that trip to vegas no youre not considering the possibilities with only one goal in mind now he headed for the stairs its quick convenient colorful we could spend our wedding night in a big heartshaped bed under a fulllength mirror as appealing as that sounds im going to pass why dont we the crash at the back of the house had gabe dropping her to her feet stay here he ordered and he shoved her toward the stairs before he could get halfway toward the sound one of his grooms stumbled in whitefaced and wideeyed mr slater jesus mr slater youve got to come its reno oh my god i think hes dead there was no doubt of that though someone had had the courage and compassion to cut him down from where he had swung from a rope tied to a beam there was no mistaking the sight of death kelsey couldnt take her eyes from it the limp body decked out in riding silks the horrible angle of the head with its livid bruises around the neck call the police gabe ordered he turned kelsey around roughly get out of here go home no im staying im all right im staying with you he didnt have time to argue wait outside goddammit he exploded when she remained stubbornly beside him wait outside she only shook her head she did look away from reno and found her eyes locked on jamisons his were glazed with devastation or shock she couldnt be sure but she walked to him gently leading him to a chair sit down now jamie i found him somebody told me he was around and looking for me i dont know why i came in here i dont know why except i did and i found him just like last time i found him last time benny just like benny oh god he buried his face in his hands oh god when will it stop theres a note mr slater a young stableboy crept closer he whispered as though death had ears theres a note on the bench there i didnt touch it he added they always say youre not supposed to touch anything thats right go wait outside for the police will you sure mr slater he hesitated we cut him down he blurted out maybe we werent supposed to but we couldnt just leave him like that we had to get him down you did the right thing gabe put a hand on the boys shoulder wait outside now already dreading what he would find gabe walked over to the bench to the single sheet of paper handwritten im sorry its the cowards way but the only way i know ill never ride a horse again i killed the best horse i ever had under me as god is my witness i didnt know it was a lethal dose it was supposed to disqualify him thats all and settle a score i never believed my father was guilty until now what he did i did what he did ill do bad blood theres no fighting bad blood gabe turned from the note and looked at his trainer did you know jamie tears dripped onto jamisons hands as he nodded i knew i knew reno was benny moraless son god help him the pieces fit perfectly once they were turned to the light benny morales disgraced despairing had hanged himself leaving behind a young pregnant widow shed fled virginia and had settled in kansas secluding herself and the infant son she bore from the scandal when reno was five she married again reno took his stepfathers name but he never stopped dreaming of his real father from benny he inherited his small stature his quick hands and his love of horses so he followed in his fathers footsteps working his way up from hotwalker to exercise boy and to apprentice jockey obsessed with his fathers memory he moved to virginia he trusted only jamison his fathers closest friend with his secret and jamison kept it he had scrapbooks on his father two days after the suicide rossi shared some of the details with gabe almost a library of them several of them were dedicated to the accusations made against his father the investigation and the suicide his mother and stepfather are coming out today from kansas to claim the body i can tell you from my talk with her that she supports the fact that he had an unhealthy obsession with his father reno saw him as a hero and a scapegoat and he was determined to right the old wrong by drugging the chadwick colt gabe said softly disqualifying it from the derby morales was riding for the chadwicks when he took the fall that kept him out of racing for more than a year rossi didnt need his notes but he flipped through his book out of habit then when the horse sun spot had to be put down at keeneland matthew chadwick was one of the most outspoken against benny morales he had after all lost a valuable investment due to the tampering bad blood gabe set his teeth theres still a matter of where reno got the drug i think we can figure he injected the horse sometime after weighin and before they were loaded in the gate most probably while they were in the tunnel but how did he get it and from whom it doesnt seem it would be that difficult for a man in his position mr slater renod been around tracks since he was a teenager hed have known the right people and the wrong ones if hed gotten the drug himself he wouldnt have mistaken the dose he didnt intend to kill the horse lieutenant thats clear to me he made a mistake or he was duped have you looked up my father this is a real family affair isnt it no he said when gabe remained silent hes moved out of his rooms no forwarding address the only reason i have to pursue that particular thread is your instinct im trusting that mr slater if he shows up around the track anywhere in the area well bring him in for questioning hell show hes too vain to know when to cut his losses he hadnt believed in his fathers guilt kelsey stood at her bedroom window fresh from a lateafternoon shower and stared out over the hills reno hadnt believed in his fathers guilt and so had spent most of his life pursuing that ghost wanting to vindicate it to avenge it in the end he had discovered something about the man whose blood ran through him and about himself that he had not been able to live with it was always a risk to pry open doors to the past she was encouraging gabe to shrug off his own yoke of inheritance and be who he was yet she couldnt wasnt she risking everything shed built with naomi over the past months by probing poking prodding at that door and when she opened it when she found what was lurking in the dust behind it would she be able to live with it let it go she ordered herself why pick at something everyone wants locked she had her whole life ahead of her a life with gabe fresh new beginnings everywhere all she had to do was turn away from the shadows and accept what was miss kelsey kelsey answered without looking around yes gertie mr lingstroms office is on the phone he wanted to speak with miss naomi but since shes out hell talk to you all right gertie ill take it downstairs she took the call in her mothers office on the business line she listened managed to make the appropriate comments when the call was complete kelsey replaced the receiver carefully she was still sitting at the desk when naomi walked in god save me from those foolish timewasting luncheons i dont know what makes me think im obliged to go the only bright spot was that i happened to go into this little boutique near the restaurant when it was over there was the most incredible dress absolutely perfect for a simple garden wedding theyll hold it for twentyfour hours if you she trailed off the impetus that had carried her straight through the house to her daughter fading kelsey was staring at her her hands locked together tightly on the desk what is it naomi asked is it about reno is there something else no its not about reno she watched the relief flutter over naomis face your lawyer just phoned oh fresh nerves had naomi lifting a hand to toy with the starshaped pin at her lapel he wanted you to know that the documents you requested he draft are ready for your signature she paused the ones transferring half of three willows into my name well then thats fine why would you do something like that its something your grandfather and i discussed before he died it was always my intention kelsey and his im just making it legal without telling me i didnt want it to have the tone of an obligation naomi said carefully on either my part or yours there hasnt been a lot ive been able to give you this is something i can my father left the when and how up to me but basically this comes down to you through him i felt this was the right time and the right way this isnt a rope to tie you here kelsey or to tie you to me you must know im already tied here and to you you gambled that i would be when you asked me to come yes i did i couldnt guess or even hope that youd feel anything for me but i was sure youd feel it for three willows ones very much the same as the other a ghost of a smile moved over naomis lips so ive been told its very difficult to love and respect one without loving and respecting the other she rose holding out her hands across the desk i havent been able to do that i dont see why i should not everyone would have given me the chance naomi took kelseys hands and gripped hard not everyone had kelsey thought but she would take the risk and try to change that it was nearly five when she pulled up in tiptons driveway behind his dusty latemodel pickup the neighbors dog sent up a din racing back and forth along the chainlink fence that separated the lawns as if to warn her his ground was sacrosanct a woman leaned out of an upstairs window and shouted the dog down before eyeing kelsey looking for jim yes i am is he home in the shop she pointed shook her head cant you hear the racket indeed she could now that the dog had quieted to low throaty snarls she followed the highpitched whine of a power saw into the backyard there was a small shed one that could be put together from a kit bought at most lumberyards kelsey knocked on a door that hung crookedly on its jamb at the slight tap it swung wide and banged against the inner wall tipton stood at a bench safety glasses and ear protectors in place his orioles cap turned into the catchers position sawdust flew as he sheared off a twobyfour kelsey decided it was safer for both of them if she waited for the blade to stop whirling gotcha you son of a bitch tipton muttered as a chunk of wood hit the ground captain tipton he whirled around looking very much like something out of a b horror movie his eyes shaded by ambertoned plastic his ear protectors bulging and gray and red splotches dotting his shirt oh god youve cut yourself where what alarmed tipton checked to make sure all his fingers were in place as kelsey dashed across the shed oh this grinning he patted his chest cranberry juice the wife doesnt like me to work in good clothes kelsey leaned weakly against the bench and swore scared you huh still chuckling he pulled off his ear guards and pushed up his goggles want to sit down no im fine im building some shelves he picked up a wide flat board sighted down it for warping the wife and i have this little game i build shelves and she fills them up with doodads keeps us both happy thats nice i wonder if you could spare a few minutes i might be able to squeeze you in lemonade without waiting for her assent he hefted a big plastic jug and poured two paper cups you had some more trouble out your way i hear yes its an odd coincidence isnt it that reno should so completely mirror his fathers life and death the worlds full of odd coincidences ms byden but he wasnt happy about this one hed completed his background check on benny morales and had gathered all the details only hours before renos suicide another twentyfour hours he thought and events might have taken a different turn it solves one of your problems though you know who did your horse reno didnt mean to kill him im certain of that she sipped the lemonade found it tart and swimming with pulp his wife she thought must squeeze her own someone used him captain theres a lot of that in the world too people using people cant argue with you there my mother was using alec bradley to make my father jealous to prove her own independence even to incite gossip i wonder though how had alec bradley been using her the girl had a nice tidy mind tipton decided he picked up a square of sandpaper and began to rub it over a curved slat of wood shes a beautiful woman this isnt about sex captain rape isnt about sex he huffed out a breath maybe not we only ever had her word about the attempted rape i believe her so did you did you ever ask yourself why if she was telling the truth why alec bradley chose that particular night to attack her theyd been seeing each other for weeks shes not the kind of woman who could continue to see a man who abused her or who threatened to abuse her tipton continued to sand the wood it would be a rocking chair for his granddaughter on her birthday in september if she was telling the truth ms byden if hed been drinking theyd had a public scene shed given him his walking papers and a faceful of french champagne that kind of combination could push a certain kind of man in the wrong direction he blew lightly at the wood dust but like i said there was no evidence to support it her nightgown was torn she had bruises kelsey let out an impatient sound at his shrug all right as easily selfinflicted as not but if we say not if we believe not how do you prove it you checked his background certainly if there was another woman someone else hed abused or attacked that would weigh on naomis side wouldnt it i never found one a lot of rapes go unreported especially the kind youre talking about the daterape kind he didnt like that particular term date rape acquaintance rape it made the vicious act seem much too friendly and back twenty years ago people had a different attitude bradley had a reputation but violence wasnt part of it he had some heavy debts tipton continued almost to himself about the time he started seeing your mother he paid off some of them about twenty thousand dollars worth but he needed at least that much again to pull himself out so he needed money my mother had money he never asked her for more than a couple of grand tipton set the wood aside thats her own statement he never asked her for big money and thats one of the things i found odd because it was his pattern to sponge off women he might have been biding his time or he might have been expecting it from another source that was a thought tipton pulled a baby ruth bar from his back pocket snapped it in half and offered a share to kelsey i never tracked it down though i always wondered where he got that twenty grand couldve won it at the track but the word there was that he lost as much as he won and most of it was pennyante he talked big tipton added with a mouthful of chocolate let a lot of people know he had a deal in the works just talk as far i could find but if he did if it had something to do with my mother kelsey began to pace the shop as she worked it out she was through with him told him it was over so he panicked tried to force her if she cut him loose the deal was dead he needed money a lot of people knew he needed money but who would have used him to get to my mother as the answer swam into her mind she stopped the hand holding the paper cup tightened crushing it into a damp blob thats the trouble when you turn over rocks tipton said kindly you hardly ever like what you find under them i never linked your father to alec bradley and i tried i subpoenaed your fathers bank records went over them with a finetooth comb looking for that twentythousanddollar payment he was clean phone records too no calls came from or to alec bradleys number from the house in potomac or his office at the university he would never have done such a thing but kelseys lips were stiff and cold my father would never have done such a thing the way it looks youre right of course that puts the heat back on your mother theres another answer kelsey whirled back i know theres another answer you want another answer tipton said gently maybe youll find it maybe you wont like it he sighed and reached out to take the squashed cup from her hand i only had one thing linking philip byden with what happened that night at three willows that was charles rooney chapter twentysix it was obvious something was wrong shed come to him after dark saying only that she wanted to be with him gabe wanted to believe it was as simple as that as true as that but her eyes were distant her smile too bright with strain at the edges her needs always a delight to him were frenzied shed torn into sex with a wild abandon that couldnt quite mask the desperation as if shed been purging herself he thought now that she lay quiet beside him his body had responded and in that most elemental link they had met clashed and joined but he thought now as the silence stretched out between them neither of them had been satisfied are you ready now he asked her she turned her head looking for a cooler place to rest her cheek on the warm sheets ready to tell me whats eating you what should be eating me her voice was dull tired a man i knew and liked killed himself a few days ago this isnt about reno its about you she turned on her back staring up at the dark skylight no moon tonight she thought the clouds masked it like smoke it really took very little to hide so much he loved his father she began he didnt even know him but he loved him believed in him everything reno did circled back to that love and belief blind unquestioning love and belief she sighed once and when he realized it had been misplaced at least the belief had been misplaced he couldnt live with it she shifted restlessly the sound of her skin against the sheets a whisper in the darkness it would have been better if hed turned away from it wouldnt it better for him better for everyone if hed left what happened all those years ago alone whats to be proved gabe whats to be solved by insisting on looking back it depends on how badly you need to look and what you find he touched her hair let it sift through his fingers this is about you isnt it kelsey about you and naomi she considers it over why cant i theres no turning back the clock giving her back those years we lost that we both lost she killed alec bradley i should accept that i shouldnt let it matter so much why kelsey moved again pushing herself up drawing in her knees circling them with her arms in a move of such poignant defense it tore at his heart then let it go let it go she repeated its the sensible thing after all whatever wrong she did whatever mistakes she made shes paid for i didnt know her then or dont remember knowing her what makes me think i can go back and sort it out or that i should shes happy my fathers happy neither of them would thank me for digging into it ive no right to scrape open old wounds just to satisfy my own ridiculous need for truth for justice squeezing her eyes tight she pressed her face to her knees theyre not always the same are they truth and justice they should be one of the most admirable things about you is that you want them to be he brushed a hand over her shoulder felt the knots of tension and began to massage them out what stirred this up kelsey she took a long steadying breath and told him about her visit to tipton he didnt interrupt and tried to deal with his own kneejerk anger that she had gone without him and now youre worried that your father was somehow involved he couldnt have been her head shot up in the dark her eyes shone with defiance and a plea for understanding he couldnt have been gabe you dont know him no i dont annoyed with himself gabe drew away and reached for a cigar on the night table weve skipped that little amenity she passed a weary hand through her hair somehow shed managed to hurt him this has all happened so fast everything between you and me has happened at double time and the situation my family situation is on very rocky ground it isnt that ive kept you from him forget it he snapped on his lighter and scowled into the flame forget it he said again more quietly its hardly the point and its not whats annoying me i would have gone with you today i should have been with you it was an impulse that was the truth she thought but only half the truth maybe i wanted to go alone maybe i needed to i dont want to be protected gabe all my life ive been protected without even knowing it i cant live the rest of it that way theres a difference between being protected and being supported i need you to lean on me kelsey just like i need to know i can lean on you after a moment she took his hand do you have to be right i prefer it that way he lifted her fingers to his lips what do you want to do what i want is to forget it to let it all alone and go from here but i cant i have to know and when i do i have to live with whatever i find out she measured her palm against his then laced fingers im going to go see rooney tomorrow afternoon will you come with me more lies kelsey thought of the little white variety youre going to love the dress naomi held out the pale lavender business card the clerks names on the back ilsa they do alterations right there thats great if it doesnt suit you im sure youll find something else its a wonderful shop oh and i spoke to the caterer at the club i know you want to keep the wedding simple but you have to have food hes going to work up a couple of menus for you to choose from and she snatched up another list i know gabe has a wonderful garden and hes got an innate touch with flowers but youll want some patio plants and cut arrangements to fill things out once you decide on your colors we can order what you like thats fine listen to me laughing at herself naomi set the lists back on her desk ive fallen headfirst into the motherofthebride trap im annoying myself kelsey forced her lips to curve tried to make the smile reflect in her eyes no i appreciate it really even with a small informal wedding at home there are dozens of details that youre perfectly capable of handling yourself naomi finished i know youve had the big splashy wedding kelsey and that you want this to be different i do yes kelsey turned the business card over in her hand then stuck it guiltily in her pocket candace orchestrated that i barely had to do more than show up hearing herself she hissed out a breath that sounds ungrateful im not she was wonderful but youd like to handle this one yourself lets just say id like more of a hand in it but i dont mind delegating i never thought id have this chance planning my daughters wedding determined she pushed all her lists into a pile topped them with a brass paperweight just yank me back when i threaten to go overboard and she eased a hip onto the corner of the desk about the dress i promise i wont say a word if you dont love it but you will now youd better go before i nag you into letting me go along with you instead of gabe well shop for your dress together kelsey said as guilt piled over guilt maybe over the weekend id like that breezily naomi linked her arm through kelseys as she walked kelsey to the door itll give me a chance to harass you about photographers now go enjoy yourself kelsey mumbled something and walked outside just as gabe pulled up in the drive we have to make a stop first kelsey told him pulling out the business card after shed settled into the passenger seat he lifted a brow shopping soothing my conscience it didnt work even when it turned out that naomi had been completely right about the dress or perhaps because of it under any other circumstances the dress would have lifted her spirits the pale rose color of the silk the elegant tea length the simple lines enhanced by raindrops of seed pearls it was a wish of a dress that ilsa assured her might have been made with kelsey in mind and didnt they have the sweetest hat to go with it the clerk expounded a little whimsy with a flirty fingertip veil so perfect for an intimate outdoor wedding shoes of course classic satin pumps that could be dyed to match what flowers was she going to carry she didnt know white roses would be lovely she was assured a bride was entitled to white now did she want to take the dress and hat along with her or have them sent she took them along moving through the transaction as if in a dream it was so strange and so simple you didnt model it for me gabe commented as he walked with her back to the car bad luck she said absently then she stopped pressing her hands to her flushed cheeks god did i just buy a wedding dress apparently he took her shoulders turned her to face him second thoughts no no not about you us this its just moving so quickly i just bought my wedding dress and a hat i actually bought a hat im having shoes dyed and i havent even told my family you can rectify that today if its what you want he put the boxes in the trunk okay she nodded and reached for the door handle gabe closed his hand over hers then drew it back lets try this on for luck then he slipped a ring on her finger a single squarecut diamond centered in a gold band crusted with tiny rubies my colors our colors now thats official tears pricked at her eyes they may have been standing in a parking lot with the summer sun beating down but to her the moment was as romantic as a cruise down a moonlit stream its beautiful gabe i didnt need it i did across the lot rich huddled in his car and watched the exchange the embrace he took a nip from his flask and what a handsome couple they make he thought bitterly his son and the sluts daughter it was gabes fault he was on the run again that he was going to have to fold his tent and slink off there would be no triumphant drive to vegas now the cops were asking questions rich had dragged that much out of cunningham when hed squeezed the man for another two thousand let them ask he thought switching on his ignition when the jaguars roared to life he wouldnt be around to answer no sir rich slater was taking the high road all the way to mexico just as soon as he took care of a little business he slipped out of the lot keeping the jaguar in sight were going to have to be obnoxious kelsey told gabe as they wove their way through alexandrias traffic rooney refused to take any of my calls so well be obnoxious you think im wasting my time whats important is what you think you want to talk to him well talk to him she shifted in her seat wishing they could hurry up wishing they could take forever i suppose i want to know how involved my father was in rooneys investigation if dad knew alec bradley or just of him i need to clear it in my mind i dont suppose it changes anything that happened that night but i need to know you could ask your father ill have to sooner or later for now id her voice trailed off abruptly she straightened in her seat and leaned forward as gabe turned into the parking garage beneath rooneys building what is it that car the one that just pulled out gabe flicked a glance at his rearview mirror in time to see the car turn left and join the flow of traffic the black lincoln my grandmother kelsey rubbed at the chill on her arms that was my grandmothers car it was her driver at the wheel i recognized him there are a lot of offices in this building kelsey and lifes full of odd coincidences no she shook her head staring straight ahead when gabe pulled the car into an empty space i dont believe it she was here to see rooney im going to find out why as they crossed to the elevator gabe took her arm she was all but vibrating with temper and nerves if you go in guns blazing youll just spook him whatever it takes she stepped in then jabbed the button for rooneys floor she might have been packing sixguns gabe thought the way she stalked the receptionist in rooneys plush outer office kelsey byden and gabriel slater to see mr rooney the womans professional smile flashed do you have an appointment no im sorry ms byden mr slater dont be kelsey interrupted and leaned on the desk in a manner that had the professional smile dimming considerably just tell him were here and were not leaving until we see him oh and you might mention that i just saw my grandmother leaving milicent byden it turned the key within ten minutes they were being ushered into rooneys office he didnt rise from his desk this time but greeted them both with a single terse nod youve caught me at a bad time im afraid i cant spare more than five minutes we might have managed a more convenient time mr rooney if youd taken any of my calls ms byden trying to exude patience rooney folded his hands on the desk he succeeded in looking like a man begging ive tried to save both of us time and trouble i cant help you why were you there that night mr rooney you see thats a question i keep returning to maybe its because it all happened so long ago and i see it from a different perspective from those who were involved in the heat of the moment but why that night that particular night of all nights i was on routine surveillance its just as viable to ask yourself why your mother chose that particular night to shoot alec bradley i know the answer to that kelsey returned steadily im wondering if you do how much did you really see thats a matter of record he rose dismissing them i cant help you how far did my father tell you to go did he approve your decision to sneak onto my mothers property and spy through her windows im paid to use my own judgment you must have come to know my mother and alec bradley very well in those weeks that you followed them did you ever follow only him see who he met who he spoke with who might have given him money he could barely swallow then realized it wasnt necessary the saliva in his mouth had dried up i was hired to investigate your mother but he was part of your investigation how well did my father know him rooneys jaw tightened to my knowledge they were not acquainted outwardly cool kelsey merely lifted a brow he had no interest in the man his wife was allegedly having an affair with estranged wife and no at that point in time philip byden was only interested in one thing his child but when you reported to him i reported to his lawyers whether or not he read the copies they sent him i cant say he didnt want to be involved a small smile touched rooneys mouth he felt the idea of hiring an investigator was undignified but he did hire you perhaps he felt the ends justified the means i have another appointment youll have to excuse me why did my grandmother come here today thats confidential shes a client i cant help you he said spacing his words but his eyes flicked to gabe then away alone rooney sat behind his desk steadying his breathing he reached into his pocket and thumbed out a tums that would do little to ease the burning in his gut how could it come back like this after all these years hed gone by the book hed followed the book to the letter for twentythree years how could one night so long ago spring back at him like a tiger he started at the sound of his buzzer then cursed himself he wouldnt help the situation if he let nerves rattle him he answered the buzzer mr rooney theres a gentleman to see you he doesnt have an appointment but he claims to be an old friend im to tell you its old rich i dont know any his mouth went dry again his palms damp for one frantic moment rooney looked around his office for a route of escape there was none he realized he was as terminally hooked as the glasseyed swordfish on his wall send him in and hold my calls please yes sir rich was beaming when he stepped into rooneys office long time no see what do you want rich sat propped his feet on the desk youve put on a little weight charlie looks good on you though used to look a little like a scarecrow why dont you buy an old pal a drink what do you want rooney repeated well you can start by telling me what my boy and that pretty lady of his wanted with you rich drew out a cigarette well work from there i dont feel a whole lot better kelsey said when they climbed back into the car am i supposed to be glad that my father hired that man but kept himself distant so he wouldnt soil his dignity or should i be relieved that he had nothing to do with rooney or alec bradley maybe you should spend some time wondering why rooney was so nervous nervous he seemed cold remote and annoyed but not nervous he had his hands locked together to keep them still gabe backed out of the parking space the airconditioning was blasting in that office but he was sweating his jaw was locked so tight he had a tic at the corner of his mouth he was bluffing his way through it gabe paid the attendant then eased back into the street but little things kept giving him away and his eyes he had the look of a man whos holding trash but keeps bumping the pot curious and fascinated kelsey studied him you get all that from gambling its a gift somethings got him spooked all we have to do is find out what she sighed i need a phone booth gabe i think its time i rounded up the family milicent accepted the sherry her son poured her and feeling magnanimous patted his hand shes finally come to her senses dont look so concerned philip im quite willing to put these past few months behind us shes a byden after all she sat back sighed sipped blood will tell i certainly hope shes brought channing with her candace paced to the window and flicked the lace curtain impatiently i see no reason why he should stay at that place if kelseys coming home channings doing whats right for him philip put a gentle hand on candaces shoulder part of her wanted to shrug it off but another deeper part couldnt bear the thought of any more harsh words between them i want him to be happy philip you know i do of course you do the boy will come around milicent assured them its just youthful defiance thats all and sentiment a vet really now that will pass she flicked channings dream aside with one elegant hand why there was a time if you can imagine it when philip was a boy do you remember dear and he wanted to be a baseball player of all things i remember he murmured hed been sixteen eager and despite his bookish appearance hed had an arm like a rocket of course that dream had been aborted in its embryonic state a byden didnt play professional sports a byden was a professional channing will listen to reason just as philip did your mistake candace dear was in not asserting your authority channings over twentyone candace said stiffly a mother is always a mother milicents smile settled comfortably when the doorbell chimed ah that will be the prodigal daughter now let her apologize first philip shell feel better for it then well have cook kill the fatted calf but kelsey didnt look apologetic when she entered the sitting room with gabe at her side she did smile at her father and go to him for a greeting kiss hoping to mend fences she embraced candace before turning to her grandmother thank you for seeing me she leaned down and kissed milicents lightly powdered cheek grandmother dad candace this is gabriel slater gabe milicent candace and philip byden its nice to meet you philip offered a hand i dont mean to be rude milicents eyes were cold as they lingered on gabe but i had the impression there was family business to be discussed yes there is old and new i suppose i should start with the new gabe and i are going to be married there was a moment of stunned silence before philip recovered well thats a surprise a happy one a bombshell candace corrected and just like you kelsey but she softened at the idea of orange blossoms now i suppose sherry wont do well have to have champagne i wont have it milicent spoke her face bonewhite beneath her rouge i wont have this insulting behavior in my home mother philip began tentatively my home she said again thumping a fist on the arm of her chair is this a slap at me she demanded of kelsey a subtle insult you would bring this person into my home threaten to bring him into this family even knowing milicent kelsey was shocked at the reaction its not a slap an insult or a threat its a fact were getting married in a few weeks at gabes home in virginia id like it very much if all of you would be there of course we will eager to smooth over the rough edges candace stepped in were all just a little flustered by the suddenness of the announcement but we wouldnt miss it for the world i hope youll let me help you with some of the details enough milicent slammed her sherry down with a force that snapped the fragile stem the remaining drops of amber liquid dripped down to spot the rug there is most certainly not going to be a wedding apparently kelsey youve allowed yourself to be swayed by an attractive face thats foolish but not irrevocable with an effort she steadied her breathing and maintained her selfcontrol theres been no public announcement so there will be nothing to tidy up you she pointed at gabe you can save yourself some embarrassment now by leaving i dont think so he said evenly embarrass me well both go trembling with rage kelsey took his hand this was a mistake whatever else i have to say to my grandmother i can say at another time i shouldnt have brought you here and subjected you to this stop it gabe brought their joined hands to his lips kissed hers just above the ring let her finish im going to ask you to let me apologize philip moved between his mothers chair and his daughter certainly this has come as a surprise it might be best if we talk about it later dont shield the girl milicent rose and walked to a glossy chippendale desk youve done that long enough its time she learned to face facts i have been kelsey murmured for some time now then deal with these she drew out a file from the desk ive compiled quite a bit of information on you mr slater quite a bit professional gambler exconvict the son of an itinerant drunkard with no visible means of support and a cleaning woman a runaway who lived on the streets and spent time in jail for illegal gambling she kept the file clutched in her hand as she studied gabe with cold condemning eyes you may have developed a taste for the finer things and amassed some of them but it doesnt change who you are no it doesnt gabe agreed just as being born with them doesnt change who you are she slapped the file back on the desk get out of my house wait kelseys hand closed convulsively around gabes arm how dare you do this how dare you pry into gabes personal life and mine ill do whatever is necessary to protect the byden name and you despite this sudden attachment youve developed for that woman are a byden that woman is my mother did you put a dossier together on her as well she demanded did you search for nasty little secrets to throw in my fathers face to try to keep him from marrying her it was to my regret one of the few times in his life he didnt listen to me the scene had been all too similar to this milicent remembered philip had actually shouted at her and given her the ultimatum of accepting that woman or losing her own son no he didnt listen she repeated and the results were disastrous im one of the results kelsey tossed back is that what you were doing in rooneys office this afternoon milicent used one arm to brace herself against the desk i dont know what youre talking about i saw you you hired him again didnt you to spy on gabe to pry into his past it was just a necessary evil to compile information that would bring you to your senses milicent defended well you wasted your money it doesnt make any difference to me i already know all of it then youre more your mother than i wanted to believe you deserve what becomes of you youre right kelsey turned to her father did you fall out of love with her dad or did you allow yourself to be shoved out of it kelsey he said his voice hoarse because all at once he wasnt sure of the answer what happened then happened i apologize with all my heart for this rigid with shock and embarrassment he looked at gabe to both of you apologize milicent spat out ive told you the kind of man he is the kind of man shes using to humiliate this family and you apologize yes with sorrow in his eyes philip looked at his mother i apologize for you for the fact that youve used the family name like a whip a name that has always meant more to you than something as simple as happiness pale as death milicent gripped the edge of the desk i will not be spoken to like that by my son in my own home her eyes flashed back to kelsey shes at the root of this naomi is the root of this kelsey nodded slowly perhaps she is im sorry i wont be back lets go home gabe kelsey flushed pink candace dashed after them stopping them at the door please dont blame your father im trying not to he would never have allowed this to happen if hed known surely you know what kind of man he is kelsey looked into candaces worried eyes yes i do you know i always thought how well you and dad were suited how you complemented each other filled in the blanks leaning forward she kissed candace softly on the cheek i didnt realize until right now how much you love him i should have tell him ill call him later all right yes yes i will and kelsey her smile was a little crooked but it was there best wishes to both of you chapter twentyseven quite a family youve got there darling okay gabe once hed parked in the drive at three willows kelsey got out of the car and closed her door with deliberate care this isnt the time to get cute no i mean it i let you rant half the way home and stew the other half that ought to finish it she wasnt nearly finished it wasnt just about me it wasnt really about me at all it was about you hell in an easy motion he swung an arm around her shoulder ive had a lot worse tossed at me she didnt bring up the showgirl in reno or the business in el paso thats hardly the point she stopped dead on the first step what showgirl got your attention he gave her an almost brotherly squeeze anyway i liked your father and your stepmother thats two for three baffled she could only stare up at him youre not even angry youre not even angry over what she did gabe she hired a detective to pry into your life to put together a file on you as though you were some kind of criminal and what did she accomplish kelsey you already knew the worst of me and you defended even that it makes my laying my cards out on the table up front the best gamble i ever took it doesnt excuse what she did but it makes what she did meaningless look maybe i understand a little because i never had a family name to defend now she stopped in her tracks youre standing up for her no but i figure she made the wrong move and it ended up costing her a lot more than it cost me she blew at her bangs maybe i need a little more time to be openminded get my dress out of the car will you at least we can make one person happy today when i show it to naomi why dont i take you both out to dinner he rubbed his thumb over the ring on her finger he liked seeing it there celebrate why dont you ill go tell her she hurried into the house giving herself one quick shake a gesture to toss off the worst of the day she was halfway up the stairs when naomi called her oh there you are one hand trailing along the banister kelsey rushed down again you were absolutely right about the dress gabes getting it out of the car then hes going to take us out to dinner should we see if we can drag moses away from the barn naomi stood in the foyer her hands clasped we need to talk it might be better if we sat down what is it oh god not one of the horses justice was a little wheezy but i dosed him the way moses told me its not one of the horses kelsey please come in and sit down the stranger was back that cool controlled woman who had first invited her to tea baffled kelsey followed her through the doorway youre angry with me about something no i dont think angry is the appropriate word she glanced over when gabe came through the door it might be best if we discussed this privately no theres nothing you cant say to me in front of gabe all right then naomi walked to the window faced out she needed all her control now all the selfreliance shed had to learn to survive in prison you had a call while you were out gertie took the message she left it on the desk in your room i went in there a few minutes ago to take in a guest list id been putting together her face expressionless she turned around ill apologize for reading it it wasnt intentional it was simply there and my eye fell on it why dont you just tell me who called charles rooney the message was marked urgent he wants you to contact him as soon as possible then id better see what its about please naomi held up a hand after more than twenty years i cant believe it could be so urgent youve been to see him yes twice for what purpose kelsey havent i answered your questions yes you have thats one of the reasons i went to see him because youve answered my questions and you she turned to gabe a flash of temper sneaking through the cracks you encouraged her in this it wasnt a matter of encouragement but i understand how could you understand she demanded bitter how could either of you possibly understand you cant imagine what went through me when i saw his name on the desk ive spent more than a decade of my life trying to forget i made myself dredge it up again relive it again a payment i thought i hoped to bring my daughter back but its not enough i didnt go to see him to hurt you im sorry i have i went because i wanted to help because i hoped i would find something that would change things they cant be changed if he saw something that night he didnt tell the police if he held something back stunned naomi sank to the arm of the sofa did you think really think you could find something to clear my name is that what this is about kelsey a belated bath for the dirty family linen with a weak laugh naomi rubbed her eyes god what possible difference could it make now you cant give me back one second of the time i lost you cant take away one whisper one sneer one sidelong look its done she said dropping her hands its as dead and buried as alec bradley not to me i did what i thought was right and if rooney called me theres a reason he didnt want to talk to me today he was nervous maybe even afraid just leave it alone i cant do that she stepped forward gripping naomis cold hands in hers theres more what happened to pride and reno its so much like what happened all those years ago your horse benny morales its like this terrible echo thats taken this long to catch up and it hasnt stopped yet even the police wonder if theres a connection the police what color remained in naomis cheeks washed away youve spoken with the police kelsey released her mothers hands and stepped back ive been to see captain tipton tipton the shudder came before she could stop it oh god he believed you kelsey watched naomi lift her head he told me he believed you thats bull trembling she sprang up you werent there in that horible room with the questions pounding at you over and over and over no one believed me certainly not tipton if he had why did i go to prison he couldnt prove it the photographs back to rooney naomi interrupted do you really think you can turn this around discover some longoverlooked clue that proves i was defending my honor the hurt throbbed in her heart in her voice well you cant and even if you want to help you wont be able to because i cant survive going through it again i just cant she walked from the room and hurried up the stairs moments later they heard the sound of a door slamming what a mess kelsey dropped into a chair closed her eyes what a mess ive made of things no you havent youve stirred things up maybe they needed to be stirred up wed come a long way she and i had come such a long way gabe ive ruined that do you really believe that i dont know she lifted her hands then let them fall i started off telling myself i was asking questions for me because i had a right to know somewhere along the line i twisted that convinced myself i was doing it for her but i think i was right in the first place i wanted to tidy it all up make it clean if i believe her everyone should believe her that doesnt make you a villain kelsey he crossed over and sat on the arm of her chair tell me what you want to do she drew in a deep breath expelled it im going to call charles rooney i have to finish it they met him at a bar not a seedy ginsoaked dive that might have added atmosphere to a clandestine meeting but a plantfilled lounge that catered to whitecollar professionals rooney had used every skill every trick along his route to make certain he hadnt been followed when he saw them come in he finished off his first gin and tonic he was done and knew it hed spent the hours since rich slater had left his office making plans to disappear he had the knowledge the contacts and now he had the motive mr rooney sit down i can recommend the house wine fine kelsey said and nodded to the hovering waitress coffee gabe ordered black you said urgent he reminded rooney so i did he tapped his glass to indicate another one more for the road he thought by morning he planned to be sipping a mimosa in rio im afraid i was a little rattled when i made that call it was a day for unexpected visitors at my office the last one was unpleasant ive been an investigator for over twentyfive years a long time ive had a lot of interesting cases ive never once discharged a weapon he gave the table two brisk knocks i enjoy my work always have its difficult to build up the right clientele a certain class of people the right class of people generally dont care to have an overt association with someone in my line of work they hire us with the same kind of dismay and disgust that they hire someone to exterminate their roaches they want the results of course but they rarely want to discuss the execution there are some who prefer a more handson approach he paused as their drinks were served this is fascinating rooney gabe commented but hardly urgent milicent byden he said and watched kelseys mouth tighten shes a woman accustomed to directing servants giving orders making certain theyre carried out to her specifications we know she hired you to investigate gabe kelsey washed the bad taste out of her mouth with wine i hope you got a hefty retainer mr rooney believe me shes far from satisfied with the results tossed them back in her face did you he found that amusing and chuckled into his drink maybe theres some justice in the world she was satisfied with the results the first time she hired me more than satisfied the first time it was your grandmother who hired me for the custody suit my information is that you were hired by my fathers lawyers her lawyers ms byden you should remember they were her lawyers too and thats the way she wanted it to shake down he took the lime wedge from his drink and squeezed the juice into the glass id done a job for an acquaintance of hers divorce she must have figured id done a good one a discreet one and i fit the bill ambitious still young enough to be impressed by who she was who her husband was and the size of her check he shrugged that out and dipped into the bowl filled with pretzels shaped like chinese characters i dont see that it makes a large difference where your retainer came from kelsey commented oh but it did i never even met your father i saw him at the trial but we never had a oneonone thats the way your grandmother wanted it and she was good at getting things done her way she wanted your mother out all the way out of his life and yours and shed worked out a very simple plan to accomplish it my job was to follow naomi take pictures make reports thats all milicent byden told me but im a good investigator ms byden even then i was good and i found out more more kelsey felt that door creak open a little wider and was afraid very much afraid of what she would see beyond it its easy enough to rub some elbows at the track one of my sources had the goods on bradley knew hed played deep and was in debt to the wrong people bradley wasnt good at keeping secrets and hed talked talked about the big deal he was working on all he had to do was make time with a beautiful woman and hed be set bradley and my source got chummy they didnt run in the same circles but they were cut pretty much from the same cloth bradley talked too much my source put the arm on him for more then passed the information on to me for a fee youre taking a long time to circle around to the wire rooney gabe said then let me make it simple he loosened his constricting tie the custody suit was leaning toward naomi courts dont like to take a kid from its mother maybe she liked to party maybe she liked men but she didnt fool with either when the kid was around she had the money and the means and there were plenty of people willing to testify that she was a good mother a devoted one so the bydens needed something to tip the scales in their favor milicent found it in alec bradley my kelsey took a moment to steady her voice my grandmother knew alec bradley yes she knew him knew his parents knew his character she hired bradley to seduce your mother to lure her into a compromising situation the kind of situation that would make her appear anything but moral and maternal beneath the table kelsey gripped gabes hand youre saying that my grandmother paid alec bradley paid him to why should i believe you you believe what you want rooney didnt give a damn he was just clearing his desk so to speak before he retired you came after the answers ms byden dont blame me if they dont suit you she gave him twenty thousand dollars up front kelsey made a small sound as the figure clicked the trouble was naomi wasnt playing the game not the way bradley and your grandmother wanted she was keeping him on a leash the way the custody suit was heating up your grandmother needed action so she found another element to stir into the mix there was some trouble at the track a dead horse a dead jockey the publicity on that boomeranged in the chadwicks favor gabe held up a hand are you saying thats connected its all connected bradley needed cash but milicent was keeping her wallet slammed shut until he produced results so bradley and his pal at the track worked out a little deal when the horse went down bradley picked up some loose change but he didnt get the bonus hed hoped for when the sympathy went with naomi milicent gave him a deadline rooney studied what was left of his drink debated indulging in another with less than two hours until his flight he opted to keep a clear head she told me to have my camera and plenty of film to be outside the house i went to the club first and watched bradley stage the jealousy scene stage kelsey repeated its easier to see through an act when youre not involved plus my source had alerted me this was going to be the night bradley wanted to rile her i dont think he expected her to cut him loose he thought too much of himself when it came to the ladies when your mother left i was right behind her there was nobody else in the house not until bradley got there my instructions were to take pictures but only pictures that weighed in on the side of the bydens your instructions kelsey said dully from my grandmother thats right it looked promising at first her opening the door in that nightgown letting him in they had another drink and he was pouring on the charm i got a good shot through the window of them kissing i didnt bother to take one of her shoving him away that wasnt my job they started to argue i could hear snatches through the window when she shouted loud enough she was telling him to get out that they were through he grabbed her pawed at her rooney lifted his eyes to kelseys there was a minute there when i thought about going in breaking it up she was in trouble there was no way to mistake what kind of trouble but i didnt go in i had my job to do in any case she fought him off she was pissed still more pissed than scared she shouted at him made a move for the phone but he came after her again i dont think she had any doubt about what was going to happen she ran rooney paused wiped a hand over his mouth he knew i was there the son of a bitch knew i was there he looked right out the window and he pointed like this rooney jerked a finger at the ceiling upstairs he was telling me im going to take care of it upstairs so i did what id been hired to do i went up the tree i couldnt hear anything not the way my heart was pounding i didnt let myself think i had a job a big one one that was going to lead to a lot of others and shed asked for it hadnt she thats what i told myself shed asked for it the way shed been stringing him along you knew he would rape her kelsey managed you knew and you did nothing thats right rooney downed the rest of his drink she came into the bedroom came running in she was scared then but she was mad too that filmy robe shed been wearing was falling off her shoulder where it was torn he came in after her and he smiled he looked friendly even apologetic the way they were framed in the window facing each other so completely focused on each other with her clothes falling off and the shirt of his tux undone it looked provocative even sexy i dont know what he was saying to her but she was shaking her head and backing up he reached down like he was going to unhook his pants she slapped him rooney moistened his lips i got that on film he slapped her back i didnt take that shot he had to stop again he hadnt realized how going through that night step by step would affect him then hed felt small and scared now he simply felt small she made a dive she was out of my view for a minute he put his hands up he was still smiling but it didnt look so friendly now then i could see her again and i saw the gun i started taking pictures fast then i was scared i kept taking them after she shot him even when there was nothing to see it was selfdefense kelseys fingers dug into gabes just as she said all along yeah it was maybe maybe she could have held him off once she had the gun but she was scared she was trapped if all the facts had come out i dont think theyd have charged her with so much as manslaughter they sure as hell wouldnt have convicted her but the facts didnt come out no i took them straight to milicent byden i wasnt thinking going to her house in the middle of the night getting her out of bed she poured me a brandy herself told me to sit down then she listened to what i had to tell her from beginning to end she said it had worked out for the best she instructed me to wait a day or two before going to the police she knew kelsey whispered so she knew everything she orchestrated it if naomi hadnt been arrested by then i was to take the film to the cops and give my statement i was to tell them what i saw only what i saw not what i assumed not what i interpreted then she told me what id seen a woman provocatively dressed welcoming her lover into an empty house they shared a drink an embrace then they quarreled the woman was jealous that was obvious after the scene at the club she went upstairs her lover following to make apologies amends perhaps a seduction and in a jealous rage the woman took out a gun and killed him she gave me another five thousand cash that night and the promise of several reference whitefaced kelsey slid from the booth with one hand pressed to her heaving stomach she dashed toward the rest rooms gabe watched her go he found that his fists were balled under the table youre a revolting specimen rooney a few thousand dollars and some fancy names on a client list for that you watched an attempted rape then helped see that the victim was locked away theres more rooney said well wait for kelsey tell me this why did you decide to come out with all of this now a few hours ago you had nothing to say its getting complicated i dont like being squeezed from two sides rooney shrugged when this comes out and ive decided it will my reputations shot it looks to me like im about to retire a few years early i might as well do it with a clean slate im wondering gabe began and his voice was cool deceptively detached if i should take you outside and beat you to a pulp or if i should just let you live with this rooney picked up his glass and sipped the melted ice cubes slowly we all make our choices slater youre a gambler when you know the house has stacked the deck are you going to bet against it some games you just dont play he rose as kelsey walked back to the booth im all right im sorry she was still white around the lips but her hand was steady when it gripped gabes you hang on for a minute he gave his attention back to rooney lets have the rest youre not going to like it milicent byden didnt hire me just to compile your dossier mr slater that came later she put me on retainer months ago right after kelsey contacted naomi chadwick kelsey pressed her lips together praying for her stomach to settle i dont understand but she thought she did she was terrified that she did flat out rooney continued she didnt want you there didnt want to take any chances that you and naomi would click how did she intend to prevent it well since there wasnt anything to smear naomi with since shed been released from prison milicent made use of the past after alec bradley was shot i took her my files all of my files there was a lot of detail in them not just about naomi im thorough you see i had documentation on bradley and his associate the race fix my suspicions on cunninghams involvement when she gave you a yank kelsey and you didnt come to heel she put that information to use how kelsey braced herself youd better tell me how she had me look up bradleys old friend and lure him back to the area with the promise of a job she didnt tell me what that job would be but it didnt take long to figure it out not with history repeating itself a fixed race a dead colt gossip and suspicion circled around naomi and you he jabbed a finger at gabe milicent didnt want you anywhere near her blood kin kelsey was supposed to see just how unsavory racing was how ruthless and she was supposed to run back home but i didnt kelsey could feel tears burning at her eyes but she wouldnt free them not now not yet youre telling me that she was behind it behind prides death and god micks even a woman like milicent cant control a man with no ethics you could say that her hireling momentarily got away from her she was steamed after the grooms murder read me the riot act as if id stabbed the poor bastard myself he shook his head remembering the horse now thats what she wanted a recreation of crimes a scandal to teach her granddaughter a lesson because of me kelsey murmured her hand lay limply under gabes all of it because of me youre the last of the byden line rooney pointed out she sets store by that and she hates naomi with a kind of coldblooded passion that doesnt dilute with time if she could ruin her again and keep control over you it would all be worth it she lent cunningham enough money to buy that horse big sheba more than enough to keep him under her thumb and persuade him to work with her button man not that she liked it rooney added associating even from a distance with that type but the ends justify i dont think i know the woman youre talking about kelsey said slowly i dont think i recognize her how could she ruin so many lives control them rooney corrected she never considered any of it more than necessary control and i went along with it he rubbed a hand between his eyes the first time i was young eager impressionable this time i felt trapped and hell it was just a job my last visitor of the day changed things he studied gabes face for a long moment maybe im getting old christ knows im tired so when he showed up trying to make a new deal i cut my losses and maybe i like to think that i figured it was time for a little atonement rooneys eyes sharpened do you want to know how benny moraless son did the chadwick colt how somebody nearly did one of yours slater look to your own organization and look to your old man thats right he said smiling a little rich slater wormed plenty of secrets out of alec bradley and he was more than happy to use them and repeat the sequence when milicent byden sent for him revenge and control revenge and money her motives and his makes a hell of a combination chapter twentyeight pull over will you a half mile from longshot gabe swung to the shoulder of the road are you feeling sick again no she was but not in the way he meant i just need to walk for a minute can we walk without waiting for his answer she pushed out of the car the perfect night she thought the classic midsummer night in the country with a diamondbright dome of sky stars and moon not even a wisp of a cloud to spoil it the air smelled of the honeysuckle that was patiently burying the fence along the rolling field to the right the high grass that grew beyond it was alive with the chirp of crickets as she walked the soft shoulder gave under kelseys feet its too much she murmured its just too much to take in how can i tell her gabe she spun around her hands reaching for his for a solution how can i tell my mother that it was all planned that everything that happened was all part of some scheme to keep her away from me first he reached up to tuck her hair behind her ear you stop blaming yourself im not she stopped turning to lean on the fence to look out over the shadowy hills but im angry that i was used like a pawn she wasnt even thinking of me as a child i can see that not as a child certainly not as a person progeny kelsey said bitterly thats all i was all i am to her just the next byden he started to speak to offer some sort of comfort then stopped sometimes it was kinder simply to listen i think kelsey continued i really think she wanted to love me that she tried even succeeded for stretches of time but the way she felt about my mother and maybe god i hope the guilt she lived with over what shed done made it almost impossible she wanted me to be a credit to the family name educated at the best schools knowledgeable about the arts competent in music and other acceptable pastimes my friends had to be from the right families maybe thats why i never made any who were really close to me and every small rebellion every flash of my own personality or needs was seen as a mirror of the woman shed ruined kelsey plucked some honeysuckle from the vine and began slowly systematically to shred the fragile white blossoms when i turned twelve she wanted me to go to boarding school in england my father refused it was one of the few times id ever seen them quarrel i needed discipline i needed guidance my father said i needed childhood with a sigh she rubbed the tattered petals between her fingers stinging the air with scent did she realize that she was using him too another pawn how responsible is she gabe for destroying their marriage whatever chance they had of making it work thats the least of it though she murmured and let the blossoms fall now i have to find a way to tell my mother why and how and who and my father ill have to tell him too wont i he has a right to know everything she did then everything shes done now she turned to him then pressing her face to his chest grateful that his arms were there to wrap around her so much waste so many lives lost or ruined and it all trickles down to some horribly misplaced family pride and a few more of the deadly sins he said quietly thinking of his own father envy greed lust ive always believed more in luck than fate but its more than luck that brought this full circle he drew her back so he could see her face you and me kelsey weve both been a part of it right from the beginning and maybe we wouldnt be so close to ending it if we hadnt found each other youll want to find him now wont you your father ill have to find him you could leave it to rossi her grip tightened suddenly urgently gabe he wants to hurt you if he went to rooneys office so soon after we did he was probably following us hes looking for a way to get to you so ill find him first thats my circle kelsey i need to close it but if we went to the police why havent we already called them she looked away he saw her heart her needs too clearly all right i need to talk to naomi first and you need to find your father then well end it i guess youd better take me home when they pulled up at three willows she declined his offer to come in with her she would do this alone he waited until she went inside until the front porch light went dark gabe had his own demons to face and the first wasnt his father inside kelsey glanced up the stairs it was late undoubtedly naomi was in bed wait until morning she thought its waited so long already surely it could wait one more night but that was cowardice with a sigh she headed toward the kitchen she would brew a pot of tea first that would give her a chance to sort out exactly how she would begin gertie kelsey was surprised to find the housekeeper up loading the dishwasher oh miss kelsey you gave me such a start the woman pressed a hand to the bodice of her pink chenille robe its after midnight you shouldnt be working so late oh i was just putting my dishes in there was a bette davis movie on the tv tonight now voyager i had me some lemon cake and a good cry she sighed happily over the thought of it they just dont make movies like that these days miss kelsey no they dont struggling to hold a conversation kelsey moved to the range her movements mechanical as she picked up the kettle and walked to the sink to fill it is everyone else in bed you want some tea let me do that territorial gertie brushed her aside and set the kettle on to boil channings out with matt gunner that tennessee walker of the williamses got a case of the strangles they dont know if hell make it until morning oh im sorry well its a shame thats the truth gertie busied herself warming a china pot while waiting for the kettle to boil but i have to say channing was mighty excited at the idea of sitting up half the night in a barn i told him id leave the kitchen door unlatched for him and theres a nice cold plate of chicken in the fridge then undoubtedly hell be in heaven its a pleasure having him around here for me too i need two cups gertie i want to take a cup up to my mother oh shes sleeping honey gertie chose the chamomile and measured the leaves out by sight fact is she looked so tired out and upset about something that i had her take a sleeping pill just an hour ago a sleeping pill she said i was fussing but she didnt look well to me all drawn out and pale a good nights sleep is what she needed and i told her so i was going to check on her before i went to bed ill do it kelsey looked at the teapot with a mixture of resignation and relief just one cup then gertie thanks ill talk to her in the morning shell be fine then just overtired i expect gertie put the pot on a tray arranged the cup and saucer shes looked better happier these past few months than she has in a long long time thats your doing it dont matter what else goes on a mother pines for her child im here now i know it honey dont you stay up too late i wont good night gertie kelsey carried the tray upstairs setting it in her room before going to look in on her mother in the slant of moonlight through the window she could see naomi sleeping deeply so it would be in the morning after all she thought and slipped into her own room to wait for the dawn gabe didnt bother to stop in at the house but drove straight to the barn he saw the light above the tack room and grimly circled around and climbed the stairs he didnt knock jamison sat at his desk paperwork in neat organized piles a single glass of brandy at his elbow he looked up blinking owlishly gabe what brings you up here so late i could ask you the same oh well with a tired smile jamison gestured at the stacks of papers theres always something needs dealing with its easier to concentrate at night when things are quiet theres a jar of instant coffee over there he added you can heat up the pot on the hot plate no gabe studied his trainer his friend in the yellow light of the desk lamp the past months of strain and worry had taken their toll the shadows under his eyes were like bruises the lines bracketing his mouth so sharp and deep they might have been carved by a knife not the face of a man who had recently trained a horse to the triple crown i used to hang around the barn a lot when i worked here didnt i jamie tagged after you or mick that you did jamison relaxed the shoulders that had gone tense under gabes scrutiny or youd hustle us into a poker game and hose us out of a weeks pay cunningham never gave you much peace as i remember if you had one winner he wanted two always a bigger race a bigger purse i remember he was always saying moses over at three willows knew how to turn out champions and if you didnt hed find someone who could he was a hard man to work for i trained good horses for him won a lot of races had horse of the year back in the eighties with try again but i never satisfied him he wanted a derby winner you never pulled that off even after the chadwicks lost that colt at keeneland back in what was it seventythree and cunninghams was the favorite you didnt pull it off gabes voice was quiet cool that colt came in third as i remember a disappointing third that must have been hard to take after all youd gone through to see him under the wire first the memory had jamisons mouth twitching a show at the derbys no shame the colt didnt run his best that day lost it in the last furlong and things were hard around here mighty hard he lifted his brandy drank after benny hung himself you and benny were tight we were good friends yeah good friends gabe turned a chair around straddled it how much did you have to do with it jamie then and now what are you getting at you and benny were close did you talk him into fixing the race or did you just go along with it ill tell you what i think gabe continued without waiting for an answer i think you asked him to help you out give the colt a little edge cunningham was pushing you for that edge maybe he offered you a bigger cut of the purse maybe he just kept the pressure on you until you broke and when you broke you took benny morales along with you his eyes never left jamisons face a derby win jamie something youve always wanted and up until now never quite pulled off thats foolish talk gabe youve known me too long i have jamie ive known you too long not to know that nothing goes on in that barn that you dont have a hand in i didnt put you together with what happened to the three willows colt this time or what nearly happened to mine my mistake he said watching jamisons eyes drop never figured youd kill a horse just to win a race any race gabe took out a cigar studying it from tip to tip while jamison remained silent thats what blinded me jamie until reno he didnt know it was a lethal dose neither did you you were just giving my colt the edge werent you by seeing that pride was eliminated is that how my father put it to you jamie give yourself the edge i wanted my own place jamison whispered a man deserves his own after so many years of tending someone elses any other year that colt wouldve won the derby laughing why was it moses should have one that could match him why was it bad luck gabe lit his cigar hed stopped feeling sorrow hed stopped feeling grief you wanted that win gabe dont tell me you didnt yeah i wanted it i wont tell you i didnt are you going to tell me you wouldnt have looked the other way if youd known gabes eyes flashed up no it wasnt sorrow in them and it was a long way from grief if you thought that why did you hide it from me you were a wild card thats how rich put it you were a wild card and you couldnt be trusted look how that colt ran gabe he said desperate think about that he took the three jewels and nothing could stop him at what cost its not just a dead horse jamie its mick and its reno jamisons eyes filled swam with tears that wasnt my doing jesus god gabe you cant believe that was my doing lipsky went off on his own i didnt even know about it until after then it was too late his voice broke for a moment there was only the sound of his labored breathing with an effort he pulled himself back rich wanted to give you something to think about but he didnt tell me until after i didnt know he was going to go after double gabe god is my witness it was to be the three willows colt a scandal a disqualification he shuddered waiting for gabe to speak veering closer to the edge when there was only silence youve got to figure that rich and cunningham worked it out gabe youve got to figure it thats right ive got to figure it the disqualification wasnt enough for rich the money he got for fixing it wasnt enough hes greedy you know that he used us to kill that colt i suffered when that horse went down when i knew what hed had us do and reno he buried his face in his hands i cared about that boy afterward i told him it wasnt his fault but he wouldnt listen its rich whos responsible for all of it then he comes around here and he changes the rules how jamison dropped his hands wiped the back of one over his mouth he picked up the brandy again drank it like medicine he didnt want you to win the triple crown gabe it was eating him inside out to think you could he told me it was a job just a little side bet he had going but it was money he wanted he had me dont you see he had me and reno both but i wasnt going to hurt double you have to believe that i got the drug myself this time it was only going to be enough to eliminate him gabes eyes narrowed down into points of flame the night kelsey came into the barn it was you wasnt it youre the one who hurt her i didnt do her any real harm i just had to get out before she saw me i got kip out of the way didnt do more than give him a headache then when she came in i couldnt finish i just i could break you in half for that alone jamie quick as a snake gabes hand shot out closed around jamisons throat for that alone he murmured squeezing i panicked gabe terrified jamison clawed at gabes iron grip jesus i was half out of my mind cant you see i see a lot of things disgusted gabe released him the ugly mottled red began to fade from jamisons face as he gulped in air he had me trapped dont you see i told rich i wouldnt do it but he said if it wasnt done we were going to pay so i tried even though it was breaking my heart i tried but it didnt work reno was supposed to do it the day of the belmont but he couldnt jesus gabe he hung himself a horse isnt worth dying for but its worth killing for i told you i didnt tell yourself gabe spat out tell yourself you were a victim jamie that you were used that what happened to benny morales and mick and reno and even to lipsky was just the luck of the draw then see if you can live with it he rose kicking the chair aside i did what i had to do and i stood up to him just tonight i stood up to him gabes head jerked up what are you talking about rich was here not an hour ago drunk mean he was talking wild about killing the horses burning the barn christ knows what hed have done if i hadnt held him off gabe whirled and was bounding down the steps with jamie shouting after him he hit the lights in the barn choking back fear as he systematically checked every box i told you i didnt let him in here jamison said i told him to get out to go sleep it off that we were finished i wasnt doing his dirty work anymore not after reno no matter what gabe stood outside doubles box the colt sidled forward nuzzled lazily at his hand youre finished jamie pack up and get out tonight a mans entitled to a place of his own you should know that yeah i know that but yours isnt here not anymore within twenty minutes gabe had roused three grooms and posted them in the barn until he ran his father to ground there would be a twentyfourhour watch hed be back gabe thought as he strode toward the house the combination of greed and hate would draw him back nothing would satisfy rich slater except his sons total misery what was most important most cherished had to be destroyed but this time it would be different this time the blood drained out of gabes face as his own thoughts circled back in his head what was most important most cherished kelsey gertie tried out a new night cream shed ordered from one of the shopathome channels a guilty pleasure she sometimes indulged in on the kitchen television the young and perky saleswoman on the screen had touted the cream as something akin to a rebirth gertie didnt expect miracles only a temporary reprieve from the lines that seemed to bloom on her face with increasing regularity vanity she clucked at her mirrored reflection foolish vanity for a woman who had lived on this earth for more than half a century but when she looked closely she thought maybe just maybe she could spot a slight softening around the eyes where the crow had dug his feet in the deepest satisfied with the new nightly ritual she stood to remove her robe then smiled when she heard the sound of the kitchen door creaking open that boy would raid the refrigerator for sure she thought and likely leave a mess boys channings age never chased down crumbs shed just go along and fix him a plate herself see that he washed it down with milk instead of that soda pop he was always guzzling i hear you out there she said as she swung into the kitchen from her adjoining room no use sneaking around you just sit yourself down and ill she stopped frowning in the glow of the range light shed left on for channing the kitchen was quiet spotless and empty ears playing tricks on me she muttered maybe theyll start selling something for that on the tv she started to turn then pain burst in her head she managed one tiny birdlike cry as she crumpled to the tile rich stood over her grinning coshed the skinny old bitch with her own rolling pin he thought and tapped the smooth heavy marble against his palm he toed at her side lightly catching himself when the onefooted stance had him weaving need a little balance he decided and reached into his back pocket for his flask when no more than a few miserly drops hit his tongue he swore stuffing the empty flask back into his pocket he stepped over the unconscious gertie they were bound to have some liquor around here he thought prime stuff too once hed fueled himself up hed hunt up gabes pretty little pigeon upstairs kelsey drank another cup of tea while she paced her room she wished channing would get home at least then shed be able to talk to someone and who would understand better than he this horrible conflict of family loyalties even gabe for all his support didnt share the same memories the same affections and frustrations channing when the trouble was real was a rock in the morning in a few short hours she would tell naomi everything shed learned once the story was told kelsey knew she would be freeing one woman she loved and condemning another for under all the bitterness the anger and the painful disappointment she still loved her grandmother the magnificent milicent she thought shutting her eyes how would she survive the scandal let alone the legal consequences and there were bound to be consequences and how kelsey asked herself would she be able to live with the fact that what shed done and what she would do could send her own grandmother to prison a tinkling crash of glass from downstairs had her biting back a gasp channing she thought setting down her cup she hadnt heard him drive up but he was obviously down there fumbling through the dark in a very poor attempt not to wake the rest of the house relieved kelsey hurried out of her room and down the stairs to find him channing you idiot what did you break if that was one of naomis crystal horses there will be hell to pay at the base of the stairs she stopped listening the house was quiet now quiet enough to run a chill up her arms stop it she ordered herself and rubbed them warm come on channing im not in the mood to play games i really need to talk to you she snapped on the light in the foyer look i know youre down here your catlike grace always gives you away its important channing annoyed now she marched into the sitting room in the glow of moonlight she saw the glint of shattered glass on the rug dammit it was one of the horses nice going ace she hurried over kneeling down to pick up shards all the queens horses rich said and switched on the lights all the queens men he grinned down at kelsey but can the queens lovely daughter put any of them back together again he threw back his head and laughed at the sheer poetry of it chapter twentynine kelsey gasped in surprise and pain as her hand contracted around a sliver of glass blood welled on her palm careful there honey pie rich sauntered over you could slice yourself to ribbons he tuttutted over the cut on her hand then gallantly offered her a handkerchief didnt mean to give you such a start but i thought it was time we had ourselves a chat seeing as youre warming my boys bed most nights youre gabes father kelsey scrambled to her feet but not quickly enough richs hand shot out locked around her arm theres a family resemblance isnt there the ladies always said we made a handsome pair me and my boy his eyes bright with liquor and anticipation skimmed over her face why youre even prettier close up doll face it isnt hard to see why my boys been sniffing around you no indeedy it isnt hard at all here now he stuffed the handkerchief into her bleeding hand you wrap that up she obeyed automatically if youre looking for gabe she broke off reevaluated quickly hes upstairs she said ill go up and tell him youre here the one thing i never tolerated from a woman was a lie with one flick he shoved her into a chair hard enough to snap her head back youd better get that straight right now he leaned over the chair trapping her between his arms gabes not upstairs now is he i saw him drop you off out of his fancy car just a little while ago dont know why hed go home to a cold bed when he has something like you but i always had a hard time teaching the boy anything he patted her cheek pleased with the swell of power when she cringed back but this works out real cozy just you and me getting acquainted whoops whats this here chuckling he pinched his fingers at her wrist forced her hand up thats a whopper now isnt it he said eyeing her ring is that what i think it is he wagged his finger in front of her face is my boy going to make an honest woman out of you honey pie well youre a real step up from most of the sluts hes snuggled with before no offense no she said hoping to play the game out no offense taken gabe and i are going to be married in august i hope youll be there she cried out in shock when the back of his hand swiped across her face his genial expression never altered now what did i tell you about lying what you and that boy of mine would like is for me to drop dead on the spot wouldnt you she blinked to clear her vision i dont know you she said carefully but she knew enough to be afraid and her trembling gave her away you know me ill give you odds my loving sons told you all about me your mama too the thought of naomi soured his grin shed have something to say about good old rich slater kelsey anchored her chin to keep it from trembling im sorry shes never mentioned you his smile thinned bitch always was a bitch you take right after her in some ways youre hurting me mr slater rich honey or better yet you call me daddy since were going to be family the idea of it had him hooting with laughter until tears filled his eyes one big happy family i bet that old icicles fuming over that did i mention i know your grandma i know her real well she must be foaming at the mouth at the idea of her hoitytoity granddaughter playing house with a son of mine she hated your mama you know hated her right down to the ground i know you know what i think he reached up pinched kelseys throbbing cheek hard enough to make her gasp i think you should fix us both a nice drink then well get to know each other all right when he stepped back kelsey eased out of the chair her eyes darted to the patio doors to the doorway that led to the foyer if she could get out of the room she was sure she could outrun him you dont want to try that honey he pinched her arm again his fingers digging down to the bone you dont want to theres brandy in the cabinet there napoleon well thats just fine and dandy he kept his hand on her arm and dragged her to it pour us both a couple of healthy swallows he was already drunk she thought frantically if she poured with a generousenough hand she might slip past his guard gabe said youve done a lot of traveling ive been here and there i like new places she smiled and handed him a snifter cheers she tapped her glass to his youre a cool one rich tossed back the brandy then let out a long pleased sigh thats one of the things that appealed to me most about your mother she was one long cool drink of water that naomi she never would give me a sip though let plenty of others drink great big gulps but she never let good old rich have one little sip maybe she will now i bet i can make her change her mind is she upstairs shes not home before the words were out kelsey was reeling back the blow had stars bursting in front of her eyes as she fell lying bitch with a thin smile rich drank more brandy coldeyed lying bitch just like your ma maybe youd rather i had a taste of you instead he laughed until his sides ached at the expression of animal terror on her face no no that wouldnt be proper poking in where my boys already been besides i prefer a more mature woman and naomi shes been around the track a time or two now hasnt she now maybe if your grandma had hired me instead of the cokesnorting bradley things would be different why dont we go ask naomi if shed like to give rich a try now stay away from her her head spun sickeningly as she lurched to her feet her vision was blurred where the blow had struck her eye ill kill you if you touch her yeah just like your ma kill a man for doing what comes natural we know all about you dizzy she leaned against the cabinet she just needed a minute she told herself to clear the pain from her head to get some feeling back in her watery legs gabes not here because he went for the police theyll be here any minute she teetered back nearly falling when he lifted his hand again you want to tell the truth to me honey pie or im going to spoil that pretty face of yours it is the truth we met charles rooney tonight he called after you came to his office he told us everything praying for time she began to list the details he believed her now she could see it in his face and what she saw there told her he could do worse a great deal worse than slap her again theyll find you here if you stay she continued theyll find you and theyll put you in prison the way they put my mother in prison you could probably still get away they might not catch you if you ran theyve got nothing on me nothing he took her untouched brandy and drank it down its all air and youre forgetting grandma no im not they put my mother away with lies itll be easy to put you away with the truth hed turn me in enraged rich tossed the snifter shattering the glass on the hearth in a parody of celebration my own flesh and blood would turn me in well have to make him sorry for that real sorry he lunged panic and youth had kelsey spinning to the side so that he caught nothing more than the sleeve of her blouse as the seam ripped she tore away making a dash for the doorway he caught her bringing her down in a lumbering tackle that radiated pain down to the bone panting out sobs she kicked out blindly landing a glancing blow off his shoulder another off his chest as she clawed her way inch by desperate inch over the rug he was going to kill her now she was sure of it beat her or choke her with those big bruising hands and when he was done hed go after naomi she screamed once when he yanked her head back by the hair light flashed in front of her eyes wheeled like comets fired by the hideous pain if she had found her voice she might have begged then pleaded and begged but the air was searing in and out of her throat gotcha dont i gotcha thought you were such a smart little bitch her fingers dug into the carpet reached then closed over an inchlong shard of crystal mindless with terror and pain she swung out then it was he who screamed rearing back the blood spurting out of his cheek where the delicate foreleg of the glass thoroughbred had pierced his flesh whimpering she dragged herself up and raced from the room in a panicked limping run while his curses chased after her she fell on the stairs fighting for breath struggling to clear enough of the fear from her mind so that she could think when she called out trying to warn her mother only little mewling sounds escaped with blood and fear stinging her mouth she clawed her way up gaining her feet and the top of the stairs just as she heard rich charging up behind her no she snatched a vase of lilies and hurled it down at him the crash and a grunt of pain bought her a few precious seconds wasted as she fumbled with bloody hands at the knob of her mothers bedroom door mom oh god mom with one blind burst of strength she shoved through the door and slammed it behind her mom get up she was weeping as she fought the lock with fingers gone numb with terror for gods sake get up in a lunge she was at the bed dragging naomi up by the shoulders shaking pleading wha groggy from the sleeping pill naomi pushed her daughters hand away annoyed what is it hes coming wake up we have to get out do you understand me whos coming naomi blinked open heavy eyes kelsey what is it hell kill us get out of bed goddammit she screamed again when rich hurled his weight against the door get out of bed breath coming in hot gasps she turned terrified eyes to the door its not going to hold sweet jesus it wont hold the gun do you still have the gun she babbled out little prayers as she clawed open the nightstand drawer it was there the chrome glinting in the moonlight what are you doing sleepy and dazed naomi managed to fight her way through the mists to kneel in bed good god kelsey what are you doing whos at the door but as the wood splintered kelsey stared straight ahead she held the gun in both hands struggling to keep it from slipping out of her shaking fingers he burst in blood glistening on his cheek and saw only naomi kneeling in the bed with the thin silk gown sliding from her shoulders his teeth flashed as he leaped forward kelsey felt the gun buck like a live thing sending vibrations singing up to her shoulders she never heard the shot alec the wooziness floated over naomis mind sliding images of past and present its not alec kelsey heard her own voice small with distance its gabes father ive killed gabes father slater half dreaming naomi crawled out of bed and as she had done so many years ago bent over a dead man mechanically she checked his pulse before straightening again rich slater confused she rubbed her hands over her eyes what in gods name is happening here i killed him kelsey dropped her arm the gun dangling from her fingers naomi looked up into her daughters face she recognized the shock the disbelief and the fear she forced her trembling legs to move forward sit down kelsey thats right sit down she eased her gently onto the side of the bed nothing mattered now nothing but kelsey let me have the gun okay naomi set it aside for the moment it would take no time at all to deal with it put your head between your legs now and breathe i cant i cant breathe yes you can slow and deep thats it honey as kelsey tried to obey naomi outlined her plan now im going to tell you what were going to do and i want you to listen very carefully and do exactly just exactly what i tell you understand he was going to kill me and you he would have killed us both but i killed him i dont remember pulling the trigger but i must have her teeth began to chatter because i shot him no i shot him look at me kelsey gently naomi lifted kelseys ravaged face oh god she shuddered dug her nails into her palms until the pain cleared some of the shock listen to me baby he broke in and he she brushed at a cut on kelseys cheek and he hurt you so i got the gun and i shot him no thats wrong i couldnt wake you up no no honey i woke up when you came in you came in here to get away from him then he broke down the door and i shot him im going to call the police now and thats exactly what were going to tell them i dont kelsey lifted a hand to her spinning head i dont she jerked around and screamed at the sound of feet pounding up the stairs jesus god gabe took one look at his father then stared at the two women huddled on the bed kelsey in one leap he was crouched in front of her holding her wounded hands he hurt you look at your face he jumped up his eyes hard deadly ill kill him myself i already have naomi said calmly gabe get her out of here take her to her room ill call the police im all right kelsey insisted but the room faded out as she pushed herself to her feet you just need to lie down gabe picked her up ill take care of you he looked back at naomi ill take care of her make her stay in there until ive finished this naomi lifted the bedside phone he was just there kelsey murmured shivering as gabe carried her to her room and laid her on the bed he was just there he broke the horse just lie still he wanted to hold her he wanted to crush something someone into dust instead he whipped the bedspread over her she was shaking badly her pupils contracted to pinpoints with shock and her face gabes hands balled helplessly at his sides her face was bruised and bleeding he couldnt think just then he couldnt allow himself to think that his own father had done that to her he went quickly into the bathroom dampened a washcloth and filled a cup with water here baby gently he curved an arm under her and brought the cup to her lips drink some of this he was downstairs her fingers fretted at the bedspread it wasnt channing the little horse was shattered and he was just there he kept smiling he kept hitting me and smiling the hand on the wet cloth clenched until the knuckles went white he wont hurt you anymore with fingers no more steady than hers he washed away the blood hold on to me kelsey no ones going to hurt you anymore i couldnt bluff shivering she curled against him she was cold so cold and he held the heat i tried but i was so scared and so angry and he knew and hed hit me again she turned her battered face into gabes throat he has such big hands and preferred to use them gabe thought grimly on women id have killed him for this he murmured killed him with my own hands for touching you it wasnt me suddenly she was so tired so horribly horribly tired it was you he wanted to hurt you i know he turned his head just enough to brush his lips over her brow then he eased her back on the pillows its over now she let her eyes close for a moment as the worst of the shock ebbed the pain crept back her body felt trampled you came blindly she groped for his hand found it yeah he looked down at their joined hands a hunch the trouble was i moved on it too late her eyes opened again fresh panic flashing naomi shes fine if youd been alone the thought of that had talons of fear clawing through his gut kelsey im going to give you an out right now an out though she wasnt sure she would like what she found she lifted a hand to probe at her throbbing face if i were fair id do the walking walking the heavy fog was lifting she could see him clearly now the strain that tightened his face the swirl of emotion in his eyes gabe she touched a hand to his cheek as if to brush some color and calm into it dont im all right now he battered your face he tore your clothes he terrified you deliberately he pried her clutching hand from his and rose he was my father it doesnt matter that ive worked all my life to rid myself of any part of him its blood and itll always be there ive got no place in your life kelsey the biggest favor i could do for you is to walk out of it with some effort she pushed herself up pain was singing in every bone now did i ask you for a damn favor she snapped out she winced as the scream of sirens sliced through the night and into her throbbing head if you want to do me one then get me a bottle of aspirin and keep your ridiculous grand gestures to yourself he nearly smiled im trying to be noble well youre no good at it and i dont like noble i like you she brushed her hair back eyed him narrowly do you think you can sneak out of this when im down we had a deal slater and youre not going to welsh i never welsh he sat on the edge of the bed again and placed his hands lightly on her shoulders and thats my last shot at nobility a hell of a hero i make anyway it should have been me who killed him kelsey she crossed a hand over her body to clasp his dont you couldnt know that he would be here that he would do this and still you came her brow furrowed why did you come it doesnt matter now but it should have been me it should have been me and not naomi who killed him kelsey drew back her face paling again it wasnt you she said slowly and it wasnt naomi i killed your father gabe naomi sipped the brandy slowly she was sitting in the kitchen the lights were very bright and hurt her eyes her hands were trembling but she could deal with it would deal with it all she could think was that her daughter was upstairs hurt terrorized and gertie sweet gertie was in an ambulance on her way to the hospital he must have come in this way she said hit gertie shell be all right wont she control slipped a notch and her lips trembled shes so small and shes so harmless the paramedics said she was lucid ms chadwick rossi kept his voice low the woman looked as though she would shatter into bits at any moment well check on her once theyve had time to get her to the hospital moses should have gone with her i should have made him go hes not going to leave you were having a hardenough time keeping him outside just tell me what happened naomi drew in a deep breath and began he got in the house i dont know how i was upstairs in bed sleeping a noise woke me before i could get up kelsey ran into my room she was terrified hysterical her face i could see where hed hit her she pressed a hand to her mouth shed slept through that slept while hed beaten her child then there was banging at the bedroom door as if someone were throwing himself against it i got the gun out of the drawer beside the bed when he broke in i shot him rossi watched her as she lifted her glass cupping her other hand over it to try to keep it steady as she drank you were in bed when you shot him ms chadwick yes no she set the glass down she had to be careful she had to be very careful i was in front of the window id gotten up it happened very fast you say a noise woke you but your daughter ran in before you could get up and see what it was yes why did they always repeat what she said theyd done that before she remembered it didnt matter what she said it never mattered have you been into the sitting room ms chadwick since you notified the police no she pressed her lips together if it was a trick she couldnt see it i didnt come down i stayed upstairs until you came youve got a hell of a mess in there blood broken furniture id say that much damage took some time to accomplish time enough for anyone to get out of bed and check things out i i was frightened should she tell him shed taken a sleeping pill yes no i stayed in my room because i was frightened with a phone right beside you and a gun in the drawer she looked up met his eyes he broke into my bedroom she said evenly and i shot him no she didnt kelsey stepped into the kitchen though she was grateful for the support of gabes arm she made herself move away from it she didnt kill anyone you shouldnt be down here panicked naomi pushed away from the table take her back upstairs gabe you can see shes hurt she clamped a desperate hand on rossis arm you can see shes hurt look what that bastard did to her look what he did to my child shes in shock she doesnt know what happened stop it kelsey stepped up to the table in the strong light her cuts and bruises stood out in stark relief against her pale skin im not going to let you do this it isnt necessary and it isnt right why dont you sit down ms byden rossi invited and tell me what happened no in a lunge naomi rounded the table and gripped kelseys arms listen to me kelsey youre hurt youre confused gabe will take you to the hospital and ill handle this no she shook her head moving in to draw naomi close mom no im not going to let you go through this i wont trembling now she hugged kelsey tight you dont know what its like it wont matter what you say it wont matter what happened theyll take you away kelsey please please listen to me it does matter kelsey murmured its not like before but it was naomi thought of course it was my fingerprints are on the gun stonefaced naomi turned back to rossi the gun was in my room he was killed in my room that should be enough for you naomi gabe said gently sit down you said youd take care of her she turned to him you said you would now make her go upstairs ms chadwick rossi studied her eyes theres a very simple test that will prove whether it was you or your daughter who discharged the weapon i dont give a damn about your tests youre not putting my daughter in a cell i think we can agree on that sit down please rossi added come on kelsey draped an arm over naomis shoulders theres nothing for you to worry about i promise would you like some brandy ms byden rossi asked when she was settled at the table kelsey looked down at the snifter and shuddered no ive lost my taste for it she drew a deep breath i heard glass breaking downstairs she began chapter thirty there was dew sparkling on the grass from her chair on the patio kelsey watched it gleam knowing the sun would soon be strong enough to burn it away down at the barn horses were being worked stalls cleaned troughs filled her body still ached enough to prevent her from resenting the fact that shed been banned from the routine for a week she glanced around as the door opened behind her and she smiled at her mother gertie shes feeling better shes fussing with a sigh naomi sat stretched out her legs she thought about pouring coffee from the pot kelsey had on the table but she felt entirely too lazy im using guilt to keep her in bed for another day or two if she gets up ill worry sneaky whatever works right now shes buying out the shopping channels how are you feeling im fine until i look in the mirror she grimaced over the last two days some of the bruises had faded but others had blossomed until i do it all seems almost like a dream i dont know if its just a stage im stuck in i know i killed a man but i cant seem to feel the horror of it dont try you did what you had to do to protect yourself and me naomi lifted her face to the sun i dont even remember him kelsey not really i suppose i saw him around the track now and then maybe even spoke to him but i dont really remember i keep thinking i should that it all should be vivid in my mind how can i not remember a man who had so much to do with the way my life turned out he never mattered to you and he knew it that was part of the anger that built up in him he found a way to make you pay and to make a profit she pushed the plate of croissants toward naomi sun spot naomi murmured god i loved that horse yes he certainly made me pay she grandmother used alec bradley for that for a lot of things and cunningham bill on a long breath naomi shook her head hes so much more of a fool than i guessed and what good did it do him kelsey then or now he didnt pay before but hell pay now the police the racing commission theyll see that cunningham pays for what he did to pride and to sun spot all those years ago no one ever put it together it might have ended there with the lies and the misery if gabe hadnt come back if he hadnt drawn an inside straight she smiled as naomi tore off a corner of a roll if he hadnt made himself into the man he is and if you hadnt fallen in love with him thats something that smooths away the worst of it kelsey when i think of what could have happened it didnt rich slater paid the price for his part in it and the case is closed selfdefense i suppose it was foolish of me to lie to the police she tossed the bite of roll aside he didnt believe me its ironic isnt it once i told the truth once i lied neither worked you were trying to protect me it was time to say it kelsey told herself and she hoped the full meaning would be understood you tried to protect me before when i was a child you were wrong both times and you were right both times no easy answers its taken me a long time to realize there isnt always only one she pressed her lips together before continuing im grateful for what youre doing for milicent no please dont stiffen up on me im grateful even though i cant resolve it in my heart even though its a lie im grateful what difference would it make now kelsey to have the whole story come out and destroy whats left of her life the birds were singing and the sound was comforting it wouldnt give me back those years it wouldnt change what happened to mick to pride to reno shes responsible for that for all of it shame and bitterness warred inside kelsey no matter that she couldnt have meant anyone to die shes responsible hiring other people to do what she considered necessary to protect the family name what name does she have now kelsey demanded what honor and thats what she has to live with i dont do this for her i know naomi lifted a brow its not entirely unselfish either i dont want to go through it to live through the press the police and i have the gift of knowing you believed me you believed in me enough to stick i wasnt the only one who believed you and everyone would know what happened with alec bradley what happened with pride and all the rest if the story came out i dont care about everyone naomi decided shed pour coffee after all i talked it over with moses last night and were agreed she smiled adding cream to her coffee when a woman has a man wholl stand by her through the worst the rest is easy naomi glanced over at the sound of a car pulling into the drive thats probably gabe it better be we were supposed to go over these menus for the reception over breakfast then id better leave you two alone to do it no why dont you stay that way you can agree with what ive already decided and give me the edge kelsey leaned forward took her mothers hand i love you emotions swirled up then settled beautifully i know kelsey rose and started across the patio to greet him her eyes widened as they shifted from gabes to her fathers then back again dad oh kelsey instinctively philip framed her face with his hands nothing gabe had told him had prepared him oh sweetheart im all right really it looks much worse than it is i was going to come see you in a couple of days when she looked more presentable she thought and shot gabe a telling look your young man was right to tell me the whole story the whole story he repeated staring into her eyes you left out a great many details when you phoned me kelsey another kind of lie she thought the sin of omission i thought it best i only wanted you to know i was all right before the papers reported it and i am all right so im told he looked back at gabe then his gaze shifted locked over kelseys shoulder she moved aside and stood between her parents dad wanted to see that i was all right she began of course he did naomi nodded and kept her hands at her sides hello philip naomi you look well so do you ah kelsey groped for some way to ease past the awkwardness channings down at the barn why dont you walk down with me dad youll get a kick out of seeing him work and he can show off for you she looked helplessly at gabe im sure youd like to talk with kelsey naomi said i was just on my way down to the barn myself ill tell channing youre here no i philip began then composed himself actually id like to speak with you if you have the time all right lets take a walk gabe murmured and grasped kelseys hand i dont know where to begin naomi gabe told me everything everything philip repeated heartsick he was kind enough to wait for me when i went to see her i had to see her he added before i came here i understand understand unbearably weary he slipped his fingers under his glasses and pressed them to his eyes i cant i cant understand all that she did all the pain she caused and when i confronted her she was unbending unshakable he said and dropped his hands she sees nothing that she did as anything but necessary men died but she feels no responsibility not to them not to you and that surprises you he winced she remains my mother naomi even knowing all i know ive thought of hundreds of ways to try to apologize and none of them begins to cover it what she did what i did he took off his glasses rubbed his eyes again then replaced them and the simple fact is i dont know what to say to you its over philip i let you down all those years ago i let you down no there was a time i thought that it helped but it wasnt really true i wasnt what you wanted me to be whatever shes done milicent wasnt responsible for that only for making sure you realized it she could have prevented you from going to prison yes and what she did now to you to kelsey his breath caught as the image of his daughters bruised face swam into his mind my god naomi she might have been killed she protected herself and me she studied him the pain in his eyes the baffled disbelief behind it i cant tell you not to feel what youre feeling now kelsey was hurt was forced to defend herself by taking a life and you and i will never forget it well never forget who started the chain of events maybe she said slowly thats enough punishment for milicent theres nothing i can do philips voice faltered broke nothing i can do to make up for it theres nothing you have to do despite everything kelsey has what she wants and so do i her lips curved softly i have everything i want the farm a man who loves me my daughter you did a wonderful job with her philip i always knew you would shes so like you he studied the woman who had been his wife so much had changed and so little good god naomi if i could go back do something anything you cant hed always been so fair she thought so honorable now he suffered because no amount of fairness no amount of honor could wipe away the pain we wanted things from each other that neither of us could give and we made mistakes mistakes we used against each other and that other people used against us we were both victims of someone elses needs philip you paid dearly for it ive gained too she loves me its just that simple just that marvelous so lets leave the rest where it belongs closed she drew a breath you know i always wondered how id feel if i saw you again i wondered too how do you feel naomi im glad to see you philip do you think we should leave them alone for so long yes i do to prove it gabe gave her a helpful nudge they have old business to settle but kelsey looked back over her shoulder they were still standing yards apart he looked so sad his worlds been shaken badly itll settle again maybe not quite in the same way but itll settle candace wont let him brood for long still she dragged her feet gabe what made you bring him here were closing the circle he said before we start our own i like the sound of that she tipped her head toward his shoulder youre awfully smart slater and sneaky too going behind my back to bring him here going to see him was my idea coming here was his he needs to make his peace with naomi he will she smiled to herself it was after all her personal fairy tale i love it here she murmured i love everything about here think of the champions well make gabe are we talking horses she shook her head and laughed up at him not only horses is that okay with you thats just fine with me he walked with her away from the barn from the crews toward the rising hills where mares grazed with their foals and horses raced their shadows next spring a foal will be born his dam from three willows his sire from longshot he turned her into his arms ill remember the day he was conceived how i looked at you and wanted you to belong to me and i do she linked her arms around his neck so whats next weve got a fresh deck he tapped his pocket anything can happen anything well she drew his mouth down to hers deal them
