 the adventures of tom bombadil old tom bombadil was a merry felow bright blue his jacket was and his bloots were yellow green were his girdle and his breeches all of leather he wore in his tall hat a swanwing feather he lived up under hill where the withywindle ran from a grassy well down into the dingle old tom in summertime walked about the meadows gathering the buttercups running after shadows tickling the bumblebees that buzzed among the flowers sitting by the waterside for hours upon hours there his beard dangled long down into the water up came goldberry the riverwomans daughter pulled

foresteaves he sat a while aiistening on the boughs piping birds were chirruping and whistling butterflies about his head went quivering and winking until grey clouds came up as the sun was sinking then tom hurried on rain began to shiver round rings spattering in the running river a wind blew shaken leaves chilly drops were dripping into a sheltering hole old tom went skipping out came badgerbrock with his snowy forehead and his dark blinking eyes in the hill he quarried with his wife and many sons by the coat they caught him pulled him inside their earth down their tunnels brought

bellows he woke in morninglight whistled like a starling sang come derrydol merrydol my darling he clapped on his battered hat boots and coat and feather opened the window wide to the sunny weather wise old bombadil he was a wary fellow bright blue his jacket was and his boots were yellow none ever caught old tom in upland or in dingle walking the forestpaths or by the withywindle or out on the lilypools in boat upon the water but one day tom he went and caught the river daughter in green gown flowing hair sitting in the rushes singing old watersongs to birds upon the bushes he caught her held her fast waterrats went scuttering reeds hissed herons cried and her heart was fluttering said tom bombadil heres my pretty maiden you shall come home with me the table is all laden yellow cream

wife brought tankards out for those that might be thirsty songs they had and merry tales the supping and the dancing goodman maggot there for all his belt was prancing tom did a hornpipe when he was not quaffing daughters did the springlering goodwife did the laughing when others went to bed in hay fern or feather close in the inglenook they laid their heads together old tom and muddyfeet swapping all the tidings from barrowdowns to tower hills of walkings and of ridings of wheatear and barleycorn of sowing and of reaping queer tales from bree and talk at smithy mill and cheaping rumours in whispering trees southwind in the larches tall watchers by the ford shadows on the marches old maggot slept at last in chair beside the embers ere dawn tom was gone as dreams one half remembers some merry some sad and some of hidden warning none heard the door unlocked a shower of rain at morning his footprints washed away at mithe he left no traces at haysend they heard no song nor sound of heavy paces three days his boat lay by the hythe at grindwall and then one mom was gone back up withywindle otterfolk hobbits said came by night and loosed her dragged her over weir and up stream they pushed her out from elvetisle old swan came sailing in beak took her painter up in the water trailing drew her proudly on otters swam beside her round old willowmans crooked roots to guide her the kings fisher perched on bow on thwart the wren was singing merrily the cockleboat homeward they were bringing to toms creek they came at last otterlad said whish now whats a coot without his legs or a unless fish now o sillysallowwillowstream the oars theyd left behind them long they lay at grindwall hythe for tom to come and find them errantry there was a merry passenger a messenger a mariner he built a gilded gondola to wander in and had in her a load of yellow oranges and porridge for his provender he perfumed her with marjoram and cardamom and lavender he called the winds of argosies with cargoes in to carry him across the rivers seventeen that lay between to tarry him he landed all in loneliness where stonily the pebbles on the running river derrilyn goes merrily for ever on he journeyed then through meadowlands to shadowland that dreary lay and under hill and over hill went roving still a weary way he sat and sang a melody his errantry atarrying he begged a pretty butterfly that fluttered by to marry him she scorned him and she scoffed at him she laughed at him unpitying so long he studied wizardry and sigaldry and smithying he wove a tissue airythin to snare her in to follow her he made him beetleleather wing and feather wing of swallowhair he caught her in bewilderment with filament of spiderthread he made her soft pavilions of lilies and a bridal bed of flowers and of thistledown to nestle down and rest her in and silken webs of filmy white and silver light he dressed her in he threaded gems in necklaces but recklessly she squandered them and fell to bitter quarrelling then sorrowing he wandered on and there he left her withering as shivering he fled away with windy weather following on swallowwing he sped away he passed the archipelagoes where yellow grows the marigold where countless silver fountains are and mountains are of fairygold he took to war and foraying aharrying beyond the sea and roaming over belmarie and thellamie and fantasie he made a shield and morion of coral and of ivory a sword he made of emerald and terrible his rivalry with elvenknights of aerie and faerie with paladins that goldenhaired and shiningeyed came riding by and challenged him of crystal was his habergeon his scabbard of chalcedony with silver tipped at plenilune his spear was hewn of ebony his javelins were of malachite and stalactitehe brandished them and went and fought the dragonflies of paradise and vanquished them he battled with the dumbledors the hummerhorns and honeybees and won the golden honeycomb and running home on sunny seas in ship of leaves and gossamer with blossom for a canopy he sat and sang and furbished up and burnished up his panoply he tarried for a little while in little isles that lonely lay and found there naught but blowing grass and so at last the only way he took and turned and coming home with honeycomb to memory his message came and errand too in derringdo and glamoury he had forgot them journeying and tourneying a wanderer so now he must depart again and start again bis gondola for ever still a messenger a passenger a tarrier aroving as a feather does a weatherdriven mariner little princess mee lovely was she as in elvensong is told she had pearls in hair all threaded fair of gossamer shot with gold was her kerchief made and a silver braid of stars about her throat of mothweb light all moonlitwhite she wore a woven coat and round her kirtle was bound a girdle sewn with diamond dew she walked by day under mantle grey and hood of clouded blue but she went by night all glittering bright under the starlit sky and her slippers frail of fishes mail flashed as she went by to her dancingpool and on mirror cool of windless water played as a mist of light in whirling flight a glint like glass she made wherever her feet of silver fleet flicked the dancingfloor she looked on high to the roofless sky and she looked to the shadowy shore then round she went and her eyes she bent and saw beneath her go a princess shee as fair as mee they were dancing toe to toe shee was as light as mee and as bright but shee was strange to tell hanging down with starry crown into a bottomless well her gleaming eyes in great surprise looked up to the eyes of mee a marvellous thing headdown to swing above a starry sea only their feet could ever meet for where the ways might lie to find a land where they do not stand but hang down in the sky no one could tell nor learn in spell in all the elvenlore so still on her own an elf alone dancing as before with pearls in hair and kirtle fair and slippers frail of fishes mail went mee of fishes mail and slippers frail and kirtle fair with pearls in hair went shee the man in the moon stayed up too late there is an inn a merry old inn benealh an old grey hill and there they brew a beer so brown that the man in the moon himself came down one night to drink his fill the ostler has a tipsy cat that plays a fivestringed fiddle and up and down he runs his bow now squeaking high now purring low now sawing in the middle the landlord keeps a littie dog that is mighty fond of jokes when theres good cheer among the guests he cocks an ear at all the jests and laughs unlit he choices they also keep a horned cow as proud as any queen but music turns her head like ale and makes her wave her tufted tail and dance upon the green and o the row of silver dishes and the store of silver spoons for sunday theres a special pair and these they polish up with care on saturday afternoons the man in the moon was drinking deep and the cat began to wail а dish and a spoon on the table danced тhе cow in the garden madly pranced and the little dog chased his tail the man in the moon took another mug and then rolled beneath his chair and there he dozed and dreamed of ale till in the sky the stars were pale and dawn was in the air the ostler said to his tipsy cat the white horses of the moon they neigh and champ their silver bits but their masters been and drowned his wits and the sunll be rising soon so the cat on his fiddle played heydiddlediddle a jig that would wake the dead he squeaked and sawed and quickened the tune while the landlord shook the man in the moon its after three he said they rolled ihe man slowly up the hill and bundled him into the moon while his horses galloped up in rear and the cow came capering like a deer and a dish ran up with a spoon now quicker the fiddle went deedledumdiddle the dog began to roar the cow and the horses stood on their heads the guests all bounded from their beds and danced upon the floor with a ping and a pong the fiddlestrings broke the cow jumped over the moon and the little dog laughed to see such fun and the saturday dish went off at a run with the silver sunday spoon the round moon rolled behind the hill as the sun raised up her head she hardly believed her fiery eyes for though it was day to her surprise they all went back to bed the man in the moon came down too soon the man in the moon had silver shoon it and his beard was of silver thread with opals crowned and pearls all bound about his girdlestead in his mantle grey he walked one day across a shining floor and with crystal key in secrecy he opened an ivory door n a filigree stair of glimmering hair then lightly down he went and merry was he at last to be free on a mad adventure bent in diamonds white he had lost delight he was tired of his minaret of tall moonstone that towered alone on a lunar mountain set hе would dare any peril for ruby and beryl to broider his pale attire for new diadems of lustrous gems emerald and sapphire so was lonely too with nothing to do but stare at the world of gold and heark to the hum that would distantly come as gaily round it rolled at plenilune in his argent moon in his heart he longed for fire fot the limpid lights of wan selenites for red was his desire for crimson and rose and emberglows for flame with burning tongue for the scarlet skies in a swift sunrise when a stormy day is young hed have seas of blues and the living hues of forest green and fen and he yearned for the mirth of the populous earth and the sanguine blood of men he coveted song and laughter long and viands hot and wine eating pearly cakes of light snowflakes and drinking thin moonshine he twinkled his feet as he thought of the meat of pepper and punch galore and he tripped unaware on his slanting stair and like a meteor a star in flight ere yule one night flickering down he fell from his laddery path to a foaming bath in the windy bay of bel he began to think lest he melt and sink what in the moon to do when a fishermans boat found him far afloat to the amazement of the crew caught in their net all shimmering wet in a phosphorescent sheen of bluey whites and opal lights and delicate liquid green against his wish with the morning fish they packed him back to land you had best get a bed in an inn they said the town is near at hand only the knell of one slow bell high in the seaward tower announced the news of his moonsick cruise not a hearth was laid not a breakfast made and dawn was cold and damp there were ashes for fire and for grass the mire for the sun a smoking lamp in a dim backstreet not a man did he meet no voice was raised in song there were snores instead for all folk were abed and still would slumber long he knocked as he passed on doors locked fast and called and cried in vain till he came to an inn that had light within and tapped at a windowpane a drowsy cook gave a surly look and what do you want said he i want fire and gold and songs of old and red wine flowing free you wont get them here said the cook with a leer but you may come inside silver i lack and silk to my back maybe ill let you bide a silver gift the latch to lift a pearl to pass the door for a seat by the cook in the inglenook it cost him twenty more for hunger or drouth naught passed his mouth till he gave both crown and cloak and all that he got in an earthen pot broken and black with smoke was porridge cold and two days old to eat with a wooden spoon for puddings of yule with plums poor fool he arrived so much too sooo an unwary guest on a lunatic quest from the mountains of the moon the stone troll troll sat alone on his seat of stone and munched and mumbled a bare old bone for many a year he had gnawed it near for meat was hard to come by done by gum by in a cave in the hills he dwelt alone and meat was hard to come by up came tom with his big boots on said he to troll pray what is yon for it looks like the shin o roy nuncle tim as should be alyin in graveyard caveyard paveyard this many a year has tim been gone and i thought he were lyin in graveyard my lad said troll this bone i stole but what be bones that lie in a hole thy nuncle was dead as a lump o lead afore i found his shinbone tinbone thinbone he can spare a share for a poor old troll for he dont need his shinbone said tom i dont see why the likes o thee

pins says troll and grins ill eat thee too and gnaw thy shins a bit o fresh meat will go down sweet ill try my teeth on thee now нее now see now im tired o gnawing old bones and skins ive a mind to dine on thee now but just as he thought his dinner was caught he found his hands had hold of naught before he could mind tom slipped behind and gave him the boot to larn him warn him darn him a bump o the boot on the seat tom thought would be the way to larn him but harder than stone is the flesh and bone of a troll that sits in the hills alone as well set your boot to the mountains root for the seat of a troll dont feel it peel it heal it old troll laughed when he heard tom groan and he knew his toes could feel it toms leg is game since home he came and his bootless foot is lasting lame but troll dont care and hes still there with the bone he boned from its owner doner boner trolls old seat is still the same and the bone he boned from its owner perrythewinkle the lonely troll he sat on a stone and saog a mournful lay why why must i live on my own in the hills of faraway my folk are gone beyond recall and take no thought of me alone im left the last of all from weathertop to the sea i steal no gold i drink no beer i eat no kind of meat but people slam their doors in fear whenever they hear my feet how i wish that they were neat and my hands were not so rough yet my heart is soft my smile is sweet and my cooking good enough come come he thought this will not do i must go and find a friend awalking soft ill wander through the shire from end to end down he went and he walked all night with his feet in boots of fur to delving he came in the morning light when folk were just astir he looked around and who did he meet but old mrs bunce and all with umbrella and basket walking the street and he smiled and stopped to call good morning maam good day to you i hope i find you well but she dropped umbrella and basket too and yelled a frightful yell old pott the mayor was strolling near when he heard that awful sound he turned all purple and pink with fear and dived down underground the lonely troll was hurt and sad dont go he gently said but old mrs bunce ran home like mad and hid beneath her bed the troll went on to the marketplace and peeped above the stalls the sheep went wild when they saw his face and the geese flew over the walls old farmer hogg he spilled his ale bill butcher threw a knife and grip his dog he turned his tail and ran to save his life the old troll sadly sat and wept outside the lockholes gate and perrythewinkle up he crept and patted him on the pate why do you weep you great big lump youre better outside than in he gave the troll a friendly thump and laughed to see him grin perrythewinkle boy he cried come youre the lad for me now if youre willing to take a ride ill carry you home to tea he jumped on his back and held on tight and off you go said he and the winkle had a feast that night there were pikelets there was buttered toast and jam and cream and cake and the winkle strove to eat the most though his buttons all should break the kettle sang the fire was hot the pot was large and brown and the winkle tried to drink the lot in tea though he should drown when full and tight were coat and skin they rested without speech till the old troll said ill now begin the bakers art to teach the making of beautiful cramsome bread of bannocks light and brown and then you can sleep on a heatherbed with pillows of owlets down young winkle whereve you been they said ive been to a fulsome tea and i feel so fat for i have fed on cramsome bread said he but where my lad in the shire was that or out in bree said they but winkle he up and answered flat i aint agoing to say but i know where said peeping jack i watched him ride away he went upon the old trolls back to the hills of faraway then all the people went with a will by pony cart or moke until they came to a house in a hill and saw a chimney smoke they hammered upon the old trolls door a beautiful cramsome cake bake for us please or two or more go home go home the old troll said i never invited you only on thursdays i bake my bread and only for a few go home go home theres some mistake my house is far too small and ive no pikelets cream or cake the winkle has eaten all you jack and hogg old bunce and pott i wish no more to see be off be off now all the lot the winkles the boy for me now perrythewinkle grew so fat through eating of cramsome bread his weskit bust and never a hat would sit upon his head for every thursday he went to tea and sat on the kitchen floor and smaller the old troll seemed to be as he grew more and more the winkle a baker great became as still is said in song from the sea to bree there went the fame of his bread both short and long but it werent so good as the cramsome bread no butter so rich and free as every thursday the old troll spread for perrythewinkles tea the mewlips the shadows where the mewlips dwell are dark and wet as ink and slow and softly rings their bell as in the slime you sink you sink into the slime who dare to knock upon their door while down the grinning gargoyles stare and noisome waters pour beside the rotting riverstrand the drooping willows weep and gloomily the gorcrows stand croaking in their sleep over the merlock mountains a long and weary way in a mouldy valley where the trees are grey by a dark pools borders without wind or tide moonless and sunless the mewlips hide the cellars where the mewlips sit are deep and dank and cold with single sickly candle lit and there they count their gold their walls are wet their ceilings drip their feet upon the floor go softly with a squishflapflip as they sidle to the door they peep out slyly through a crack their feeling fingers creep and when theyve finished in a sack your bones they lake to keep beyond the merlock mountains a long and lonely road through the spidershadows and the marsh of tode and through the wood of hanging trees and the gallowsweed you go to find the mewlips and the mewlips feed oliphaunt grey as a mouse big as a house nose like a snake i make the earth shake as i tramp through the grass trees crack as i pass with horns in my mouth i walk in the south flapping big ears beyond count of years i stump round and round never lie on the ground not even to die oliphaunt am i biggest of all huge old and tall if ever youd met me you wouldnt forget me if you never do you wont think im true but old oliphaunt am i and i never lie fastitocalon look there is fastitocalon an island good to land upon although tis rather bare come leave the sea and let us run or dance or lie down in the sun see gulls are sitting there beware gulls do not sink there they may sit or strut and prink their part it is to tip the wink if anyone should dare upon that isle to settle or only for a while to get relief from sickness or the wet or maybe boil a kettle ah foolish folk who land on him and little fires proceed to trim and hope perhaps for tea it may be that his shell is thick he seems to sleep but he is quick and floats now in the sea with guile and when he hears their tapping feet or faintly feels the sudden heat with smile he dives and promptly turning upsidedown he tips them off and deep they drown and lose their silly lives to their surprise be wise there are many monsters in the sea but none so perilous as he old horny fastitocalon whose mighty kindred all have gone the last of the old turtlefish so if to save your life you wish then i advise pay heed to sailors ancient lore set foot on no uncharted shore or better still your days at peace on middleearth in mirth fulfill the cat the fat cat on the mat may seem to dream of nice mice that suffice for him or cream but he free maybe walks in thought unbowed proud where loud roared and fought his kin lean and slim or deep in den in the east feasted on beasts and tender men the giant lion with iron claw in paw and huge ruthless tooth in gory jaw the paid darkstarred fleet upon feet that oft soft from aloft leaps on his meat where woods loom in gloom far now they be fierce and free and tamed is he but fat cat on the mat kept as a pet he does not forget shadowbride there was a man who dwelt alone as day and night went past he sat as still as carven stone and yet no shadow cast the white owls perched upon his head beneath the winter moon they wiped their beaks and thought him dead under the stars of june there came a lady clad in grey in the twilight shining one moment she would stand and stay her hair with flowers entwining he woke as had he sprung of stone and broke the spell that bound him he clasped her fast both flesh and bone and wrapped her shadow round him there never more she walks her ways by sun or moon or star she dwells below where neither days nor any nights there are but once a year when caverns yawn and hidden things awake they dance together then till dawn and a single shadow make the hoard when the moon was new and the sun young of silver and gold the gods sung in the green grass they silver spilled and the white waters they with gold filled ere the pit was dug or hell yawned ere dwarf was bred or dragon spawned there were elves of old and strong spells under green hills in hollow dells they sang as they wrought many fair things and the bright crowns of the elfkings but their doom fell and their song waned by iron hewn and by steel chained greed that sang not nor with mouth smiled in dark holes their wealth piled graven silver and carven gold over elvenhome the shadow rolled there was an old dwarf in a dark cave to silver and gold his fingers clave with hammer and tongs and anvilstone he worked his hands to the hard bone and coins he made and strings of rings and thought to buy the power of kings but his eyes grew dim and his ears dull and the skin yellow on his old skull through his bony claw with a pale sheen the stony jewels slipped unseen no feet he heard though the earth quaked when the young dragon his thirst slaked and the stream smoked at his dark door the flames hissed on the dank floor and he died alone in the red fire his bones were ashes in the hot mire there was an old dragon under grey stone his red eyes blinked as he lay alone his joy was dead and his youth spent he was knobbed and wrinkled and his limbs bent in the long years to his gold chained in his hearts furnace the fire waned to his bellys slime gems stuck thick silver and gold he would snuff and lick he knew the place of the least ring beneath the shadow of his black wing of thieves he thought on his hard bed and dreamed that on their flesh he fed their bones crushed and their blood drank his ears drooped and his breath sank mailrings rang he heard them not a voice echoed in his deep grot a young warrior with a bright sword called him forth to defend his hoard his teeth were knives and of horn his hide but iron tore him and his flame died there was an old king on a high throne his white beard lay on knees of bone his mouth savoured neither meat nor drink nor his ears song he could only think of his huge chest with carven lid where pale gems and gold lay hid in secret treasury in the dark ground its strong doors were ironbound the swords of his thanes were dull with rust his glory fallen his rule unjust his halls hollow and his bowers cold but king he was of elvish gold he heard not the horns in the mountainpass he smelt not the blood on the trodden grass but his halls were burned his kingdom lost in a cold pit his bones were tossed there is an old hoard in a dark rock forgotten behind doors none can unlock that grim gate no man can pass on the mound grows the green grass there sheep feed and the larks soar and the wind blows from the seashore the old hoard the night shall keep while earth waits and the elves sleep the seabell i walked by the sea and there came to me as a starbeam on the wet sand a white shell like a seabell trembling it lay in my wet hand in my fingers shaken i heard waken a ding within by a harbour bar a buoy swinging a call ringing over endless seas faint now and far then i saw a boat silently float on the nighttide empty and grey it is later than late why do we wait i leapt in and cried bear me away it bore me away wetted with spray wrapped in a mist wound in a sleep to a forgotten strand in a strange land in the twilight beyond the deep i heard a seabell swing in the swell dinging dinging and the breakers roar on the hidden teeth of a perilous reef and at last i came to a long shore white it glimmered and the sea simmered with starmirrors in a silver net cliffs of stone pale as ruelbone in the moonfoam were gleaming wet glittering sand slid through my hand dust of pearl and jewelgrist trumpels of opal roses of coral flutes of green and amethyst but under cliffeaves there were glooming caves weedcurtained dark and grey a cold air stirred in my hair and the light waned as i hurried away down from a hill ran a green rill its water i drank to my hearts ease up its fountainstair to a country fair of evereve i came far from the seas climbing into meadows of fluttering shadows flowers lay there like fallen stars and on a blue pool glassy and cool like floating moons the nenuphars alders were sleeping and willows weeping by a slow river of rippling weeds gladdonswords guarded the fords and green spears and arrowreeds there was echo of song all the evening long down in the valley many a thing running to and fro hares white as snow voles out of holes moths on the wing with lanterneyes in quiet surprise brocks were staring out of dark doors i heard dancing there music in the air feet going quick on the green floors but whenever i came it was ever the same the feet fled and all was still never a greeting only the fleeting pipes voices horns on the hill of riverleaves and the rushsheaves i made me a mantle of jewelgreen a tall wand to hold and a flag of gold my eyes shone like the starsheen with flowers crowned i stood on a mound and shrill as a call at cockcrow proudly i cried why do you hide why do none speak wherever i go here now i stand king of this land with gladdonsword and reedmace answer my call come forth all speak to me words show me a face black came a cloud as a nightshroud like a dark mole groping i went to the ground falling on my hands crawling with eyes blind and my back bent i crept to a wood silent it stood in its dead leaves bare were its boughs there must i sit wandering in wit while owls snored in their hotlow house for a year and a day there must i stay beetles were tapping in the rotten trees spiders were weaving in the mould heaving puffballs loomed about my knees at last there came light in my long night and i saw my hair hanging grey bent though i be i must find the sea i have lost myself and i know not the way but let me be gone then i stumbled on like a hunting bat shadow was over me in my ears dinned a withering wind and with ragged briars i tried to cover me my hands were torn and my knees worn and years were heavy upon my back when the rain in my face took a salt taste and i smelled the smell of seawrack birds came sailing mewing wailing i heard voices in cold caves seals barking and rocks snarling and in spoutholes the gulping of waves winter came fast into a mist i passed to lands end my years i bore snow was in the air ice in my hair darkness was lying on the last shore there still afloat waited the boat in the tide lifting its prow tossing weary i lay as it bore me away the waves climbing the seas crossing passing old hulls clustered with gulls and great ships laden with light coming to haven dark as a raven silent as snow deep in the night houses were shuttered wind round them muttered roads were empty i sat by a door and where drizzling rain poured down a drain i cast away all that i bore in my clutching hand some grains of sand and a seashell silent and dead never will my ear that bell hear never my feet that shore tread never again as in sad lane in blind alley and in long street ragged i walk to myself i talk for still they speak not men that i meet the last ship firiel looked out at three oclock the grey night was going far away a golden cock clear and shrill was crowing the trees were dark and the dawn pale waking birds were cheeping a wind moved cool and frail through dim leaves creeping she watched the gleam at window grow till the long light was shimmering on land and leaf on grass below grey dew was glimmering over the floor her white feet crept down the stair they twinkled through the grass they dancing stepped all with dew besprinkled her gown had jewels upon its hem as she ran down to the river and leaned upon a willowstem and watched the water quiver a kingfisher plunged down like a stone in a blue flash falling bending reeds were softly blown lilyleaves were sprawling a sudden music to her came as she stood there gleaming with free hair in the mornings flame on her shoulders streaming flutes there were and harps were wrung and there was sound of singing like windvoices keen and young and far bells ringing a ship with golden beak and oar and timbers white came gliding swans went sailing on before her tall prow guiding fair folk out of elvenland in silvergrey were rowing and three with crowns she saw there stand with bright hair flowing with harp in hand they sang their song to the slow oars swinging green is the land the leaves are long and the birds are singing many a day with dawn of gold this earth will lighten many a flower will yet unfold ere the cornfields whiten then whither go ye boatmen fair down the river gliding to twilight and to secret lair in the great forest hiding to northern isles and shores of stone on strong swans flying by cold waves to dwell alone with the white gulls crying nay they answered far away on the last road faring leaving western havens grey the seas of shadow daring we go back to elvenhome where the white tree is growing and the star shines upon the foam on the last shore flowing to mortal fields say farewell middleearth forsaking in elvenhome a clear bell in the high tower is shaking here grass fades and leaves fall and sun and moon wither and we have heard the far call that bids us journey thither the oars were stayed they turned aside do you hear the call earthmaiden firiel firiel they cried our ship is not fullladen one more only we may bear come for your days are speeding come earthmaiden elvenfair our last call heeding firiel looked from the riverbank one step daring then deep in clay her feet sank and she halted staring slowly the elvenship went by whispering through the water i cannot come they heard her cry i was born earths daughter no jewels bright her gown bore as she walked back from the meadow under roof and dark door under the houseshadow she donned her smock of russet brown her long hair braided and to her work came stepping down soon the sunlight faded year still after year flows down the seven rivers cloud passes sunlight glows reed and willow quivers at morn and eve but never more westward ships have waded in mortal waters as before and their song has faded
