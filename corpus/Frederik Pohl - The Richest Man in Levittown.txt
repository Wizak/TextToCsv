the richest man in levittown margery tried putting the phone back on the hook but it immediately rang again she kicked the stand picked up the phone and said hang up will you we dont want any she slammed the phone down to break the connection and took it off the hook again the doorbell rang my turn i said and put down the paperit looked as though i never would find out what the national league standings were it was patrolman gamelsfelder man to see you mr binns says its important he was sweatingyou could see the black patches on his blue shirt i knew what he was thinking we had air conditioning and money and he was risking his life day after day for a lousy policemans pay and what kind of a country was this anyhow hed said as much that afternoon it might be important to him but i dont want to see anybody sorry officer i closed the door margery said are you or are you not going to help me change the baby i said cheerfully ill be glad to dear and it was truebesides being good policy to say that since she was pretty close to exploding it was true because i wanted something to do myself i wanted some nice simple demanding task like holding a oneyearold down with my knee in the middle of his chest while one hand held his feet and the other one pinned the diaper i mean it was nice of uncle otto to leave me the money but did they have to put it in the paper the doorbell rang again as i was finishing margery was upstairs with gwennie who took a lot of calming down because shed had an exciting day and because she always did so i stood the baby on his fat little feet and answered the door myself it was the policeman again some telegrams for you mr binns i wouldnt let the boy deliver them thanks i tossed them in the drawer of the telephone stand what was the use of opening them they were from people who had heard about uncle otto and the money and who wanted to sell me something that fellows still here patrolman gamelsfelder said sourly i think hes sick too bad i tried to close the door anyway he says to tell cuddles that tinker is here i grabbed the door tell cud thats what he said gamelsfelder saw that that hit me and it pleased him for the first time he smiled whatwhats his name winston mcneely mcghee said officer gamelsfelder happily or anyway thats what he told me mr binns i said send the son of a send the fellow in i said and jumped to get the baby away from the ashtray where margery had left a cigarette burning winnie mcgheeit was all i needed to finish off my day he came in holding his head as though it weighed a thousand pounds he was never what youd call healthylooking even when margery stood me up at the altar in order to elope with him it was his frail poetic charm and maybe he still had that and maybe he didnt but the way he looked to me he was sick all right he looked like he weighed a fast hundred pounds not counting the head the head looked like a balloon he moaned hello harlan age thirtyone fiveeleven one seventythree you got an acetylsalicylic acid tablet i said what but he didnt get a chance to answer right away because there was a flutter and a scurry from the expansion attic and margery appeared at the head of the stairs i thought she began wildly and then she saw that her wildest thought was true you she betrayed pure panicfussing with her hair with one hand and smoothing her bermuda shorts with the other simultaneously trying to wiggle nohands out of the sloppy old kitchen apron that had been good enough for me mcghee said pallidly hello please dont you have an acetylsalicylic acid tablet i dont know what it is i said simply margery chuckled ruefully ah harlan harlan she said with fond tolerance beaming lovingly at me as she came down the stairs it was enough to turn the stomach of a cat you forget winnie harlan doesnt know much chemistry wont you find him an aspirin harlan thats all he wants thanks said winnie with a grateful sigh massaging his temples i went and got him an aspirin i thought of adding a little mixer to the glass of water that went with it but there wasnt anything in the medicine chest that looked right and besides its against the law i dont mind admitting it i never liked winnie mcghee and it isnt just because he swiped my bride from me well she smartened up after six months and then when she turned up with an annulment and sincere repentancewell ive never regretted marrying her or anyway not much but you cant expect me to like mcghee my heavens if id never seen the man before id hate his little purple guts on first contact because he looks like a poet and talks like a scientist and acts like a jerk i started back to the living room and yelled the baby margery turned away from simpering at her former husband and sprang for the puppys dish she got it away from the baby but not quite full there was a good babysized mouthful of mixed milk and dogbiscuit that she had to excavate for and naturally the baby had his way of counterattacking for that no bite she yelled pulling her finger out of his mouth and putting it in hers then she smiled sweetly isnt he a darling winnie hes got his daddys nose of course but dont you think he has my eyes hell have your fingers too if you dont keep them out of his mouth i told her winnie said thats normal after all with twentyfour paired chromosomes forming the gamete it is perfectly obvious that the probability of inheriting none of his traits from one parentthat is being exactly like the otheris one chance in ooh my head margery gave him a small frown what he was like a woundup phonograph thats without allowance for spontaneous mutation he added or induced and considering the environmental factors in uterothat is broadspectrum antibiotics tripling of the background radiation count due to nuclear weapons dietary influences et ceterayes i should put the probability of induced mutation rather high yes perhaps of the order of i interrupted heres your aspirin now what do you want harlan margery said warningly i meanwell what do you want he leaned his head on his hands i want you to help me conquer the world he said crashsplash go get a mop margery ordered the baby had just spilled the puppys water she glared at me and smiled at winnie go ahead she coaxed take your nice aspirin and well talk about your trip around the world later but that hadnt been what he had said conquer the world i heard it plain as day i went to fetch the mop because that was as good a way as any to think over what to do about winston mcneely mcghee i mean what did i want with the world uncle otto had already bequeathed me the world or anyway as much of it as i ever hoped to own when i came back winnie was tottering around the room followed at a respectful distance by my wife holding the baby she was saying to the prospective conqueror of all the world how did you hear about harlans good lu about the tragic loss of his dear uncle i mean he groaned i read it in the paper he fiddled aimlessly with the phone its all for the best i say said margery in a philosophic tone carving damp grahamcracker crumbs out of the babys ear dear otto lived a rich and full life think of all those years in yemen and the enormous satisfaction it must have given him to be personally responsible for the installation of the largest petroleumcracking still west of the suez east my dear east the mutawakelite kingdom lies just south of saudi arabia she looked at him thoughtfully but all she said was winnie youve changed and so he had but for that matter so had she it was not like margery to be a hypocrite simpering over her exhusband i could understandit wasnt so bad she was merely showing the poor guy how very much better off she was than she ever would have been with him but the tragic loss of my dear uncle had never occasioned a moments regret in heror in me the plain fact of the matter is that until the man from the associated press called up she didnt even know i had an uncle otto and i had pretty nearly forgotten it myself otto was the brother that my mothers family didnt talk about how were they to know that he was laying up treasures of oil and gold on the arabian peninsula the phone rang winnie had thoughtlessly put it back on the hook no margery cried into it hardly listening we dont want any uranium stock weve got closets full i said taking advantage of the fact that her attention was diverted winnie im a busy man how about you telling me what you want he sat down with his head on his hands and made a great effort itsdifficult he said speaking very slowly each word came out by itself as though he had to choose and sort painfully among all the words that were rushing to his mouth iinvented something you understand and when i heard about you inheriting money you thought you could get some of it away from me i sneered no he sat up sharplyand winced and clutched his head i want to make money for you weve got closets full i said gently he said in a desperate tone but i can give you the world harlan trust me i never have trust me now you dont understand harlan we can own the world the two of us if youll just give me a little financial help ive invented a drug that gives me total recall how nice for you i said reaching for the knob of the door but then i began to think total recall i asked he said sputtering with eagerness the upwelling of the unconscious the ability to remember everythingthe eidetic memory of an idiot savant and the indexing system of a quiz winner you want to know the first six kings of england egbert etheiwulf ethelbald ethelbert ethelred and alfred you want to know the mating call of a ruffnecked grouse he demonstrated the call of the ruffnecked grouse oh said margery coming back into the room with the freshly diapered baby bird imitations and more cried winnie do you know about the time the united states had two presidents no but march the third he said eighteen seventyseven rutherford b hayesid better say rutherford birchard hayeswas about to succeed grant and he was sworn in a day early i ought to explain that no i said dont explain well how about this want me to name the abc bowling champions from to date clack nitschke hewitt vidro brokaw gagliardi andersonoh wait a minute i forgot thats warren then gagliardi anderson danek winnie i said cut it out will you this has been a tough day but this is the key to conquering the world hah i said youre going to bore everybody to death by naming bowling champions knowledge is power harlan he rested his head on his palms briefly but it does make my head ache i took my hand off the knob of the door i said grudgingly sit down winnie i admit youve got me interested i cant wait to hear what the swindle is harlan warned margery winnie said theres no swindle i promise you but think what it can mean knowledge is power harlan as i say why with my superbrain we can outwit the rulers of any country anywhere we can own the world andmoney you say knowledge is money too for instance he winkedworried about taxes i can tell you the minority opinion in u s govt v oosterhagen alabama theres a loophole there you could drive an armored truck through margery sat down with a cigarette in the long long holder id bought her to square a beef the year after we were married she looked at me and then at the cigarette and it penetrated and i raced over with a match thank you darling she said throatily she had changed herself as well as the baby she now wore something more suitable for a coheiress of a big fat hunk of money entertaining an exhusband it was a gold lamй housecoat and she had bought it within an hour of the time the associated press man had called on a charge account wed never owned until the early editions of the papers hit the stores around levittown and that reminded me money who needed money what was the use of inheriting all that loot from uncle otto if i couldnt throw winnie out on his ear politeness made me temporize all this is very interesting winnie but harlan the baby margery yelled get him out of the pretzels i did while winnie said faintly behind me the shape of a pretzel represents childrens arms folded in prayeror so it was thought in the seventh century a good pretzel bender can bend more than thirtyfive a minute of course machines are faster i said winnie like to know the etymology of the word navy most people think it has something to do with sailors winnie listen to me it doesnt though it comes from the laborers on the inland navigation canalseighteenthcentury england you know well the laborers i said firmly winnie go away harlan you stay out of this margery i told her winnies after my dough thats all well i havent had it long enough to want to throw it away besides who wants to rule the world well margery said thoughtfully with all our money i cried who needs it winnie clutched his head oh he moaned wait harlan all i need is a stake ive got the longterm cycles of every stock on the exchange down in my headsplits and dividends and earnings records since nineteen ought four i know the private brokers hand signals on the curbwave up for buy wave down for sell look see how my fingers are bent that means the spread between bid and asked is threeeighths of a point give me a million dollars harlan no just a million thats all you can spare it and ill double it in a week quadruple it in a monthin a year well have a billion a billion dollars i shook my head the taxes remember u s govt v oosterhagen he cried and thats a bare beginning ever think what a billion dollars could do in the hands of a supergenius he was talking faster and faster a perfect diarrhea of words as though he couldnt control the spouting here he yelled clutching at his temple with one hand pulling something out of his pocket with the other look at this harlan its yours for a million dollarsno for a hundred thousand yes a hundred thousand dollars and you can have it ill sell it for that and then i wont split with youwell both be supergeniuses eh fair enough i was trapped by my own curiosity what is it i asked he waved it at mea squat little bottle halffilled with pale capsules mine he said proudly my hormone its a synapserelaxer one of these and the blocks between adjoining cells in your brain are weakened for an hour three of them for every twenty pounds of body weight and youre a supergenius for life youll never forget youll remember things you think have passed out of your recollection years ago youll recall the postpartum slap that started you breathing youll remember the name of the nurse who carried you to the door of your fathers maxwell oh harlan there is simply no limit to go away i said and pushed him patrolman gamelsfelder appeared like a genie from a lamp thought so he said somberly advancing on winnie mcghee extortions your game is it cant say i blame you brother but its a trip to the station house and a talk with the sergeant for you just get rid of him i said and closed the door as winnie was challenging the cop to name an opera by krenek other than johnny spielt auf margery put the baby down breathing hard she said scuffling and pushing people around and bad manners you werent like this when we were married harlan theres something come over you since you inherited that money i said help me pick these things up will you i hadnt pushed him hard but all the same those pills had gone flying margery stamped her foot and burst into tears i know how you feel about poor winnie she sobbed but its just that im sorry for him couldnt you at least be polite couldnt you at least have given him a couple of lousy hundred thousand dollars watch the baby i warned her at the head of the stairs gwennie appeared attracted by the noise rubbing her eyes with her fists and beginning to cry margery glared at me started to speak was speechless turned her back and hurried up to comfort gwennie i began to feel the least little bit ashamed of myself i stood up patting the baby absentmindedly on the head looking up the stairs at the female half of our household i had been when you stopped to think of it something of a clunk item i had been rough on poor old winnie suppose it had been i who discovered the hormone and needed a few lousy hundred thousand as margery put it so well as a stake in order to grasp undreamedof wealth and power well why not why shouldnt i have given it to him the poor fellow was evidently suffering the effects of the hormone wearing off as much as from any hangover i could have been more kind yes and item margery did have a tough time with the kids and all and on this day of all days she was likely to be excited and item i had just inherited a bloody mint why wasnt ithe thought came to me with sudden appalling clarityusing some of uncle ottos money to make life easier for all of us i galloped up the steps two at a time margery i cried margery im sorry i think you should she began and then looked up from gwennie and saw my face i said look honey lets start over im sorry about poor winnie but forget him huh were rich lets start living as though we were rich lets go out just the two of usits early yet well grab a cab and go into new yorkall the way by cab why not well eat at the colony and see my fair lady from the fifth row on the aisleyou can get quite good seats they tell me for a hundred bucks or so why not margery looked up at me and suddenly smiled but she patted gwennies head the kids what about them get a babysitter i cried mrs schroopll be glad of the work but its such short notice margery i said we dont inherit a fortune every night call her up margery stood up holding gwennie beginning to smile why she said that sounds like fun harlan why not as you say onlydo you remember mrs schroops number its written down i told her no that was on the old directory she frowned youve told it to me a thousand times it isnt listed in her own nameits her soninlaw oh what is that number a thin voice from down the stairs said ovington eight zero zero fourteen its listed under sturgis arthur r number fortyone universe avenue margery looked at me and i looked at margery i said sharply who the devil said that i did daddy said the owner of the voice all of twentyeight inches tall appearing at the foot of the steps he had to use one hand to steady himself because he didnt walk so very well in the other hand he held the squat glass bottle that winnie mcghee had dropped the bottle was empty well we dont live in levittown any moreof course margery and gwennie and i have tried everythingchanging our name dyeing our hair even plastic surgery once it didnt work so we had the same surgeon change us back people keep recognizing us what we mostly do now is cruise up and down the coast of the usji in our yacht inside the twelvemile limit when we need supplies we send some of the crew in with the motor launch thats risky yes but it isnt as risky as landing in any other country would be and we just dont want to go back to jias theyve taken to calling it these days you cant blame us how would you like it i wish hed leave us alone the way it goes we just cruise up and down and every once in a while he remembers us and calls up on the shiptoshore he called yesterday matter of fact he said you cant stay out there forever daddy your main engines are due for a refit after eleven months seven days of running and youve been gone ten months six what are you using for dairy products the load you shipped in jacksonville must have run out last thursday week there isnt any point in your starving yourself besides its not fair to gwennie and mom come home well make a place for you in the government thanks i said but no thanks youll be sorry he warned pleasantly enough and he hung up well we should have kept him out of those pills i guess it was my fault i should have listened when old winnie heaven rest his soul wherever he issaid that the lifetime dose was three tablets for every twenty pounds of body weight the baby only weighed twentyfour pounds thenlast time wed taken him to the pediatrician naturally we couldnt take him again after he swallowed the pills and he mustve swallowed at least a dozen but i guess winnie was right at the very least the world is well on its way to being conquered now the united states fell to juvens imperator as he calls himself in eighteen months after his sensational coup on the question and his later success in cornering soybean futures and the common stock of united states steel the rest of the world is just a matter of time and not very much time at that and dont they just know it though thats why we darent land abroad but who would have thought it i mean i watched his inauguration last october on the television the country has had some pretty peculiar people running it no doubt but did you ever think youd live to see the oath of office administered to my little boy with one hand upraised and the thumb of the other in his mouth
