 chapter one ancksunamun thebes egypt bc thebes was the city of imhotep the high priest of the dead it was also the city of ancksunamun ancksunamun was the pharaohs lover but she loved imhotep imhotep walked into her bedroom and took the beautiful woman in his arms my love for you is more important than life he said outside the bedroom door imhoteps priests watched but when pharaoh seti the first of egypt walked in they couldnt stop him imhotep quickly ran into the next room pharaoh seti heard something but he didnt see him who was here seti asked ancksunamun i know somebody was here in your bedroom and then the pharaoh looked into the next room imhotep he said my high priest ancksunamun looked at imhotep they had to kill the pharaoh before the pharaoh and his soldiers killed them ancksunamun took her knife and pushed it hard into the pharaohs back the pharaohs eyes opened wide then imhotep took the pharaohs sword and killed him they heard something outside the pharaohs soldiers the medjai were there but imhoteps priests came in first they took the pharaohs sword from imhoteps hand come with us the priests said to him quick they pulled him away from his lover no said imhotep i will stay with ancksunamun please go said ancksunamun please live they will kill me but you can bring me back to life only you the high priest can do it the priests took imhotep with them the pharaohs soldiers ran in ancksunamun didnt say goodbye to imhotep there wasnt time she took the pharaohs sword and pushed it into her heart imhotep saw her die the pharaohs soldiers found ancksunamuns knife in the pharaohs back but they didnt find imhotep in her room so imhotep the high priest had to send his lover the killer of the pharaoh to the underworld imhotep had to mummify ancksunamun first he cut out her heart he put it in a gold box then he read from the gold book of amun ra the book of amun ra sent the bad people of this world to the underworld a dark place with no hope they all watched her go the medjai the people of egypt and the priests only the priests with their white cats werent afraid nobody could hurt the priests when their white cats were with them but imhotep could bring his lover back back from the underworld back from the dead the book of the dead could bring ancksunamun back this black book was in the statue of the god anubis it was anubiss book a book for gods not for men but for his lover for ancksunamun imhotep didnt listen to gods the statue of anubis was at hamunaptra the city of the dead egypts gold was there too late at night imhotep took his dead lover ancksunamun there he also took her heart in its gold box he went across the desert to hamunaptra on horseback with his priests there were ten soldiers at the statue of anubis but imhotep was the high priest so the soldiers helped him they carried dead ancksunamun imhotep and his priests found the book of the dead and they took it to an underground room a room of the dead the soldiers followed when imhotep began to read from the book of the dead ancksunamuns heart moved in its gold box there was life in it again then ancksunamun opened her eyes nothing can stop me now thought imhotep but he was wrong the medjai from thebes ran into the underground room with swords in their hands they stopped imhotep they broke the box with ancksunamuns heart in it and ancksunamun died again the medjai mummified imhoteps twentyone priests and imhotep had to watch they made the ten soldiers from hamunaptra into mummies too they put them all into the ground before they were dead but for imhotep there was something worse than that first they cut out his eyes with knives then they put him into the ground a mummy before he was dead but that wasnt the worst thing they put scarabs on imhoteps face the scarabs ran into his mouth and nose and started to eat him this was horn dai or halflife the scarabs will eat him for all time said the medjai imhotep is halfdead and he will be halfdead for all time nobody can bring him and ancksunamun back to the world of the living or he will make everybody in the world his mummies and the scarabs will fly again and eat us all it will be the end of the world so we the medjai will stay here and watch imhotep first us and then our sons and then the sons of our sons nothing is more important than that the medjai looked down at imhotep the scarabs started to eat him he could never get out or could he chapter two oconnell and evelyn years later hamunaptra most of hamunaptra is under the desert only one or two houses stand in seti the firsts great city of the dead and in those houses some soldiers are fighting for france they are fighting with hundreds of desert horsemen again and again the horsemen came out of the desert with the sun on their backs they had guns and they shot at the soldiers one of the men was a better fighter than the other soldiers this man wasnt french he was american and his name was rick oconnell next to him was beni a hungarian beni was oconnells friend sometimes when he wanted something why are you here oconnell said to beni and he shot again i took some gold from a temple said beni with a smile and you why are you a soldier did you kill somebody no said oconnell but im thinking about it and he shot another horseman from his horse no tell me beni said why are you here in the desert i want to have a good time said oconnell the horsemen were now very close oconnell shot then he shouted and shot again theres only you and me beni shouted oconnell but beni didnt answer he wasnt there four horsemen were almost on top of oconnell he ran he saw beni in front of a temple the hungarian went in and started to close the temple door dont close that door oconnell shouted at beni but beni closed it in his face and oconnell couldnt open it im going to get you for this oconnell shouted at beni through the closed door but first there were four desert horsemen with guns in his face he had a problem ok shouted oconnell im ready the four of you fight me but the four horsemen didnt fight their horses went up on their back feet their ears went back and their eyes opened they threw the four horsemen to the ground and ran away the horsemen followed them why oconnell thought i dont understand he turned around there behind him was an old statue it was the god anubis why did the horsemen run from a statue but suddenly he was afraid too a wind came across the desert the yellow ground moved with the wind and under it there was a big face it was the face of the high priest imhotep oconnell ran away from hamunaptra but there were eyes on his back in the hot desert he knew that he could feel them he turned and looked up there high up on a mountain were the medjai evelyn carnahan was a quiet uninteresting woman people thought and she worked in a quiet place it was a place full of very old books the cairo museum evelyn put a book on the top shelf she saw something up there and she was angry she was angry because the name of the book started with the letter t why was it on that shelf the other books on the shelf started with s evelyn took the book from the top shelf but she fell and the books fell with her the bookshelf fell and hit another bookshelf then that bookshelf hit the shelf behind it in two minutes all the old books in the museum from az were on the floor evelyn fell on the floor with them the curator of the museum walked in oh said evelyn she wasnt very happy look at this shouted the curator what are you doing why did we give you a job here oh be quiet evelyn thought she said you gave me a job here because i know everything about the pharaohs i understand the old languages and i can read these books i evelyn stopped she felt very angry and very british but she didnt want to lose this job she liked living in cairo the curator said some more angry words and then left evelyn got up and started to put the books on the shelves again somebody spoke i am the undead it said evelyn looked behind a shelf and saw a mummy she screamed and then the mummy started to laugh hello baby sister it said her brother jonathan put his head up then he came out from behind the mummy jonathan he was more than thirty years old and a baby jonathan go and put that mummy back ah but i have something for you said her brother oh no jonathan often found things from the time of the pharaohs and brought them to his intelligent sister but when people in the museum looked at them they werent really old ok said evelyn what is it this time it was a box and the box had egyptian writing on it evelyn looked at it she opened the box carefully and took out a key and a map jonathan she said this is very important evelyn and jonathan took the box to the museums curator the curator looked at it see said evelyn its from the time of seti the first maybe said the curator the curator wasnt excited evelyn couldnt understand that did the curator know something about the box who was seti the first asked jonathan was he rich the richest of the pharaohs answered evelyn jonathan liked this answer the curator looked at the map this map is more than years old said evelyn she knew a lot about the pharaohs and she wanted the curator to forget the books on the floor the writing tells us that its a map of hamunaptra the curator was afraid of the name hamunaptra but he turned away from evelyn so she didnt see his face my dear girl said the curator there are a lot of stories about hamunaptra is this hamunaptra city of the dead asked jonathan he and evelyn had an egyptian mother they listened to stories about hamunaptra when they were children yes evelyn answered hamunaptra city of the dead the pharaohs put their gold there the curator had the map in his hands it was above a candle on his desk he moved his hands down no shouted jonathan he pulled the map away from the candle and put out the fire with his hand some of the map was black now you couldnt see the city of the dead why did you do that asked jonathan it wasnt really an old map said the curator didnt you know that miss carnahan thats very stupid of you but it was an old map and it showed hamunaptra evelyn knew that she took the key from the curator quickly before he threw that away she could ask other people about the map but where did jonathan get it outside the curators office she asked her brother that question where did i get it oh i took it from a man in a bar he was an american his name was rick oconnell evelyn and jonathan went to the bar evelyn wasnt happy about that she didnt usually go to bars and this was a very dirty bar the american rick oconnell was there he was always there all day every day he was dirty and he was ready for a fight dont i know you oconnell said to jonathan i saw you somewhere and whos your little girlfriend very nice shes my sister said jonathan little little i am evelyn wasnt anybodys little girlfriend but she didnt say that she wanted to leave but this man knew about the map and the key only oconnell had the answers to her questions we er found this box she began you want to know about hamunaptra said oconnell evelyns eyes opened this american wasnt stupid how do you know that the box is from hamunaptra because i found it in hamunaptra i was there suddenly oconnell remembered jonathan you took my box he said and he hit jonathan in the face jonathan fell on the floor tell me about hamunaptra said evelyn i hit your brother said oconnell hes on the floor and you want to know about hamunaptra oh hes ok said evelyn hes often on the floor

curators office but they didnt go in so they didnt see the man in the curators office the man in the office knew the curator he knew oconnell too he was high on a mountain when oconnell ran away into the desert his name was ardeth bay and he was the head of the medjai the curator was in the medjai too miss carnahan wants to go to hamunaptra said the curator stop her said ardeth bay stop her or kill her chapter three the book of the dead the sun was at her back the wind was in her hair evelyn wanted to laugh and cry at the same time she loved the desert and the idea of hamunaptra was exciting she and jonathan were near the temple now their horses were very tired then they saw a man outside the temple oh no said evelyn the man said can i help you down from that horse oconnell thats me what are you doing here she wanted to be angry with oconnell but he looked cleaner now and maybe he could help them hes here for the gold said jonathan oconnell smiled oh i only want to have a good time he said and he looked into evelyns eyes more people arrived outside the temple there were three americans and a lot of egyptian diggers with them was beni you came back oconnell said to beni beni laughed you too outside the temple there were a lot of thin horses one of the americans daniels asked where did these horses come from theyre waiting said beni sometimes people find hamunaptra but they all die their horses wait for them but then they die too beni the americans and their diggers looked for a way down under the desert to the gold jonathan walked around the houses but then he found the top of the statue of anubis most of the statue was under the desert he evelyn and oconnell started to dig down and down into the desert they found a dark room under the ground and they got in through a wall were the first people in this room for more than years said evelyn for her this was wonderful its dark and cold down here said oconnell he wasnt very excited wheres the gold said jonathan you boys dont understand thought evelyn we find the wonderful world of the pharaohs and im with them then they lit a candle in the room oh my god said evelyn its a sahnetjer its a what asked oconnell the priests made mummies in this room jonathan told him the dead went to the afterlife from here said evelyn oconnell didnt like that he took out his gun they walked through the dark from room to room some of the rooms were very small sometimes their candle almost went out and left them in the dark then they heard something evelyn looked at oconnell oconnell had his gun in front of him and he walked slowly in the dark he saw the bottom of the statue of anubis under the ground then he heard something again from the back of the statue it came closer and closer three people came at him the americans they had guns in their hands we want to look here said burns one of the americans he looked around him he wore thick glasses no we want to look here said oconnell this is our statue

were wild he wanted to kill oconnell evelyn put her hand over oconnells gun lets be nice children she said and play nicely she pulled oconnell away and jonathan followed the americans and beni laughed we can dig in other places evelyn told oconnell evelyn walked down under the statue of anubis and jonathan and oconnell followed evelyn wanted to dig under the statue before the americans got into the statue from above they stood under the statue and jonathan and oconnell started to dig into it above them the americans and their diggers started to dig into the top of the statue then they heard horses and guns stay here shouted oconnell he got his gun and ran up to the americans evelyn and jonathan followed him oconnell saw beni the americans and the diggers shooting around them were ardeth bay and the medjai with their guns oconnell ran to beni and started shooting at the medjai oh not again said beni do you like fighting no but i look good when i do said oconnell and he shot a medjai soldier evelyn had a gun in her hand for the first time she shot at the medjai too stop shouted ardeth bay the medjai stopped shooting everybody stopped shooting it was quiet leave this place said the head of the medjai leave this place or die ardeth bay left and the other medjai soldiers followed him theres gold here said daniels when it was quiet again those soldiers were here for the gold no said oconnell theyre desert people water is important to them not gold but theres something more important than water or gold down here oconnell jonathan and evelyn went back down to the bottom of the statue the americans and their diggers started to dig again at the top they got into the statue and the diggers found a big box there was egyptian writing on the box beni read it dont open this he told the other men the americans laughed seti the first wasnt stupid said beni the diggers can open the box im out of here beni knew egypt he understood the countrys language and its gods he was afraid and he ran open the box burns said to the diggers the diggers were afraid but they opened the box then they screamed scarabs ran out of the box the scarabs ran into the diggers feet up their legs up and up and into their brains then the scarabs ate their brains the diggers stopped screaming the americans were afraid but they took the gold from the box beni came back into the room what did that writing on the box say asked henderson it said open this and you die at the bottom of the statue jonathan was asleep evelyn and oconnell stopped digging and sat on the floor in the dark they were very tired oconnell lit a fire and looked into evelyns eyes evelyn put her face close to his im going to kiss you mr oconnell she said no youre not said oconnell im not ok you can but call me rick not mr oconnell evelyn smiled and put her face closer to his rick she said and closed her eyes rick and then she was asleep oconnell smiled that was nice maam he said the next morning they got into the top of the statue of anubis inside there was a coffin look evelyn said to jonathan theres no writing on this coffin so the dead man in here isnt going to the afterlife hes staying in this world he did something very very bad jonathan took out the key and put it in the coffin the coffin halfopened oconnell pulled the coffin open and a yearold mummy stood up oconnell evelyn and jonathan screamed then the mummy fell back in its coffin imhotep wasnt dead but he wasnt of this world he was undead he wanted life above them the americans looked in the box they wanted gold but they found only a book henderson took it out its an old black book he said be careful with that said beni its the book of the dead i dont want a book shouted daniels he was angry and he kicked the box the box broke and a smaller gold box fell out thats better said daniels and he took the box with ancksunamuns heart in it that evening evelyn jonathan and oconnell walked up to the top of the statue again they sat around a fire with the americans beni was asleep with the book of the dead next to him evelyn tried not to take it but it was impossible she had to look at it she took it and opened it the second person in
