chapter one christmas holidays it was the last week of the christmas term and all the girls at gaylands school were looking forward to the christmas holidays anne sat down at the breakfasttable and picked up aletter addressed to her hallo look at this she said to her cousin georgina who was sitting beside her a letter from daddy and i only had one from him and mummy yesterday i hope its not bad news said george she would not allow anyone to call her georgina and now even the mistresses called her george she really was very like a boy with her short curly hair and her boyish ways she looked anxiously at anne as her cousin read the letter oh george we cant go home for the holidays said anne with tears in her eyes mummys got scarlet fever and daddy is in quarantine for it so they cant have us back isnt it just too bad oh i am sorry said george she was just as disappointed for herself as for anne because annes mother had invited george and her dog timothy to stay for the christinas holidays with them she had been promised many things she had never seen before the pantomime and the circus and a big party with a fine christmas tree now it wouldnt happen whatever will the two boys say said anne thinking of julian and dick her two brothers they wont be able to go home either well what are you going to do for the holidays then asked george wont you come and stay at kirriii cottage with me im sure my mother would love to have you again we had such fun when you came to stay for the summer holls wait a minute let me finish the letter and see what daddy says said anne picking up the note again poor mummy i do hope she isnt feeling very ill she read a few more lines and then gave such a delighted exclamation that george and the other girls waited impatiently for her to explain george we are to come to you again but oh blow blow blow weve got to have a tutor for the holls partly to look after us so that your mother doesnt have too much bother with us and partly because both julian and dick have been ill with flu twice this term and have got behind in their work a tutor how sickening that means ill have to do lessons too ill bet said george in dismay when my mother and father see my report i guess theyll find out how little i know after all this is the first time ive ever been to a proper school and there are heaps of things i dont know what horrid holls theyll be if we have a tutor running after us all the time said anne gloomily i expect ill have quite a good report because ive done well in the exams but it wont be any fun for me not doing lessons with you three in the holls though of course i could go off with timothy i suppose he wont be doing lessons yes he will said george at once she could not bear the idea of her beloved dog timothy going off each morning with anne whilst she george sat and worked hard with julian and dick timothy cant do lessons dont be silly george said anne he can sit under my feet whilst im doing them said george it will be a great help to feel him there for goodness sake eat up your sausages anne weve all nearly finished the bell will go in a minute and you wont have had any breakfast i am glad mummy isnt very bad said anne hurriedly finishing her letter daddy says hes written to dick and julian and to your father to ask him to engage a tutor for us oh dash this is an awful disappointment isnt it i dont mean i shant enjoy going to kirrin cottage again and seeing kirrin island but after all there are no pantomimes or circuses or parties to look forward to at kirrin the end of the term came quickly anne and george packed up their trunks and put on the labels enjoying the noise and excitement of the last two days the big school coaches rolled up to the door and the girls clambered in off to kirrin again said anne come on timothy darling you can sit between me and george gaylands school allowed the children to keep their own pets and timothy georges big mongrel dog had been a great success except for the time when he had run after the dustman and dragged the dustbin away from him all the way up the school grounds and into georges classroom he had really behaved extremely well im sure youll have a good report tim said george giving the dog a hug were going home again will you like that woof said tim in his deep voice he stood up wagging his tail and there was a squeal from the seat behind george make tim sit down hes wagging my hat off it was not very long before the two girls and timothy were in london being put into the train for kirrin i do wish the boys broke up today too sighed anne then we could all have gone down to kirrin together that would have been fun julian and dick broke up the next day and were to join the girls then at kirrin cottage anne was very much looking forward to seeing them again a term was a long time to be away from one another she had been glad to have her cousin george with her the three of them had stayed with george in the summer and had had some exciting adventuies together on the little island off the coast an old castle stood on the island and in the dungeons the children had made all kinds of wonderful discoveries it will be lovely to go across to kirrin island again george said anne as the train sped off towards the west we shant be able to said george the sea is terribly rough round the island in the winter it would be too dangerous to try and row there oh what a pity said anne disappointed i was looking forward to some more adventures there there wont be any adventures at kirrin in the winter said george its cold down there and when it snows we sometimes get frozen up completely cant even walk to the village because the seawind blows the snowdrifts so high oooh that sounds rather exciting said anne well it isnt really said george its awfully boring nothing to do but sit at home all day or turn out with a spade and dig the snow away it was a long time before the train reached the little station that served kirrin but at last it was there steaming in slowly and stopping at the tiny platform the two girls jumped out eagerly and looked to see if anyone had met them yes there was georges mother hallo george darling hallo anne said georges mother and gave both children a hug anne im so sorry about your mother but shes getting on all right youll be glad to know oh good said anne its nice of you to have us aunt fanny well try and be good what about uncle quentin will he mind having four children in the house in the wintertime we wont be able to go out and leave him in peace as often as we did in the summer georges father was a scientist a very clever man but rather frightening he had little patience with children and the four of them had felt very much afraid of him at times in the summer oh your uncle is still woiking very hard at his book said aunt fanny you know he has been working out a secret theory a secret idea and putting it all into his book he says that once it is all explained and finished he is to take it to some high authority and then his idea will be used for the good of the country oh aunt fanny it does sound exciting said anne whats the secret i cant tell you that silly child said her aunt laughing why even i myself dont know it come along now its cold standing heie timothy looks very fat and well george dear oh mother hes had a marvellous time at school said george he really has he chewed up the cooks old slippers and he chased the cat that lives in the stables every time he saw her said anne and he once got into the larder and ate a whole steak pie said george and once good gracious george i should think the school will refuse to have timothy next term said her mother in horror wasnt he well punished i hope he was no he wasnt said george going rather red you see mother we are responsible for our pets and their behaviour ourselves so if ever timothy does anything bad im punished for it because i havent shut him up properly or something like that well you must have had quite a lot of punishments then said her mother as she drove the little ponytrap along the frosty roads i really think thats rather a good idea there was a twinkle in her eyes as she spoke t christmas holidays think ill keep on with the same idea punish you every time timothy misbehaves himself the girls laughed they felt happy and excited holidays were fun going back to kirrin was lovely tomorrow the boys would come and then christmas would betheie good old kirrin cottage said anne as they came in sight of the pretty old house oh look theres kirrin island the two looked out to sea where the old ruined castle stood on the little island of kirrin what adventures they had had there in the summer the girls went into the house quentin called geoiges mother quentin the girls are here uncle quentin came out of his study at the other side of the house anne thought he looked taller and darker than ever and frowmer she said to herself uncle quentin might be very clever but anne preferred someone jolly and smiling like her own father she shook hands with her uncle politely and watched george kiss him well said uncle quentin to anne i hear ive got to get a tutor for you at least for the two boys my word you will have to behave yourself with a tutor i can tell you this was meant to be a joke but it didnt sound very nice to anne and george people you had to behave well with were usually very strict and tiresome both girls were glad when georges father had gone back into his study your father has been woiking far too hard lately said georges mother to her he is tired out thank goodness his book is nearly finished he had hoped to finish it by christmas so that he could join in the fun and games but now he says he cant what a pity said anne politely though secretly she thought it was a good thing it wouldnt be much fun having uncle quentin to play charades and things like that oh aunt fanny im so looking forward to seeing julian and dick and wont they be pleased to see tim and george aunt fanny nobody calls george georgina at school not even our form mistress i was rather hoping they would because i wanted to see what would happen when she refused to answer to georgina george you liked school didnt you yes said george did i thought id hate being with a lot of others but its fun after all but mother you wont find my report very good im afraid there were such a lot of things i was bad at because id never done them before well youd never been to school before said her mother ill explain it to your father if he gets upset now go along and get ready for a late tea you must be very hungry the girls went upstairs to their little room im glad im not spending my holls by myself said george ive had much more fun since ive known you and the boys hie timothy where have you gone hes gone to smell all round the house to make sure its his proper homesaid anne with a giggle he wants to know if the kitchen smells the same and the bathroom and his basket it must be just as exciting for him to come home for the holls as it is for us anne was right timothy was thrilled to be back again he ran round georges mother sniffing at her legs in friendliness pleased to see her again he ran into the kitchen but soon came out again because someone new was there joanna the cook a fat panting person who eyed him with suspicion you can come into this kitchen once a day for your dinner said joanna and thats all im not having meat and sausages and chicken disappearing under my nose if i can help it i know what dogs are i do timothy ran into the scullery and sniffed round there he ran into the diningroom and the sittingroom and was pleased to find they had the same old smell he put his nose to the door of the study where georges father worked and sniffed very cautiously he didnt mean to go in timothy was just as wary of georges father as the others were he ran upstairs to the girls bedroom again where was his basket ah there it was by the windowseat good that meant he was to sleep in the girls bedroom once more he curled himself up in his basket and thumped loudly with his tail glad to be back said his tail glad to be back chapter two all together again the next day the boys came back anne and george went to meet them with timothy george drove the ponytrap and tim sat beside her anne could hardly wait for the train to stop at the station she ran along the platform looking for julian and dick in the carriages that passed then she saw them they were looking out of a window at the back of the train waving and yelling anne anne here we are hallo george oh theres timothy julian dick yelled anne timothy began to bark and leap about it was most exciting oh julian its lovely to see you both again cried anne giving her two brothers a hug each timothy leapt up and licked them both he was beside himself with joy now he had all the children around him that he loved the three children and the dog stood happily together all talking at once whilst the porter got the luggage out of the train anne suddenly remembered george she looked round her she was nowhere to be seen although she had come on the station platform with anne wheres old george said julian i saw her here when i waved out of the window she must have gone back to the ponytrap said anne tell the porter to bring your trunks out to the trap julian come along well go and find george george was standing by the pony holding his head she looked rather gloomy anne thought the boys went up to her hallo george old thing cried julian and gave her a hug dick did the same whats up asked anne wondering at georges sudden silence i believe george felt leftcut said julian with a grin funny old georgina dont call me georgina said the little girl fiercely the boys laughed ah its the same fierce old george all right said dick and he gave the girl a friendly slap on the shoulder oh george its good to see you again do you remember our marvellous adventures in the summer george felt her awkwardness slipping away from her she had felt leftout when she had seen the great welcome that the two boys gave to their small sister but no one could sulk for long with julian and dick they just wouldnt let anyone feel leftout or awkward or sulky the four children climbed into the trap the porter heaved in the two trunks there was only just room for them timothy sat on top of the trunks his tail wagging nineteen to the dozen and his tongue hanging out because he was panting with delight you two girls were lucky to be able to take tim to school with you said dick patting the big dog lovingly no pets are allowed at our school awfully hard on those fellows who like live things thompson minor kept white mice said julian and one day they escaped and met matron round a corner of the passage she squealed the place down the girls laughed the boys always had funny tales to tell when they got home and kennedy keeps snails said dick you know snails sleep for the winter but kennedy kept his in far too warm a place and they all crawled out of their box and went up the walls you should have heard how we laughed when the geography master asked thompson to point out cape town on the map and there was one of the snails in the very place everyone laughed again it was so good to be all together once more they were very much of an age julian was twelve george and dick were eleven and anne was ten holidays and christmas time were in front of them no wonder they laughed at everything even the silliest little joke its good that mummy is getting on all right isnt it said dick as the pony went along the road at a spanking trot t was disappointed not to go home i must say did want to go to see aladdin and the lamp and the circus but still its good to be back at kirrin cottage again i wish we could have some more exciting adventures not a hope of that this time though theres one snag about these holls said julian and thats the tutor i hear weve got to have one because dick and i missed so much school this term and weve got to take scholarship exams next summer yes said anne i wonder what hell be like i do hope he will be a sport uncle quentin is going to choose one today julian and dick made faces at one another they felt sure that any tutor chosen by uncle quentin would be anything but a sport uncle quentins idea of a tutor would be somebody strict and gloomy and forbidding never mind he wouldnt come for a day or two and he might be fun the boys cheered up and pulled timothys thick coat the dog pretended to growl and bite he wasnt worried about tutors lucky timothy they all arrived at kirrin cottage the boys were really pleased to see their aunt and rather relieved when she said that their uncle had not yet come back hes gone to see two or three men who have answered the advertisement for a tutor she said he wont be long before hes back mother i havent got to do lessons in the holls too have i asked george nothing had yet been said to her about this and she longed to know oh yes george said her mother your father has seen your report and although it isnt really a bad one and we certainly didnt expect a marvellous one still it does show that you are behind your age in some things a little extra coaching will soon help you along george looked gloomy she had expected this but it was tiresome all the same annes the only one who wont have to do lessons she said til do some too promised anne perhaps not always george if its a very fine day for instance but sometimes just to keep you company thanks said george but you neednt i shall have timmy georges mother looked doubtful about this well have to see what the tutor says about that she said mother if the tutor says i cant have timothy in the room i jolly well wont do holiday lessons began george fiercely her mother laughed well well heres our fierce hottempered george again she said go along you two boys and wash your hands and do your hair you seem to have collected all the smuts on the railway the children and timothy went upstairs it was such fun to be five again they always counted tim as one of themselves he went everywhere with them and really seemed to understand every single word they said i wonder what sort of a tutor uncle quentin will choose said dick as he scrubbed his nails if only he would choose the right kind someone jolly and full of fun who knows that holiday lessons are sickening to have and tries to make up for them by being a sport out of lessontime i suppose well have to work every morning hurry up i want my tea said julian come on down dick well know about the tutor soon enough p they all went down together and sat round the table joanna the cook had made a lovely lot of buns and a great big cake there was not much left of either by the time the four children had finished uncle quentin returned just as they were finishing he seemed rather pleased with himself he shook hands with the two boys and asked them if they had had a good term did you get a tutor uncle quentin asked anne who could see that everyone was simply bursting to know this ah yes i did said her uncle he sat down whilst aunt fanny poured him out a cup of tea i interviewed three applicants and had almost chosen the last one when another fellow came in all in a hurry said he had only just seen the advertisement and hoped he wasnt too late did you choose him asked dick i did said his uncle he seemed a most intelligent fellow even knew about me and my work and he had the most wonderful letters of recommendation i dont think the children need to know all these details murmured aunt fanny anyway you asked him to come oh yes said uncle quentin hes a good bit older than the others they were rather young fellows this one seems very responsible and intelligent im sure youll like him fanny hell fit in here very well i feel i would like to have him to talk to me sometimes in the evening the children couldnt help feeling that the new tutor sounded rather alarming their uncle smiled at the gloomy faces youll like mr roland he said he knows how to handle youngsters knows hes got to be very firm and to see that you know a good bit more at the end of the holidays than you did at the beginning this sounded even more alarming all four children wished heartily that aunt fanny had been to choose the tutor and not uncle quentin when is he coming asked george tomorrow said her father you can all go to meet him at the station that will be a nice welcome for him we had thought of taking the bus and going to do a bit of christmas shopping said julian seeing anne looked very disappointed oh no you must certainly go and meet mr roland said his uncle i told him you would and mind you you four no nonsense with him youve to do as youre told and you must work hard with him because your father is paying very high fees for his coaching im paying a third because i want him to coach george a little too so george you must do your best ill try said george if hes nice ill do my very best youll do your best whether you think him nice or not said her father frowning he will arrive by the tenthirty train be sure to be there in time i do hope he wont be too strict said dick that evening when the five of them were alone for a minute or two its going to spoil the holls if we have someone down on us all the time and i do hope hell like timothy george looked up at once like timothy she said of couise hell like timothy how couldnt he well your father didnt like timothy very much last summer said dick t dont see how anyone could dislike darling tim but there are people who dont like dogs you know george if mr roland doesnt like timothy ill not do a single thing for him said george not one single thing shes gone all fierce again said dick with a laugh my word the sparks will fly if mr roland dares to dislike our timothy chapter three the new tutor next morning the sun was out all the seamist that had hung about for the last two days had disappeared and kirrin island showed plainly at the mouth of kirrin bay the children stared longingly at the ruined castle on it i do wish we could get over to the castle said dick it looks quite calm enough george its very rough by the island said george it always is at this time of year i know mother wouldnt let us go its a lovely island and its all our own said anne you said you would share it with us for ever and ever didnt you george yes i did said george and so i will dungeons and all come on we must get the trap out we shall be late meeting the train if we stand here all day looking at the island they got the pony and trap and set off down the hard lanes kirrin island disappeared behind the cliffs as they turned inland to the station did all this land round abojit belong to your family once upon a time asked julian yes all of it said george now we dont own anything except kirrin island our ovn house and that farm away over there kirrin farm she pointed with her whip the children saw a fine old farmhouse standing on a hill a good way off over the heatherclad common who lives there asked julian oh an old farmer and his wife said george they were nice to me when i was smaller well go over there one day if you like mother says they dont make the farm pay any more and in the summertime they take in people who want a holiday hark thats the train whistling in the tunnel said julian suddenly buck up for goodness sake george we shant be there in time the four children and timothy looked at the train coming out of the tunnel and drawing in at the station the pony cantered along swiftly they would be just in time whos going on to the platform to meet him asked george as they drew into the little station yard tm not i must look after tim and the pony i dont want to said anne til stay with george well wed better go then said julian and he and dick leapt out of the trap they ran on to the platform just as the train pulled up not many people got out a woman clambered out with a basket a young man leapt out whistling the son of the baker in the village an old man climbed down with difficulty the tutor could be none of those then right at the front of the train rather a queerlooking man got out he was short and burly and he had a beard rather like a sailor his eyes were piercingly blue and his thick hair was sprinkled with grey he glanced up and down trie platiorm and then beckoned to the porter that must be mr roland said julian to dick come on lets ask him theres no one else it could be the boys went up to the bearded man julian raised his cap politely are you mr roland sir he asked i am said the man i suppose you are julian and dick yes sir answered the boys together we brought the ponytrap for your luggage oh fine said mr roland his bright blue eyes looked the boys up and down and he smiled julian and dick liked him he seemed sensible and jolly are the other two here as well said mr roland walking down the platform with the porter trailing behind with his luggage yes george and anne are outside with the trap said julian george and anne said mr roland in a puzzled voice i thought the others were girls i didnt know there was a third boy oh george is a girl said dick with a laugh her real name is georgina and a very nice name too said mr roland george doesnt think so said julian she wont answer if shes called georgina youd better call her george sir really said mr roland in rather a chilly tone julian took a glance at him not quite so jolly as he looks thought the boy tims out there too said dick oh ana is i im a ooy or a gin inquired ivir noiana cautiously a dog sir said dick with a grin mr roland seemed rather takenaback a dog he said i didnt know there was a dog in the household your uncle said nothing to me about a dog dont you like dogs asked julian in surprise no said mr roland shortly but i daresay your dog wont worry me much hallo hallo so here are the little girls how do you do george was not very pleased at being called a little girl for one thing she hated to be spoken of as little and for another thing she always tried to be a boy she held out her hand to mr roland and said nothing anne smiled at him and mr roland thought she was much the nicer of the two tim shake hands with mr roland said julian to timothy this was one of tims really good tricks he could hold out his right paw in a very polite manner mr roland looked down at the big dog and tim looked back at him then very slowly and deliberately timothy turned his back on mr roland and climbed up into the ponytrap usually he put out his paw at once when told to and the children stared at him in amazement timothy whats come over you cried dick tim put his ears down and did not move he doesnt like you said george looking at mr roland thats very queer he usually likes people but perhaps you dont like dogs no i dont as a matter of fact said mr roland i was once very badly bitten as a boy and somehow or other ive never managed to like dogs since but i daresay your tim will take to me sooner or later they all got into the trap it was a tight squeeze timothy looked at mr rolands ankles as if he would rather like to nibble them anne laughed tim is behaving queerly she said its a good thing you havent come to teach him mr roland she smiled up at the tutor and he smiled back showing very white teeth his eyes were as brilliant a blue as georges anne liked him he joked with the boys as they drove him and both of them began to feel that their uncle quentin hadnt made such a bad choice after all only george said nothing she sensed that the tutor disliked timothy and george was not prepared to like anyone who didnt take to timothy at first sight she thought it was very queer too that tim would not shake paws with the tutor hes a clever dog she thought he knows mr roland doesnt like him so he wont shake hands i dont blame you tim darling i wouldnt shake hands with anyone who didnt lite me mr roland was shown up to his room when he arrived aunt fanny came down and spoke to the children well he seems very nice and jolly though its funny to see a youngish man with a beard youngish exclaimed julian why hes awfully old must be forty at the very least aunt fanny laughed does he seem so old to you she said well old or not hell be quite nice to you im sure aunt fanny we shant begin lessons until after christmas shall we asked julian anxiously of course you will said his aunt it is almost a week till christmas you dont suppose we have asked mr roland to come and do nothing till christmas is over do you the children groaned we wanted to do some christmas shopping said anne well you can do that in the afternoons said her aunt you will only do lessons in the morning for three hours that wont hurt any of you the new tutor came downstairs at that moment and aunt fanny took him to see uncle quentin she came out after a while looking very pleased mr roland will be nice company for your uncle she said to julian i think they will get on very well together mr roland seems to understand quite a bit about your uncles work lets hope he spends most of his time with him then said george in a low voice come on out for a walk said dick its so fine today we shant have lessons this morning shall we aunt fanny oh no said his aunt youll begin tomorrow go for a walk now all of you we shant often get sunny days like this lets go over to kirrin farm said julian it looks such a nice place show us the way george right said george she whistled to timothy and he came bounding up the five of them set off together going down the lane and then on to a rough road over the common that led to the farm on the distant hill it was lovely walking in the december sun their feet rang on the frosty path and tims blunt claws made quite a noise as he pattered up and down overjoyed at being with his four friends again after a good long walk across the common the children came to the farmhouse it was built of white stone and stood strong and lovely on the hillside george opened the farmgate and went into the farmyard she kept her hand on tims collar for there were two farmdogs somewhere about someone clattered round the barn near by it was an old man and george hailed him loudly hallo mr sanders how are you why if it isnt master george said the old fellow with a grin george grinned too she loved being called master instead of miss these are my cousins shouted george she turned to the others hes deaf she said youll have to shout to make him hear tm julian said julian in a loud voice and the others said their names too the farmer beamed at them you come along in and see the missis he said shell be rare pleased to see you all weve known master george since she was a baby and we knew her mother when she was a baby too and we knew her granny as well you must be very very old said anne the farmer smiled down at her as old as my tongue and a little older than my teeth he said chuckling come away in now they all went into the big warm farmhouse kitchen where a little old woman as lively as a bantam hen was bustling about she was just as pleased to see the four children as her husband was well there now she said i havent seen you for months master george i did hear that youd gone away to school yes i did said george but im home for the holidays now does it matter if i let timothy loose mrs sanders i think hell be friendly if your dogs are too yes you let him loose said the old lady hell have a fine time in the farmyard with ben and rikky now what would you like to drink hot milk cocoa coffee and ive some new shortbread baked yesterday you shall have some of that ah the wifes very busy this week cooking up all sorts of things said the old farmer as his wife bustled off to the larder weve company this christmas have you said george surprised for she knew that the old pair had never had any children of their own who is coming anyone i know two artists from london town said the old farmer wrote and asked us to take them for three weeks over christmas and offered us good money too so the old wifes as busy as a bee are they going to paint pictures asked julian who rather fancied himself as an artist too i wonder if i could come and talk to them some day im rather good at pictures myself they might give me a few hints you come along whenever you like said old mrs sanders making cocoa in a big jug she set out a plate of most deliciouslooking shortbreads and the children ate them hungrily i should think the two artists will be rather lonely down here in the depths of the country at christmastime said george do they know anyone they say they dont know a soul said mrs sanders but there artists are queer folk ive had some here before they seemed to like mooning about all alone these two will be happy enough ill be bound they should be with all the good things youre cooking up for them said her old husband well i must be out after the sheep goodday to you youngsters come again and see us sometimes he went out old mrs sanders chattered on to the children as she bustled about the big kitchen timothy ran in and settled down on the rug by the fire he suddenly saw a tabby cat slinking along by the wall all her hairs on end with fear of the strange dog he gave a delighted wuff and sprang at the cat she fled out of the kitchen into the old panelled hall tim flew after her taking no notice at all of georges stern shout the cat tried to leap on top of an old grandfather clock in the hall with a joyous bark tim sprang too he flung himself against a polished panel and then a most extraordinary thing happened the panel disappeared and a dark hole showed in the old wall george who had followed tim out into the hall gave a loud cry of surprise look mrs sanders come and look chapter four an exciting discovery old mrs sanders and the other three children rushed out into the hall when they heard georges shout whats up cried julian whats happened tim sprang at the cat missed her and fell hard against the panelled wall said george and the panel moved and look theres a hole in the wall its a secret panel cried dick in excitement peering into the hole golly did you know there was one here mrs sanders oh yes said the old lady this house is full of funny things like that im very careful when polish that panel because if i rub too hard in the top corner it always slides back whats behind the panel asked julian the hole was only about the width of his head and when he stuck his head inside he could see only darkness the wall itself was about eight inches behind the panelling and was of stone get a candle do get a candle said anne thrilled you havent got a torch have you mrs sanders no said the old woman but you can get a candle if you like theres one on the kitchen mantelpiece anne shot off to get it julian lighted it and put it into the hole behind the panel the others pushed against him to try and peep inside dont said julian impatiently wait your turn sillies let me have a look he had a good look but there didnt really seem anything to see it was all darkness behind and stone wall he gave the candle to dick and then each of the children had a turn at peeping old mrs sanders had gone back to the kitchen she was used to the sliding panel she said this house was full of queer things like that said anne what other things are there do you think lets ask her they slid the panel back into place and went to find mrs sanders mrs sanders what other funny things are there in kirrin farmhouse asked julian theres a cupboard upstairs with a false back said mrs sanders dont look so excited theres nothing in it at all and theres a big stone over there by the fireplace that pulls up to show a hideyhole i suppose in the old days people wanted good hidingplaces for things the children ran to the stone she pointed out it had an iron ring in it and was easily pulled up below was a hollowedout place big enough to take a small box it was empty now but all the same it looked exciting wheres the cupboard asked julian my old legs are too tired to go traipsing upstairs this morning said the farmers wife but you can go youi selves up the stairs turn to the right and go into the second door you see the cupboard is at the farther end open the door and feel about at the bottom till you come across a dent in the wood press it hard and the false back slides to the side the four children and timothy ran upstairs as fast as they could munching shortbread as they went this really was a very exciting morning they found the cupboard and opened the door all foyr went down on hands arid knees to press round the bottom of the cupboard to find the dented place anne found it ive got it she cried she pressed hard but her little fingers were not strong enough to work the mechanism of the sliding back julian had to help her there was a creaking noise and the children saw the false back of the cupboard sliding sideways a big space showed behind large enough to take a fairly thin man a jolly good hidingplace said julian anyone could hide there and no one would ever know til get in and you shut me up said dick it would be exciting he got into the space julian slid the back across and dick could no longer be seen bit of a tight fit he called and awfully dark let me out again the children all took turns at going into the space behind the back of the cupboard and being shut up anne didnt like it very much they went down to the warm kitchen again its a most exciting cupboard mrs sanders said julian i do wish we lived in a house like this full of secrets can we come and play in that cupboard again asked george no im afraid you cant master george said mrs sanders that room where the cupboard is is one the two gentlemen are going to have oh said julian disappointed shall you tell them about the sliding back mrs sanders i dont expect so said the old lady its only you children that get excited about things like that bless you two gentlemen wouldnt think twice about it how funny grownups are said anne puzzled im quite certain i shall be thrilled to see a sliding panel or a trapdoor even when im a hundred same here said dick could i just go and look into the sliding panel in the hall once more mrs sanders ill take the candle dick never knew why he suddenly wanted to have another look it was just an idea he had the others didnt bother to go with him for there really was nothing to see behind the panelling except the old stone wall dick took the candle and went into the hall he pressed on the panel at the top and it slid back he put the candle inside and had another good look there was nothing at all to be seen dick took out his head and put in his arm stretching along the wall as far as his hand would reach he was just about to take it back when his fingers found a hole in the wall funny said dick why should there be a hole in the stone wall just there he stuck in his finger and thumb and worked them about he felt a little ridge inside the wall rather like a birds perch and was able to get hold of it he wriggled his fingers about the perch but nothing happened then he got a good hold and pulled the stone came right out dick was so surprised that he let go the heavy stone and it fell to the ground behind the panelling with a crash the noise brought the others out into the hall whatever are you doing dick said julian have you broken something no said dick his face reddening with excitement i say i put my hand in here and found a hole in one of the stones the wall is made of and i got hold of a sort of ridge with my finger and thumb and pulled the stone came right out and i got such a surprise i let go it fell and thats what you heard golly said julian trying to push dick away from the open panel let me see no julian said dick pushing him away this is my discovery wait till i see if i can feel anything in the hole its difficult to get at the others waited impatiently julian could hardly prevent himself from pushing dick right away dick put his arm in as far as he could and curved his hand round to get into the space behind where the stone had been his fingers felt about and he closed them round something that felt like a book cautiously and carefully ne brought it out an old book he said whats in it cried anne they turned the pages carefully they were so dry and brittle that some of them fell into dust i think its a book of recipes said anne as her sharp eyes read a few words in the old brown faded handwriting lets take it to mrs sanders the children carried the book to the old lady she laughed at their beaming faces she took the book and looked at it not at all excited yes she said its a book of recipes thats all it is see the name in thes front alice mary sanders that must have been my greatgrandmother she was famous for her medicines i know it was said she could cure any ill in man or animal no matter what it was its a pity its so hard to read her writing said julian disappointed the whole book is falling to pieces too it must be very old do you think theres anything else in that hideyhole asked anne julian you go and put your arm in its longer than dicks there didnt seem to be anything else at all said dick its a very small place just a few inches of hollow space behind that brick or stone that fell down well ill just put my hand in and see said julian they all went back into the hal julian put his arm into the open panel and slid it along the wall to where the stone had fallen out his hand went into the space there and his long fingers groped about feeling for anything else that might be there there was something else something soft and flat that felt like leather eagerly the boys fingers closed over it and he drew it out carefully half afraid that it might fall to pieces with age ive got something he said his eyes gleaming brightly look what is it the others crowded round its rather like daddys tobacco pouch said anne feeling it the same shape is there anything inside it was a tobacco pouch very dark brown made of soft leather and very much worn carefully julian undid the flap and unrolled the leather a few bits of black tobacco were still in the pouch but there was something else too tightly rolled up in the last bit of pouch was a piece of linen julian took it out and unrolled it he put it flat on the halltable the children stared at it there were marks and signs on the linen done in black ink that had hardly faded but the four of them could not make head or tail of the marks its not a map said julian it seems a sort of code or something i do wonder what it means i wish we could make it out it must be some sort of secret the children stared at the piece of linen very thrilled it was so old and contained some kind of secret whatever could it be they ran to show it to mrs sanders she was studying the old recipe book and her face glowed with pleasure as she raised it to look at the excited children this books a wonder she said i can hardly read the writing but heres a recipe for backache i shall try it myself my back aches so much at the end of the day now you listen but the children didnt want to listen to recipes for backache they pushed the piece of lineii on to mrs sanders lap look whats this about mrs sanders do you know we found it in a kind of tobacco pouch in that place behind the panel mrs sanders took off her glasses polished them and put them on again she looked carefully at the piece of linen with its strange marks she shook her head no this doesnt make any sense to me and whats this now it looks like an old tobacco pouch ah my john would like that i guess hes got such an old one that it wont hold his tobacco any more this is old too but theres a lot of wear in it yet mrs sanders do you want this piece of linen too asked julian anxiously he was longing to take it home and study it he felt certain there was some kind of exciting secret hidden there and he could not bear the thought of leaving it with mrs sanders you take it master julian if you want it said mrs sanders with a laugh til keep the recipes for myself and john shall have the pouch you can have the old rag if you want it though it beats me why you set such store by it ah heres john she raised her voice and shouted to the deaf old man hey john heres a tobacco pouch for you the children found it somewhere behind that panel that opens in the hall john took it and fingered it its a queer one he said but better than mine well youngsters i dont want to hurry you but its one oclock now and youd best be going if its near your dinnertime gracious said julian we shall be late goodbye mrs sanders and thanks awfully for the shortbread and this old rag well try our best to make out whats on it and tell you hurry everyone wheres tim come on timothy were late the five of them ran off quickly they really were late and had to run most of the way which meant that it was difficult to talk but they were so excited about their morning that they panted remarks to one another as they went i wonder what this old rag says panted julian i mean to find out im sure its something mysterious shall we tell anyone asked dick no said george lets keep it a secret if anne starts to give away anything kick her under the table like we did last summer said julian with a grin poor anne always found jt difficult to keep a secret and often had to be nudged or kicked when she began to give things away i wont say a word said anne indignantly and dont you dare to kick me it only makes me cry out and then the grownups want to know why well have a good old puzzle over this piece of linen after dinner said julian i bet well find out what it says if we really make up our minds to here we are said george not too late hallo mother we wont be a minute washing our hands weve had a lovely time chapter five an unpleasant walk after dinner the four children went upstairs to the boys bedroom and spread out the bit of linen on a table there there were words here and there scrawled in rough printing there was the sign of a compass with e marked clearly for east there were eight rough squares and in one of them right in the middle was a cross it was all very mysterious you know i believe these words are latin said julian trying to make them out but i cant read them properly and i expect if i could read them i wouldnt know what they meant i wish we knew someone who could read latin like this could your father george asked anne i expect so said george but nobody wanted to ask georges father he might lake the curious old rag away he might forget all about it he might even burn it scientists were such queer people what about mr roland said dick hes a tutor he knows latin we wont ask him till we know a bit more about him said julian cautiously he seems quite jolly and nice but you never know oh blow i wish we could make this out i really do there are two words at the top said dick and he tried to spell them out via occulta what do you think they could mean julian well the only thing i can think of that they can mean is secret way or something like that said julian screwing up his forehead into a frown secret way said anne her eyes shining oh i hope its that secret way how exciting what sort of secret way would it be julian how do i know anne silly said julian i dont even know that the words are meant to mean secret way its really a guess on my part if they did mean that the linen might have directions to find the secret way whatever it is said dick oh julian isnt it exasperating that we cant read it do do try you know more latin than i do its so hard to read the funny old letters said julian trying again no its no good at all i cant make them out steps came up the stairs and the door opened mr roland looked in hallo hallo he said i wondered where you all were what about a walk over the cliffs well come said julian rolling up the old rag what have you got there anything interesting asked mr roland its a began anne and at once all the others began to talk afraid that anne was going to give the secret away its a wonderful afternoon for a walk come on lets get our things on tim tim where are you george gave a piercing whistle tim was under the bed and came bounding out anne went red as she guessed why all the others had interrupted her so quickly idiot said julian under his breath baby fortunately mr roland said no more about the piece of linen he had seen julian rolling up he was looking at tim i suppose he must come he said george stared at him in indignation of course he must she said we never never go anywhere without timothy mr roland went downstairs and the children got ready to go out george was scowling the very idea of leaving tim behind made her angry you nearly gave our secret away you silly said dick to anne i didnt think said the little girl looking ashamed of herself anyway mr roland seems very nice i think we might ask him if he could help us to understand those funny words you leave that to me to decide said julian crossly now dont you dare to say a word they all set out timothy too mr roland need not have worried about the dog for timothy would not go near him it was very queer really he kept away from the tutor and took not the slightest notice of him even when mr roland spoke to him hes not usually like that said dick hes a most friendly dog really well as ive got to live in the same house with him i must try and make him friends with me said the tutor hie timothy come here ive got a biscuit in my pocket timothy pricked up his ears at the word biscuit but did not even look towards mr roland he put his tail down and went to george she patted him if he doesnt like anyone not even a biscuit or a bone will make him go to them when he is called she said mr roland gave it up he put the biscuit back into his pocket hes a queerlooking dog isnt he he said a terrible mongrel i must say i prefer wellbred dogs george went purple in the face hes not queerlooking she spluttered hes not nearly so queerlooking as you hes not a terrible mongrel hes the best dog in the world i think you are being a little rude said mr roland stiffly ci dont allow my pupils to be cheeky georgina galling her georgina made george still more furious she lagged behind with tim looking as black as a thundercloud the others felt uncomfortable they knew what tempers george got into and how difficult she could be she had been so much better and happier since the summer when they had come to stay for the first time they did hope she wasnt going to be silly and get into rows it would spoil the christmas holidays mr roland took no more notice of george he did not speak to her but strode on ahead with the others doing his best to be jolly he could really be very funny and the boys began to laugh at him he took annes hand and the little girl jumped along beside him enjoying the walk julian felt sorry for george it wasnt nice to be left out of things and he knew how george hated anything like that he wondered if he dared to put in a good word for her it might make things easier mr roland sir he began could you call my cousin by the name she likes george she simply hates georgina and shes very fond of tim she cant bear anyone to say horrid things about him mr roland looked suiprised my dear boy i am sure you mean well he said in rather a dry sort of voice but i hardly think i want your advice about any of my pupils i shall follow my own wishes in my treatment of georgina not yours i want to be friends with you all and i am sure we shall be but georgina has got to be sensible as you three are julian felt rather squashed he went red and looked at dick dick gave him a squeeze on his arm the boys knew george could be silly and difficult especially if anyone didnt like her beloved dog but they thought mr roland might try to be a bit more understanding too dick slipped behind and walked with george you neednt walk with me said george at once her blue eyes glinting walk with your friend mr roland he isnt my friend said dick dont be silly im not silly said george in a tight sort of voice i heard you all laughing and joking with him you go on and have a good laugh again ive got timothy george its christmas holidays said dick do lets all be friends do dont lets spoil christmas t cant like anyone who doesnt like tim said george obstinately well after all mr roland did offer him a biscuit said dick trying to make peace as hard as he could george said nothing her small face looked fierce dick tried again george promise to try and be nice till christmas is over anyway dont lets spoil christmas for goodness sake come on george all right said george at last til try come and walk with us then said dick so george caught up the others and tried not to look too sulky mr roland guessed that dick had been trying to make george behave and he included her in his talk he could not make her laugh but she did at least answer politely is that kirrin farmhouse asked mr roland as they came in sight of the farm yes do you know it asked julian in surprise no no said mr roland at once i heard of it and wondered if that was the place we went there this morning said anne its an exciting place she looked at the others wondering if they would mind if she said anything about the things they had seen that morning julian thought for a moment after all it couldnt matter telling him about the stone in the kitchen and the false back to the cupboard mrs sanders would tell anyone that he could speak about the sliding panel in the hall too and say they had found an old recipe book there he did not need to say anything about the old bit of marked linen so he told their tutor about the exciting things they had seen at the old farmhouse but said nothing at all about the linen and its strange markings mr roland listened with the greatest interest this is all very remarkable he said very remark able indeed most interesting you say the old couple live there quite alone well they are having two people to stay over christmas said dick artists julian thought he would go over and talk to them he can paint awfully well you know can he really said mr roland well he must show me some of his pictures but i dont think hed better go and worry the artists at the farmhouse they mieht not like it this remark made julian feel obstinate he made up his mind at once that he would go and talk to the two artists when he got the chance it was quite a pleasant walk on the whole except that george was quiet and timothy would not go anywhere near mr roland when they came to a frozen pond dick threw sticks on it for tim to fetch it was so funny to see him go slithering about on his long legs trying to run properly everyone threw sticks for the dog and tim fetched all the sticks except mr rolands when the tutor threw a stick the dog looked at it and took no more notice it was almost as if he had said what your stick no thank you now home we go said mr roland trying not to look annoyed with tim we shall just be in time for tea chapter six lessons with mr roland next morning the children felt a little gloomy lessons how horrid in the holidays still mr roland wasnt so bad the children had not had him with them in the sittingroom the night before because he had gone to talk to their uncle so they were able to get out the mysterious bit of linen again and pore over it but it wasnt a bit of good nobody could make anything of it at all secret way what did it mean was it really directions for a secret way and where was the way and why was it secret it was most exasperating not to be able to find out i really feel well have to ask someone soon julian had said with a sigh i cant bear this mystery much longer i keep on and on thinking of it he had dreamt of it too that night and now it was morning with lessons ahead he wondered what lesson mr roland would take latin perhaps then he could ask him what the words via occulta meant mr roland had seen all their reports and had noted the subjects they were weak in one was latin and another was french maths were very weak in both dicks report and georges both children must be helped on in those geometry was julians weakest spot anne was not supposed to need any coaching but if you like to come along and join us ill give you some painting to do said mr roland his blue eyes twinkling at her he liked anne she was not difficult and sulky like george anne loved painting oh yes she said happily td love to do some painting i can paint flowers mr roland ill paint you some red poppies and blue cornflowers out of my head we will start at halfpast nine said mr roland we are to work in the sittingroom take your schoolbooks there and be ready punctually so all the children were there sitting round a table their books in front of them at halfpast nine anne had some painting water and her paintingbox the others looked at her enviously lucky anne to be doing painting whilst they worked hard at difficult things like latin and maths wheres timothy asked julian in a low voice as they waited for their tutor to come in under the table said george defiantly tm sure hell lie still dont any of you say anything about him i want him there im not going to do lessons without tim here i dont see why he shouldnt be here with us said dick hes very very good sh here comes mr roland the tutor came in his black beard bristling round his mouth and chin his eyes looked very piercing in the pale winter sunlight that filtered into the room he told the children to sit down ill have a look at your exercise books first he said and see what you were doing last term you come first julian soon the little class were working quietly together anne was very busy painting a bright picture of poppies and cornflowers mr roland admired it very much anne thought he really was very nice suddenly there was a huge sigh from under the table it was tim tired of lying so still mr roland looked up surprised george at once sighed heavily hoping that mr roland would think it was she who had sighed before you sound tired georgina said mr roland you shall all have a little break at eleven george frowned she hated being called georgina she put her foot cautiously on timothy to warn him not to make any more noises tim licked her foot after a while just when the class was at its very quietest tim felt a great wish to scratch himself very hard on his back he got up he sat down again with a thump gave a grunt and began to scratch himself furiously the children all began to make noises to hide the sounds that tim was making george clattered her feet on the floor julian began to cough and let one of his book slip to the ground dick jiggled the table and spoke to mr roland oh dear this sum is so hard it really is i keep doing it and doing it and it simply wont come right why all this sudden noise said mr roland in surprise stop tapping the floor with your feet georgina tim settled down quietly again the children gave a sigh of relief they became quiet and mr roland told dick to corne to him with his maths book the tutor took it and stretched his legs out under the table leaning back to speak to dick to his enorm ous surprise his feet struck something soft and warm and then something nipped him sharply on the ankle he drew in his feet with a cry of pain the children stared at him he bent down and looked under the table its that dog he said in disgust the brute snapped at my ankles he has made a hole in my trousers take him out georgina georgina said nothing she sat as though she had not heard she wont answer if you call her georgina julian reminded him shell answer me whatever i call her said mr roland in a low and angry voice i wont have that dog in here if you dont take him out this very minute georgina i will go to your father george looked at him she knew perfectly well that if she didnt take tim out and mr roland went to her father he would order timothy to live in the garden kennel and that would be dreadful there was absolutely nothing to be done but obey red in the face a huge frown almost hiding her eyes she got up and spoke to tim come on tim im not surprised you bit him i would too if i were a dog there is no need to be rude georgina said mr roland angrily the others stared at george they wondered how she dared to say things like that when she got fierce it seemed as if she didnt care for anyone at all come back as soon as you have put the dog out said mr roland george scowled but came back in a few minutes she ielt caught her father was friendly with mr roland and knew how difficult george was if she behaved as badly as she felt she would like to it would be tim who would suffer for he would certainly be banished from the house so for tims sake george obeyed the tutor but from that moment she disliked him and resented him bitterly with all her fierce little heart the otheis were soiry for george and timothy but they did not share the little girls intense dislike of the new tutor he often made them laugh he was patient with their mistakes he was willing to show them how to make paper darts and ships and to do funny little tricks julian and dick thought these were fun and stored them up to try on the other boys when they went back to school after lessons that morning the children went out for half an hour in the frosty sunshine george called tim poor old boy she said what a shame to turn you out ofthe room whatever did you snap at mr roland for i think it was a very good idea tim but i really dont know what made you george you cant play about with mr roland said julian youll only get into trouble hes tough he wont stand much from any of us but i think hell be quite a good sport if we get on the right side of him well get on the right side of him if you like said george in rather a sneering voice tm not going to if i dont like a person i dont and i dont like him why just because he doesnt like tim asked dick mostly because of that but because he makes me feel prickly down my back said george i dont like his nasty mouth but you cant see it said julian its covered with his moustache and beard ive seen his lips through them said george obstinately theyre thin and cruel you look and see i dont like thinlipped people they are always spiteful and hard and i dont like his cold eyes either you can suck up to him all you like shant julian refused to get angry with the stubborn little girl he laughed at her were not going to suck up to him he said were just going to be sensible thats all you be sensible too george old thing but once george had made up her mind about something nothing would alter her she cheered up when she heard that they were all to go christmas shopping on the bus that afternoon without mr roland he was going to watch an experiment that her father was going to show him i will take you into the nearest town and you shall shop to your hearts content said aunt fanny to the children then we will have tea in a teashop and catch the six oclock bus home this was fun they caught the afternoon bus and rumbled along the deep country lanes till they got to the town the shops looked very gay and bright the children had brought their money with them and were very busy indeed buying all kinds of things there were so many people to get presents for i suppose wed better get something for mr roland hadnt we said julian im going to said anne tm going to buy him a packet of cigarettes i know the kind he smokes fancy buying mr roland a present said george in her scornful voice why shouldnt she george asked her mother in surprise oh dear i hope you are going to be sensible about him and not take a violent dislike to the poor man i dont want him to complain to your father about you what are you going to buy for tim george asked julian changing the subject quickly the largest bone the butcher has got said george what are you going to buy him i guess if tim had money he would buy us each a present said anne taking hold of the thick hair round tims neck and pulling it lovingly hes the best dog in the world george forgave anne for saying she would buy mr roland a present when the little girl said that about tim she cheered up again and began to plan what she would buy for everyone they had a fine tea and caught the six oclock bus back aunt fanny went to see if the cook had given the two men their tea she came out of the study beaming really ive never seen your uncle so jolly she said to julian and dick he and mr roland are getting on like a house on fire he has been showing your tutor quite a lot of his experiments its nice for him to have someone to talk to that knows a little about these things mr roland played games with the children that evening tim was in the room and the tutor tried again to make friends with him but the dog refused to take any notice of him as sulky as his little mistress said the tutor with a laughing look at george who was watching tim refuse to go to mr roland and looking rather pleased about it she gave the tutor a scowl and said nothing shall we ask him whether via occult really does mean secret way or not tomorrow said julian to dick as they undressed that night im just longing to know if it does what do you think of mr roland dick i dont really quite know said dick i like lots of things about him but then i suddenly dont like him at all i dont like his eyes and george is quite right about his lips they are so thin theres hardly anything of them at all i think hes all right said julian he wont stand any nonsense thats all i wouldnt mind showing him the whole piece of rag and asking him to make out its meaning for us i thought you said it was to be a proper secret said dick i know but whats the use of a secret we dont know the meaning of ourselves said julian til tell you what we could do ask him to explain the words to us and not show him the bit of linen but we cant read some of the words ourselves said dick so thats no use youd have to show him the whole thing and tell him where we got it well ill see said julian getting into bed the next day there were lessons again from halfpast nine to halfpast twelve george appeared without tim she was angry at having to do this but it was no good being defiant and refusing to come to lessons without tim now that he had snapped at mr roland he had definitely put himself in the wrong and the tutor had every right to refuse to allow him to come but george looked very sulky indeed in the latin lesson julian took the chance of asking what he wanted to know please mr roland he said could you tell me what via ocgulta means via occulta said mr roland frowning yes it means secret path or secret road a hidden way something like that why do you want to know all the children were listening eagerly their hearts thumped with excitement so julian had been right that funny bit of rag contained directions for some hidden way some secret path but where to where did it begin and end oh i just wanted to know said julian thank you sir he winked at the others he was as excited as they were if only only they could make out the rest of the markings they might be able to solve the mystery well perhaps he would ask mr roland in a day or two the secret must be solved somehow the secret way said julian to himself as he worked out a problem in geometry the secret way ill find it somehow chapter seven directions for the secret way for the next day or two the four children did not really have much time to think about the secret way because christmas was coming near and there was a good deal to do there were christmas cards to draw and paint for their mothers and fathers and friends there was the house to decorate they went out with mr roland to find sprays of holly and came home laden you look like a christmas card yourselves said aunt fanny as they walked up the garden path carrying the redberried holly over their shoulders mr roland had found a group of trees with tufts of mistletoe growing from the top branches and they had brought some of that too its berries shone like pale green pearls mr roland had to climb the tree to get this said anne hes a good climber as good as a monkey everyone laughed except george she never laughed at anything to do with the tutor they all dumped their loads down in the porch and went to wash they were to decorate the house that evening is uncle going to let his study be decorated too asked anne there were all kinds of strange instruments and glass tubes in the study now and the children looked at them with wonder whenever they ventured into the study which was very seldom no my study is certainly not to be messed about said uncle quentin at once i wouldnt hear of it uncle why do you have all these funny things in your study asked anne looking round with wide eyes uncle quentin laughed tm looking for a secret formula he said whats that said anne you wouldnt understand said her uncle all these funny things as you call them help me in my experiments and i put down in my book what they tell me and from all i learn i work out a secret formula that will be of great use when it is finished you want to know a secret formula and we want to know a secret way said anne quite forgetting that she was not supposed to talk about this julian was standing by the door he frowned at anne luckily uncle quentin was not paying any more attention to the little girls chatter julian pulled her out of the room anne the only way to stop you giving away secrets is to sew up your mouth like brer rabbit wanted to do to mister dog he said joanna the cook was busy baking christmas cakes an enormous turkey had been sent over from kirrin farm and was hanging up in the larder timothy thought it smelt glorious and joanna was always shooing him out of the kitchen there were boxes of crackers on the shelf in the sittingroom and mysterious parcels everywhere it was very very christmassy the children were happy and excited mr roland went out and dug up a little spruce fir tree we must have a christmas tree he said have you any treeornaments children no said julian seeing george shake her head til go into the town this afternoon and get some for you promised the tutor it will be fun dressing the tree well put it in the hall and light candles on it on christmas day after tea whos coming with me to get the candles and the ornaments i am cried three children but the fourth said nothing that was george not even to buy treeornaments would the obstinate little girl go with mr roland she had never had a christmas tree before and she was very much looking forward to it but it was spoilt for her because mr roland bought the things that made it so beautiful now it stood in the hall with coloured candles in holders clipped to the branches and gay shining ornaments hanging from top to bottom silver strands of frosted string hung down from the branches like icicles and anne had put bits of white cottonwool here and there to look like snow it really was a lovely sight to see beautiful said uncle quentin as he passed through the hall and saw mr roland hanging the last ornaments on the tree i say look at the fary doll on the top whos that for a good girl anne secretly hoped that mr roland would give her the doll she was sure it wasnt for george and anyway george wouldnt accept it it was such a pretty doll with its gauzy frock and silvery wings julian dick and anne had quite accepted the tutor now as teacher and friend in fact everyone had their uncle and aunt too and even joanna the cook george of course was the only exception and she and timothy kept away from mr roland each looking as sulky as the other whenever the tutor was in the room you know i never knew a dog could look so sulky said julian watching timothy really he scowls almost like george and i always feel as if george puts her tail down like tim when mr roland is in the room giggled anne laugh all you like said george in a low tone i think youre beastly to me i know im right about mr roland ive got a feeling about him and so has tim youre silly george said dick you havent really got a feeling its only that mr roland will keep calling you georgina and putting you in your place and that he doesnt like tim i dare say he cant help disliking i dogs after all there was once a famous man called lord jihoberts who couldnt bear cats oh well cats are different said george if a person doesnt like dogs especially a dog like our timothy then there really must be something wrong with him its no use arguing with george said julian once shes made up her mind about something she wont budge george went out of the room in a huff the others thought she was behaving rather stupidly im surprised really said anne she was so jolly last ifferm at school now shes gone all queer rather like she was when we first knew her last summer i do think mr roland has been decent digging up the christmas tree and everything said dick i still dont like him awfully much sometimes but i think hes a sport what about asking him if he can read that old linen rag for us dont think id mind him sharing our secret really i would love him to share it said anne who was busy doing a marvellous christmas card for the tutor hes most awfully clever im sure he could tell us what the secret way is do lets ask him all right said julian ill showhim the piece of linen its christmas eve tonight he will be with us in the sittingroom because aunt fanny is going into the study with uncle quentin to wrap up presents for all of us so that evening before mr roland came in to sit with them julian took out the little roll of linen and stroked it out flat on the table george looked at it in surprise mr roland will be here in a minute she said youd better put it away quickly were going to ask him if he can tell us what the old latin words mean said julian youre not cried george in dismay ask him to share our secret however can you well we want to know what the secret is dont we said julian we dont need to tell him where we got this or anything about it except that we want to inow what the markings mean were not exactly sharing the secret with him only asking him to use his brains to help us well i never thought youd ask him said george hell want to know simply everything about it you st see if he wont hes terribly snoopy whatever you mean said julian in surprise i it think hes a bit snoopy i saw him yesterday snooping round the study when one was there said george he didnt see me outfede the window with tim he was having a real poke you know how interested he is in your fathers work paid julian why shouldnt he look at it your father ces him too youre just seeing what horrid things you t find to say about mr roland oh shut up you two said dick its christmas eve ont lets argue or quarrel or say beastly things just at that moment the tutor came into the room all busy as bees he said his mouth smiling beneath its ftoustache too busy to have a game of cards i supaose mr roland sir began julian could you help us something weve got an old bit of linen here with id markings on it the words seem to be in some sort jfof latin and we cant make them out george gave an angry exclamation as she saw julian e push the piece of linen over towards the tutor she went of the room and shut the door with a bang tim was s with her our sweettempered georgina doesnt seem to be very friendly tonight remarked mr roland pulling the bit of linen towards him where in the world did you get this what an odd thing nobody answered mr roland studied the roll of linen and then gave an exclamation ah i see why you wanted to know the meaning of those latin words the other day the ones that meant hidden path you remember they are at the top of this linen roll yes said dick all the children leaned over towards mr roland hoping he would be able to unravel a little of the mystery for them we just want to know the meaning of the words sir said julian this is really very interesting said the tutor puzzling over the linen apparently there are directions here for finding the opening or entrance of a secret path or road thats what we thought cried julian excitedly thats exactly what we thought oh sir do read the directions and see what you make of them well these eight squares are meant to represent wooden boards or panels i think said the tutor pointing to the eight rough squares drawn on the linen wait a minute i can hardly read some of the words this is most fascinating solum lapideum paries ligneus and whats this cellula yes cellulal the children hung on his words wooden panels that must mean panels somewhere at kirrin farmhouse mr roland frowned down at the old printed words then he sent anne to borrow a magnifying glass from her uncle she came back with it and the four of them looked through the glass seeing the words three times as clearly now well said the tutor at last as far as i can make out the direction mean this a room facing east eight wooden panels with an opening somewhere to be found in that marked one a stone floor yes i think thats right a stone floor and a cupboard it all sounds most extraordinary and very thrilling where did you get this from we just found it said julian after a pause oh mr roland thanks awfully we could never have made it out by ourselves i suppose the entrance to the secret way is in a room facing east then it looks like it said mr roland poring over the linen roll again where did you say you found this we didnt say said dick its a secret really you see i think you might tell me said the tutor looking at dick with his brilliant blue eyes i can be trusted with secrets youve no idea how many queer secrets i know well said julian i dont really see why you shouldnt know where we found this mr roland we found it at kirrin farmhouse in an old tobacco pouch i suppose the secret way begins somewhere there i wonder where and wherever can it lead to you found it at kirrin farmhouse exclaimed mr roland well well i must say that seems to be an interesting old place i shall have to go over there one day julian rolled up the piece of linen and put it into his pocket well thank you sir he said youve solved a bit of the mystery for us but set us another puzzle we must look for the entrance of the secret way after christmas when we can walk over to kirrin farmhouse til come with you said mr roland i may be able to help a little that is if you dont mind me having a little share in this exciting secret well youve been such a help in telling us what the words mean said julian wed like you to come if you want to sir yes we would said anne well go and look for the secret way then said mr roland what fun we shall have tapping round the panels waiting for a mysterious dark entrance to appear i dont suppose george will go dick murmured to julian you shouldnt have said mr roland could go with us ju that means that old george will have to be left out of it you know how she hates that i know said julian feeling uncomfortable dont lets worry about that now though george may feel different after christmas she cant keep up this kind of behaviour for ever chapter eight what happened on christmas night it was great fun on christmas morning the children awoke early and tumbled out of bed to look at the presents that were stacked on chairs near by squeals and yells of delight came from everyone oh a railway station just what i wanted who gave me this marvellous station a new doll with eyes that shut i shall call her betsymay she looks just like a betsymay i say what a whopping great book all about aeroplanes from aunt fanny how decent of her timothy look what julian has given you a collar with big brass studs all round you will be grand go and lick him to say thank you whos this from i say who gave me this wheres the label oh from mr roland how decent of him look julian a pocketknife with three blades so the cries and exclamations went on and the four excited children and the equallyexcited dog spent a glorious hour before a late christmas breakfast opening all kinds and shapes of parcels the bedrooms were in a fine mess when the children had finished who gave you that book about dogs george asked julian seeing rather a nice dogbook lying on georges pile mr roland said george rather shortly julian wondered if george was going to accept it he rathei thought she wouldnt but the little girl defiant and obstinate as she was had made up her mind not to spoil christmas day by being difficult so when the others thanked the tutor for their things she too added her thanks though in rather a stiff little voice george had not given the tutor anything but the others had and mr roland thanked them all very heartily appearing to be very pleased indeed he tolcl anne that her christmas card was the nicest he had ever had and she beamed at him with joy well i must say its nice to be here for christmas said mr roland when he and the others were sitting round a loaded christmas table at the midday dinner shall i carve for you mr quentin im good at that uncle quentin handed him the carving knife and fork gladly its nice to have you here he said warmly i must say youve settled in well im sure we all feel as if weve known you for ages it really was a jolly christmas day there were no lessons of course and there were to be none the next day either the children gave themselves up to the enjoyment of eating a great deal sucking sweets and looking forward to the lighting of the christmas tree it looked beautiful when the candles were lighted they twinkled in the darkness of the hall and the bright ornaments shone and glowed tim sat and looked at it quite entranced he likes it as much as we do said george and indeed tim had enjoyed the whole day just as much as any of the children they were all tired out when they went to bed i shant be long before im asleep yawned anne oh george its been fun hasnt it i did like the christmas tree yes its been lovely said george jumping into bed here conies mother to say good night basket tim basket tim leapt into his basket by the window he was always there when georges mother came in to say good night to the girls but as soon as she had gone downstairs the dog took a flying leap and landed on georges bed there he slept his head curled round her feet dont you think tim ought to sleep downstairs tonight said georges mother joanna says he ate such an enormous meal in the kitchen that she is sure he will be sick oh no mother said george at once make tim sleep downstairs on christmas night whatever would he think oh very well said her mother with a laugh i might have known it was useless to suggest it now go to sleep quickly anne and george its late and you are all tired she went into the boys room and said good night to them too they were almost asleep two hours later everyone else was in bed the house was still and dark george and anne slept peacefully in their small beds timothy slept too lying heavily on georges feet suddenly george awoke with a jump tim was growl ing softly he had raised his big shaggy head and george knew that he was listening what is it tim she whispered anne did not wake tim went on growling softly george sat up and put her hand on his collar to stop him she knew that if he awoke her father he would be cross timothy stopped growling now that he had roused george the girl sat and wondered what to do it wasnt any good waking annfm the little girl would be frightened why was tint growling he never did that at night perhaps id better go and see if everything is all right thought gpnrgf she was quite fearless and the thought pf creeping through the still dark house did not disturb her at all besides she had tim who could be afraid with tim beside them she slipped on her dressinggown perhaps a log has fallen out of one of the fireplaces and a rug is burning she thought sniffing as she went down the stairs tt would be just like tim to smell it and warn us with her hand on tims head to warn him to be quite quiet george crept softly through the hall to the sittingroom the fire was quite all right there just a red glow in the kitchen all was peace too tims feet made a noise there as his claws rattled against the linoleum a slight sound came from the other side of the house tim growled quite loudly and the hairs on the back of his neck rose up george stood still could it possibly be burglars suddenly timothy shook himself free from her fingers and kapt across the hall down a passage and into the study beyond there was the sound of an exclamation and a noise as if someone was falling over it is a burglar said george and she ran to the study she saw a torch shining on the floor dropped by someone who was even now struggling with tim george switched on the light and then looked with the greatest astonishment into the study mr roland was there in his dressinggown rolling on the floor trying to get away from timothy who although not biting him was holding him firmly by his dressinggown oh its you george call your beastly dog off said mr roland in a low and angry voice do you want to rouse all the household why are you creeping about with a torch demanded george i heard a noise down here and came to see what it was said mr roland sitting up and trying to fend off the angry dog for goodness sake call your beast off why didnt you put on the light asked george not attempting to take tim away she was very much enjoying the sight of an angry and frightened mr roland i couldnt find it said the tutor its on the wrong side of the door as you see this was true the switch was an awkward one to find if you didnt know it mr roland tried to push tim away again and the dog suddenly barked well hell wake everyone said the tutor angrily i didnt want to rouse the house i thought i could find out for myself if there was anyone about a burglar perhaps here comes your father georges father appeared carrying a large poker he stood still in astonishment when he saw mr roland on the ground and timothy standing over him whats all this he exclaimed mr roland tried to get up but tim would not let him georges father called to him sternly tim come here sir timothy glanced at george to see if his mistress agreed with her fathers command she said nothing so timothy took no notice of the order and merely made a snap at mr rolands ankles that dogs mad said mr roland from the floor hes already bitten me once before and now hes trying to do it again tim will you come here sir shouted georges father george that dog is really disobedient call him off at once come here tim said george in a low voice the dog at once came to her standing by her side with the hairs on his neck still rising up stiffly he growled softly as if to say be careful mr roland be careful the tutor got up he was very angry indeed he spoke to georges father i heard some sort of a noise and came down with my torch to see what it was he said i thought it came from your study and knowing you kept your valuable books and instruments here i wondered if some thief was about i had just got down and into the room when that dog appeared from somewhere and got me down on the ground george came along too and would not call him off i cant understand your behaviour george i really cant said her father angrily i hope you are not going to behave stupidly as you used to behave before your cousins came last summer and what is this i hear about tim biting mr roland before george had him under the table during lessons said mr roland i didnt know that and when i stretched out my legs they touched tim and he bit me i didnt tell you before sir because i didnt want to trouble you both george and the dog have tried to annoy me ever since i have been here well tim must go outside and live in the kennel said georges father i wont have him in the house it will be a punishment for him and a punishment for you too george i will not have this kind of behaviour mr roland has been extremely kind to you all i wont let tim live outside said george furiously its such cold weather and it would simply break his heart well his heart must be broken then said her father it will depend entirely on your behaviour from now on whether tim is allowed in the house at all these holidays i shall ask mr roland each day how you have behaved if you have a bad report then tim stays outside now you know go back to bed but first apologize to mr roland i wont said george and choked by feelings of anger and dismay she tore out of the room and up the stairs the two men stared after her let her be said mr roland shes a very difficult child and has made up her mind not to like me thats quite plain but i shall be very glad sir to know that that dog isnt in the house im not at all certain that georgina wouldnt set him on me if she could im soiry about all this said georges father i wonder what the noise was that you heard a log falling in the grate i expect now what am i to do about that tiresome dog tonight go and take him outside i suppose leave him tonight said mr roland i can hear noises upstairs the others are awake by now dont lets make any more disturbance tonight perhaps you are right said georges father thankfully he didnt at all want to tackle a defiant little girl and an angry big dog in the middle of a cold night the two men went to bed and slept george did not sleep the others had been awake when she got upstairs and she had told them what had happened george you really are an idiot said dick after all why shouldnt mr roland go down if he heard a noise you went down now we shant have darling old tim in the house this cold weather anne began to cry she didnt like hearing that the tutor she liked so much had been knocked down by tim and she hated hearing that tim was to be punished dont be a baby said george im not crying and its my dog but when everyone had settled down again in bed and slept peacefully georges pillow was very wet indeed tim crept up beside her and licked the salt tears off her cheek he whined softly tim was always unhappy when his little mistress was sad chapter nine a hunt for the secret way there were no lessons the next day george looked rather pale and was very quiet tim was already out in the yardkennel and the children could hear him whining unhappily they were all upset to hear him oh george im awfully sorry about it all said dick i wish you wouldnt get so fierce about things you only get yourself into trouble and poor old tim george was full of mixed feelings she disliked mr roland so much now that she could hardly bear to look at him and yet she did not dare to be openly rude and rebellious because she was afraid that if she was the tutor would give her a bad report and perhaps she would not be allowed even to see timothy it was very hard for a defiant nature like hers to force herself to behave properly mr roland took no notice of her at all the other children tried to bring george into their talks and plans but she remained quiet and uninterested george were going over to kirrin farmhouse today said dick coming were going to try and find the entrance to the secret way it must start somewhere there the children had told george what mr roland had said about the piece of marked linen they had all been thrilled about this though the excitements of christmas day had made them forget about it for a while yes of course ill come said george looking more cheerful timothy can come too he wants a walk but when the little girl found that mr roland was also going she changed her mind at once not for anything would she go with the tutor no she would go for a walk alone with timothy but george think of the excitement well have trying to find the secret way said julian taking hold of her arm george wrenched it away tm not going if mr roland is she said obstinately and the others knew that it was no good trying to coax her i shall go alone with tim said george you go off together with your dear mr roland she set out with timothy a lonely little figure going down the garden path the others stared after her this was horrid george was being more and more left out but what could they do about it well children are you ready asked mr roland you start off by yourselves will you ill meet you at the farmhouse later i want to run down to the village first to get something so the three children set off by themselves wishing that george was with them she was nowhere to be seen old mr and mrs sanders were pleased to see the itliree children and sat them down in the big kitchen to eat ginger buns and drink hot milk well have you come to find a few more seciet things asked mrs sanders with a smile may we try asked julian were looking for a room facing east with a stone floor and panelling all the rooms downstairs have stone floors said mrs sanders you hunt all you like my dears you wont do any damage i know but dont go into the room upstairs with the cupboard that has a false back will you or the one next to it those are the rooms the two artists have all right said julian rather soiry that they were unable to fiddle about with the exciting cupboard again are the artists here mrs sanders id like to talk to them about pictures i hope one day ill be an artist too dear me is that so said mrs sanders well well its always a marvel to me how people make any money at painting pictures it isnt making money that artists like so much as the painting of the pictures said julian looking rather wise that seemed to puzzle mrs sanders even more she shook her head and laughed theyre queer folk she said ah well you go along and have a hunt for whatever it is you want to find you cant talk to the two artists today though master julian theyre out the children finished their buns and milk and then stood up wondering where to begin their search they must look for a room or rooms facing east that would be the first thing to do which side of the house faces east mrs sanders asked julian do you know the kitchen faces due north said mrs sanders so east will be over there she pointed to the right thanks said julian come on everyone the three children went out of the kitchen and turned to the right there were three rooms there a kind of scullery not much used now a tiny room used as a den by old mr f sanders and a room that had once been a drawingroom but which was now cold and unused theyve all got stone floors said julian so well have to hunt through all of the three rooms said anne no we wont said julian we shant have to look in this scullery for one thing why notasked anne because the walls are of stone silly and we want panelling said julian use your brains anne well thats one room we neednt bother with then said dick look both this little room and the drawingroom have panelling julian we must search in both there must be some reason for putting dight squares of panelling in the directions said julian looking at the roll of linen again it would be a good idea to see whether theres a place with eight squares only you know over a window or something it was tremendously exciting to look round the two rooms the children began with the smaller room it was panelled all the way round in dark oak but there was no place where only eight panels showed so the children went into the next room the panelling there was different it did not look so old and was not so dark the squares were rather a different size too the children tried each panel tapping and pressing as they went expecting at any moment to see one slide back as the one in the hall had done but they were disappointed nothing happened at all they were still in the middle of trying when they heard footsteps in the hall and voices somebody looked into the drawingroom it was a man thin and tall wearing glasses on his long nose hallo he said mrs sanders told me you were treasurehunting or something how are you getting on not very well said julian politely he looked at the man and saw behind him another one younger with rather screwedup eyes and a big mouth i suppose you are the two artists he asked we are said the first man coming into the room now just exactly what are you looking for julian did not really want to tell him but it was difficult not to well were just seeing if theres a sliding panel here he said at last theres one in the hall you know its exciting to hunt round shall we help said the first artist coming into the room what are your names mines thomas and my friends name is wilton the children talked politely for a minute or two not at all wanting the two men to help if there was anything to be found they wanted to find it it would spoil everything if grownups solved the puzzle soon everyone was taptaptapping round the wooden panels they were in the middle of this when a voice hailed them hallo my word we are all busy the children turned and saw their tutor standing in the doorway smiling at them the two artists looked at him is this a friend of yours asked mr thomas yes hes our tutor and hes very nice said anne running to mr roland and putting her hand in his perhaps you will introduce me anne said mr roland smiling at the little girl anne knew how to introduce people she had often seen her mother doing it this is mr roland she said to the two artists then she turned to mr roland this is mr thomas she said waving her hand towards him and the other one is mr wilton the men halfbowed to one another and nodded are you staying here asked mr roland a very nice old farmhouse isnt it it isnt time to go yet is it asked julian hearing a clock strike yes im afraid it is said mr roland tin later meeting you than i expected we must go in about five minutes no later ill just give you a hand in trying to find this mysterious secret way but no matter how anyone of them pressed and tapped around the panels in either of the two rooms they could not find anything exciting it really was most disappointing well we really must go now said mr roland come and say goodbye to mrs sanders they all went into the warm kitchen where mrs sanders was cooking something that smelt most delicious something for our lunch mrs sanders said mr wilton my word you really are a wonderful cook mrs sanders smiled she turned to the children well dearies did you find what you wanted she asked no said mr roland answering for them we havent been able to find the secret way after all the secret way said mrs sanders in surprise what do you know about that now i thought it had all been forgotten in fact i havent believed in that secret way for many a year oh mrs sanders do you know about it cried julian where is it i dont know dear the secret of it has been lost for many a day said the old lady i remember my old grandmother telling me something about it when i was smaller than any of you but i wasnt interested in things like that when i was little i was all for cows and hens and sheep oh mrs sanders do do try and remember something begged dick what was the secret way well it was supposed to be a hidden way from kirrin farmhouse to somewhere else said mrs sanders i dont know where im sure it was used in the olden days when people wanted to hide from enemies it was disappointing that mrs sanders knew so little the children said goodbye and went off with their tutor feeling that their morning had been wasted george was indoors when they got to kirrin cottage her cheeks were not so pale now and she greeted the children eagerly did you discover anything tell me all about it she said theres nothing to tell said dick rather gloomily we found three rooms facing east with stone floors but only two of them had wooden panelling so we hunted round those tapping and punching but there wasnt anything to be discovered at all we saw the two artists said anne one was tall and thin and had a long nose with glasses on he was called mr thomas the other was younger with little piggy eyes and an enormous mouth i met them out this morning said george it must have been them mr roland was with them and they were all talking together they didnt see me oh it couldnt have been the artists you saw said anne at once mr roland didnt know them i had to introduce them well im sure i heard mr roland call one of them wilton said george puzzled lie must have known them it couldnt have been the artists said anne again they really didnt know mr roland mr thomas asked if he was a friend of ours im sure im not mistaken said george looking obstinate if mr roland said he didnt know the two artists he was telling lies oh youre always making out that he is doing something horrid cried anne indignantly you just make up things about him sh said julian here he is the door opened and the tutor came in well he said it was disappointing that we couldnt find the secret way wasnt it anyway we were rather foolish to hunt about that drawingroom as we did the panelling there wasnt really old it must have been put in years after the other oh well its no good looking there again said julian disappointed and im pretty sure theres nothing to be found in that other little room we went all over it so thoroughly isnt it disappointing it js said mr roland well julian how did you like the two artists i was pleased to meet them they seemed nice fellows and i shall like to know them george looked at the tutor could he possibly be telling untruths in such a truthful voice the little girl was very puzzled she felt sure it was the artists she had seen him with but why should he pretend he didnt know them she must be mistaken but all the same she felt uncomfortable about it and made up her mind to find out the truth if she could chapter ten a shock for george and tim next morning there were lessons again and no timothy under the table george felt very much inclined to refuse i to work but what would be the good of that grownups were so powerful and could dole out all kinds of punishments she didnt care how much she was punished her self but she couldnt bear to think that timothy might have to share in the punishments too so pale and sullen the little girl sat down at the table with the others anne was eager to join in the lessons in fact she was eager to do anything to please mr roland because he had given her the fairy doll from the top of the christmas tree anne thought she was the prettiest doll she had ever seen george had scowled at the doll when anne showed it to her she didnt like dolls and she certainly wasnt going to like one that mr roland had chosen and given to anne but anne loved it and had made up her mind to do lessons with the others and work as well as she could george did as little as she could without getting into trouble mr roland took no interest in her or in her work he praised the others and took a lot of trouble to show julian something he found difficult the children heard tim whining outside as they worked this troubled them very much for timothy was such a companion and so dear to them all they could not bear to think of him left out of everything cold and miserable in the yardkennel when the ten minutes break came and mr roland went out of the room for a few minutes julian spoke to george george its awful for us to hear poor old tim whining out there in the cold and im sure i heard him cough let me speak to mr roland about him you must feel simply dreadful knowing that tim is out there i thought i heard him cough too said george looking worried i hope he wont get a cold he simply doesnt understand why i have to put him there he thinks im terribly unkind the little girl turned her head away afraid that tears might come into her eyes she always boasted that she never cried but it was very difficult to keep the tears away when she thought of timothy out there in the cold dick took her arm listen george you just hate mr roland and i suppose you cant help it but we can none of us bear timothy being out there all alone and it looks like snow today which would be awful for him could you be awfully awfully good today and forget your dislike so that when your father asks mr roland for your report he can say you were very good and then well all ask mr roland if he wouldnt let timmy come back into the house see timothy coughed again out in the yard and georges heart went cold suppose he got that awful illness called pneumonia and she couldnt nurse him because he had to live in the kennel she would die of unhappiness she turned to julian and dick all right she said i do hate mr roland but i love timothy more than i hate the tutor so for tims sake ill pretend to be good and sweet and hardworking and then you can beg him to let timothy come back good girl said julian now here he comes so do your best to the tutors enormous surprise george gave him a smile when he came into the room this was so unexpected that it puzzled him he was even more puzzled to find that george worked harder than anyone for the rest of the morning and she answered politely and cheerfully when he spoke to her he gave her a word of praise well done georgina i can see youve got brains thank you said george and gave him another smile a very watery poor affair compared with the happy smiles the others had been used to but still it was a smile at dinnertime george looked after mr roland most politely passed him the salt offered him more bread got up to fill his glass when it was empty the others looked at her in admiration george had plenty of pluck she must be finding it very difficult to behave as if mr roland was a great friend when she really disliked him so much mr roland seemed very pleased and appeared to be quite willing to respond to georges friendliness he made a little joke with her and offered to lend her a book he had about a dog georges mother was delighted to find that her difficult daughter seemed to be turning over a new leaf altogether things were very much happier that day george you go out of the room before your father comes in to ask mr roland about your behaviour tonight said julian then when the tutor gives you a splendid report we will all ask if timothy can come back it will be easier if you are not there all right said george she was longing for this difficult day to be over it was very hard for her to pretend to be friendly when she was not she could never never do it if it wasnt for timothys sake george disappeared out of the room just before six oclock when she heard her father coming he walked into the room and nodded to mr roland well have your pupils worked well today he asked very well indeed said mr roland julian has really mastered something he didnt understand today dick has done well in latin anne has written out a french exercise without a single mistake and what about george asked uncle quentin i was coming to georgina said mr roland looking round and seeing that she was gone she has worked better than anyone else today i am really pleased with her she has tried hard and she has really been polite and friendly i feel she is trying to turn over a new leaf shes been a brick today said julian warmly uncle quentin she has tried awfully hard she really has and you know shes terribly unhappy why asked uncle quentin in surprise because of timothy said julian hes out in the cold you see and hes got a dreadful cough oh uncle quentin please do let poor timmy come indoors begged anne yes please do said dick not only for georges sake because she loves him so but for us too we hate to hear him whining outside and george does deserve a reward uncle shes been marvellous today well said uncle quentin looking doubtfully at the three eager faces before him well i hardly know what to say if george is going to be sensible and the weather gets colder well he looked at mr roland expecting to hear him say something in favour of timothy but the tutor said nothjf ing he looked annoyed what do you think roland asked uncle quentin i think you should keep to what you said and let the dog stay outside said the tutor george is spoilt and needs firm handling you should really keep to your decision about the dog there is no reason to give way about it just because she has tried to be good for once the three children stared at mr roland in surprise and dismay it had never entered their heads that he would not back them up oh mr roland you are horrid cried anne oh do do say youll have timothy back the tutor did not look at anne he pursed up his mouth beneath its thick moustache and looked straight at uncle quentin well said uncle quentin perhaps we had better see how george behaves for a whole week after all just one day isnt much the children stared at him in disgust they thought he was weak and unkind mr roland nodded his head yes he said a week will be a better test if georgina behaves well for a whole week well have another word about the dog sir but at present i feel it would be better to keep him outside very well said uncle quentin and went out of the room he paused to look back come along into my study sometime he said ive got a bit further with my formula its at a very interesting stage the three children looked at one another but said nothing how mean of the tutor to stop uncle quentin from having timothy indoors again they all felt disappointed in him the tutor saw their faces im sorry to disappoint you he said but i think if youd been bitten by timothy once and snapped at all over when he got you on the floor you would not be very keen on having him in either he went out of the room the children wondered what to say to george she came in a moment later her face eager but when she saw the gloomy looks of the other three she stopped short isnt tim to come in she asked quickly whats happened tell me they told her the little girls face grew dark and angry when she heard how the tutor had put his foot down about timothy even when her father had himself suggested that the dog might come indoors oh what a beast he is she cried how i do hate him ill pay him out for this i will i will she rushed out of the room they heard her fumbling in the hall and then the front door banged shes gone out into the dark said julian i bet shes gone to timmy poor old george now shell be worse than ever that night george could not sleep she lay and tossed in her bed listening for timothy she heard him cough she heard him whine he was cold she knew he was she had put plenty of fresh straw into his kennel and had turned it away from the cold north wind but he must feel the bitter night terribly after sleeping for so long on her bed timothy gave such a hollow cough that george could bear it no longer she must she simply must get up and go down to him i shall bring him into the house for a little while and rub his chest with some of that stuff mother uses for herself when shes got a cold on her chest thought the girl perhaps that will do him good she quickly put a few clothes on and crept downstairs the whole house was quiet she slipped out into the yard and undid tims chain he was delighted to see her and licked her hands and face lovingly come along into the warm for a little while whispered the little girl til rub your poor chest with some oil ive got timmy pattered behind her into the house she took him to the kitchen but the fire was out and the room was cold george went to look at the other rooms there was quite a nice fire still in her fathers study f she and tim went in there she did not put on the light because the firelight was fairly bright she had with her the little bottle of oil from the bathroom cupboard she put it down by the fire to warm then she rubbed the dogs hairy chest with the oil hoping it would do him good dont cough now if you can help it tim she whispered if you do someone f may hear you lie down here by the fire darling and if get nice and warm your cold will soon be better timothy lay down on the rug he was glad to be out ti of his kennel and with his beloved mistress he put his head on her knee she stroked him and whispered to him the firelight glinted on the curious instruments and jf glass tubes that stood around on shelves in her fathers j study a log shifted a little in the fire and settled lower sending up a cloud of sparks it was warm and peaceful there the little girl almost fell asleep the big dog closed his eyes too and rested peacefully happy and warm george settled down with her head on his neck she awoke to hear the study clock striking six the room was cold now and she shivered goodness six oclock joanna the cook would soon be awake she must not find timmy and george in the study tim darling wake up we must put you back into your kennel whispered george im sure your cold is better because you havent coughed once since youve been indoors get up and dont make a noise sh tim stood up and shook himself he licked georges hand he understood perfectly that he must be quite quiet the two of them slipped out of the study went into the hall and out of the front door in a minute or two timothy was on the chain and in his kennel cuddled down among the straw george wished she could cuddle there with him she gave him a pat and slipped back indoors again she went up to bed sleepy and cold she forgot that she was partly dressed and got into bed just as she was she was asleep in a moment in the morning anne was most amazed to find that george had on vest knickers skirt and jersey when she got out of bed to dress look she said youre halfdressed but i saw you undressing last night be quiet said george i went down and let tim in last night we sat in front of the study fire and i rubbed him with oil now dont you dare to say a word to anyone promise anne promised and she faithfully kept her word well well to think that george dared to roam about like that all night what an extraordinary girl she was chapter eleven stolen papers george dont behave fiercely today will you said julian after breakfast it wont do you or timothy aay good at all do you suppose im going to behave well when i know perfectly well that mr roland will never let me have tim indoors all these holidays said george well they said a week said dick cant you try for a week no at the end of a week mr roland will say i must try for another week said george hes got a real dislike for poor tim and for me too im not surprised at that because i know that when i try to be horrid i really am horrid but he shouldnt hate poor timmy oh george youll spoil the whole holls if you are silly and keep getting into trouble said anne well ill spoil them then said george the sulky look coming back on her face i dont see why you have to spoil them for us as well as for yourself said julian they dont need to be spoilt for you said george you can have all the fun you want go for walks with your dear mr roland play games with him in the evening and laugh and talk as much as you like you dont need to take any notice of me you are a funny girl george said julian with a sigh we like you and we hate you to be unhappy so how can we have fun if we know you are miserable and timmy too dont worry about me said george in rather a choky voice tm going out to tim im not corning in to lessons today george but you must said dick and julian together theres no must about it said george tm just not coming i wont work with mr roland till he says i can have timothy indoors again but you know you cant do things like that youll be spanked or something said dick i shall run away if things get too bad said george in a shaky voice i shall run away with tim she went out of the room and shut the door with a bang the others stared after her what could you do with a person like george anyone could rule her with kindness and understanding but as soon as she came up against anyone who disliked her or whom she disliked she shied away like a frightened horse and kicked like a frightened horse too mr roland came into the sittingroom his books in his hand he smiled at the three children well all ready for me i see wheres george nobody answered nobody was going to give george away dont you know where she is asked mr roland in surprise he looked at julian no sir said julian truthfully ive no idea where she is well perhaps she will come along in a few minutes said mr roland gone to feed that dog of hers i suppose they all settled down to work the time went on and george did not come in mr roland glanced at the clock and made an impatient clicking noise with his tongue really its too bad of george to be so late anne go and see if you can find her anne went she looked in the bedroom there was no george there she looked in the kitchen joanna was there making cakes she gave the little girl a hot piece to eat she had no idea where george was anne couldnt find her anywhere she went back and told mr roland he looked angry i shall have to report this to her father he said i have never had to deal with such a rebellious child before she seems to do everything she possibly can to get herself into trouble lessons went on break came and still george did not appear julian slipped out and saw that the yardkennel was empty so george had gone out with timmy what a row she would get into when she got back no sooner had the children settled down after break to do the rest of the mornings lessons than a big disturbance came uncle quentin burst into the room looking upset and worried have any of you children been into my study he asked no uncle quentin they all answered you said we werent to said julian why sir has something been broken asked mr roland yes the testtubes i set yesterday for an experiment have been broken and what is worse three most important pages of my book have gone said uncle quentin i can write them out again but only after a great deal of work i cant understand it are you sure children that none of you has been meddling with things in my study quite sure they answered anne went very red she suddenly remembered what george had told her george said she had taken timmy into uncle quentins study last night and rubbed his chest with oil but george couldnt possibly have broken the testtubes and taken pages from her fathers book mr roland noticed that anne had gone red do you know anything about this anne he asked no mr roland said anne blushing even redder and looking very uncomfortable indeed wheres george suddenly said uncle quentin the children said nothing and it was mr roland who answered we dont know she didnt come to lessons this morning didnt come to lessons why not demanded uncle quentin beginning to frown she didnt say said mr roland dryly i imagine she was upset because we were firm about timothy last night sir and this is her way of being defiant the naughty girl said georges father angrily i dont know whats come over her lately fanny come here did you know that george hasnt been in to her lessons today aunt fanny came into the room she looked very worried she held a little bottle in her hand the children wondered what it was didnt come in to lessons repeated aunt fanny how extraordinary then wheie is she i dont think you need to worry about her said mr roland smoothly shes probably gone off with timothy in a fit of temper what is very much more important sir is the fact that your work appears to have been spoilt by someone i only hope it is not george who has been spiteful enough to pay you out for not allowing her to have her dog in the house of course it wasnt george cried dick angry that anyone should even think such a thing of his cousin george would never never do a thing like that said julian no she never would said anne sticking up valiantly for her cousin although a horrid doubt was in her mind after all george had been in the study last night quentin i am sine george would not even think of such a thing said aunt fanny you will find those pages somewhere and as for the testtubes that were broken well perhaps the wind blew the curtain against them or something when did you last see those pages last night said uncle quentin i read them over again and checked my figures to make sure they were right these pages contain the very heart of my formula if they got into anyone elses hands they could use my secret this is a terrible thing for me i must know what has happened to them i found this in your study quentin said aunt fanny and she held up the little bottle she carried did you put it there it was in the fender uncle quentin took the bottle and stared at it camphorated oil he said of course i didnt take it there why should i well who took it there then asked aunt fanny puzzled none of the children has a cold and anyway they wouldnt think of the camphorated oil and take it into the study to use its most extraordinary everyone was astonished why should a bottle of camphorated oil appear in the study fender only one person could think why it suddenly came into annes mind in a flash george had said she had taken timmy into the study and rubbed him with oil he had had a cough that was why and she had left the oil in the study oh dear oh dear now what would happen what a pity george had forgotten the oil anne went very red again as she looked at the oil mr roland whose eyes seemed very sharp this morning looked hard at the little girl anne you know something about that oil he said suddenly what do you know did you put it there no said anne i havent been into the study i said i hadnt do you know anything about the oil said mr roland again you do know something everyone stared at anne she stared back this was simply dreadful she could not give george away she could not george was in quite enough trouble as it was without getting into any more she pursed up her little mouth and did not answer anne said mr roland sternly answer when you are spoken to anne said nothing the two boys stared at herguessing that it was something to do with george they did not know that george had brought timothy in the night before anne dear said her aunt gently tell us if you know something it might help us to find out what has happened to uncle quentins papers it is very very important still anne said nothing her eyes filled with tears julian squeezed her arm dont bother anne he said to the grownups if she thinks she cant tell you shes got some very good reason i think shes shielding george said mr roland is that it anne anne burst into tears julian put his arms round his little sister and spoke again to the three grownups dont bother anne cant you see shes upset well let george speak for herself when she thinks will come in said mr roland im sure she knows how that bottle got there and if she put it there herself must have been into the study and shes the only person that has been there the boys could not think for one moment that george would do such a thing as spoil her fathers work anne feared it and it upset her she sobbed in julians amis when george comes in send her to me in my study said uncle quentin irritably how can a man work when these upsets go on i was always against having children in the house he stamped out tall cross and frowning the children were glad to see him go mr roland shut the books on the table with a snap we cant do any more lessons this morning he said tut on your things and go out for a walk till dinnertime yes do said aunt fanny looking white and woiried thats a good idea mr roland and their aunt went out of the room i dont know if mr roland thinks hes coming out with us said julian in a low voice but weve got to get out first and give him the slip weve got to find george and warn her whats up right said dick dry your eyes anne darling hurry and get your things well slip out of the garden door before mr roland comes down i bet george has gone for her favourite walk over the cliffs well meet her the three children threw on their outdoor things and crept out of the garden door quietly they raced down the garden path and out of the gate before mr roland even knew they were gone they made their way to the cliffs and looked to see if george was coming there she is and timothy too cried julian pointing george george quick weve got something to tell you chapter twelve george in trouble whats the matter asked george as the three children tore up to her has something happened yes george someone has taken three most important pages out of your fathers book panted julian and broken the testtubes he was making an experiment with mr roland thinks you might have had something to do with it the beast said george her blue eyes deepening with anger as if id do a thing like that why should he think its me anyway well george you left that bottle of oil in the study fender said anne i havent told anyone at all what you told me happened last night but somehow mr roland guessed you had something to do with the bottle of oil didnt you tell the boys how i got timmy indoors asked george well theres nothing much to tell julian i just heard poor old tim coughing in the night and i halfdressed went down and took him into the study where there was a fire mother keeps a bottle of oil that she used to rub her chest wfth when she has a cough so i thought it might do timmys cold good too i got the oil and rubbed him well and we both fell asleep by the fire till six oclock i was sleepy when i woke up and forgot the oil thats all and you didnt take any pages from the book uncle quentin is writing and you didnt break anything in the study did you said anne of course not silly said george indignantly how can you ask me a thing like that you must be mad george never told a lie and the others always believed her whatever she said they stared at her and she stared back i wonder who could have taken those pages then said julian maybe your father will come across them after all i expect he put them into some safe place and then forgot all about them and the testtubes might easily have overbalanced and broken themselves some of them look very shaky to me i suppose i shall get into trouble now for taking tim into the study said george and for not coming into lessons this morning said dick you really are an idiot george i never knew anyone like you for walking right into trouble hadnt you better stay out a bit longer till everyone has calmed down a bit said anne no said george at once if im going to get into a row ill get into it now im not afraid she marched over the cliff path with timmy running round her as usual the others followed it wasnt nice to think that george was going to get into such trouble they came to the house and went up the path mr roland saw them from the window and opened the door he glanced at george your father wants to see you in the study said the tutor then he turned to the others looking annoyed why did you go out without me i meant to go with you oh did you sir im sorry said julian politely not looking at mr roland we just went out on the cliff a little way georgina did you go into the study last night asked mr roland watching george as she took off her hat and coat til answer my fathers questions not yours said george what you want is a good spanking said mr roland and if i were your father id give it to you youre not my father answered george she went to the study door and opened it there was no one there father isnt here said george hell be there in a minute said mr roland go in and wait and you others go up and wash for lunch the other three children felt almost as if they were deserting george as they went up the stairs they could hear timmy whining from the yard outside he knew his little mistress was in trouble and he wanted to be with her george sat down on a chair and gazed at the fire remembering how she had sat on the rug there with tim last night rubbing his hairy chest how silly of her to have forgotten the bottle of oil her father came into the room frowning and angry he looked sternly at george were you in here last night george he asked yes i was answered george at once what were you doing in here asked her father you know you children are forbidden to come into my study i know said george but you see timmy had a dreadful cough and i couldnt bear it so i crept down about one oclock and let him in this was the only room that was really warm so i sat here and rubbed his chest with the oil mother uses when she has a cold rubbed the dogs chest with camphorated oil exclaimed her father in amazement what a mad thing to do as if it would do him any good it didnt seem mad to me said george it seemed sensible and timmys cough is much better today im sorry for coming into the study i didnt touch a thing of course george something very serious has happened said her father looking gravely at her some of my testtubes with which i was doing an important experiment have been broken and worse than that three pages of my book have gone tell me on your honour that you know nothing of these things i know nothing of them said george looking her father straight in the eyes her own eyes shone very blue and clear as she gazed at him he felt quite certain that george was speaking the truth she could know nothing of the damage done then where were those pages george last night when i went to bed at eleven oclock everything was in order he said i read over those three important pages and checked them once more myself this morning they are gone then they must have been taken between eleven oclock and one oclock said george i was here from that time until six but who could have taken them said her father the window was fastened as far as i know and nobody knows that those three pages were so important but myself it is most extraordinary mr roland probably knew said george slowly dont be absurd said her father even if he did realize they were important he would not have taken them hes a very decent fellow and that reminds me why were you not at lessons this morning george im not going to do lessons any more with mr roland said george i simply hate him george i will not have you talking like this said her father do you want me to say you are to lose tim altogether no said george feeling shaky about the knees and i dont think its fair to keep trying to force me to do things by threatening me with losing timothy if if you do a thing like that ill ill run away or something there were no tears in georges eyes she sat bolt upright on her chair gazing defiantly at her father how difficult she was her father sighed and remembered that he too in his own childhood had been called difficult perhaps george took after him she could be so good and sweet and here she was being perfectly impossible her father did not know what to do with george he thought he had better have a word with his wife he got up and went to the door stay here i shall be back in a moment i want to speak to your mother about you dont speak to mr roland about me will you said george who felt quite certain that the tutor would urge terrible punishments for her and timmy oh father if only timothy had been in the house last night sleeping in my room as usual he would have heard whoever it was that stole your secret and he would have barked and roused the house her father said nothing but he knew that what george had said was true timmy wouldnt have let anyone get into the study it was funny he hadnt barked in the night if anyone from outside had climbed in at the study window still it was the other side of the house maybe he had heard nothing the door closed george sat still on her chair gazing up at the mantelpiece where a clock ticked away the time she felt very miserable everything was going wrong every single thing as she gazed at the panelled overmantel she counted the wooden panels there were eight now where had she heard of eight panels before of course in that secret way there were eight panels marked on the roll of linen what a pity there had not been eight panels in a wooden overmantel at kirrin farmhouse george glanced out of the window and wondered if it faced ast she looked to see where the sun was it was not shining into the room but it did in the early morning so it must face east fancy here was a room facing east and with eight wooden panels she wondered if it had a stone floor the floor was covered with a large thick carpet george got up and went to the wall she pulled up the edge of the carpet there and saw that the floor underneath was made of large flat stones the study had a stone floor too she sat down again and gazed at the wooden panels trying to remember which one in the roll of linen was marked with a cross but of course it couldnt be a room in kirrin cottage it must be in kirrin farmhouse where the secret way began but just suppose it was kirrin cottage certainly the directions had been found in kirrin farmhouse but that was not to say that the secret way had to begin there even though mrs sanders seemed to think it did george was feeling excited i must tap round about those eight panels and try to find the one that is marked on the linen roll she thought it may slide back or something and i shall suddenly see the entrance opening she got up to try her luck but at that moment the door opened again and her father came in he looked very grave i have been talking to your mother he said she agrees with me that you have been very disobedient rude and defiant we cant let behaviour like that pass george you will have to be punished george looked anxiously at her father if only her punishment had nothing to do with timothy but of course it had you will go to bed for the rest of the day and you will not see timothy for three days said her father i will get julian to feed him and take him for a walk if you persist in being defiant timothy will have to go away altogether i am afraid queer as it may seem that thai dog has a bad influence on you he hasnt he hasnt cried george oh hell be so miserable if i dont see him for three whole days theres nothing more to be said said her father go straight upstairs to bed and think over all i have said to you george i am very disappointed in your behaviour these holidays i really did think the influence of your three cousins had made you into a normal sensible girl now you are worse than you have ever been he held open the door and george walked out holding her head high she heard the others having their dinner in the diningroom she went straight upstairs and undressed she got into bed and thought miserably of not seeing tim for three days she couldnt bear it nobody could possibly know how much she loved timothy joanna came up with a tray of dinner well miss its a pity to see you in bed she said cheerfully now you be a sensible girl and behave properly and youll soon be downstairs again george picked at her dinner she did not feel at all hungry she lay back on the bed thinking of tim and thinking of the eight panels over the mantelpiece could they possibly be the ones shown in the secret way directions she gazed out of the window and thought hard golly its snowing she said suddenly sitting up t thought it would when i saw that leaden sky this morning its snowing hard it will be quite thick by tonight inches deep oh poor timothy i hope julian will see that his kennel is kept clear of the drifting snow george had plenty of time to think as she lay in bed joanna came and took the tray away no one else came to see her george felt sure the other children had been forbidden to go up and speak to her she felt lonely and leftout she thought of her fathers lost pages could mr roland have taken them after all he was very interested in her fathers work and seemed to understand it the thief must have been someone who knew which were the important pages surely timothy would have barked if a thief had come in from outside even though the study was the other side of the house timmy had such sharp ears i think it must have been someone mside the house said george none of us children thats certain and not mother or joanna so that only leaves mr roland and i did find him in the study that other night when timmy woke me by growling she sat up in bed suddenly i believe mr roland had timothy put out of the house because he wanted to go poking round the study again and was afraid tim would bark she thought he was so very insistent that tim should go out of doors even when everyone else begged for me to have him indoors i believe really do believe that mr roland is the thief the little girl felt very excited could it be that the tutor had stolen the pages and broken those important testtubes how she wished that the others would come and see her so that she could talk things over with them chapter thirteen julian has a surprise the three children downstairs felt very sorry for george uncle quentin had forbidden them to go up and see her a little time for thinking out things all alone may do george good he said poor old george said julian its too bad isnt it i say look at the snow the snow was falling very thickly julian went to the window and looked out i shall have to go and see that timmys kennel is all right he said we dont want the poor old fellow to be snowed up i expect he is wondering what the snow is timothy was certainly very puzzled to see everywhere covered with soft white stuff he sat in his kennel and stared out at the falling flakes his big brown eyes following them as they fell to the ground he was puzzled and unhappy why was he living out here by himself in the cold why didnt george come to him didnt she love him any more the big dog was very miserable as miserable as george he was delighted to see julian he jumped up at the boy and licked his face good old tim said julian are you all right let me sweep away some of this snow and swing your kennel round a bit so that no flakes fly inside there thats better no were not going for a walk old thing not now the boy patted the dog and fussed him a bit then went indoors the others met him at the sittingroom door julian mr roland is going out for a walk by himself aunt fanny is lying down and uncle quentin is in his study cant we go up and see george we were forbidden to said julian doubtfully t know said dick but i dont mind risking it for the sake of making george feel a bit happier it must be so awful for her lying up there all alone knowing she cant see tim for days well let me go up as im the eldest said julian you two stay down here in the sittingroom and talk then uncle quentin will think were all here ill slip up and see george for a few minutes all right said dick give her our love and tell her well look after timmy julian slipped quietly up the stairs he opened georges door and crept inside he shut the door and saw george sitting up in bed looking at him in delight sh said julian im not supposed to be here oh julian said george joyfully how good of you to come i was so lonely come this side of the bed then if anyone comes in suddenly you can duck down and hide julian went to the other side of the bed george began to pour out to him all she had been thinking of i believe mr roland is the thief i really do she said im not saying that because i hate him julian really im not after all i did find him snooping round the study one afternoon and again in the middle of the night he may have got to hear of my fathers work and come to see if he could steal it it was just lucky for him that we needed a tutor im sure he stole those pages and im sure he wanted timmy out of the house so that he could do his stealing without tim hearing him and growling oh george i dont think so said julian who really could not approve of the idea of the tutor doing such a thing it all sounds so farfetched and unbelievable lots of unbelievable things happen said george lots and this is one of them well if mr roland did steal the pages they must be somewhere in the house said julian he hasnt been out all day they must be somewhere in his bedroom of course said george looking thrilled t wish hed go out then id search his room george you cant do things like that said julian quite shocked you simply dont know what things i can do if i really want to said george setting her mouth in a firm line oh whats that noise there was the bang of a door julian went cautiously to the window and peeped out the snow had stopped falling for a time and mr roland had taken the chance of going out its mr roland said julian oooh i could search his room now if youll keep watch at the window and tell me if he comes back said george throwing back the bedclothes at once no george dont said julian honestly and truly its awful to search somebodys room like that and anyway i dare say hes got the pages with him he may even be going to give them to somebody i never thought of that said george and she looked at julian with wide eyes isnt that sickening of course he may be doing that he knows those two artists at kirrin farmhouse for instance they may be in the plot too oh george dont be silly said julian you are making a mountain out of a molehill talking of plots and goodness knows what anyone would think we were in the middle of a big adventure well i think we are said george unexpectedly and she looked rather solemn i sort of feel it all round me a big adventure julian stared at his cousin thoughtfully could there possibly be anything in what she said julian will you do something for me said george of course said the boy at once go out and follow mr roland said george dont let him see you theres a white mackintosh cloak in the hall cupboard put it on and you wont be easily seen against the snow follow him and see if he meets anyone and gives them anything that looks like the pages of my fathers book you know those big pages he writes on theyre very large all right said julian but if i do promise you wont go and search his room you cant do things like that george i can said george but i wont if youll just follow mr roland for me im sure hes going to hand over what he has stolen to others who are in the plot and i bet those others will be the two artists at kirrin farmhouse that he pretended not to know youll find youre quite wrong said julian going to the door im sure i shant be able to follow mr roland anyway hes been gone five minutes now yes you will silly hell have left his footmarks in the snow said george and oh julian i quite forgot ta tell you something else exciting oh dear there isnt time now ill tell you when you come back if you can come up again then its about the secret way really said julian in delight it had been a great disappointment to him that all their hunting and searching had come to nothing all right ill try and creep up again later if i dont come youll know i cant and you must wait till bedtime he disappeared and shut the door quietly he slipped downstairs popped his head into the sittingroom and whispered to the others that he was going out after the tutor tell you why later he said he put the white mackintosh cloak around him and went out into the garden snow was beginning to fall again but not yet heavily enough to hide mr rolands deep footsteps he had had big wellington boots on and the footmarks showed up well in the sixinchdeep snow the boy followed them quickly the countryside was very wintrylooking now the sky was low and leaden and he could see there was much more snow to come he hurried on after mr roland though he could not see a sign of the tutor down the lane and over the path that led across the common went the double row of footmarks julian stumbled on his eyes glued to the footprints suddenly he heard the sound of voices and stopped a big gorse bush lay to the right and the voices came from there the boy went nearer to the bush he heard his tutors voice talking in low tones he could not hear a word that was said whoever can he be talking to he wondered he crept up closer to the bush there was a hollow space inside julian thought he could creep right into it though it would be very prickly and peer out of the other side carefully the boy crept into the prickly hollow where the branches were bare and brown he parted the prickly branches slowly and cautiously and to his amazement he saw mr roland talking to the two artists from kirrin farmhouse mr thomas and mr wilton so george was right the tutor had met them and as julian watched mr roland handed over to mr thomas a doubled up sheaf of papers they look just like pages from uncle quentins book said julian to himself i say this is mighty queer it does begin to look like a plot with mr roland as the centre of it mr thomas put the papers into the pocket of his overcoat the men muttered a few more words which even julians sharp ears could not catch and then parted the artists went off towards kirrin farmhouse and mr roland took the path back over the common julian crouched down in the hollow of the prickly gorse bush hoping the tutor would not turn and see him luckily he didnt he went straight on and disappeared into the snow which was now falling thickly it was also beginning to get dark and julian unable to see the path very clearly hurried after mr roland halfafraid of being lost in the snowstorm mr roland was not anxious to be out longer than he could help either he almost ran back to kirrin cottage he came to the gate at last and julian watched him go into the house he gave him a little time to take off his things and then giving timothy a pat as he went by he went to the garden door he took off his mackintosh cloak changed his boots and slipped into the sittingroom before mr roland had come down from his bedroom whats happened asked dick and anne seeing that julian was in a great state of excitement but he could not tell them for at that moment joanna came in to lay the tea much to julians disappointment he could not say a word to the others all that evening because one or other of the grownups was always in the room neither could he go up to see george he could hardly wait to tell his news but it was no good he had to is it still snowing aunt fanny asked anne her aunt went to the front door and looked out the snow was piled high against the step yes she said when she came back it is snowing fast and thickly if it goes on like this we shall be completely snowed up as we were two winters ago we couldnt get out of the house for five days then the milkman couldnt get to us nor the baker fortunately we had plenty of tinned milk and i can bake myown bread poor children you will not be able to go out tomorrow the snow will be too thick will kirrin farmhouse be snowed up too asked mr roland oh yes worse than we shall be said aunt fanny but they wont mind they have plenty of food there they will be prisoners just as much and more as we shall julian wondered why mr roland had asked that question was he afraid that his friends would not be able to send those pages away by the post or take them anywhere by bus or car the boy felt certain this was the reason for the question how he longed to be able to talk over everything with the others im tired he said about eight oclock lets go to bed dick and anne stared at him in astonishment usually as he was the eldest he went to bed last of all tonight he was actually asking to go julian winked quickly at them and they backed him up at once dick yawned widely and so did anne their aunt put down the sewing she was doing you do sound tired she said i think youd better all go to bed could i just go out and see if timmy is all right i asked julian his aunt nodded the boy put on his rubber boots and coat and slipped out through the garden door into the yard it was very deep in snow too tims kennel was halfhidden in it the dog had trampled a space in front of the kennel door and stood there looking for julian as he came out of the house poor old boy out here in the snow all alone said julian he patted the dog and timmy whined he was asking to go back with the boy i wish i could take you back with me said julian never mind timothy ill come and see you tomorrow he went indoors again the children said good night to their aunt and mr roland and went upstairs undress quickly put on dressinggowns and meet in georges room whispered julian to the others dont make a sound or well have aunt fanny up quick now in less than three minutes the children were undressed and were sitting on georges bed she was very pleased to see them anne slipped into bed with her because her feet were cold julian did you follow mr roland all right whispered george why did he follow him asked dick who had been dying to know julian told them everything as quickly as he could all that george suspected and how he had followed the tutor and what he had seen when george heard how julian had watched him giving a sheaf of papers to the two artists her eyes gleamed angrily the thief they must have been the lost pages and to think my father has been so friendly to him oh what can we do those men will get the papers away as quickly as they can and the secret father has been working on for ages will be used by someone else for some other country probably they cant get the papers away said julian youve no idea how thick the snow is now george we shall be prisoners here for a few days if this snow goes on and so will the people in kirrin farmhouse if they want to hide the papers they will have to hide them in the farmhouse if only we could get over there and hunt round well we cant said dick thats quite certain wed be up to our necks in snow the four children looked gloomily at one another dick and anne could hardly believe that the jolly mr roland was a thief a spy perhaps trying to steal a valuable secret from a friendly scientist and they couldnt stop it wed better tell your father said julian at last no said anne he wouldnt believe it would he george hed laugh at us and go straight and tell mr roland said george that would warn him and he mustnt be warned he mustnt know that we guess anything sh aunt fannys coming whispered dick suddenly the boys slipped out of the room and into bed anne hopped across to her own little bed all was peace and quiet when the childrens aunt came into the bedroom she said good night and tucked them up as soon as she had gone down the four children met together again in georges room george tell me now what you were going to say about the secret way said julian oh yes said george well there may be nothing in my idea at all but in the study downstairs there are eight wooden panels over the mantelpiece and the floor is of stone and the room faces east a bit queer isnt it just what the directions said is there a cupboard there too asked julian no but there is everything else said george and i was just wondering if by any chance the entrance to the secret way is in this house not in the farmhouse after all they both belonged to my family at one time you know the people living in the farmhouse years ago must have known all about this cottage golly george suppose the entrance was here said dick wouldnt it be simply marvellous lets go straight down and look dont be silly said julian go down to the study when uncle quentin is there id rather meet twenty lions than face uncle especially after what has happened well we simply must find out if georges idea is right we simply must said dick forgetting to whisper shut up idiot said julian giving him a punch do you want to bring the whole household up here sorry said dick but oh golly this is exciting its an adventure again just what i said said george eagerly listen shall we wait till midnight and then creep down to the study when everyone is asleep and try our luck there may be nothing in my idea at all but well have to find out now i dont believe i could go to sleep till ive tried one of those panels over the mantelpiece to see if something happens well i know i cant sleep a wink either said dick listen is that someone coming up wed better go come on julian meet in georges room at midnight and well creep down and try out georges idea the two boys went off to their own room neither of them could sleep a wink nor could george she lay awake and went over and over in her mind all that had happened those holidays its like a jigsaw puzzle she thought i couldnt understand a lot of things at first but now they are fitting together and making a picture anne was fast asleep she had to be awakened at midnight come on whispered julian shaking her dont you want to share in this adventure chapter fourteen the secret way at last the four children crept downstairs through the dark and silent night nobody made a sound at all they made their way to the study george softly closed the door and then switched on the light the children stared at the eight panels over the mantelpiece yes there were exactly eight four in one row and four in the row above julian spread the linen roll out on the table and the children pored over it the cross is in the middle of the second panel in the top row said julian in a low voice til try pressing it watch all of you he went to the fireplace the others followed him their hearts beating fast with excitement julian stood on tiptoe and began to press hard in the middle of the second panel nothing happened press harder tap itsaid dick i darent make too much noise said julian feeling all over the panel to see if there was any roughness that might tell of a hidden spring or lever suddenly under his hands the panel slid silently back just as the one had done at kirrin farmhouse in the hall the children stared at the space behind thrilled its not big enough to get into said george it cant be the entrance to the secret way julian got out his torch from his dressinggown pocket he put it inside the opening and gave a low exclamation theres a sort of handle here with strong wire or something attached to it ill pull it and see what happens he pulled but he was not strong enough to move the handle that seemed to be embedded in the wall dick put his hand in and the two boys then pulled together its moving its giving way a bit panted julian go on dick pull hard the handle suddenly came away from the wall and behind it came thick wire rusty and old at the same time a curious grating noise came from below the hearthrug in front of the fireplace and anne almost fell julian something is moving under the rug she said frightened i felt it under the rug quick the handle could not be pulled out any farther the boys let go and looked down to the right of the fireplace under the rug something had moved there was no doubt of that the rug sagged down instead of being flat and straight a stone has moved in the floor said julian his voice shaking with excitement this handle works a lever which is attached to this wire quick pull up the rug and roll back the carpet with trembling hands the children pulled back the rug and the carpet and then stood staring at a very strange thing a big flat stone laid in the floor had slipped downwards pulled in some manner by the wire attached to the handle hidden behind the panel there was now a black space where the stone had been look at that said george in a thrilling whisper the entrance to the secret way its here after all said julian lets go down said dick no said anne shivering at the thought of disappearing into the black hole julian flashed his torch into the black space the stone had slid down and then sideways below was a space just big enough to take a man bending down i expect theres a passage or something leading from here under the house and out said julian golly i wonder where it leads to we simply must find out said george not now said dick its dark and cold i dont fancy going along the secret way at midnight i dont mind just hopping down to see what its like but dont lets go along any passage till tomorrow uncle quentin will be working here tomorrow said julian he said he was going to sweep the snow away from the front door in the morning said george we could slip into the study then its saturday there may be no lessons all right said julian who badly wanted to explore everything then and there but for goodness sake lets have a look and see if there is a passage down there at present all we can see is a hole til help you down said dick so he gave his brother a hand and the boy dropped lightly down into the black space holding his torch he gave a loud exclamation its the entrance to the secret way all right theres a passage leading from here under the house awfully low and narrow but i can see its a passage i do wonder where it leads to he shivered it was cold and damp down there give me a hand up dirk he said he was soon out of the hole and in the warm study again the children looked at one another in the greatest joy and excitement this was an adventure a real adventure it was a pity they couldnt go on with it now well try and take timmy with us tomorrow said george oh i say how are we going to shut the entrance up we cant leave the rug and carpet sagging over that hole said dick noi can we leave the panel vopen well see if we can get the stone back said julian he stood on tiptoe and felt about inside the panel his hand closed on a kind of knob set deep in a stone he pulled it and at once the handle slid back pulled by the wire at the same time the sunk stone glided to the surface of the floor again making a slight grating sound as it did so well its like magic said dick it really is fancy the mechanism working so smoothly after years of not being used this is the most exciting thing ive evei seen there was a noise in the bedroom above the children stood still and listened its mr roland whispered dick hes heard us quick slip upstairs before he comes down they switched out the light and opened the study door softly up the stairs they fled as quietly as indians their hearts thumping so loudly that it seemed as if everyone in the house must hear the beat the girls got safely to their rooms and dick was able to slip into his but julian was seen by mr roland as he came out of his room with a torch what are you doing julian asked the tutor in surprise did you hear a noise downstairs i thought i did yes i heard quite a lot of noise downstairs said julian truthfully but perhaps its snow falling off the roof landing with a plop on the ground sir do you think thats it i dont know said the tutor doubtfully well go down and see they went down but of course there was nothing to be seen julian was glad they had been able to shut the panel and make the stone come back to its proper place again mr roland was the very last person he wanted to tell his secret to they went upstairs and julian slipped into his room is it all right whispered dick yes said julian dont lets talk mr rolands awake and i dont want him to suspect anything the boys fell asleep when they awoke in the morning there was a completely white world outside snow covered everything and covered it deeply timothys kennel could not be seen but there were footmarks round about it george gave a squeal when she saw how deep the snow was poor timothy im going to get him in i dont care what anyone says i wont let him be buried in the snow she dressed and tore downstairs she went out to the kennel floundering knee deep in the snow but there was no timmy there a loud bark from the kitchen made her jump joanna the cook knocked on the kitchen window its all right i couldnt bear the dog out there in the snow so i fetched him in poor thing your mother says i can have him in the kitchen but youre not to come and see him oh good timmys in the warmth said george gladly she yelled to joanna thanks awfully you are kind she went indoors and told the others they were very glad and ive got a bit of news for you said dick mr roland is in bed with a bad cold so there are to be no lessons today cheers golly that is good news said george cheering up tremendously timmy in the warm kitchen and mr roland kept in bed i do feel pleased we shall be able to explore the secret way safely now said julian aunt fanny is going to do something in the kitchen this morning with joanna and uncle is going to tackle the snow i vote we say well do lessons by ourselves in the sittingroom and then when everything is safe well explore the secret way but why must we do lessons asked george in dismay because if we dont silly well have to help your father dig away the snow said julian so to his uncles surprise julian suggested that the four children should do lessons by themselves in the sittingroom well i thought youd like to come and help dig away the snow said uncle quentin but perhaps you had better get on with your work the children sat themselves down as good as gold in the sittingroom their books before them they heard mr roland coughing in his room they heard their aunt go into the kitchen and talk to joanna they heard timmy scratching at the kitchen door then paws pattering down the passage then a big inquiring nose came round the door and there was old timmy looking anxiously for his beloved mistress timmy squealed george and ran to him she flung her arms round his neck and hugged him you act as if you hadnt seen tim for a year said julian it seems like a year said george i say theres my father digging away like mad cant we go to the study now we ought to be safe for a good while they left the sittingroom and went to the study julian was soon pulling the handle behind the secret panel george had already turned back the rug and the carpet the stone slid downward and sideways the secret way was open come on said julian hurry he jumped down itito the hole dick followed then anne then george julian pushed them all into the narrow low passage then he looked up perhaps he had better pull the carpet and rug over the hole in case anyone came into the room and looked around it took him a few seconds to do it then he bent down and joined the others in the passage they were going to explore the secret way at last chapter fifteen an exciting journey and hunt timothy had leapt down into the hole when george had jumped he now ran ahead of the children puzzled at their wanting to explore such a cold dark place both julian and dick had torches which threw broad beams before them there was not much to be seen the secret way under the old house was narrow and low so that the children were forced to go in single file and to stoop almost double it was a great relief to them when the passage became a little wider and the room a little higher it was very tiring to stoop all the time v have you any idea where the secret way is going dick asked julian i mean is it going towards the sea or away from it oh not towards the sea said julian who had a very good sense of direction as far as i can make out the passage is going towards the common look at the walls they are rather sandy in places and we know the common has sandy soil i hope we shant find that the passage has fallen in anywhere they went on and on the secret way was very straight though occasionally it wound round a rocky part in a curve isnt it dark and cold said anne shivering i wish i had put on a coat how many miles have we come julian not even one silly said julian hallo look here the passage has fallen in a bit thei e two bright torches shone in front of them and the children saw that the sandy roof had fallen in julian kicked at the pile of sandy soil with his foot its all right he said we can force our way through easily it isnt much of a fall and its mostly sand ill do a bit of kicking after some trampling and kicking the rooffall no longer blocked the way there was now enough room for the children to climb over it bending their heads low to avoid knocking them against the top of the passage julian shone his torch forward and saw that the way was clear the secret way is very wide just here he said suddenly and flashed his torch around to show the others its been widened out to make a sort of little room said george look theres a kind of bench at the back made out of the rock i believe its a restingplace george was right it was very tiring to creep along the narrow passage for so long the little wide place with its rocky bench made a very good restingplace the four tired children cold but excited huddled together on the queer seat and took a welcome rest timmy put his head on georges knee he was delighted to be with her again well come on said julian after a few minutes im getting awfully cold i do wonder where this passage comes out julian do you think it could come out at kirrin farmhouse asked george suddenly you know what mrs sanders said that there was a secret passage leading from the farmhouse somewhere well this may be the one and it leads to kirrin cottage george i believe youre right said julian yes the two houses belonged to your family years ago and in the old days there were often secret passages joining houses so its quite plain this secret way joins them up together why didnt i think of that before say squealed anne in a high excited voice i say ive thought of something too what asked everyone well if those two artists have got uncles papers we may be able to get them away before the men can send them off by post or take them away themselves squeaked anne so thrilled with her idea that she could hardly get the words out quickly enough theyre prisoners at the farmhouse because of the snow just as we were at the cottage anne youre right said julian clever girl said dick i say if we could get those papers again how wonderful it would be cried george timmy joined in the general excitement and jumped up and down in joy something had pleased the children so he was pleased too come on said julian taking annes hand this is thrilling if george is right and this secret way comes out at kirrin farmhouse somewhere well somehow hunt through those mens rooms and find the papers you said that searching peoples rooms was a shocking thing to do said george well i didnt know then all i know now said julian were doing this for your father and maybe for our country too if his secret formula is valuable weve got to set our wits to work now to outwit dangerous enemies do you really think they are dangerous asked anne rather afraid yes i should think so said julian but you neednt worry anne youve got me and dick and tim to protect you i can protect her too said george indignantly tm as good as a boy any day yes you are really said dick in fact youre fiercer than any boy i know come on said julian impatiently tm longing to get to the end of this passage they all went on again anne following behind julian and dick behind george timmy ran up and down the line squeezing by them whenever he wanted to he thought it was a very peculiar way to spend a morning julian stopped suddenly after they had gone a good way whats up asked dick from the back not another rooffall i hope no but i think weve come to the end of the passage said julian thrilled the others crowded as close to him as they could the passage certainly had come to an end there was a rocky wall in front of them and set firmly in it were iron staples intended for footholds these went up the wall and when julian turned his torch upwards the children saw that there was a square opening in the roof of the passage we have to climb up this rocky wall now said julian go through that dark hole there keep on climbing and goodness knows where we come out ill go first you wait here everyone and ill come back and tell you what ive seen the boy put his torch befween his teeth and then pulled himself up by the iron staples set in the wall he set his feet on them and then climbed up through the square dark hole feeling for the staples as he went he went up for a good way it was almost like going up a chimney shaft he thought it was cold and smelt musty suddenly he came to a ledge and he stepped on to it he took his torch from his teeth and flashed it around him there was stone wall behind him at the side of him and stone above him the black hole up which he had come yawned by his feet julian shone his torch in front of him and a shock of surprise went through him there was no stone wall in front of him but a big wooden door made of black oak a handle was set about waisthigh julian turned it with trembling fingers what was he going to see the door opened outwards over the ledge and it was difficult to get round it without falling back into the hole julian managed to open it wide squeezed round it without losing his footing and stepped beyond it expecting to find himself in a room but his hand felt more wood in front of him he shone his torch round and found that he was up against what looked like yet another door under his searching fingers it suddenly moved sideways and slid silently away and then julian knew where he was im in the cupboard at kirrin farmhouse the one that has a false back he thought the secret way comes up behind it how clever little did we know when we played about in this cupboard that not only did it have a sliding back but that it was the entrance to the secret way hidden behind it the cupboard was now full of clothes belonging to the artists julian stood and listened there was no sound of anyone in the room should he just take a quick look round and see if those lost papers were anywhere about then he remembered the other four waiting patiently below in the cold he had better go and tell them what had happened they could all come and help in the search he stepped into the space behind the sliding back the sliding door slipped across again and julian was left standing on the narrow ledge with the old oak door wide open to one side of him he did not bother to shut it he felt about with his feet and found the iron staples in the hole below him down he went clinging with his hands and feet his torch in his teeth again julian what a time youve been quick tell us all about it cried george its most terribly thrilling said julian absolutely super where do you suppose all this leads to into the cupboard at kirrin farmhouse the one thats got a false back golly said dick i say i said george did you go into the room cried anne i climbed as far as i could and came to a big oak door said julian it has a handle this side so i swung it wide open then i saw another wooden door in front of me at least i thought it was a door i didnt know it was just the false back of that cupboard it was quite easy to slide back and i stepped through and found myself among a whole lot of clothes hanging in the cupboard then i hurried back to tell you julian we can hunt for those papers now said george eagerly was there anyone in the room i couldnt hear anyone said julian now what i propose is this well all go up and have a hunt round those two rooms the men have the room next to the cupboard one too oh good said dick thrilled at the thought of such an adventure lets go now you go first ju then anne then george and then me what about tim asked george he cant climb silly said julian hes a simply marvellous dog but he certainly cant climb george well hav to leave him down here he wont like that said george well we cant carry him up said dick you wont mind staying here for a bit will you tim old fel tim wagged his tail but as he saw the four children mysteriously disappearing up the wall he put his big tail down at once what going without him how could they he jumped up at the wall and fell back he jumped again and whined george called down to him in a low voice be quiet tim dear we shant be long tim stopped whining he lay down at the bottom of the wall his ears wellcocked this adventure was becoming more and more peculiar soon the children were on the narrow ledge the old oak door was still wide open julian shone his torch and the others saw the false back of the cupboard julian put his hands on it and it slid silently sideways then the torch shone on coats and dressinggowns the children stood quite still listening there was no sound from the room til open the cupboard door and peep into the room whispered julian dont make a sound the boy pushed between the clothes and felt for the outer cupboard door with his hand he found it and pushed it slightly it opened a little and a shaft of daylight came into the cupboard he peeped cautiously into the room there was no one there at all that was good come on he whispered to the others the rooms empty p one by one the children crept out of the clothes cupboard and into the room there was a big bed there a washstand chest of drawers small table and two chairs nothing else it would be easy to search the whole room look julian theres a door between the two rooms said george suddenly two of us can go and hunt there and two here and we can lock the doors that lead on to the landing so that no one can come in and catch us good idea said julian who was afraid that at any moment someone might come in and catch them in their search anne and i will go into the next room and you and dick can search this one lock the door that opens on to the landing dick and ill lock the one in the other room well leave the connectingdoor open so that we can whisper to one another quietly the boy slipped through the connectingdoor into the second room which was very like the first that was empty too julian went over to the door that led to the landing and turned the key in the lock he heard dick doing the same to the door in the other room he heaved a big sigh now he felt safe anne turn up the rugs and see if any papers are hidden there he said then look under the chaircushions and strip the bed to see if anything is hidden under the mattress anne set to work and julian began to hunt too he started on the chest of drawers which he thought would be a very likely place to hide things in the childrens hands were shaking as they felt here and there for the lost papers it was so terribly exciting they wondered where the two men were down in the warm kitchen perhaps it was cold up here in the bedrooms and they would not want to be away from the warmth they could not go out because the snow was piled in great drifts round kirrin farmhouse dick and george were searching hard in the other room they looked in every drawer they stripped the bed they turned up rugs and carpet they even put their hands up the big chimneyplace julian have you found anything asked dick in a low voice appearing at the door between the two rooms not a thing said julian rather gloomily theyve hidden the papers well i only hope they havent got them on them in their pockets or something dick stared at him in dismay he hadnt thought of that that would be sickening he said you go back and hunt everywhere simply everywhere i ordered julian punch the pillows to see if theyve stuck them under the pillowcase dick disappeared rather a lot of noise came from his room it sounded as if he were doing a good deal of punching anne and julian went on hunting too there was simply nowhere that they did not look they even turned the pictures round to see if the papers had been stuck behind one of them but there was nothing to be found it was bitterly disappointing we cant go without finding them said julian in desperation it was such a bit of luck to get here like this down the secret way right into the bedrooms we simply must find those papers i say said dick appearing again i can hear voices listen all four children listened yes there were mens voices just outside the bedroom doors chapter sixteen the children are discovered what shall we do whispered george they had all tiptoed to the first room and were standing together listening wed better go down the secret way again said julian oh no we began george when she heard the handle of the door being turned whoever was trying to get in could not open the door there was an angry exclamation and then the children heard mr wiltons voice thomas my door seems to have stuck do you mind if i come through your bedroom and see whats the matter with this handle come right along came the voice of mr thomas there was the sound of footsteps going to the outer door of the second room then there was the noise of a handle being turned and shaken whats this said mr wilton in exasperation this wont open either can the doors be locked it looks like it said mr thomas there was a pause then the children distinctly heard a few words uttered in a low voice are the papers safe is anyone after them theyre in your room arent they said mr thomas there was another pause the children looked at one another so the men had got the papers and what was more they were in the room the very room the children stood in they looked round it eagerly racking their brains to think of some place they had not yet explored quick hunt round again whilst weve time whispered julian dont make a noise on tiptoe the children began a thorough hunt once more how they searched they even opened the pages of the books on the table thinking that the papers might have been slipped in there but they could find nothing hie mrs sanders came mr wiltons voice have you by any chance locked these two doors we cant get in dear me said the voice of mrs sanders from the stairs ill come along and see i certainly havent locked any doors once again the handles were turned but the doors would not open the men began to get very impatient do you suppose anyone is in our rooms mr wilton asked mrs sanders she laughed well now sir who would be in your rooms theres only me and mr sanders in the house and you know as well as i do that no one can come in from outside for were quite snowed up i dont understand it the locks of the doors must have slipped anne was lifting up the washstand jug to look underneath at that moment it was heavier than she thought and she had to let it down again suddenly it struck the marble washstand with a crash and water slopped out all over the place everyone outside the door heard the noise mr wilton banged on the door and rattled the handle whos there let us in or youll be sorry what are you doing in there idiot anne said dick now theyll break the door down that was exactly what the two men intended to do afraid that someone was mysteriously in their room trying to find the stolen papers they went quite mad and began to put their shoulders to the door and heave hard the door shook and creaked now you be careful what youre doing cried the indignant voice of mrs sanders the men took no notice there came a crash as they both tried out their double strength on the door quick we must go said julian we mustnt let the men know how we got here or we shant be able to come and hunt another time anne george dick get back to the cupboard quickly the children raced for the clothes cupboard til go first and help you down said julian he got out on to the narrow ledge and found the iron footholds with his feet down he went torch held between his teeth as usual anne come next he called and dick you come third and give a hand to anne if she wants it george is a good climber she can easily get down herself anne was slow at climbing down she was terribly excited rather frightened and so afraid of falling that she hardly dared to feel for each iron staple as she went down buck up anne whispered dick above her the men have almost got the door down there were tremendous sounds coming from the bedroom door at any moment now it might break down and the men would come racing in dick was thankful when he could begin to climb down the wall once they were all out georgfe could shut the big oak door and they would be safe george was hidden among the clothes in the cupboard waiting her turn to climb down as she stood there trying in vain to go over any likely hidingplace in her mind her hands felt something rustly in the pocket of a coat she was standing against it was a mackintosh coat with big pockets the little girls heart gave a leap suppose the papers had been left in the pocket of the coat the man had on when he took them from mr roland that was the only place the children had not searched the pockets of the coats in the cupboard with trembling fingers the girl felt in the pocket where the rustling was she drew out a sheaf of papers it was dark in the cupboard and she could not see if they were the ones she was hunting for or not but how she hoped they were she stuffed them up the front of her jersey for she had no big pocket and whispered to dick can i come now crash the door fell in with a terrific noise and the two men leapt into the room they looked round it was empty but there was the water spilt on the wash stand and on the floor someone must be there somewhere look in the cupboard said mr thomas george crept out of the clothes and on to the narrow ledge beyond the place where the false back of the cupboard used to be it was still hidden sideways in the wall the girl climbed down the hole a few steps and then shut the oak door which was now above her head she had not enough strength to close it completely but she hoped that now she was safe the men went to the cupboard and felt about in the clothes for anyone who might possibly be hiding there mr wilton gave a loud cry the papers are gone they were in this pocket theres not a sign of them quick thomas we must find the thief and get them back the men did not notice that the cupboard seemed to go farther back than usual they stepped away from it now that they were sure no one was there and began to hunt round the room by now all the children except george were at the bottom of the hole standing in the secret way waiting impatiently for george to come down poor george was in such a hurry to get down that she caught her skirt or one of the staples and had to stand in a very dangerous position trying to disentangle it come on george for goodness sake said julian timothy jumped up at the wall he could feel the fear and excitement of the waiting children and it upset him he wanted george why didnt she come why was she up that dark hole tim was unhappy about her he threw back his head and gave such a loud and mournful howl that all the children jumped violently shut up tim said julian tim howled again and the weird sound echoed round and about in a queer manner anne was terrified and she began to cry timothy howled again and again once he began to howl it was difficult to stop him the men in the bedroom above heard the extraordinary noise and stopped in amazement whatevers that said one sounds like a dog howling in the depths of the earth said the other tunny said mr wilton it seems to be coming from the direction of that cupboard he went over to it and opened the door tim chose that moment to give a specially mournful howl and mr wilton jumped he got into the cupboard and felt about at the back the oak door there gave way beneath his hand and he felt it open thomas theres something queer here called mr wilton bring my torch off the table tim howled again and the noise made mr wilton shiver tim had a peculiarly horrible howl it came echoing up the hole and burst out into the cupboard mr thomas got the torch the men shone it at the back of the cupboard and gave an exclamation look at that theres a door here where does it lead to mrs sanders who had been watching everything in surprise and indignation angry that her door should have been broken down came up to the cupboard my she said i knew there was a false back to that cupboard but i didnt know there was another door behind it too that must be the entrance to the secret way that people used in the old days where does it lead to rapped out mr wilton goodness knows said mrs sanders i never took much interest in such things come on thomas we must go down said mr wilton shining his torch into the square black hole and seeing the iron footholds set in the stone this is where the thief went he cant have got far well go after him weve got to get those papers back it was not long before the two men had swung themselves over the narrow ledge and down into the hole feeling with their feet for the iron staples down they went and down wondering where they were coming to there was no sound below them clearly the thief had got away george had got down at last tim almost knocked her over in his joy she put her hand on his head you old silly she said i believe youve given our secret away quick ju we must go because those men will be after us in a minute they could easily hear tims howling julian took annes hand come along anne he said you must run as fast as you can hurry now dick keep with george the four of them hurried down the dark narrow passage what a long way they had to go home if only the passage wasnt such a long one the childrens hearts were beating painfully as they made haste stumbling as they went julian shone his light steadily in front of him and dick shone his at the back halfleading halfdragging anne julian hurried along behind them they heard a shout look theres a light ahead thats the thief come on well soon get him chapter seventeen good old tim hurry anne do hurry shouted dick who was just behind poor anne was finding it very difficult to get along quickly pulled by julian and pushed by dick she almost fell two or three times her breath came in loud pants and she felt as if she would burst let rne have a rest she panted but there was no time for that with the two men hurrying after them they came to the piece that was widened out where the rocky bench was and anne looked longingly at it but the boys hurried her on suddenly the little girl caught her foot on a stone and fell heavily almost dragging julian down with her she tried to get up and began to cry ive hurt my foot ive twisted it oh julian it hurts me to walk well youve just got to come along darling said julian sorry for his little sister but knowing that they would all be caught if he was not firm hurry as much as you can but now it was impossible for anne to go fast she cried with pain as her foot hurt her and hobbled along so slowly that dick almost fell over her dick cast a look behind him and saw the light of the mens torches coming nearer and nearer whatever were they to do ill stay here with tim and keep them off said george suddenly here take these papers dick i believe theyre the ones we want but im not sure till we get a good light to see them i found them in a pocket of one of the coats in the cupboard golly said dick surprised he took the sheaf of papers and stuffed them up his jersey just as george had stuffed them up hers they were too big to go into his trousers pockets ill stay with you george and let the other two go on ahead no i want the papers taken to safety in case they are my fathers said george go on dick ill be all right here with tim i shall stay here just where the passage curves round this rocky bit ill make tim bark like mad suppose the men have got revolvers said dick doubtfully they might shoot him i bet they havent said george do go dick the men are almost here theres the light of their torch dick sped after the stumbling anne he told julian what george jbad suggested good for george said julian she really is marvellous not afraid of anything she will keep the men off till i get poor old anne back george was crouching behind the rocky bit her hand on tims collar waiting now tim she whispered bark your loudest now timothy had been growling up till now but at georges command he opened his big mouth and barked how he barked he had a simply enormous voice and the barks went echoing all down the dark and narrow passage the hurrying men who were near the rocky piece of the passage stopped if you come round this bend ill set my dog on you cried george its a child shouting said one man to another only a child come on timothy barked again and pulled at his collar he was longing to get at the men the light of their torch shone round the bend george let tim go and the big dog sprang joyfully round the curve to meet his enemies they suddenly saw him by the light of their torch and he was a very terrifying sight to begin with he was a big dog and now that he was angry all the hairs on the back of his neck had risen up making him look even more enormous his teeth were bared and glinted in the torchlight the men did not like the look of him at all if you move one step nearer ill tell my dog to fly at you shouted george wait tim wait stand there till i give the word the dog stood in the light of the torch growling deeply he looked an extremely fierce animal the men looked at him doubtfully one man took a step forward and george heard him at once she shouted to tim go for him tim go for him tim leapt at the mans throat he took him completely by surprise and the man fell to the ground with a thud trying to beat off the dog the other man helped call off your dog or well hurt him cried the second man its much more likely hell hurt you i said george coming out from behind the rock and enjoying the fun tim come off tim came away from the man he was worrying looking up at his mistress as if to say i was having such a good time why did you spoil it who are you said the man on the ground tm not answering any of your questions said george go back to kirrin farmhouse thats my advice to you if you dare to come along this passage ill set my dog on to you again and next time hell do a little more damage the men turned and went back the way they had come they neither of them wanted to face tim again george waited until she could no longer see the light of their torch then she bent down and patted timothy brave good dog she said i love you darling tim and you dont know how proud i am of you come along well hurry after the others now i expect those two men will explore this passage some time tonight and wont they get a shock when they find out where it leads to and see who is waiting for them george hurried along the rest of the long passage with tim running beside her she had dicks torch and it did not take her long to catch the others up she panted out to them what had happened and even poor anne chuckled in delight when she heard how tim had flung mr wilton to the ground here we are said julian as the passage came to a stop below the hole in the study floor hallo whats this a bright light was shining down the hole and the rug and carpet so carefully pulled over the hole by julian were now pulled back again the children gazed up in surprise uncle quentin was there and aunt fanny and when they saw the childrens faces looking up at them from the hole they were so astonished that they very nearly fell down the hole too julian anne what in the wide world are you doing down there cried uncle quentin he gave them each a hand up and the four children and timothy were at last safe in the warm study how good it was to feel warm again they got as near the fire as they could children what is the meaning of this asked aunt fanny she looked white and worried i came into the study to do some dusting and when i stood on that bit of the rug it seemed to give way beneath me when i pulled it up and turned back the carpet i saw that hole and the hole in the panelling too and then i found that all of you had disappeared and went to fetch your uncle what has been happening and where does that hole lead to dick took the sheaf of papers from under his jersey and gave them to george she took them and handed them to her father are these the missing pages she asked her father fell on them as if they had been worth more than a hundred times their weight in gold yes yes theyre the pages all three of them thank goodness theyre back they took me three years to bring to perfection and contained the heart of my secret formula george where did you get them its a very long story said george you tell it all julian i feel tired julian began to tell the tale he left out nothing he told how george had found mr roland snooping about the study how she had felt sure that the tutor had not wanted timmy in the house because the dog gave warning of his movements at night how george had seen him talking to the two artists although he had said he did not know them as the tale went on uncle quentin and aunt fanny looked more and more amazed they simply could not believe it all but after all there were the missing papers safely back that was marvellous uncle quentin hugged the papers as if they were a precious baby he would not put them down for a moment george told the bit about timmy keeping the men off the escaping children so you see although you made poor tim live out in the cold away from me he really saved us all and your papers too she said to her father fixing her brilliant blue eyes on him her father looked most uncomfortable he felt very guilty for having punished george and timothy they had been right about mr roland and he had been wiong poor george he said and poor timmy im sorry about all that george did not bear malice once anyone had owned themselves to be in the wrong she smiled at her father its all right she said but dont you think that as i was punished unfairly mr roland might be punished well and truly he deserves it oh he shall be certainly he shall be promised her father hes up in bed with a cold as you know i hope he doesnt hear any of this or he may try to escape he cant said george were snowed up you could ring up the police and arrange for them to come here as soon as ever they can manage it when the snow has cleared and i rather think those other two men will try to explore the secret way as soon as possible to get the papers back could we catch them when they arrive do you think rather said uncle quentin though aunt fanny looked as if she didnt want any more exciting things to happen now look here you seem really frozen all of you and you must be hungry too because its almost dinnertime go into the diningroom and sit by the fire and joanna shall bring us all a hot lunch then well talk about what to do nobody said a word to mr roland of course he lay in bed coughing now and then george had slipped up and locked his door she wasnt going to have him wandering out and overhearing anything they all enjoyed their hot dinner and became warm and cosy it was nice to sit there together talking over their adventure and planning what to do i will telephone to the police of course said uncle quentin and tonight we will put timmy into the study to give the two artists a good welcome if they arrive mr roland was most annoyed to find his door locked that afternoon when he took it into his head to dress and go downstairs he banged on it indignantly george grinned and went upstairs she had told the other children how she had locked the door whats the matter mr roland she asked in a polite voice oh its you george is it said the tutor well see whats the matter with my door will you i cant open it george had pocketed the key when she had locked the door she answered mr roland in a cheerful voice oh mr roland theres no key in your door so i cant unlock it ill see if i can find it mr roland was angry and puzzled he couldnt understand why his door was locked and the key gone he did not guess that everyone knew about him now uncle quentin laughed when george went down and told him about the locked door he may as well be kept a prisoner he said he cant escape now that night everyone went to bed early and timmy was left in the study guarding the hole mr roland had become more and more angry and puzzled when his door was not unlocked he had shouted for uncle quentin but only george had come he could not understand it george of course was enjoying herself she made timothy bark outside mr rolands door and this puzzled him too for he knew that george was not supposed to see timmy forthree days wild thoughts raced through his head had that fierce impossible child locked up her father and mother and joanna as well as himself he could not imagine what had happened in the middle of the night timmy awoke everyone by barking madly uncle quentin and the children hurried downstairs followed by aunt fanny and the amazed joanna a fine sight met their eyes mr wilton and mr thomas were in the study crouching behind the sofa terrified of timothy who was barking for all he was worth timmy was standing by the hole in the stone floor so that the two men could not escape down there artful timmy he had waited in silence until the men had crept up the hole into the study and were exploring it wondering where they were and then the dog had leapt to the hole to guard it preventing the men from escaping good evening mr wilton good evening mr thomas said george in a polite voice have you come to see our tutor mr roland so this is where he lives said mr wilton was it you in the passage today yes and my cousins said george have you come to look for the papers you stole from my father the two men were silent they knew they were caught mr wilton spoke after a moment wheres roland shall we take these men to mr roland uncle asked julian winking at george although its in the middle of the night im sure he would love to see them yes said his uncle jumping at once to what the boy meant to do take them up timmy you go too the men followed julian upstairs timmy close at their heels george followed too grinning she handed julian the key he unlocked the door and the men went in just as julian switched on the light mr roland was wide awake and gave an exclamation of complete amazement when he saw his friends before they had time to say a word julian locked the door again and threw the key to george a nice little bag of prisoners he said we will leave old tim outside the door to guard them its impossible to get out of that window and anyway were snowed up if they could escape that way everyone went to bed again but the children found it difficult to sleep after such an exciting time anne and george whispered together and so did julian and dick there was such a lot to talk about next day there was a surprise for everyone the police did arrive after all the snow did not stop them for somewhere or other they had got skis and had come skimming along valiantly to see the prisoners it was a great excitement for everyone we wont take the men away sir till the snow has gone said the inspector well just put the handcuffs on them so that they dont try any funny tricks you keep the door locked too and that dog outside theyll be safe there for a day or two weve taken them enough food till we come back again if they go a bit short it will serve them right the snow melted two days later and the police took away mr roland and the others the children watched them go no more lessons these holls said anne gleefully no more shutting timothy out of the house said george you were right and we were wrong george said julian you were fierce werent you but its a jolly good thing you were she is fierce isnt she said dick giving the girl a sudden hug but i rather like her when shes fierce dont you julian oh george we do have marvellous adventures with you i wonder if well have any more they will there isnt a doubt of that the end
