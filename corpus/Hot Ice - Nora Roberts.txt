 chapter one he was running for his life and it wasnt the first time as he raced by tiffanys elegant window display he hoped it wouldnt be his last the night was cool with april rain slick on the streets and sidewalk there was a breeze that even in manhattan tasted pleasantly of spring he was sweating they were too damn close fifth avenue was quiet even sedate at this time of night streetlights intermittently broke the darkness traffic was light it wasnt the place to lose yourself in a crowd as he ran by fiftythird he considered ducking down into the subway below the tishman building but if they saw him go in he might not come back out doug heard the squeal of tires behind him and whipped around the corner at cartiers he felt the sting in his upper arm heard the muffled pop of a silenced bullet but never slackened his pace almost at once he smelled the blood now they were getting nasty and he had the feeling they could do a lot worse but on fiftysecond street were people a group here and there some walking some standing here there was noise raised voices music his labored breathing went unnoticed quietly he stood behind a redhead who was four or five inches taller than his own six feet and half again as wide she was swaying to the music that poured out of her portable stereo it was like hiding behind a tree in a windstorm doug took the opportunity to catch his breath and check his wound he was bleeding like a pig without giving it a thought he slipped the striped bandana out of the redheads back pocket and wrapped it around his arm she never stopped swaying he had very light fingers it was more difficult to kill a man outright when there was a crowd he decided not impossible just harder doug kept his pace slow and faded in and out of the packs of people while he kept his eyes and ears open for the discreet black lincoln near lexington he saw it pull up a half block away and he saw the three men in trim dark suits get out they hadnt spotted him yet but it wouldnt be long thinking fast he scanned the crowd hed merged with the black leather with the two dozen zippers might work hey he grabbed the arm of the boy beside him ill give you fifty bucks for your jacket the boy with pale spiked hair and a paler face shrugged him off fuck off its leather a hundred then doug muttered the three men were getting closer all the time this time the boy took more interest he turned his face so that doug saw the tiny tattooed vulture on his cheek two hundred and its yours doug was already reaching for his wallet for two hundred i want the shades too the boy whipped off the wraparound mirrored sunglasses you got em here let me help you off with that in a quick move doug yanked the boys jacket off after stuffing bills in the boys hand he pulled it on letting out a hiss of breath at the pain in his left arm the jacket smelled not altogether pleasantly of its previous owner ignoring it doug tugged the zipper up look therere three guys in undertaker suits coming this way theyre scouting out for extras for a billy idol video you and your friends here should get yourselves noticed oh yeah and as the boy turned around with his best boredteenagers look on his face doug was diving through the nearest door inside wallpaper shimmered in pale colors under dimmed lights people sat at white linencovered tables under artdeco prints the gleam of brass rails formed a path to more private dining rooms or to a mirrored bar with one whiff doug caught the scent of french cooking sage burgundy thyme briefly he considered hustling his way past the maitre d to a quiet table then decided the bar was better cover affecting a bored look he stuck his hands in his pockets and swaggered over even as he leaned on the bar he was calculating how and when to make his exit whiskey he pushed the wraparound shades more firmly onto his nose seagrams leave the bottle he stood hunched over it his face turned ever so slightly toward the door his hair was dark curling into the collar of the jacket his face was cleanshaven and lean his eyes hidden behind the mirrored glasses were trained on the door as he downed the first fiery taste of whiskey without pausing he poured a second shot his mind was working out all the alternatives hed learned to think on his feet at an early age just as hed learned to use his feet to run if that was the best solution he didnt mind a fight but he liked to have the odds in his favor he could deal straight or he could skim over the finer points of honesty depending on what was the most profitable what he had strapped to his chest could be the answer to his taste for luxury and easy living the taste hed always wanted to cultivate what was outside combing the streets for him could be a quick end to living at all weighing one against the other doug opted to shoot for the pot of gold the couple beside him were discussing the latest mailer novel in earnest voices another group tossed around the idea of heading to a club for jazz and cheaper booze the crowd at the bar was mostly single he decided here to drink off the tension of a business day and show themselves to other singles there were leather skirts threepiece suits and hightopped sneakers satisfied doug pulled out a cigarette he could have chosen a worse place to hide a blonde in a dove gray suit slid onto the stool beside him and flicked her lighter at the end of his cigarette she smelled of chanel and vodka crossing her legs she downed the rest of her drink havent seen you in here before doug gave her a brief look enough to take in the slightly blurred vision and the predatory smile another time hed have appreciated it no he poured another shot my office is a couple of blocks from here even after three stolichnayas she recognized something arrogant something dangerous in the man beside her interested she swiveled a little closer im an architect the hair on the back of his neck stood up when they walked in the three of them looked neat and successful shifting he looked over the blondes shoulder as they separated one of them stood idly by the door the only way out attracted rather than discouraged by his lack of response the blonde laid a hand on dougs arm and what do you do he let the whiskey lie in his mouth for just a moment before he swallowed and sent it spreading through his system i steal he told her because people rarely believe the truth she smiled as she took out a cigarette then handed him her lighter and waited for doug to flick it on for her fascinating im sure she blew out a quick thin stream of smoke and plucked the lighter from his fingers why dont you buy me a drink and tell me all about it a pity hed never tried that line before since it seemed to work so well a pity the timing was all wrong because she filled out the little suit neater than a cpa filled out a not tonight sugar keeping his mind on business doug poured more whiskey and stayed out of the light the impromptu disguise might work he felt the pressure of a gun barrel against his ribs then again it might not outside lord mr dimitris upset that you didnt keep your appointment yeah casually he swirled the whiskey in his glass thought id have a couple of drinks first remo mustve lost track of time the barrel dug into his ribs again mr dimitri likes his employees to be prompt doug downed the whiskey watching in the mirror behind the bar as the two other men took position behind him already the blonde was backing off to look for an easier mark am i fired he poured another glass and figured the odds three to one they were armed he wasnt but then of the three of them only remo had what could pass for a brain mr dimitri likes to fire his employees in person remo grinned and showed perfectly capped teeth under a pencilthin moustache and he wants to give you real special attention okay doug placed one hand on the whiskey bottle the other on the glass how about a drink first mr dimitri doesnt like drinking on the job and youre late lord real late yeah well its a shame to waste good booze whirling he tossed the whiskey into remos eyes and swung the bottle into the face of the suited man at his right with the impetus of the swing he ran headlong into the third man so that they fell backward onto the dessert display chocolate soufflé and rich french cream flew in a symphony of highcaloric rain wrapped around each other like lovers they rolled into the lemon torte terrible waste doug muttered and pushed a handful of strawberry mousse into the other mans face knowing the element of surprise would wear out quickly doug used the most expeditious means of defense he brought his knee up hard between his opponents legs then he ran put it on dimitris tab he called out as he pushed his way through tables and chairs on impulse he grabbed a waiter then shoved him and his loaded tray in remos direction roast squab flew like a bullet with one hand on the brass rail he leapt over and scrambled for the door he left the chaos behind him and broke into the street hed bought some time but theyd be behind him again and this time theyd be mean doug headed uptown on foot wondering why the hell you could never find a cab when you needed one traffic was light on the long island expressway as whitney headed into town her flight from paris had landed at kennedy an hour behind schedule the back seat and trunk of her little mercedes were crammed with luggage the radio was turned up high so that the gritty strains of springsteens latest hit could ricochet through the car and out the open window the twoweek trip to france had been a gift to herself for finally working up the courage to break off her engagement to tad carlyse iv no matter how pleased her parents had been she just couldnt marry a man who colorcoordinated his socks and ties whitney began to sing harmony with springsteen as she tooled around a slowermoving compact she was twentyeight attractive moderately successful in her own career while having enough family money to back her up if things got really tough she was accustomed to affluence and deference shed never had to demand either one only expect them she enjoyed being able to slip into one of new yorks posher clubs late at night and find it filled with people she knew she didnt mind if the paparazzi snapped her or if the gossip columns speculated on what her latest outrage would be shed often explained to her frustrated father that she wasnt outrageous by design but by nature she liked fast cars old movies and italian boots at the moment she was wondering if she should go home or drop in at elaines and see whod been up to what in the past two weeks she didnt feel jet lag but a trace of boredom more than a trace she admitted she was nearly smothered with it the question was what to do about it whitney was the product of new money big money shed grown up with the world at her fingertips but she hadnt always found it interesting enough to reach for where was the challenge she wondered where was the she hated to use the word purpose her circle of friends was wide and from the outside appeared to be diverse but once you got in once you really saw beneath the silk dresses or chinos there was a sameness to these young urbane wealthy pampered people where was the thrill that was better she thought thrill was an easier word to deal with than purpose it wasnt a thrill to jet to aruba if you only had to pick up the phone to arrange it her two weeks in paris had been quiet and soothing and uneventful uneventful maybe that was the crux she wanted something something more than she could pay for with a check or credit card she wanted action whitney also understood herself well enough to know she could be dangerous in this kind of mood but she wasnt in the mood to go home alone and unpack then again she wasnt feeling much like a club crowded with familiar faces she wanted something new something different she could try one of the new clubs that were always popping up if she liked she could have a couple of drinks and make conversation then if the club interested her enough she could drop a few words in the right places and make it the newest hot spot in manhattan the fact that she had the power to do so didnt astonish her or even particularly please her it simply was whitney squealed to a halt at a red light to give herself time to make up her mind it seemed like nothing was happening in her life lately there wasnt any excitement any well zing she was more surprised than alarmed when her passenger door was yanked open one look at the black zippered jacket and wraparound glasses of the hitchhiker had her shaking her head you arent keeping up with fashion trends she told him doug shot a look over his shoulder the street was clear but it wouldnt be for long he jumped in and slammed the door drive forget it i dont drive around with guys who wear last years clothes take a walk doug stuck his hand in his pocket using his forefinger to simulate the barrel of a gun drive he repeated she looked at his pocket then back at his face on the radio the disk jockey announced a full hour of blasts from the past vintage stones began to pour out if theres a gun in there i want to see it otherwise take off of all the cars he couldve picked why the hell wasnt she shaking and pleading like any normal person wouldve done dammit i dont want to have to use this but if you dont throw this thing in gear and get moving im going to have to put a hole in you whitney stared at her own reflection in his glasses mick jagger was demanding that someone give him shelter bullshit she said her diction exquisite doug gave a moments consideration to knocking her cold dumping her out and taking the car another glance over his shoulder showed him there wasnt much time to waste look lady if you dont get moving therere three men in that lincoln coming up behind us thatll do a lot of damage to your toy here she looked in the rearview mirror and saw the big black car slowing down as it approached my father had a car like that once she commented i always called it his funeral car yeah get it in gear or its going to be my funeral whitney frowned watching the lincoln in her rearview mirror then impulsively decided to see what would happen next she threw the car into first and zipped across the intersection the lincoln immediately picked up the pace theyre following of course theyre following doug spat out and if you dont step on it theyre going to crawl into the back seat and shake hands mostly out of curiosity whitney punched the gas and turned down fiftyseventh the lincoln stayed with her theyre really following she said again but with a grin of excitement cant this thing go any faster she turned the grin on him are you kidding before he could respond she gunned the engine and was off like a shot this was definitely the most interesting way to spend the evening she could imagine think i can lose them whitney looked behind her craning her neck to see if the lincoln was still following ever see bullitt of course we dont have any of those nifty hills but hey watch it whitney turned back around and whipping the wheel skimmed around a slowermoving sedan look doug gritted his teeth the whole purpose of this is to stay alive you watch the road ill watch the lincoln dont be so snotty whitney careened around the next corner i know what im doing look where youre going doug grabbed the wheel yanking it so that the fender missed a car parked at the curb damn idiot woman whitney lifted her chin if youre going to be insulting youll just have to get out slowing down she swung toward the curb for gods sake dont stop i dont tolerate insults now down doug hauled her sideways and pulled her down to the seat just before the windshield exploded into spiderweb cracks my car she struggled to sit up but only managed to twist her head to survey the damage goddamn it it didnt have a scratch on it ive only had it for two months its going to have a lot more than a scratch if you dont step on the gas and keep going from his crouched position doug twisted the wheel toward the street and peered cautiously over the dash now infuriated whitney stepped hard on the accelerator moving blindly into the street while doug held onto the wheel with one hand and held her down with the other i cant drive this way you cant drive with a bullet in your head either a bullet her voice didnt crack with fear but vibrated with annoyance theyre shooting at us they aint throwing rocks tightening his grip he spun the wheel so that the car bumped into the curb and around the next corner frustrated that he couldnt take the controls himself he took a cautious look behind the lincoln was still there but theyd gained a few seconds okay sit up but keep low and for chrissake keep moving howm i supposed to explain this to the insurance company whitney poked up her head and tried to find a clear spot in the broken windshield theyre never going to believe someone was shooting at me and ive already got a filthy record do you know what my rates are the way you drive i can imagine well ive had enough setting her jaw whitney turned left this is a oneway street he looked around helplessly didnt you see the sign i know its a oneway street she muttered and pressed harder on the gas its also the quickest way across town oh jesus doug watched the headlights bearing down on them automatically he gripped the door handle and braced for the impact if he was going to die he thought fatalistically hed rather be shot nice and clean through the heart than be spread all over a street in manhattan ignoring the screams of horns whitney jerked the car to the right then to the left fools and small animals doug thought as they breezed between two oncoming cars god looked out for fools and small animals he could only be grateful he was with a fool theyre still coming doug turned in the seat to watch the progress of the lincoln somehow it was easier if he didnt watch where he was going they bounced from side to side as she maneuvered between cars then with a force that threw him against the door she turned another corner doug swore and grabbed for the wound on his arm pain began again with a low insistent thud stop trying to kill us will you they dont need any help always complaining whitney tossed back let me tell you something youre not a real fun guy i tend to get moody when somebodys trying to kill me well try to lighten up a bit whitney suggested she barreled around the next corner skimming the curb youre making me nervous doug flopped back in his seat and wondered why with all the possibilities it had to end this way smashed into unrecognizable pulp in some crazy womans mercedes he couldve gone quietly with remo and had dimitri murder him with some ritual thered have been more justice in that they were on fifth again moving south at what doug saw was better than ninety as they went through a puddle water slushed up as far as the window even now the lincoln was less than a half block behind dammit they just wont shake lose oh yeah whitney set her teeth and gave the mirror a quick check shed never been a gracious loser watch this before doug could draw a breath she whipped the mercedes around in a tight uturn and headed deadon for the lincoln he watched with a kind of fascinated dread oh my god remo in the passenger seat of the lincoln echoed the sentiment just before his driver lost courage and steered toward the curb the speed took them over it across the sidewalk and with an impressive flourish through the plateglass window of godiva chocolatiers without slackening pace whitney spun the mercedes around again and cruised down fifth dropping back in his seat doug let out a series of long deep breaths lady he managed to say you got more guts than brains and you owe me three hundred bucks for the windshield rather sedately she pulled into the underground parking of a high rise yeah absently he patted his chest and torso to see if he was all in one piece ill send you a check cash after pulling into her space whitney turned off the ignition and hopped out now you can carry my luggage up she popped the trunk before she strolled toward the elevator maybe her knees were shaking but shed be damned if shed admit it i want a drink doug looked back toward the entrance of the garage and calculated his chances on the street maybe an hour or so inside would give him the chance to outline the best plan and he supposed he owed her he started to haul out the luggage theres more in the back ill get it later he slung a garment bag over his shoulder and hoisted two cases gucci he noted with a smirk and she was bitching about a lousy three hundred doug walked into the elevator and dumped the two cases unceremoniously on the floor been on a trip whitney punched the button for the fortysecond floor a couple of weeks in paris couple of weeks doug glanced at the three bags and shed said there were more travel light do you i travel whitney said rather grandly as i please ever been to europe he grinned and though the sunglasses hid his eyes she found the smile appealing he had a wellshaped mouth and teeth that werent quite straight few times they measured each other in silence it was the first opportunity doug had had to really look at her she was taller than hed expected though he wasnt altogether sure just what hed expected her hair was almost completely hidden under an angled white fedora but what he could see was as pale as the punkers hed stopped on the street though a richer shade the brim of the hat shaded her face but he could see a flawless ivory complexion over elegant bones her eyes were round the color of the whiskey hed downed earlier her mouth was naked and unsmiling she smelled like something soft and silky you wanted to touch in a dark room she was what hed have termed a stunner though she didnt appear to have any obvious curves beneath the simple sable jacket and silk slacks doug had always preferred the obvious in women perhaps the flamboyant still he didnt find it any real hardship to look at her casually whitney reached in her snakeskin bag and drew out her keys those glasses are ridiculous yeah well they served their purpose he took them off his eyes surprised her they were very light very clear and green somehow they were at odds with his face and his coloring until you noticed how direct they were and how carefully they watched as if he were a man who measured everything and everyone he hadnt worried her before the glasses had made him appear silly and harmless now whitney had her first stirrings of discomfort who the hell was he and why were men shooting at him when the doors slid open doug bent to pick up the suitcases whitney glanced down and noticed the thin stream of red dripping down his wrist youre bleeding doug looked down dispassionately yeah which way she hesitated only a moment she could be just as cavalier as he to the right and dont bleed on those cases breezing past him she turned the key in the lock through annoyance and pain doug noticed she had quite a walk slow and loose with an elegant sort of swing it made him conclude that she was a woman accustomed to being followed by men deliberately he came up alongside her whitney spared him a glance before she pushed open the door then flicking on the lights she walked inside and went directly to the bar she chose a bottle of remy martin and poured generous amounts into two glasses impressive doug thought as he took stock of her apartment the carpet was so thick and soft he could be happy sleeping on it he knew enough to recognize the french influence in her furnishings but not enough to pin down the period shed used deep sapphire blue and mustard yellow to offset the stunning white of the carpet he could spot an antique when he saw one and he spotted quite a few in this room her romantic taste was as obvious to him as the monet seascape on the wall a damn good copy he decided if he just had the time to hock it he could be on his way it didnt take more than a cursory glance to make him realize he could fill his zippered pockets with handfuls of her fancy french whatnots to pawn for a firstclass ticket that would get him far away from this burg trouble was he didnt dare deal in any pawnshop in the city not now that dimitri had his tentacles out because the furnishings werent of any use to him he wasnt sure why they appealed normally he would have found them too feminine and formal perhaps after an evening of running he needed the comfort of silk pillows and lace whitney sipped her cognac as she carried the glasses across the room you can bring this into the bathroom she told him as she handed him his drink negligently she tossed the fur over the back of the sofa ill take a look at that arm doug frowned while he watched her walk away women were supposed to ask questions dozens of them maybe this one just didnt have the brains to think of them reluctantly he followed her and the trail of her scent but she was classy he admitted there was no denying it take off that jacket and sit down she ordered running water over a monogrammed washcloth doug stripped off the jacket gritting his teeth as he peeled it from his left arm after carefully folding it and laying it on the lip of the tub he sat on a ladderback chair anyone else would have had in their living room he looked down and saw the sleeve of his shirt was caked with blood swearing he ripped it off and exposed the wound i can do it myself he muttered and reached for the cloth be still whitney began to wipe away the dried blood with the soapy warm cloth i cant very well see how much damage was done until i clean it up he sat back because the warm water was soothing and her touch was gentle but while he sat back he watched her just what kind of woman was she he wondered she drove like a nerveless maniac dressed like harpers bazaar and drank hed noticed shed already knocked back her cognac like a sailor hed have been more comfortable if shed shown just a touch of the hysteria hed expected dont you want to know how i got this hmmm whitney pressed a clean cloth to the wound to slow the new bleeding because he wanted her to ask she was determined not to a bullet doug said with relish really interested whitney removed the cloth to get a closer look ive never seen a bullet wound before terrific he swallowed more cognac how do you like it she shrugged before she slid back the mirrored door of the medicine cabinet its not terribly impressive frowning he looked down at the wound himself true the bullet had only nicked him but he had been shot it wasnt every day a man got shot it hurts aw well well bandage it all up scratches dont hurt nearly so much if you cant see them he watched her root through jars of face cream and bath oils youve got a smart mouth lady whitney she corrected whitney macallister turning she offered her hand formally his lips curved lord doug lord hello doug now after i fix this up well have to discuss the damage to my car and the payment she went back to the medicine cabinet three hundred dollars he took another swallow of cognac how come you know its three hundred im giving you the low end of the scale you cant fix a spark plug in a mercedes for less than three hundred ill have to owe you i spent my last two hundred on the jacket that jacket amazed whitney twisted her head and stared at him you look smarter i needed it doug tossed back besides its leather this time she laughed as in genuine imitation what dyou mean imitation that zippered monstrosity didnt come off any cow ah here it is i knew i had some with a satisfied nod she took a bottle from the cabinet that little sonofabitch doug mumbled he hadnt had the time or the opportunity to look too closely at his purchase before now in the bright bathroom light he saw it was nothing more than cheap vinyl two hundred dollars worth the sudden fire in his arm had him jerking goddamn it whatre you doing iodine whitney told him smearing it on generously he settled down scowling it stings dont be a baby briskly she wrapped gauze around his upper arm until the wound was covered she snipped off tape secured it then gave it a final pat there she said rather pleased with herself good as new still bent over she turned her head and smiled at him their faces were close hers full of laughter his full of annoyance now about my car i could be a murderer a rapist a psychopath for all you know he said it softly dangerously she felt a tremor move up her back and straightened i dont think so but she picked up her empty glass and went back into the living room another drink damn she did have guts doug grabbed the jacket and followed her dont you want to know why they were after me the bad guys the the bad guys he repeated on an astonished laugh good guys dont shoot at innocent bystanders she poured herself another drink then sat on the sofa so by process of elimination i figure youre the good guy he laughed again and dropped down beside her a lot of people might disagree with you whitney studied him again over the rim of her glass no perhaps good was too concise a word he looked more complicated than that well why dont you tell me why those three men wanted to kill you just doing their job doug drank again they work for a man named dimitri he wants something ive got which is the route to a pot of gold he said absently rising he began to pace less than twenty dollars in cash nestled with an expired credit card in his pocket neither could buy his way out of the country what he had carefully folded in a manila envelope was worth a fortune but he had to buy himself a ticket before he could cash it in he could lift a wallet at the airport better he could try rushing on the plane flashing his fake id and play the hardbitten impatient fbi agent it had worked in miami but it didnt feel right this time he knew enough to go with his instincts i need a stake he muttered a few hundred maybe a thousand thoughtfully he turned back and looked at whitney forget it she said simply you already owe me three hundred dollars youll get it he snapped dammit in six months ill buy you a whole car look at it as an investment my broker takes care of that she sipped again and smiled he was very attractive in this mood restless anxious to move his exposed arm rippled with muscle that was subtle and lean his eyes were lit with enthusiasm look whitney he came back and sat on the arm of the sofa beside her a thousand thats nothing after what weve been through together its seven hundred dollars more than what you already owe me she corrected him ill pay you back double within six months i need to buy a plane ticket some supplies he looked down at himself then back at her with that quick appealing grin a new shirt an operator she thought intrigued just what did a pot of gold mean to him id have to know a lot more before i put my money down hed charmed women out of more than money so confidently he took her hand between his rubbing his thumb over her knuckles his voice was soft compelling treasure the kind you only read about in fairy stories ill bring you back diamonds for your hair big glittery diamonds theyll make you look like a princess he skimmed a finger up her cheek it was soft cool for a moment only a moment he lost the thread of his pitch something else out of a fairy story slowly he removed her hat then watched in astonished admiration as her hair tumbled down over her shoulders over her arms pale as winter sunlight soft as silk diamonds he repeated tangling his fingers through it hair like this should have diamonds in it she was caught up in him part of her would have believed anything he said done anything he asked as long as he continued to touch her in just that way but it was the other part the survivor who managed to take control i like diamonds but i also know a lot of people who pay for them and end up with pretty glass guarantees douglas to distract herself she drank more cognac i always want to see the guarantee the certificate of value frustrated he rose she might look like a pushover but she was as tough as they came look nothings stopping me from just taking it he snatched her purse off the sofa and held it out to her i can walk out of here with this or we can make a deal standing she plucked it out of his hands i dont make deals until i know all the terms youve got a hell of a nerve threatening me after i saved your life saved my life doug exploded you damn near killed me twenty times her chin lifted her voice became regal and haughty if i hadnt outwitted those men getting my car damaged in the process youd be floating in the east river the image was entirely too close to the truth youve been watching too many cagney movies he tossed back i want to know what you have and where you intend to go a puzzle ive got pieces to a puzzle and im going to madagascar madagascar intrigued she turned it over in her mind hot sultry nights exotic birds adventure what kind of puzzle what kind of treasure my business favoring his arm he slipped on the jacket again i want to see it you cant see it its in madagascar he took out a cigarette as he calculated he could give her enough just enough to interest her and not enough to cause trouble blowing out smoke he glanced around the room looks like you know something about france her eyes narrowed enough to order escargots and dom perignon yeah i bet he lifted a pearlcrusted snuffbox from the top of a curio cabinet lets just say the goodies im after have a french accent an old french accent she caught her bottom lip between her teeth hed hit a button the little snuffbox he was tossing from hand to hand was two hundred years old and part of an extensive collection how old couple centuries look sugar you could back me he set the box down and walked to her again think of it as a cultural investment i take the cash and i bring you back a few trinkets two hundred years meant the french revolution marie and louis opulence decadence and intrigue a smile began to form as she thought it through history had always fascinated her french history in particular with its royalty and court politics philosophers and artists if he really had something and the look in his eyes convinced her he did why shouldnt she have a share a treasure hunt was bound to be more fun than an afternoon at sothebys say i was interested she began as she worked out her terms what kind of a stake would be needed he grinned he hadnt thought shed take the bait so easily couple thousand i dont mean money whitney dismissed it as only the wealthy could i mean how do we go about getting it we he wasnt grinning now theres no we she examined her nails no we no money she sat back stretching her arms on the top of the sofa ive never been to madagascar then call your travel agent sugar i work alone too bad she tossed her hair and smiled well its been nice now if youll pay me for the damages look i havent got time to he broke off at the quiet sound behind him spinning around doug saw the door handle turn slowly right then left he held up a hand signaling silence get behind the couch he whispered while he scanned the room for the handiest weapon stay there and dont make a sound whitney started to object then heard the quiet rattle of the knob she watched doug pick up a heavy porcelain vase get down he hissed again as he switched off the lights deciding to take his advice whitney crouched behind the sofa and waited doug stood behind the door watching as it opened slowly silently he gripped the vase in both hands and wished he knew how many of them he had to go through he waited until the first shadow was completely inside then lifting the vase over his head brought it down hard there was a crash a grunt then a thud whitney heard all three before the chaos began there was a shuffle of feet another splinter of glass her meissen tea set if the direction of the sound meant anything then a man cursed a muffled pop was followed by another tinkle of glass a silenced bullet she decided shed heard the sound on enough latenight movies to recognize it and the glass twisting her head she saw the hole in the picture window behind her the super wasnt going to like it she reflected not one bit and she was already on his list since the last party shed given had gotten slightly out of hand damn it douglas lord was bringing her a great deal of trouble the treasure she drew her brows together the treasure better be worth it then it was quiet entirely too quiet over the silence all she could hear was the sound of breathing doug pressed back into the shadowy corner and held onto the there was one more but at least he wasnt unarmed now he hated guns a man who used them generally ended up being on the wrong end of the barrel too often for comfort he was close enough to the door to slip through it and be gone maybe without notice if it hadnt been for the woman behind the couch and the knowledge that hed gotten her into this hed have done it the fact that he couldnt only made him furious with her he might just might have to kill a man to get out hed killed before was aware he was likely to do so again but it was a part of his life he could never examine without guilt doug touched the bandage on his arm and his fingers came away wet damn he couldnt stand there waiting and bleeding to death moving soundlessly he edged along the wall whitney had to cover her mouth to hold back all sound as the shadow crouched at the end of the sofa it wasnt doug she saw immediately that the neck was too long and the hair too short then she caught the flicker of movement to her left the shadow turned toward it before she had time to think whitney pulled off her shoe holding the good italian leather in one hand she aimed the threeinch heel at the shadows head with all the strength she could muster she brought it down there was a grunt then a thud amazed at herself whitney held up her shoe in triumph i got him sweet jesus doug muttered as he dashed across the room grabbing her hand and dragging her along with him i knocked him cold she told doug as he streaked toward the stairway with this she wiggled the shoe that was crushed between his hand and hers how did they find us dimitri traced your plates he said enraged with himself for not considering it before streaking down the next flight of stairs he started making new plans that fast she gave a quick laugh adrenaline was pumping through her is this dimitri a man or a magician hes a man who owns other men he could pick up the phone and have your credit rating and your shoe size in a half hour so could her father that was business and she understood business look i cant run lopsided give me a couple of seconds whitney pulled her hand from his and put on her shoe whatre we going to do now weve got to get to the garage down fortytwo flights elevators dont have back doors with this he grabbed her hand and began to jog down the steps again i dont want to come out near your car hes probably got somebody watching it just in case we get that far then whyre we going to the garage we still need a car ive got to get to the airport whitney slung the strap of her purse over her head so that she could grip the rail for support as they ran youre going to steal one thats the idea ill drop you off at a hotel register under some other name then oh no she interrupted noting gratefully that they were passing the twentieth floor youre not dumping me in any hotel windshield three hundred plateglass window twelve hundred dresden vase circa twentytwo seventyfive she retrieved her purse dug a notebook out of it and never missed a beat the minute she caught her breath shed start an accounting im going to collect youll collect he said grimly now save your breath she did and began to work out her own plan by the time theyd reached the garage level she was winded enough to lean breathlessly against the wall while he peered through a crack in the door okay the closest one is a porsche ill go out first once im in the car you follow and keep down he slipped the gun back out of his pocket she caught the look in his eye a look of loathing she wondered why should he look down at a gun as though it were something vile shed thought a gun would fit easily into his hand the way a gun did for a man who hung out in dim bars and smoky hotel rooms but it didnt fit easily it didnt fit at all then he went through the door who was doug lord really whitney asked herself was he a hood a con a victim because she sensed he was all three she was fascinated and determined to find out why crouched doug took out what looked like a penknife whitney watched as he fiddled with the lock for a moment then quietly opened the passenger door whatever he was whitney noted he was good at breaking and entering leaving that for later she crept through the door he was already in the drivers seat and working with wires under the dash when she climbed inside damn foreign cars he muttered give me a chevy any day wideeyed with admiration whitney heard the engine spring to life can you teach me how to do that doug shot her a look just hold on this time im driving throwing the porsche into reverse he peeled out of the space by the time they reached the garage entrance they were doing sixty got a favorite hotel im not going to a hotel youre not getting out of my sight lord until your account has a zero balance where you go i go look i dont know how much time i have he kept a careful eye on the rearview mirror as he drove what you dont have any of is money she reminded him she had her book out now and began to write in neat columns and youre currently in to me for a windshield an antique porcelain vase a meissen tea set elevenfifty for that and a plateglass window maybe more then another thousand isnt going to matter another thousand always matters your credits only good as long as i can see you if you want a plane ticket youre taking on a partner partner he turned to her wondering why he didnt just take her purse and shove her out the door i never take on partners you do this time fiftyfifty ive got the answers the truth was he had the questions but he wasnt going to worry about details but you dont have the stake he swung onto fdr drive no dammit he didnt have the stake and he needed it so for now he needed her later when he was several thousand miles from new york they could negotiate terms okay just how much cash have you got on you a couple hundred hundred shit he kept his speed to a steady fiftyfive now he couldnt afford to get pulled over that wont take us farther than new jersey i dont like to carry a lot of cash terrific ive got papers worth millions and you want to buy in for two hundred two hundred plus the five thousand you owe me and she reached into her purse ive got the plastic grinning she held up a gold american express card i never leave home without it doug stared at it then threw back his head and laughed maybe she was more trouble than she was worth but he was beginning to doubt it the hand that reached for the phone was plump and very white at the wrist white cuffs were studded with square sapphires the nails were buffed to a dull sheen and neatly clipped the receiver itself was white pristine cool fingers curled around it three elegantly manicured ones and a scarredover stub where the pinky should have been dimitri the voice was poetry hearing it remo began to sweat like a pig he drew on his cigarette and spoke quickly before exhaling they gave us the slip dead silence dimitri knew it was more terrifying than a hundred threats he used it five seconds ten three men against one and a young woman how inefficient remo pulled the tie loose from his throat so he could breathe they stole a porsche were following them to the airport now they wont get far mr dimitri no they wont get far i have a few calls to make a few buttons to push ill meet you in a day or two remo rubbed his hand over his mouth as his relief began to spread where there was a laugh soft distant the sense of relief evaporated like sweat find lord remo ill find you chapter two his arm was stiff when doug rolled over he gave a little grunt of annoyance at the discomfort and absently pushed at the bandage his face was pressed into a soft feather pillow covered by a linen case that had no scent beneath him the sheet was warm and smooth gingerly flexing his left arm he shifted onto his back the room was dark deceiving him into thinking it was still night until he looked at his watch ninefifteen shit he ran a hand over his face as he pushed himself up in bed he should be on a plane halfway to the indian ocean instead of lying around in a fancy hotel room in washington a dull fancy hotel room he remembered as he thought of the fussy redcarpeted lobby theyd arrived at oneten and he hadnt even been able to get a drink the politicians could have washington hed take new york the first problem was that whitney held the purse strings and she hadnt given him a choice the next problem was shed been right hed only been thinking of getting out of new york shed been thinking of details like passports so she had connections in dc he thought if connections could cut through paperwork he was all for it doug glanced around the highpriced room that was hardly bigger than a broom closet shed charge him for the room too he realized narrowing his eyes at the connecting door whitney macallister had a mind like a cpa and a face like with a half grin he shook his head and lay back hed better keep his mind off her face and her other attributes it was her money he needed women had to wait once he had what he was going for he could swim neckdeep in them if he wanted the image was pleasant enough to keep him smiling for another minute blondes brunettes redheads plump thin short and tall there was no point in being too discriminating and he intended to be very generous with his time first he had to get the damn passport and visa he scowled damn bureaucratic bullshit he had a treasure waiting for him a professional bone breaker breathing down his neck and a crazy woman in the room next door who wouldnt even buy him a pack of cigarettes without marking it down in the little notebook she kept in her twohundreddollar snakeskin bag the thought prompted him to reach over to pluck a cigarette from the pack on the nightstand he couldnt understand her attitude when he had money to spend he was generous with it maybe too generous he decided with a half laugh he certainly never had it for long generosity was part of his nature women were a weakness especially small pouty women with big eyes no matter how many times hed been taken by one he invariably fell for the next six months before a little waitress named cindy had given him two memorable nights and a sob story about a sick mother in columbus in the end hed parted company with her and with five grand hed always been a sucker for big eyes that was going to change doug promised himself once he had his hands on the pot of gold he was going to hold onto it this time he was going to buy that big splashy villa in martinique and start living his life the way hed always dreamed and hed be generous with his servants hed cleaned up after enough rich people to know how cold and careless they could be with servants of course hed only cleaned up after them until he could clean them out but that didnt change the bottom line working for the wealthy hadnt given him his taste for rich things hed been born with it he just hadnt been born with money then again he felt hed been better off being born with brains with brains and certain talents you could take what you needed or wanted from people who barely noticed the sting the job kept the adrenaline going the result the money just let you relax until the next time he knew how to plan for it how to plot how to scheme and he also knew the value of research hed been up half the night going over every scrap of information he could decipher in the envelope it was a puzzle but he had the pieces all he needed to put them all together was time the neatly typed translations hed read might have just been a pretty story to some a history lesson to others aristocrats struggling to smuggle their jewels and their precious selves out of revolutiontorn france hed read words of fear of confusion and of despair in the plasticsealed originals hed seen hopelessness in the handwriting in words he couldnt read but hed also read of intrigue of royalty and of wealth marie antoinette robespierre necklaces with exotic names hidden behind bricks or concealed in wagonloads of potatoes the guillotine desperate flights across the english channel pretty stories steeped in history and colored with blood but the diamonds the emeralds the rubies the size of hens eggs had been real too some of them had never been seen again some had been used to buy lives or a meal or silence others had traveled across oceans doug worked the kinks out of his arm and smiled the indian ocean trade route for merchants and pirates and on the coast of madagascar hidden for centuries guarded for a queen was the answer to his dreams he was going to find it with the help of a young girls journal and a fathers despair when he did hed never look back poor kid he thought imagining the young french girl whod written out her feelings two hundred years before he wondered if the translation hed read had really keyed in on what shed gone through if he could read the original french he shrugged and reminded himself she was long dead and not his concern but shed just been a kid scared and confused why do they hate us shed written why do they look at us with such hate papa says we must leave paris and believe i will never see my home again and she never had doug mused because war and politics go for the big view and trample all over the little guy france during the revolution or a steamy pit of a jungle in nam it never changed he knew just what it felt like to be helpless he wasnt going to feel that way ever again he stretched and thought of whitney for better or worse hed made a deal with her he never turned his back on a deal unless he was sure he could get away with it still it grated to have to depend on her for every dollar dimitri had hired him to steal the papers because he was doug admitted honestly as he sucked in smoke a very good thief unlike dimitris standard crew hed never considered that a weapon made up for wit hed always preferred living by the latter doug knew it was his reputation for doing a smooth quiet job that had earned him the call from dimitri to lift a fat envelope from a safe in an exclusive coop off park avenue a job was a job and if a man like dimitri was willing to pay five thousand for a bunch of papers a great many with faded and foreign writing doug wasnt going to argue besides hed had some debts to pay hed had to get by two sophisticated alarm systems and four security guards before he could crack the little gem of a wall safe where the envelope was stored he had a way with locks and alarms it was well a gift doug decided a man shouldnt waste his godgiven talents the thing was hed played it straight hed taken nothing but the papers though thered been a very interestinglooking black case in the safe along with it he never considered that taking them out to read them was any more than covering his bets he hadnt expected to be fascinated by the translations of letters or a journal or documents that stretched back two hundred years maybe it had been his love of a good story or his respect for the written word that had touched off his imagination as he had skimmed over the papers but fascinated or not he would have turned them over a deal was a deal hed stopped in a drugstore and bought adhesive strapping the envelope to his chest had just been a precaution new york like any city was riddled with dishonest people of course hed arrived at the eastside playground an hour early and had hidden a man stayed alive longer if he watched his ass while sitting behind the shrubbery in the rain hed thought over what hed read the correspondence the documents and the tidy list of gems and jewels whoever had collected the information translated it so meticulously had done so with the dedication of a professional librarian it had passed through his mind briefly that if hed had the time and opportunity hed have followed up on the rest of the job himself but a deal was a deal doug had waited with every intention of turning over the papers and collecting his fee that had been before hed learned that he wasnt going to get the five thousand dimitri had agreed on he was going to get a twodollar bullet in the back and a burial in the east river remo had arrived in the black lincoln with two other men dressed for business theyd calmly debated the most efficient way to murder him a bullet in the brain seemed to be the method agreed on but they were still working out the when and where as doug crouched behind bushes six feet away it seemed remo had been fussy about getting blood on the lincolns upholstery at first doug had been angry no matter how many times hed been doublecrossed and hed stopped counting it always made him angry nobody was honest in this world hed thought as the adhesive pulled a bit at his skin even while hed concentrated on getting out in one piece he had begun to consider his options dimitri had a reputation for being eccentric but he also had a reputation for picking winners from the right senator to keep on the payroll to the best wine to stock in the cellar if he wanted the papers badly enough to snip off a loose end named doug lord they must be worth something on the spot doug decided the papers were his and his fortune was made all he had to do was live to claim it in reflex he touched his arm now stiff yes but already healing he had to admit crazy whitney macallister had done a good job there he blew smoke between his teeth before he crushed out the cigarette shed probably charge him for it he needed her for the moment at least until they were out of the country once he got to madagascar hed ditch her a slow lazy grin covered his face hed had some experience in outmaneuvering women sometimes he succeeded his only regret was that he wouldnt get to see her stomp and swear when she realized hed given her the slip picturing those clouds of pale sunlit hair he thought it was almost too bad he had to doublecross her he couldnt deny he owed her even as he sighed and began to think kindly of her the connecting door burst open still in bed whitney crossed to the window and pulled open the drapes she waved a hand fussily in front of her face in an attempt to clear the haze of smoke hed been up for awhile she decided smoking and plotting well shed been doing some figuring herself when doug swore and squinted she merely shook her head you look terrible he was vain enough to scowl his chin was rough with a nights coarse growth of beard his hair was unruly and hed have killed for a toothbrush she on the other hand looked as though shed just walked out of elizabeth ardens naked in the bed with the sheet up to his waist doug felt at a disadvantage he didnt care for that sensation you ever knock not when im paying for the room she said easily she stepped over the tangle of jeans on the floor breakfast is on its way up great ignoring his sarcasm whitney made herself at home by sitting on the bottom of the bed and stretching out her legs make yourself comfortable doug said expansively whitney only smiled and shook back her hair i got in touch with uncle maxie who uncle maxie whitney repeated giving her nails a quick check she really needed a manicure before they left town actually hes not my uncle i just call him my uncle oh that kind of uncle doug said a half sneer on his face whitney spared him a mild glance dont be crude douglas hes a dear friend of the familys perhaps youve heard of him maximillian teebury senator teebury she spread her fingers for a last examination you do keep up with current events look smartass doug grabbed her arm so that she tumbled half into his lap whitney only smiled up at him knowing she still held all the aces just what does senator teebury have to do with anything connections she ran a finger down his cheek clucking her tongue at the roughness but roughness she discovered had its own primitive appeal my father always says you can do without sex in a pinch but you cant do without connections yeah grinning he lifted her up so that her face was close to his and her hair streamed down to the sheets again he caught the drift of her scent that meant wealth and class everybody has different priorities indeed she wanted to kiss him he looked rough and restless and disheveled the way a man might after a night of wild sex just what kind of a lover would douglas lord be ruthless she felt her heart thud a little faster at the thought he smelled of tobacco and sweat he looked like a man who lived on the edge and enjoyed it shed like to feel that clever interesting mouth on hers but not yet once shed kissed him she might forget that she had to stay one step ahead of him the thing is she murmured letting her hands stray into his hair when their lips were only a breath apart uncle maxie can get a passport for you and two thirtyday visas to madagascar within twentyfour hours how whitney noted with amused annoyance just how quickly his seducing tone became businesslike connections douglas she said blithely whatre partners for he shot her a considering look damn if she wasnt becoming handy if he wasnt careful shed be indispensable the last thing a smart man needed was an indispensable woman who had eyes like whiskey and skin like the underside of petals then it hit him that theyd be on their way by that time the next day letting out a quick whoop he rolled on top of her her hair fanned over the pillow her eyes halfwary halflaughing met his lets find out partner he suggested his body was hard like his eyes could be like his hand as it cupped her face it was tempting he was tempting but it was always vital to weigh advantage against disadvantage before whitney could decide whether to agree or not there was a knock at the door breakfast she said cheerfully wiggling out from under him if her heart was beating a bit too fast she wasnt going to dwell on it there was too much to do doug folded his arms behind his head and leaned back on the headboard maybe desire was eating a hole in his stomach or maybe it was just hunger maybe it was both lets have it in bed whitney gave her opinion of his suggestion by ignoring it good morning she said brightly to the waiter as he wheeled in the tray good morning ms macallister the young squarebuilt puerto rican didnt even glance at doug his eyes were all for whitney with considerable charm he handed her a pink rosebud why thank you juan its lovely i thought youd like it he flashed her a quick grin showing a mouthful of strong even teeth i hope your breakfasts okay i brought up the toiletries and the paper you asked for oh thats wonderful juan she smiled at the dark stud of a waiter doug noted with a lot more sweetness than shed bothered to show him i hope it wasnt too much trouble oh no never for you ms macallister behind the waiters back doug silently mimicked his words and soulful expression whitney only arched a brow then signed the check with a flourish thank you juan she reached into her bag and pulled out a twenty youve been a big help a pleasure ms macallister you just call me if theres anything else i can do the twenty disappeared into his pocket with the speed and discretion of long practice enjoy your breakfast still smiling he backed his way out the door you love them to grovel dont you whitney turned a cup right side up and poured coffee casually she waved the rosebud under her nose put some pants on and come eat and you were damn generous with the little bit of cash weve got she said nothing but he saw she was drawing out her little notepad just hold on it was you overtipped the waiter not me he got you a razor and a toothbrush she said mildly well split the tip because your hygienes of some concern to me at the moment thats big of you he grumbled then because he wanted to see just how far he could push her he climbed slowly out of bed she didnt gasp she didnt flinch she didnt blush she merely gave him one long measuring survey the white bandage on his arm was a stark contrast against his darktoned skin god he had a beautiful body she thought as her pulse began a slow dull thud lean sleek and subtly muscled naked unshaven halfsmiling he looked more dangerous and more appealing than any man shed ever come across she wouldnt give him the satisfaction of knowing it without taking her eyes from him whitney lifted her coffee cup stop bragging douglas she said mildly and put your pants on your eggs are getting cold damn she was a cool one he thought as he grabbed up his jeans just once he was going to see her sweat flopping down in the chair across from her doug began to stuff himself with hot eggs and crisp bacon at the moment he was too hungry to calculate what the luxury of room service was costing him once he found the treasure he could buy his own damn hotel just who are you whitney macallister he demanded over a full mouth she added a dash of pepper to her own eggs in what way he grinned pleased that she wouldnt give easy answers where do you come from richmond virginia she said lapsing so quickly into a smooth virginia accent one wouldve sworn shed had one all along my familys still there on the plantation whyd you move to new york because its fast he reached for toast scrutinizing the basket of jellies what do you do there whatever i like he looked into her sultry whiskeycolored eyes and believed it do you have a job no i have a profession she lifted a piece of bacon between her fingers and nibbled im an interior designer he remembered her apartment the feeling of elegance the melding of colors the uniqueness a decorator he mused youd be a good one naturally and you she poured them both more coffee what do you do a lot of things he reached for the cream watching her mostly im a thief she remembered the ease with which he had stolen the porsche youd be a good one he laughed enjoying her naturally this puzzle you mentioned the papers she tore a piece of toast in two are you going to show them to me no she narrowed her eyes how do i know you have them how do i know that if you do have them theyre worth my time not to mention my money he seemed to consider a moment then offered her the basket of jellies faith she chose strawberry preserves and spread them on generously lets try not to be ridiculous howd you get them i acquired them biting into the toast she watched him over it stole them yeah from the men who were chasing you for the man they work for doug corrected her dimitri unfortunately he was going to doublecross me so all bets were called off possessions ninetenths of the law i suppose she considered for a moment the fact that she was breakfasting with a thief who was in possession of a mysterious puzzle she supposed shed done more unusual things in her life all right lets try this what form is this puzzle in doug considered giving her another nonanswer then caught the look in her eyes cool unflappable determination hed better give her something at least until he had the passport and a ticket ive got papers documents letters i told you it went back a couple hundred years theres enough information in the papers i have to lead me right to the pot of gold a pot of gold nobody even knows is there when another thought occurred to him he frowned at her you speak french of course she said and smiled so some of the puzzles in french when he said nothing she steered him back again why doesnt anyone know about your pot of gold anyone who did is dead she didnt like the way he said it but she wasnt about to back off now how do you know its genuine his eyes became intense the way they could when you least expected it i feel it and whos this man whos after you dimitri hes a firstclass businessman bad business hes smart hes mean hes the kind of guy who knows the latin name for the bug hes picking the wings off if he wants the papers theyre worth a hell of a lot one hell of a lot i guess well find that out in madagascar she picked up the new york times juan had delivered she didnt like the way doug had described the man who was after him the best way to avoid thinking about it was to think of something else opening the paper she caught her breath then let it out again oh shit intent on finishing his eggs doug gave her an absent hmmm im in for it now she predicted rising and tossing the open paper onto his plate hey im not finished before he could push the paper aside he saw whitneys picture smiling up at him above the picture was a splash of headline icecream heiress missing icecream heiress doug muttered skimming down to the text before he fully took it in ice cream his mouth fell open as he dropped the paper macallisters ice cream thats you indirectly whitney told him pacing the room as she tried to work out the best plan its my father macallisters ice cream doug repeated sonofabitch he makes the best damn fudge ripple in the country of course it hit him then that she wasnt just a classy decorator but the daughter of one of the richest men in the country she was worth millions millions and if he was caught with her hed be up on kidnapping charges before he could ask for his court appointed lawyer twenty years to life he thought dragging a hand through his hair doug lord sure knew how to pick em look sugar this changes things it certainly does she muttered now i have to call daddy oh and uncle maxie too yeah he scooped up the last forkful of eggs deciding hed better eat while he had the chance why dont you figure out my bill and well daddy is going to think im being held for ransom or something exactly he grabbed the last piece of toast since shed figure out a way for him to pay for the meal he might as well enjoy it and i dont want to end up with a cops bullet in my head either dont be ridiculous whitney dismissed him with a wave of the hand while she refined her plan of approach ill get around daddy she murmured ive been doing it for years i should be able to get him to wire me some money while im at it cash she shot him a long appraising look that certainly got your attention he set the toast aside look gorgeous if you know how to get around your old man whom i to argue and while the plastics nice and the cash you can get with the plastics nice a little extra of the green stuff would help me sleep a lot easier ill take care of it she walked to the connecting doors then paused you really could use a shower and a shave douglas before we go shopping he stopped in the act of rubbing his chin shopping im not going to madagascar with one blouse and one pair of slacks and im certainly not going anywhere with you wearing a shirt with only one sleeve well do something about your wardrobe i can pick out my own shirts after seeing that fascinating jacket you had on when we met i have my doubts with this she closed the door between them it was a disguise he yelled at her then stormed off toward the bathroom damn woman always had to have the last word but he had to admit she had taste after a twohour shopping whirlwind he was carrying more packages than he cared to but the cut of his shirt helped conceal the slight bulge of the envelope that was again strapped to his chest and he liked the way the loose linen felt against his skin the same way he liked the way whitneys hips moved under the thin white dress still there was no use being too agreeable what the hell am i going to do with a suit tramping around in a forest in madagascar she glanced over and adjusted the collar of his shirt hed fussed about wearing baby blue but whitney reaffirmed her opinion that it was an excellent color for him oddly enough he looked as though hed been born wearing tailored slacks when one travels one should be prepared for anything i dont know how much walking were going to have to do sugar but ill tell you this youre carrying your own gear she tipped down her new signature sunglasses a gentleman to the last you bet he stopped beside a drugstore and shifted the packages under one arm look i need some things in here give me a twenty when she only lifted a brow he swore come on whitney youre going to mark it down in your damn account book anyway i feel naked without any cash she gave him a sweet smile as she reached in her purse it didnt bother you to be naked this morning her lack of reaction to his body still irked he plucked the bill from her hand yeah well take that up again sometime ill meet you upstairs in ten minutes pleased with herself whitney crossed to the hotel and breezed through the lobby she was having more fun annoying doug lord than shed had in months she shifted the smart leather tote shed bought to her other hand and pushed the button for her floor things were looking good she decided her father had been relieved that she was safe and not displeased that she was leaving the country again laughing to herself whitney leaned back against the wall she supposed she had given him a few bad moments in the past twentyeight years but she was just made that way in any case shed spun fact and fiction together until her father had been satisfied with the thousand dollars he was wiring to uncle maxie that afternoon she and doug would be on solid ground before they took off for madagascar even the name appealed to her madagascar she mused as she strolled down the hall toward her room exotic new unique orchids and lush greens she wanted to see it all experience it as much as she wanted to believe the puzzle doug talked about led to that pot of gold it wasnt the gold itself that drew her she was too accustomed to wealth to have her heartbeat quicken at the thought of more it was the thrill of looking of finding that attracted her oddly enough she understood better than doug that he felt the same she was going to have to learn a great deal more about him she decided from the way hed discussed cut and material with the salesclerk he wasnt a stranger to the finer things he couldve passed for one of the casually rich in a classiccut linen shirt unless you looked at his eyes really looked nothing casual there whitney thought they were restless wary and hungry if they were going to be partners she had to find out why as she unlocked her door it occurred to her that she had a few minutes alone and that maybe just maybe doug had stashed the papers in his room she was putting up the money whitney told herself she had every right to see what she was financing still she moved quietly keeping an ear out for dougs return as she crossed to the connecting doors she caught her breath then with a hand to her heart laughed juan you scared me to death she stepped inside looking beyond where the young waiter sat to the stilllittered table did you come to pick up the breakfast dishes she didnt have to put off her quick search because of him she decided and began to poke through dougs dresser is the hotel busy this time of year she asked conversationally its cherryblossom time isnt it that always brings in the tourists frustrated that the dresser was empty she scanned the room maybe the closet what time does the maid usually come in juan i could use some extra towels when he continued to stare silently at her she frowned you dont look well she told him they work you too hard maybe you should she touched a hand to his shoulder and slowly bonelessly he slumped to her feet leaving a smear of blood on the back of the chair she didnt scream because her brain and her vocal cords had frozen eyes wide mouth working she backed up shed never seen death before never smelled it but she recognized it before she could run from it a hand clamped over her arm very pretty the man whose face was inches from hers held a gun under her chin one cheek was badly scarred jagged as from a broken bottle or a blade both his hair and his eyes were the color of sand the barrel of the gun was like ice on her skin grinning he skimmed the gun down her throat wheres lord her gaze darted down to the crumpled body inches away from her feet she could see the red stain spread over the white back of his jacket juan would be no help and he d never spend the twentydollar tip shed given him only hours before if she wasnt careful very very careful shed end up the same way i asked you about lord the gun pushed her chin up a little higher i lost him she said thinking fast i wanted to get back here and find the papers doublecross he toyed with the ends of her hair and made her stomach roll smart too the fingers tightened jerking her head back whens he coming back i dont know she winced at the pain and struggled to keep her mind clear fifteen minutes maybe a half hour any minute she thought desperately he could walk in any minute and then they both would be dead another glance at the body sprawled at her feet and her eyes filled whitney swallowed hard knowing she couldnt afford tears why did you kill juan wrong place at the wrong time he said with a grin just like you pretty lady listen it wasnt difficult to keep her voice low if shed tried to speak above a whisper her teeth would have chattered i dont have any allegiance to lord if you and i could find the papers then she let the sentence trail off moistening her lips with her tongue he watched the gesture before he ran his gaze down her body not much tit he said with a sneer then stepped back gesturing with the gun maybe i should see more of what youre offering she toyed with the top button of her blouse shed gotten his mind off killing her for the moment but this wasnt much of a bargain inching back as she moved to the next button she felt her hips bump into the table as if to steady herself she rested a palm on it keeping her gaze on his sandcolored eyes she felt cool stainless steel brush her fingertips maybe you should help me she whispered and forced herself to smile he inclined his head as he set the gun on the dresser maybe i should then his hands were on her hips moving slowly up her body whitney gripped the handle in her fist and plunged the fork into the side of his throat blood spurting squealing like a pig he jumped back as he reached for the handle himself she picked up the leather tote and swung it with all the force she had she didnt look to see how deep shed driven the prongs into him she ran in high good humor after a brief flirtation with the checkout girl doug started to swing into the lobby running full steam whitney barreled into him he juggled tottering packages what the hell run she shouted and without waiting to see if he took her advice raced out of the hotel swearing and fumbling with packages he drew up alongside her what for theyve found us a glance over his shoulder showed him remo and two others just hustling out of the hotel ah shit doug muttered then grabbing whitneys arm he dragged her through the first door he came to they were greeted by the quiet strains of harp music and a stiffbacked maitre d you have a luncheon reservation just looking for friends doug told him nudging whitney along yes i hope were not too early she batted her eyes at the maitre d before scanning the restaurant i do hate being early ah theres marjorie now my my shes put on weight with whitney leaning conspiratorially toward doug they moved past the maitre d be sure to compliment her on that horrid outfit rodney skirting through the restaurant they made a direct line for the kitchen rodney he complained in undertones it just came to me here thinking fast he shoved the boxes and bags into whitneys tote then slung the whole business over his shoulder let me do the talking in the kitchen they made their way around counters and ranges and cooks moving as quickly as he thought prudent doug aimed for the back door a whiteaproned bulk three feet wide stepped in front of him guests are not permitted in the kitchen doug looked up at the chefs hat at least a foot above his own head it reminded him how much he hated physical altercations you didnt get so many bruises when you used your head one minute one minute doug said fussily and turned to the pot simmering at his right sheila this has the most divine scent superb sensuous four stars for the scent catching on she drew her pad out of her bag four stars she repeated scribbling picking up the ladle doug held it under his nose closed his eyes and sampled ah he drew the word out so dramatically whitney had to choke down a giggle poisson veronique magnificent absolutely magnificent definitely one of the top contenders in the contest your name he demanded from the chef the whiteaproned bulk preened henri henri he repeated waving a hand at whitney youll be notified within ten days come sheila dont dawdle we have three more stops to make my moneys on you whitney told henri as they walked out the back door okay doug gripped her arm hard when they stood in the alley remos only halfstupid so weve got to get out fast which way to uncle maxies he lives in virginia roslyn all right we need a cab he started forward then pushed whitney back against the wall so quickly she lost her breath dammit theyre already out there he took a moment knowing the alley wouldnt be safe for long in his experience alleys were never safe for long well have to go the other way which means going over a few walls youre going to have to keep up the image of juan was still fresh in her mind ill keep up lets go they started out side by side then swerved to the right whitney had to scramble over boxes to make it over the first fence and her leg muscles sang out in surprise on the landing she kept running if he had a pattern to his flight she couldnt find it he zigzagged down streets through alleys and over fences until her lungs burned from the effort of keeping the pace the floaty skirt of her dress caught on chain link and tore jaggedly at the hem people stopped to look at them in surprise and speculation as they never wouldve done in new york always he seemed to have one eye looking over his shoulder she had no way of knowing hed lived that way most of his life and had often wondered if hed ever live any other way when he dragged her down the stairs toward metro center she had to grip the rail to keep from plunging head first blue lines red lines he muttered why do they have to screw things up with colors i dont know breathless she leaned against the information board ive never ridden the metro before well were fresh out of limos red line he announced and grabbed her hand again he hadnt lost them doug could still smell the hunt five minutes he thought he only wanted a fiveminute lead then theyd be on one of those speedy little trains and gain more time the crowd was thick and babbling in a half dozen languages the more people the better he decided as he inched his way along he glanced over his shoulder when they stood at the edge of the platform his gaze met remos he saw the bandage on the tanned cheek compliments of whitney macallister doug thought and couldnt resist tossing back a grin yeah he owed her for that he decided if for nothing else he owed her for that it was all timing now he knew as he pulled whitney onto the train timing and luck it was either with them or against them sandwiched between whitney and a sariclad indian woman doug watched remo fight his way through the crowd when the doors closed he grinned and gave the frustrated man outside a half salute lets find a seat he said to whitney theres nothing like public transportation she said nothing as they worked their way through the car and still nothing when they found a space nearly big enough for both of them doug was too busy alternately cursing and blessing his luck to notice in the end he grinned at his own reflection in the glass to his left well the sonofabitch mightve found us but hes going to have a hell of a lot of explaining to do to dimitri about losing us again satisfied he draped his arm over the back of the bright orange seat howd you spot them anyway he asked absently while he plotted out his next move money passport and airport in that order though he had to fit in a quick trip to the library if dimitri and his hounds showed up in madagascar theyd just lose them again he was on a roll youve got a sharp eye sugar he told her wedve been in a bad way if thered been a welcoming committee back in the hotel room adrenaline had carried her through the streets the need to survive had driven her hard and fast until the moment shed sat down drained whitney turned her head and stared at his profile they killed juan what distracted he glanced over for the first time he noticed that her skin was bloodless and her eyes blank juan doug drew her closer dropping his voice to a whisper the waiter whatre you talking about he was dead in your room when i went back there was a man waiting what man doug demanded whatd he look like his eyes were like sand he had a scar down his cheek a long jagged scar butrain doug mumbled some of dimitris excess slime and as mean as they came he tightened his grip on whitneys shoulder did he hurt you her eyes dark as aged whiskey focused on his again i think i killed him what he stared at the elegant fineboned face you killed butrain how with a fork you doug stopped sat back and tried to take it in if she hadnt been looking at him with big devastated eyes if her hand hadnt been like ice hed have laughed out loud youre telling me you did in one of dimitris apes with a fork i didnt stop to take his pulse the train pulled up at the next stop and unable to sit still whitney rose and pushed her way off swearing and struggling through bodies doug caught up with her on the platform okay okay youd better tell me the whole thing the whole thing abruptly enraged she turned on him you want to hear the whole thing the whole bloody thing i walk back into the room and theres that poor harmless boy dead blood all over his starched white coat and some creep with a face like a road maps holding a gun to my throat her voice had risen so that passersby turned to listen or to stare keep it down doug muttered dragging her toward another train theyd ride it didnt matter where until she was calm and he had a more workable plan you keep it down she shot back you got me into this look honey you can take a walk any time you want sure and end up with my throat slit by someone whos after you and those damn papers the truth left him little defense shoving her down into a corner seat he squeezed in beside her okay so youre stuck with me he said under his breath heres a news flash listening to you whine about it gets on my nerves im not whining she turned to him with eyes suddenly drenched and vulnerable that boys dead anger drained and guilt flared not knowing what else to do he put his arm around her he wasnt used to comforting women you cant let it get to you youre not responsible tired she let her head rest on his shoulder is that how you get through life doug by not being responsible curling his fingers into her hair he watched their blurred twin images in the glass yeah they lapsed into silence with both of them wondering if he were telling the truth chapter three she had to snap out of it doug shifted in his firstclass seat and wished he knew how to shake the grief out of her he thought he understood wealthy women hed worked for and on plenty of them it was just as true he supposed that plenty of them had worked on him the trouble was had always been that he invariably fell just a little bit in love with any woman he spent more than two hours with they were so well feminine he decided nobody could sound more sincere than a softsmelling softskinned woman but hed learned through experience that women with big bank accounts generally had hearts of pure plastic the minute you were about ready to forget the diamond earrings in favor of a more meaningful relationship they dumped all over you callousness he thought that was the worst failing of the rich the kind of callousness that made them step all over people with the nonchalance of a child stomping on a beetle for recreation hed choose a waitress with an easy laugh but when it was business doug went straight to the bank balance a woman with a hefty one was an invaluable cover you could get through a lot of locked doors with a rich woman on your arm they came in varieties certainly but generally could be slapped with a few basic labels bored vicious cold or silly came to mind whitney didnt seem to qualify for any one of those labels how many people would have remembered the name of a waiter much less mourned for him they were on their way to paris out of dulles international enough of a detour he hoped to throw dimitri off the scent if it bought him a day a few hours hed use it he knew as anyone in the business knew of dimitris reputation for dealing with those who attempted to cross him a traditional man dimitri preferred traditional methods men like nero would have appreciated dimitris flare for slow innovative torture there had been murmurs about a basement room in dimitris connecticut estate supposedly it was filled with antiques the sort from the spanish inquisition rumor had it that there was a topgrade studio as well lights camera action dimitri was credited with enjoying replays of his more gruesome work doug wasnt going to find himself in the spotlight in one of dimitris performances nor was he going to believe the myth that dimitri was omnipotent he was just a man doug told himself flesh and blood but even at thirty thousand feet doug had the uneasy sensation of a fly being toyed with by a spider taking another drink he pushed that thought aside one step at a time thats how hed play it and thats how hed survive if hed had the time doug would have taken whitney to the hotel de crillon for a couple of days it was the only place he stayed in paris there were cities hed settle for a motel with a cot and cities where he wouldnt sleep at all but paris his luck had always held in paris he made it a point to arrange a trip twice a year for no other reason than the food as far as doug was concerned no one cooked better than the french or those educated in france because of that he had managed to bluff his way into several courses hed learned the french way the correct way to prepare an omelette at the cordon bleu of course he kept a low profile on that particular interest if word got out that hed worn an apron and whisked eggs hed lose his reputation on the streets besides it would be embarrassing so he always covered his trips to paris for cooking interests with business a couple of years back hed stayed there for a week playing the wealthy playboy and riffling the rooms of the rich doug remembered hed hocked a very good sapphire necklace and paid his bill in full you never knew when youd want to go back but there wasnt time on this trip for a quick course in soufflés or a handy piece of burglary there would be no sitting still in one place until the game was over normally he preferred it that way the chase the hunt the game itself was more exciting than the winning doug had learned that after his first big job thered been the tension and pressure of planning the rippling thrill and half terror of execution then the rushing excitement of success after that it was simply another job finished you looked for the next and the next if hed listened to his highschool counselor hed probably be a very successful lawyer right now hed had the brains and the glib tongue doug sipped smooth scotch and was grateful he hadnt listened imagine douglas lord esquire with a desk piled with papers and luncheon meetings three days a week was that any way to live he skimmed another page of the book hed stolen from a washington library before theyd left no a profession that kept you in an office owned you not the other way around so his iq topped his weight hed rather use his talents for something satisfying at the moment it was reading about madagascar its history its topography its culture by the time he finished this book hed know everything he needed to know there were two other volumes in his case hed save for later one was a history of missing gems the other a long detailed history of the french revolution before he found the treasure hed be able to see it and to understand it if the papers hed read were fact he had pretty marie antoinette and her penchant for opulence and intrigue to thank for an early retirement the mirror of portugal diamond the blue diamond the sancy all fiftyfour carats of it yeah french royalty had had great taste good old marie hadnt rocked tradition doug was grateful for it and for the aristocrats who had fled their country guarding the crown jewels with their lives holding them in secret until the royal family might rule france again he wouldnt find the sancy in madagascar doug was in the business and knew the rock was now in the astor family but the possibilities were endless the mirror and the blue had dropped out of sight centuries before so had other gems the diamond necklace affair the straw that had broken the peasants back was riddled with theory myth and speculation just what had become of the necklace that had ultimately insured marie of not having a neck to wear it on doug believed in fate in destiny and just plain luck before it was over he was going to be kneedeep in sparkles royal sparkles and screw dimitri in the meantime he wanted to learn all he could about madagascar he was going far off his own turf but so was dimitri if doug could beat his adversary in anything he prided himself on being able to top him in intelligent research he read page after page and tallied fact after fact hed find his way around the little island in the indian ocean the same way he went from eastside to westside manhattan he had to satisfied he set the book aside theyd been at cruising altitude for two hours long enough doug decided for whitney to brood in silence okay knock it off she turned and gave him a long neutral look i beg your pardon she did it well doug reflected the icebitch routine peculiar to women with money or guts of course he was learning that whitney had both i said knock it off i cant stand a pouter a pouter because her eyes were slits and shed hissed the words he was satisfied if he made her angry shed snap out of it all the quicker yeah im not crazy about a woman who runs her mouth a mile a minute but we should be able to come up with something in between should we how lovely that you have such definite requirements she took a cigarette from the pack hed tossed on the arm between them and lit it hed never known the gesture could be so haughty it helped amuse him let me give you lesson one before we go any further sweetie deliberately and with a quiet kind of venom whitney blew smoke in his face please do because he recognized pain when he saw it he gave her another minute then his voice was flat and final its a game he took the cigarette from her fingers and drew on it its always a game but you go into it knowing there are penalties she stared at him is that what you consider juan a penalty he was in the wrong place at the wrong time he told her unknowingly echoing butrains words but she heard something else regret remorse though she couldnt be sure it was something she held onto it we cant go back and change what happened whitney so we go on she picked up her neglected drink is that what you do best go on if you want to win when you have to win you cant look back very often tearing yourself up over this isnt going to change anything were one step ahead of dimitri maybe two weve got to stay that way because its a game but you play it for keeps if we dont stay ahead were dead as he spoke he laid a hand over hers not for comfort but to see if it was steady if you cant take it youd better think about backing off now because weve got a hell of a long way to go she wouldnt back off pride was the problem or the blessing shed never been able to back off but what about him she wondered what made douglas lord run why do you do it he liked the curiosity the spark as he settled back he was satisfied shed gotten over the first hump you know whitney its a hell of a lot sweeter to win the pot at poker with a pair of deuces than with a flush he blew out smoke and grinned one hell of a lot sweeter she thought she understood and studied his profile you like the odds against you long shots pay more she sat back closed her eyes and was silent so long he thought she dozed instead whitney was going back over everything that had happened step by step the restaurant she asked abruptly how did you pull that off what restaurant he was studying the different tribes of madagascar in his book and didnt bother to look up in washington when we were running for our lives through the kitchen and that enormous man in white stepped in front of you you just use the first thing that comes to your mind he said easily its usually the best it wasnt just what you said unsatisfied whitney shifted in her seat one minute youre a frantic man off the streets and the next a snooty food critic saying all the right things baby when your lifes on the line you can be anything then he looked up and grinned when you want something bad enough you can be anything usually i like to case a job from the inside all you have to do is decide if youre going in the front door or the servants entrance interested she signaled for another drink for each of them meaning okay take california beverly hills no thanks ignoring her doug began to reminisce first you have to decide which one of those nifty mansions you want to take a few discreet questions a little legwork and you hone in on one now front door or back that might depend on my own whim getting in the fronts usually easiest why because money wants references for servants not from guests you need a stake a few thousand check into the wilshire royal and rent a mercedes drop a few names of people you know are out of town once you get into the first party youre set with a sigh he drank boy they do like to wear their bank accounts around their necks in the hills and you just walk right in and pluck them off more or less the tough part is not to be greedy and to know whos wearing rocks and whos wearing glass lot of bullshit in california basically you just have to be a good mimic rich people are creatures more of habit than imagination thanks you dress right make sure youre seen at the right places with a few of the right people and nobodys going to question your pedigree the last time i used that routine i checked into the wilshire with three thousand dollars i checked out with thirty grand i like california sounds to me like you cant go back anytime soon ive been back i tinted my hair grew a little moustache and wore jeans i pruned cassie lawrences roses cassie lawrence the professional piranha who disguises herself as a patron of the arts a perfect description youve met unfortunately how much did you take her for from the tone doug decided whitney wouldve been pleased hed had quite a haul he also decided not to tell her hed had a breeze casing the inside because cassie had enjoyed watching him weed her azaleas without a shirt shed practically eaten him alive in bed in return hed lifted an ornate ruby necklace and a pair of diamond earrings as big as pingpong balls enough doug answered at length i take it you dont like her she has no class it was said simply from a woman who did did you sleep with her he choked on his drink then set it down carefully i dont think so you did a bit disappointed whitney studied him im surprised i didnt see the scars she studied him another moment thoughtful quiet dont you find that sort of thing demeaning he couldve strangled her without a qualm true there were times he slept with a mark and enjoyed himself and made certain the mark enjoyed herself as well payment for payment but as a rule he found using sex as close to ugly as he wanted to get a jobs a job he said briefly dont tell me youve never slept with a client she lifted a brow at him the way an amused woman could i sleep with whom i choose she told him in a tone that stated she chose well some of us werent born with choices opening his book again he stuck his nose in it and fell silent she wasnt going to make him feel guilty guilt was something he avoided more scrupulously than the police or a furious mark the minute you let guilt start sucking at you you were finished funny it didnt seem to bother her a bit that he stole for a living it didnt bother her that he stole particularly from her class shed never blinked an eye at that in fact it was more than likely that hed relieved some of her friends of excess personal property she wasnt the least concerned just what kind of woman was she anyway he thought he understood her thirst for adventure for excitement and taking chances hed lived his life on little else but it didnt fit those cool moneyed looks no she hadnt missed a beat when hed told her he was a thief but shed looked at him with derision and yes dammit pity when shed discovered hed slept with a westcoast shark for a handful of glitter and where had the glitter gotten him thinking back doug remembered hed dumped the rocks on a fence in chicago within twentyfour hours after a routine haggle over price a whim had taken him to puerto rico within three days doug had lost all but two thousand in the casinos what had the glitter gotten him he thought again then grinned one hell of a weekend money just didnt stick to him there was always another game a sure thing at the track or a bigeyed woman with a sob story and a breathy voice still doug didnt consider himself a sucker he was an optimist hed been born one and remained one even after more than fifteen years in the business otherwise the kick would have gone out of it and he might as well be a lawyer hundreds of thousands of dollars had passed through his hands the operative words were passed through this time would be different it didnt matter that hed said so before this time would be different if the treasure was half as big as the papers indicated hed be set for life hed never have to work again except for an occasional job to keep in shape hed buy a yacht and sail from port to port hed head for the south of france bake in the sun and watch women hed keep one step ahead of dimitri for the rest of his life because dimitri as long as he lived would never let up that too was part of the game but the best part was the doing the planning the maneuvering hed always found it more exciting to anticipate the taste of champagne than to finish the bottle madagascar was only hours away once there he could start applying everything hed been reading along with his own skills and experience hed have to pace himself to keep ahead of dimitri but not so far ahead he ran into dimitri on the other end the trouble was that he wasnt sure how much his former employer knew about the contents of the envelope too much he thought absently touching a hand to his chest where it was still strapped dimitri was bound to know plenty because he always did no one had ever crossed him and lived to enjoy it doug knew if he sat still too long hed feel hot breath on the back of his neck hed just have to play it by ear once they were there he glanced over at whitney she was kicked back in her seat eyes closed in sleep she looked cool and serene and untouchable need stirred inside him the need hed always had for the untouchable this time hed just have to smother it it was strictly business between them doug mused all business until he could talk her out of some cold cash and gently ditch her along the way maybe shed been more help than hed anticipated so far but she was a type he understood rich and restless sooner or later shed become bored with the whole scheme he had to get the cash before she did certain he would doug pressed the button to release his seat back he shut the book what hed read he wouldnt forget his gift for recall would have breezed him through law school or any other profession he was satisfied that it helped in the career hed chosen he never needed notes when he cased a job because he didnt forget he never hit the same mark twice because names and faces stayed with him money might slip through his fingers but details didnt doug took it philosophically you could always get more money life would be pretty dull if you put it all in stocks and bonds instead of on the wheel or the horses he was satisfied because he knew the next few days would be long and hard he was even better than satisfied it was more exciting to find a diamond in a garbage heap than in a display cabinet he was looking forward to digging whitney slept it was the movement of the plane beginning its long descent that woke her thank god was her first thought she was thoroughly sick of planes if shed been traveling alone shed have taken the concorde under the circumstances she hadnt been willing to pick up the extra fare for doug his account in her little book was growing and while she fully intended to collect every penny she knew he fully intended she wouldnt to look at him now youd think he was as sincere as a firstyear boy scout she studied him as he slept his hair mussed from travel his hands closed over the book on his lap anyone wouldve taken him for an ordinary man of some means on his way to a european vacation that was part of his skill she decided the ability to blend in with any group he chose would be invaluable just what group did he belong to the sleazy hardedged members of the underworld who dealt in dark alleys she remembered the look in his eyes when hed asked about butrain yes she was sure hed seen his share of dark alleys but belong no it didnt quite fit even in the short time shed known him she was certain he simply didnt belong he was a maverick perhaps not always wise but always restless that was part of the appeal he was a thief but she thought he had a certain code of honor a court might not recognize it but she did and respected it he wasnt hard shed seen in his eyes when he spoke of juan that he wasnt hard he was a dreamer shed seen that in his eyes when he spoke of the treasure and he was a realist shed heard that in his voice when he spoke of dimitri a realist knew enough to fear he was too complex to belong and yet hed been cassie lawrences lover whitney knew the westcoast diamond ate men for breakfast she was also very discriminating about whom she chose to share her sheets what had cassie seen a young virile man with a hard body perhaps that had been enough but whitney didnt think so whitney had seen for herself that morning in washington just how attractive doug lord was from head to foot and shed been tempted by more than his body she admitted style doug lord had his own style and it was that she believed that helped him over the threshold of homes in beverly hills or bel air shed thought she understood him until hed been embarrassed by her remark about cassie embarrassed and angry when shed expected a shrug and an offhand remark so he had feelings and values she mused it made him more interesting and likable if it came to that likable or not she was going to find out more about this treasure and soon she had too much money invested to move much further blindly shed gone with him on impulse and stayed through necessity instinctively she knew she was safer with him than without safety and impulse aside whitney was too much a businesswoman to invest in unnamed stock before too much more time had passed shed have a look at what he hoarded she might like him even understand him to a point but she didnt trust him not an inch as he drifted awake doug came to the same conclusion about whitney he was going to keep the envelope close to his skin until he had the treasure in his hand as the plane began its final descent they brought their chair backs up smiled at each other and calculated by the time theyd struggled with luggage and passed through customs whitney was more than ready to be horizontal in a stationary bed hotel de crillon doug told the cab driver and whitney sighed i apologize for ever doubting your taste sugar my problems always been twentyfourcarat taste he brushed at the ends of her hair more in reflex than design you look tired it hasnt been a restful fortyeight hours not that im complaining she added but its going to feel marvelous to stretch out for the next eight he merely grunted and watched paris whiz by dimitri wouldnt be far behind his network of information was every bit as extensive as interpols doug could only hope the few curves he had thrown would be enough to slow down the chase as he thought whitney struck up a conversation with the driver because it was in french doug couldnt understand but he caught the tone light friendly even flirtatious odd he reflected most of the women he knew whod grown up with portfolios never really saw the people who served them it was one of the reasons hed found it so easy to steal from them the rich were insular but no matter how often the less endowed said so the rich werent unhappy hed bullshitted his way into their circle often enough to know that money could buy happiness it just cost a bit more every year what a cute little man whitney stepped onto the curb and breathed in the scent of paris he said i was the most beautiful woman to sit in his cab in five years doug watched her pass bills to the doorman before she breezed into the hotel and earned himself a fat tip ill bet he muttered the way she tossed money around theyd be broke again before they landed in madagascar dont be such a cheapskate douglas he ignored that and took her arm you read french as well as you speak it need some help reading the menu she began then stopped tu ne parle pas français mon cher while he studied her in silence she smiled fascinating i should have caught on before that everything wasnt translated ah mademoiselle macallister georges she sent the desk clerk a smile i couldnt stay away always a pleasure to have you back his eyes lit again as he spotted doug over her shoulder monsieur lord such a surprise georges doug met whitneys speculative look briefly mademoiselle macallister and i are traveling together i hope you have a suite available romance bloomed in georges head if he hadnt had a suite georges would have been tempted at that moment to vacate one but of course of course and your papa mademoiselle he is well very well thank you georges charles will take your bags enjoy your stay whitney pocketed her key without glancing at it she knew the beds in the crillon were soft and seductive the water in the taps was hot a bath a little caviar from room service and a bed in the morning shed have a few hours in the beauty salon before they took the last leg of the journey i take it youve stayed here before whitney slipped into the elevator and leaned against the wall from time to time a profitable place i assume doug only smiled at her the service is excellent hmmm yes she could see him here sipping champagne and nibbling pate just as she could see him running through alleys in dc how lucky for me weve never crossed paths here before when the doors opened she strolled out ahead doug took her arm and steered her to the left the ambience is important i suppose in your business she added he allowed his thumb to brush over the inside of her elbow i have a taste for rich things she only gave him an easy smile that said he wouldnt sample her until she was ready the suite was no less than she expected whitney let the bellman fuss a few moments then eased him out with a tip so she plopped down on the sofa and kicked off her shoes what time do we leave tomorrow instead of answering he took a shirt from his suitcase balled it up until it wrinkled then tossed it over a chair as whitney watched he took various articles of clothing out and draped them here and there throughout the suite hotel rooms are so impersonal until you have your own things around arent they he mumbled something and dropped socks on the carpet it wasnt until he moved to her cases that she objected just a minute half the games illusion he told her and tossed a pair of italian heels into a corner i want them to think were staying here she grabbed a silk blouse out of his hands we are staying here wrong go hang a couple of things in the closet while i mess up the bathroom left with the blouse in her hands whitney tossed it down and followed him what are you talking about when dimitris muscle gets here i want them to think were still around it might only buy us a few hours but its enough systematically he went through the big plush bath unwrapping soap and dropping towels go get some of your face junk well leave a couple bottles oh no we wont what the hell am i supposed to do without it we aint going to the ball sugar he went into the master bedroom and tumbled the covers one bedll do he muttered they wouldnt believe we werent sleeping together anyway are you padding your ego or insulting mine he pulled out a cigarette lit it and blew out smoke all without taking his eyes off her for a moment just a moment she wondered what he was capable of and if shed like it after all saying nothing he strode back into the next room and began to rifle her cases damn it doug those are my things youll get them back for chrissake choosing a handful of cosmetics at random he started back to the bath that moisturizer costs me sixtyfive dollars a bottle for this interested he turned the bottle over and i thought you were practical im not leaving this room without it okay he tossed it back to her and dumped the rest on the vanity thisll do as he passed through the suite again he stubbed out the halfsmoked cigarette and lit another weve got just about enough he decided as he crouched down to close whitneys case a little swatch of lace caught his eye he lifted out a pair of sheer bikini briefs you fit in these he could see her in them he knew better than to let his imagination go in that direction but he could see her in them and nothing else she resisted the urge to snatch them out of his hand that was easy the pressure that formed low in her stomach as he brushed his fingers over the material wasnt as easily controlled when youve finished playing with my underwear why dont you tell me whats going on we check in after a moment doug tossed the little excuse of lace back in her bag then we take our bags down the service elevator and get back to the airport our flight leaves in an hour why didnt you tell me before he snapped her bag closed didnt come up i see whitney took a stroll around the suite until she thought her temper might hold let me explain something to you i dont know how you worked before and it isnt important this time she turned back to face him this time youve got a partner whatever little plans you have in your head are half mine you dont like the way i work you can back out right now you owe me when he started to object she took a step closer drawing her book from her purse as she moved should i read off the list screw your list ive got gorillas on my ass i cant worry about accounting youd better worry about it still calm she dropped the book back into her purse without me youll go treasure hunting with empty pockets sugar a couple hours in this hotel and id have enough money to take me anywhere i wanted to go she didnt doubt it but her gaze remained level with his but you dont have time to play cat burglar and we both know it partners douglas or you fly to madagascar with eleven dollars in your pocket damn her for knowing what he had almost to the penny he crushed out his cigarette then picked up his own bag weve got a plane to catch partner her smile came slowly and with such a gleam of satisfaction he was tempted to laugh whitney slipped on her shoes and picked up a tote bag get that case will you before he could swear at her she was moving to the door i only wish id had time for a bath because of the ease with which they rode the service elevator down and walked out of the hotel whitney imagined hed used that escape route before she decided she could drop a letter to georges in a few days and ask him to store her things until she could pick them up she hadnt even had a chance to wear that blouse yet and the color was very flattering all in all it seemed like a waste of time to her but she was willing to humor doug for the moment besides in the mood he was in they were better off in a plane than sharing a suite and she wanted some time to think if the papers he had or some of them at any rate were in french then it was obvious he couldnt read them she could a smile touched her lips he wanted to ditch her she wasnt fool enough to think otherwise but shed just made herself even more useful all she had to do now was persuade him to let her do some translating still she wasnt in the best of moods herself when they pulled up at the airport the thought of going through customs again of boarding another plane was enough to make her snarl it seems we couldve checked into a secondclass hotel and had a few hours sweeping back her hair she thought of the bath again hot steamy fragrant im beginning to think youre paranoid about this dimitri you treat him as though hes omnipotent they say he is whitney stopped and turned it was the way he said it as though he half believed it that made her flesh crawl dont be ridiculous cautious he scanned the terminal as they walked youre better off walking around a ladder than under it the way you talk about him youd think he wasnt human hes flesh and blood doug murmured but that doesnt make him human the shiver skimmed along her skin again turning toward doug she jolted into someone and dropped her bag with an impatient mutter she bent to pick it up look doug no one could possibly have caught up with us already shit grabbing her arm he yanked her into a gift shop with another shove she was up to her eyes in tshirts if you wanted a souvenir just look sweetheart you can apologize later with a hand on the back of her neck he steered her head to the left after a moment whitney recognized the tall dark man whod chased them in washington the moustache the little white bandage on his cheek she didnt need to be told that the two men with him belonged to dimitri and where was dimitri himself she caught herself sliding down lower and swallowing is that remo doug mumbled the word theyre faster than i thought theyd be he rubbed a hand over his mouth and swore he didnt like the feeling that the web was widening at dimitris leisure if he and whitney had strolled another ten yards theyd have walked into remos arms luck was the biggest part of the game he reminded himself it was what he liked the best itll take them a while to track down the hotel then theyll sit and wait he grinned a little nodding yeah theyll wait for us how whitney demanded for gods sake how could they be here already when youre dealing with dimitri you dont ask how you just look over your shoulder hed need a crystal ball politics doug said remember what your old man told you about connections if you had one in the cia and you made a call pushed a button you could be on top of someone without leaving your easy chair a call to the agency to the embassy to immigration and dimitri had a handle on our passports and visas before the ink was dry she moistened her lips and tried to pretend her throat hadnt gone dry then he knows where were going you bet your ass all we have to do is stay one step ahead just one whitney let out a little sigh when she realized her heart was thumping the excitement was back if she gave herself time it would smother the fear looks like you know what youre doing after all when he turned his head to scowl at her she gave him a quick friendly kiss smarter than you look lord lets go to madagascar before she could rise he caught her chin in his hand were going to finish this there his fingers tightened briefly but long enough all of this she met him look for look they had too far to go to give in now maybe she said but we have to get there first why dont we catch that plane remo picked up a silky bit of fluff whitney would have called a nightgown he balled it into his fist hed have his hands on lord and the woman before morning this time they wouldnt slip through his fingers and make him look like a fool when doug lord walked back in the door hed put a bullet between his eyes and the woman hed take care of the woman this time slowly he ripped the gown in half the silk tore with hardly a whisper when the phone rang he jerked his head signaling the other men to flank the door using the tip of his thumb and finger remo lifted the receiver when he heard the voice his sweat glands opened youve missed them again remo mr dimitri he saw the other men look over and turned his back it was never wise to let fear show weve found them as soon as they come back well they wont be back with a long smooth sigh dimitri blew out smoke theyve been spotted at the airport remo right under your nose the destination is antananarivo your tickets are waiting for you be prompt chapter four whitney pushed open the wooden shutters on the window and took a long look at antananarivo it didnt as shed thought it would remind her of africa shed spent two weeks once in kenya and remembered the heady morning scent of meat smoking on sidewalk grills of towering heat and a cosmopolitan flare africa was only a narrow strip of water away but whitney saw nothing from her window that resembled what she remembered of it nor did she find a tropical island flare she didnt sense the lazy gaiety shed always associated with islands and island people what she did sense though she wasnt yet sure why was a country completely unique to itself this was the capital of madagascar the heart of the country city of openair markets and handdrawn carts existing in complete harmony and total chaos alongside highrise office buildings and sleek modern cars it was a city so she expected the habitual turmoil that brewed in cities yet what she saw was peaceful slow but not lazy perhaps it was just the dawn or perhaps it was inherent the air was cool with dawn so that she shivered but didnt turn away it didnt have the smell of paris or europe but of something riper spice mixed with the first whispers of heat that threatened the morning chill animals few cities carried even a wisp of animal in their air hong kong smelled of the harbor and london of traffic antananarivo smelled of something older that wasnt quite ready to fade under concrete or steel there was a haze as heat hovered above the cooler ground even as she stood whitney could feel the temperature change almost degree by degree in another hour she thought the sweat would start to roll and the air would smell of that as well she had the impression of houses stacked on top of houses stacked on top of more houses all pink and purple in the early light it was like a fairy tale sweet and a little grim around the edges the town was all hills hills so steep and breathless that stairs had been dug built into rock and earth to negotiate them even from a distance they seemed worn and old and pitched at a terrifying angle she saw three children and their dog heedlessly racing down and thought she might get winded just watching them she could see lake anosy the sacred lake steel blue and still ringed by the jacaranda trees that gave it the exotic flare shed dreamed of because of the distance she could only imagine the scent would be sweet and strong like so many other cities there were modern buildings apartments hotels a hospital but sprinkled among them were thatched roofs a stones throw away were rice paddies and small farms the fields would be moist and glitter in the afternoon sun if she looked up toward the highest hill she could see the palaces glorious in the dawn opulent arrogant anachronistic she heard the sound of a car on the wide avenue below so they were here she thought stretching and drawing in the cool air the plane trip had been long and tedious but it had given her time to adjust to what had happened and to make some decisions of her own if she were honest she had to admit that shed made her decision the moment shed stepped on the gas and started her race with doug true it had been an impulse but shed stick by it if nothing else the quick stop in paris had convinced her that doug was smart and she was in for the count she was thousands of miles away from new york now and the adventure was here she couldnt change juans fate but she could have her own personal revenge by beating dimitri to the treasure and laughing to accomplish it she needed doug lord and the papers shed yet to see see them she would it was a matter of learning how to get around doug doug lord whitney mused stepping away from the window to dress who and what was he where did he come from and just where did he intend to go a thief yes she thought he was a man who might lift stealing to the level of a profession but he wasnt a robin hood he might steal from the rich but she couldnt picture him giving to the poor whatever he acquired hed keep yet she couldnt condemn him for it for one there was something about him some flash shed seen right from the beginning a lack of cruelty and a dash of what was irresistible to her daring then too shed always believed if you excelled at something you should pursue it she had an idea that he was very good at what he did a womanizer perhaps she thought but shed dealt with womanizers before professional ones who could speak three languages and order the best champagne were less admirable than a man like doug lord who would womanize in all good humor that didnt worry her he was attractive even appealing when he wasnt arguing with her she could handle the physical part of it though she could remember what it was like to lie beneath him with his mouth a teasing inch above hers thered been a pleasant breathless sort of sensation shed have liked to explore a bit further she could remember what it was like to wonder just how it would feel to kiss that interesting arrogant mouth not as long as they were business partners whitney reminded herself as she shook out a skirt shed keep things on the practical sort of level she could mark down in her notebook shed keep doug lord at a careful distance until she had her share of the winnings in her hand if something happened later then it happened with a half smile she decided it might be fun to anticipate it room service doug breezed in carrying a tray he checked a moment taking a brief but thorough look at whitney who stood by the bed in a sleek buffcolored teddy she could make a mans mouth water class he thought again a man like him had better watch his step when he started to have fantasies about class nice dress he said easily refusing to give him any reaction whitney stepped into the skirt is that breakfast hed break through that cool eventually he told himself in his own time coffee and rolls weve got things to do she drew on a blouse the color of crushed raspberries such as i checked the train schedule doug dropped into a chair crossed his ankles on the table and bit into a roll we can be on our way east at twelvefifteen meantime weve got to pick up some supplies she took her coffee to the dresser such as backpacks he said watching the sun rise over the city outside im not lugging that leather thing through the forest whitney took a sip of coffee before picking up her brush it was strong european style and thick as mud as in hiking you got it sugar well need a tent one of those new lightweight ones that fold up to nothing she drew the brush in a long slow stroke through her hair anything wrong with hotels with a quick smirk he glanced over then said nothing at all her hair looked like gold dust in the morning light fairy dust he found it difficult to swallow rising he paced over to the window so that his back was to her well use public transportation when i think its safe then go through the back door i dont want to advertise our little expedition he muttered dimitri isnt going to give up she thought of paris youve convinced me the less we use public roads and towns the less chance he has of picking up our scent makes sense whitney wound her hair into a braid and secured the end with a swatch of ribbon are you going to tell me where were going well travel by rail as far as tamatave he turned grinning with the sun at his back he looked more like a knight than a thief his hair fell to his collar dark a bit unruly there was a light of adventure in his eyes then we go north and when do i see what it is thats taking us north you dont need to ive seen it but he was already calculating how he could get her to translate pieces for him without giving her the whole slowly she tapped her brush against her palm she wondered how long it would be before she could translate some of the papers and keep a few snatches of information to herself doug would you buy a pig in a poke if i liked the odds with a half smile she shook her head no wonder youre broke you have to learn how to hang onto your money im sure you could give me lessons the papers douglas they were strapped to his chest again the first thing he was going to buy was a knapsack where he could store them safely his skin was raw from the adhesive he was certain whitney would have some pretty ointment that would ease the soreness he was equally sure shed mark the cost of it in her little notebook later when she started to speak again he held up a hand ive got a couple of books along you might like to read weve got a long trip and plenty of time well talk about it trust me okay she waited a moment watching him trust no she wasnt foolish enough to feel it but as long as she held the purse strings they were a team satisfied she swung her handbag strap over her shoulder and held out her hand if she were going on a quest shed just as soon it be with a knight who had some tarnish on him okay lets go shopping doug led her downstairs as long as she was in a good mood he might as well make his pitch companionably he swung an arm around her shoulder so howd you sleep just fine on their way through the lobby he plucked a small purple blossom from a vase and tucked it behind her ear passionflower he thought it might suit her its scent was strong and sweet as a tropical flowers should be the gesture touched her even as she distrusted it too bad we dont have much time to play tourist he said conversationally the queens palace is supposed to be something to see you have a taste for the opulent sure i always figured it was nice to live with a little flash she laughed shaking her head id rather have a feather bed than a gold one they say that knowledge is power i used to think so but i now know that they meant money she stopped in her tracks and stared at him what kind of a thief quoted byron you continue to surprise me if you read youre bound to pick up something shrugging doug decided to steer away from philosophy and back to practicality whitney we agreed to divide the treasure fiftyfifty after you pay me what you owe me he gritted his teeth on that right since were partners it seems to me we ought to divide the cash we have fiftyfifty she turned her head to give him a pleasant smile does it seem like that to you a matter of practicality he told her breezily suppose we got separated not a chance her smile remained pleasant as she tightened her hold on her purse im sticking to you like an appendage until this is all over douglas people might think were in love without breaking rhythm he changed tactics its also a matter of trust whose yours sugar after all if were partners we have to trust each other i do trust you she draped a friendly arm around his waist the mist was burning off and the sun was climbing as long as i hold the bankroll sugar doug narrowed his eyes classy wasnt all she was he thought grimly okay then how about an advance forget it because choking her was becoming tempting he broke away to face her down give me one reason why you should hold all the cash you want to trade it for the papers infuriated he spun away to stare at the whitewashed house behind him in the dusty side yard flowers and vines tangled in wild abandon he caught the scents of breakfast cooking and overripe fruit there was no way he could give her the slip as long as he was broke there was no way he could justify lifting her purse and leaving her stranded the alternative left him exactly where he was stuck with her the worst of it was he was probably going to need her sooner or later hed need someone to translate the correspondence written in french for no other reason than his own nagging curiosity not yet he thought not until he was on more solid ground look dammit ive got eight dollars in my pocket if he had much more she reflected hed dump her without a second thought change from the twenty i gave you in washington frustrated he started down a set of steep stairs youve got a mind like a damn accountant thanks she hung onto the rough wooden rail and wondered if there were any other way down she shielded her eyes and looked oh look whats that a bazaar quickening her pace she dragged doug back with her friday market he grumbled the zoma i told you that you should read the guidebook id rather be surprised lets take a look he went along because it was as easy and perhaps cheaper to buy some of the supplies in the open market as it was to buy them in one of the shops there was time before the train left he thought with a quick check of his watch they might as well enjoy it there were thatchroofed structures and wooden stalls under wide white umbrellas clothes fabrics gemstones were spread out for the serious buyer or the browser always a serious buyer whitney spotted an interesting mix of quality and junk but it wasnt a fair it was business the market was organized crowded full of sound and scent wagons drawn by oxen and driven by men wrapped in white lambas were crammed with vegetables and chickens animals clucked and mooed and snorted in varying degrees of complaint as flies buzzed a few dogs milled around sniffing and were shooed away or ignored she could smell feathers and spice and animal sweat true the roads were paved there were sounds of traffic and not too far away the windows of a firstclass hotel glistened in the burgeoning sun a goat shied at a sudden noise and pulled on his tether a child with mango juice dripping down his chin tugged on his mothers skirt and babbled in a language whitney had never heard she watched a man in baggy pants and a peaked hat point and count out coins caught by two scrawny legs a chicken squawked and struggled to fly feathers drifted on a rough blanket was a spread of amethysts and garnets that glinted dully in the early sun she started to reach out just to touch when doug pulled her to a display of sturdy leather moccasins therell be plenty of time for baubles he told her and nodded toward the walking shoes youre going to need something more practical than those little strips of leather youre wearing with a shrug whitney looked over her choices they were a long way from the cosmopolitan cities she was accustomed to a long way from the playgrounds the wealthy chose whitney bought the shoes then picked up a handmade basket instinctively bargaining for it in flawless french he had to admire her she was a born negotiator more he liked the way she had fun arguing over the price of a trinket he had a feeling shed have been disappointed if the haggling had gone too quickly or the price had dropped too dramatically since he was stuck with her doug decided to be philosophical and make the best of the partnership for the moment now that youve got it doug said whos going to carry it well leave it in storage with the luggage well need some food wont we you do intend to eat on this expedition eyes laughing she picked up a mango and held it under his nose he grinned and chose another then dropped both in her basket just dont get carried away she wandered through the stalls joining in the bargaining and carefully counting out francs she fingered a necklace of shells considering it as carefully as she would a bauble at cartiers in time she found herself filtering out the strange malagasy and listening answering even thinking in french the merchants traded in a continual stream of give and take it seemed they were too proud to show eagerness but whitney hadnt missed the marks of poverty on many how far had they come she wondered traveling in wagons they didnt seem tired she thought as she began to study the people as closely as their wares sturdy she would have said content though there were many without shoes the clothes might be dusty some worn but all were colorful women braided and pinned and wound their hair in intricate timely designs the zoma whitney decided was as much a social event as a business one lets pick up the pace babe there was an itch between his shoulder blades that was growing more nagging when doug caught himself looking over his shoulder for the third time he knew it was time to move on weve got a lot more to do today she dropped more fruit in the basket with vegetables and a sack of rice she might have to walk and sleep in a tent whitney thought but she wouldnt go hungry he wondered if she knew just what a startling contrast she made among the dark merchants and solemnfaced women with her ivory skin and pale hair there was an unmistakable air of class about her even as she stood bargaining for dried peppers or figs she wasnt his style doug told himself thinking of the sequinsandfeathers type he normally drifted to but shed be a hard woman to forget on impulse he picked up a soft cotton lamba and draped it over her head when she turned laughing she was so outrageously beautiful he lost his breath it should be white silk he thought she should wear white silk cool smooth hed like to buy her yards of it hed like to drape her in it in miles of it then slowly slowly strip it from her until it was only her skin just as soft just as white he could watch her eyes darken feel her flesh heat with her face beneath his hands he forgot she wasnt his style she saw the change in his eyes felt the sudden tension in his fingers her heart began a slow insistent thudding against her ribs hadnt she wondered what hed be like as a lover wasnt she wondering now when she could feel desire pouring out of him thief philosopher opportunist hero whatever he was her life was tangled with his and there was no going back when the time came theyd come together like thunder no pretty words no candlelight no sheen of romance she wouldnt need romance because his body would be hard his mouth hungry and his hands would know where to touch standing in the open market full of exotic scents and sound she forgot that hed be easy to handle dangerous woman doug realized as he deliberately relaxed his fingers with the treasure almost within reach and dimitri like a monkey on his back he couldnt afford to think of her as a woman at all women bigeyed women had always been his downfall they were partners he had the papers she had the bankroll that was as complicated as things were going to get youd better finish up here he said calmly enough we have to see about the camping supplies whitney let out a quiet cleansing breath and reminded herself he was already into her for over seven thousand dollars it wouldnt pay to forget it all right but she bought the lamba telling herself it was simply a souvenir by noon they were waiting for the train both of them carrying knapsacks carefully packed with food and gear he was restless impatient to begin hed risked his life and gambled his future on the small bulge of papers taped to his chest hed always played the odds but this time he held the bank by summer hed be dripping in money lying on some hot foreign beach sipping rum while some darkhaired sloeeyed woman rubbed oil over his shoulder hed have enough money to insure that dimitri would never find him and if he wanted to hustle hed hustle for pleasure not for his living here it comes feeling a fresh surge of excitement doug turned to whitney with the shawl draped over her shoulders she was carefully writing in her notepad she looked cool and calm while his shirt was already beginning to stick to his shoulder blades will you quit scrawling in that thing he demanded taking her arm youre worse than the goddamn irs just adding on the price of your train ticket partner jesus when we get what were after youll be kneedeep in gold and youre worried about a few francs funny how they add up isnt it with a smile she dropped the pad back in her purse next stop tamatave a car purred to a halt just as doug stepped onto the train behind whitney there they are jaw set remo reached beneath his jacket until his palm fit over the butt of his gun the fingers of his other hand brushed over the bandage on his face he had a personal score to settle with lord now it was going to be a pleasure a small hand with the pinky only a stub closed with steely strength on his arm the cuff was still white studded this time with hammered gold ovals the delicate hand somehow elegant despite the deformity made the muscles in remos arm quiver youve let him outwit you before the voice was quiet and very smooth a poets voice this time hes a dead man there was a pleasant chuckle followed by a stream of expensive french tobacco remo didnt relax or offer any excuses dimitris moods could be deceiving and remo had heard him laugh before hed heard him give that same mild pleasant laugh as hed seared the bottom of a victims feet with blue flame from a monogrammed cigarette lighter remo didnt move his arm nor did he open his mouth lords been a dead man since he stole from me something vile slipped into dimitris voice it wasnt anger but more power cool and dispassionate a snake doesnt always spew venom in fury get my property back then kill him however you please firing me his ears remo gestured for the man in the back seat to get out and purchase tickets and the woman there was another stream of tobacco smoke as dimitri thought it through hed learned years before that decisions made rashly leave a jagged trail he preferred the smooth and the clean a lovely woman and clever enough to sever butrains jugular damage her as little as possible and bring her back id like to talk with her satisfied he sat back idly watching the train through the smoke glass of the car window it amused and satisfied him to smell the powdery scent of fear drifting from his employees fear after all was the most elegant of weapons he gestured once with his mutilated hand a tedious business he said when remo closed the car door his sigh was delicate while he touched a scented silk handkerchief to his nose the smell of dust and animal annoyed him drive back to the hotel he instructed the silent man at the wheel i want a sauna and a massage whitney positioned herself next to a window and prepared to watch madagascar roll by as he had off and on since the previous day doug had his face buried in a guidebook there are at least thirtynine species of lemur in madagascar and more than eight hundred species of butterflies fascinating i had no idea you were so interested in fauna he looked over the top of the book all the snakes are harmless he added little things like that are important to me when im sleeping in a tent i always like to know something about the territory like the rivers here are full of crocks i guess that kills the idea of skinny dipping were bound to run into some of the natives there are several distinct tribes and according to this everybodys friendly thats good news do you have a projection as to how long it should be before we get to where x marks the spot a week maybe two leaning back he lit a cigarette how do you say diamond in french diamant narrowing her eyes she studied him did this dimitri have anything to do with stealing diamonds out of france and smuggling them here doug smiled at her she was close but not close enough no dimitris good but he didnt have anything to do with this particular heist so it is diamonds and they were stolen doug thought of the papers depends on your point of view just a thought whitney began plucking the cigarette from him for a drag but have you ever considered what youd do if there was nothing there its there he blew out smoke and watched her with his clear green eyes its there as always she found herself believing him it was impossible not to what are you going to do with your share he stretched his legs onto the seat beside her and grinned wallow in it reaching in the bag she plucked out a mango and tossed it to him what about dimitri once i have the treasure he can fry in hell youre a cocky sonofabitch douglas he bit into the mango im going to be a rich cocky sonofabitch interested she took the mango for a bite of her own she found it sweet and satisfying being richs important damn right why he shot her a look youre speaking from the comfort of several billion gallons of fudge ripple she shrugged lets just say im interested in your outlook on wealth when youre rich and you play the horses and lose you get ticked off because you lost not because you blew the rent money and thats what it comes down to ever worried about where you were going to sleep at night sugar she took another bite of fruit before handing it back to him something in his voice had made her feel foolish no she lapsed into silence for a time as the train rumbled on stopping at stations while people filed on or filed off it was already hot almost airless inside sweat fruit dust and grime hung heavily a man in a white panama a few seats forward mopped at his face with a large bandana because she thought she recognized him from the zoma whitney smiled he only pocketed the bandana and went back to his newspaper idly whitney noticed it was english before she turned back to a study of the landscape grassy rolling hills raced by almost treeless small villages or settlements were huddled here and there with thatchroofed houses and wide barns positioned near the river what river doug had the guidebook and could certainly tell her she was beginning to understand he could give her a fifteenminute lecture on it whitney preferred the anonymity of dirt and water she saw no crisscross of telephone wires or power poles the people living along these endless barren stretches would have to be tough independent selfsufficient she could appreciate that admire it without putting herself in their place though she was a woman who craved the city with its crowds and noise and pulse she found the quiet and vastness of the countryside appealing shed never found it difficult to value both a wildflower and a fulllength chinchilla they both brought pleasure the train wasnt quiet it rumbled and moaned and swayed while conversation was a constant babble it smelled not too unpleasantly as air drifted through the windows of sweat the last time shed ridden a train had been on impulse she recalled shed had an airconditioned roomette that smelled of powder and flowers it hadnt been nearly as interesting a ride a woman with a thumbsucking baby sat across from them he stared wideeyed and solemn at whitney before reaching out with a pudgy hand to grab her braid embarrassed his mother yanked him away rattling a quick stream of malagasy no no its all right laughing whitney stroked the babys cheek his fingers closed around hers like a small vise amused she signed for the mother to pass him to her after a few moments of hesitation and persuasion whitney took the baby onto her lap hello little man im not sure the natives have heard of pampers doug said mildly she merely wrinkled her nose at him dont you like children sure i just like them better when theyre housebroken chuckling she gave her attention to the baby lets see what weve got she told him and reaching in her purse came up with a compact how about this want to see the baby she held the mirror up for him enjoying the gurgling laughter pretty baby she crooned rather pleased with herself for amusing him just as amused as she the baby pushed the mirror toward her face pretty lady doug commented earning a laugh from whitney here you try it before he could protest shed passed the baby to him babies are good for you if shed expected him to be annoyed or to be awkward she was wrong as if hed spent his life doing it doug straddled the baby on his lap and began to entertain him that was interesting whitney noted the thief had a sweet side sitting back she watched doug bounce the baby on his knee and make foolish noises ever thought about going straight and opening a daycare center he lifted a brow and snatched the mirror from her look here he told the baby holding the mirror at an angle that had the sunlight flashing off it squealing the baby grabbed the compact and pushed it toward dougs face he wants you to see the monkey whitney said with a bland smile smartass so youve said to satisfy the baby doug made faces in the mirror bouncing with delight the baby knocked at the mirror angling it back so that doug had a quick view of the rear of the train he tensed and angling the mirror again took a longer scan holy shit what still juggling the baby he stared at her sweat pooled in his armpits and ran down his back you just keep smiling sugar and dont look behind me weve got a couple of friends a few seats back though her hands tensed on the arms of the seat she managed to keep her gaze from darting back over dougs shoulder small world aint it just got any ideas im working on it he measured the distance to the door if they got off at the next stop remo would be on them before theyd crossed the platform if remo was here dimitri was close he kept his men on a short leash doug gave himself a full minute to fight the panic what they needed was a diversion and an unscheduled departure you just follow my lead doug told her in undertones and when i say go you grab the knapsack and run toward the doors whitney glanced down the length of the train there were women children old people jammed into seats not the place for a showdown she decided do i have a choice no then ill run the train slowed for the next stop brakes squeaking engine puffing doug waited until the crowd of incoming and outgoing passengers was at its thickest sorry old man he murmured to the baby then gave his soft butt a hard pinch on cue the baby set up a yowling scream that had the concerned mother hopping up in alarm doug rose as well and set about causing as much confusion as possible in the crowded center aisle sensing the game whitney stood and jostled the man at her right hard enough to dislodge the packages in his arms and send them scattering on the floor grapefruit bounced and squashed when the train began to move again there were six people between doug and where remo sat crowding the aisle and arguing among themselves in malagasy in a gesture of apology doug raised his arms and upended a net bag of vegetables the baby sent up long continuous howls deciding it was the best he could do doug slipped a hand down and gripped whitneys wrist now together they streaked toward the doors doug glanced up long enough to see remo spring from his seat and begin to fight his way through the stillarguing group blocking the aisle he caught a glimpse of another man wearing a panama tossing a newspaper aside and jumping up before he too was encircled by the crowd doug only had a second to wonder where hed seen the face before now what whitney demanded as she watched the ground begin to rush by beneath them now we get off without hesitating doug jumped dragging her with him he wrapped himself around her tucking as they hit the ground so that they rolled together in a tangled heap by the time theyd stopped the train was yards away and picking up speed goddamn it whitney exploded from on top of him we couldve broken our necks yeah winded he lay there his hands had worked up under her skirt to her thighs but he barely noticed but we didnt unappeased she glowered down at him well arent we lucky now what do we do she demanded blowing loose hair out of her eyes were out in the middle of nowhere miles from where were supposed to be and with no transportation to get there youve got your feet doug tossed back at her so do they she said between her teeth and theyll be off at the next stop and doubling back for us theyve got guns and weve got mangos and a folding tent so the sooner we stop arguing and get going the better unceremoniously he pushed her from him and stood up i never told you itd be a picnic you never mentioned tossing me off a moving train either just get your ass in gear sweetheart rubbing a bruised hip she rose until she stood toe to toe with him youre crude arrogant and very dislikable oh excuse me he swept her a mock bow would you mind stepping this way so we can avoid getting a bullet in the brain duchess she stormed away and dragged up the backpack that had been knocked out of her hands on impact which way doug slipped his own pack over his shoulders north chapter five whitney had always been fond of mountains she could look back with pleasure on a twoweek skiing vacation in the swiss alps in the mornings shed ridden to the top of the slopes admiring the view from a tram the swishing rush of the ride down had always delighted her a great deal could be said about a cozy aprèsski with hot buttered rum and a crackling fire once shed enjoyed a lazy weekend in a villa in greece high on a rocky slope overlooking the aegean shed appreciated the height the view and the quality of nature and antiquity from the comfort of a terracotta balcony however whitney had never been big on mountain climbing sweaty legcramping mountain climbing nature wasnt all it was cracked up to be when it worked its way under the tender balls of your feet and dug in north hed said grimly she kept pace with him up tough rocky slopes and down again shed continue to keep pace with lord she promised herself as sweat dribbled down her back he had the envelope but while shed hike with him sweat with him pant with him there was absolutely no reason she had to speak to him no one absolutely no one told her to get her ass in gear and got away with it it might take days even weeks but shed get him for it there was one basic business rule shed learned from her father revenge chilled a bit was much more palatable north doug looked around at the rugged steep hills that surrounded them the terrain was a monotony of high grass that fanned in the breeze and rough red scars where erosion had won and rock endless unforgiving rock further up were a few sparse spindly trees but he wasnt looking for shade from his vantage point there was nothing else no huts no houses no fields no people for now it was exactly what he wanted the night before while whitney had slept hed studied the map of madagascar hed ripped from the stolen library book he couldnt stand to mar a book of any kind because books had given his imagination an outlet as a child and kept him company through lonely nights as a man but it had been necessary in this case the ragged piece of paper fit nicely in his pocket while the book stayed in his pack it was only there for backup in his minds eye doug separated the terrain into the three parallel belts hed studied the western lowlands didnt matter as he strode up a rocky rough path he hoped theyd detoured as far west as theyd have to theyd stick to the highlands avoid the river banks and open areas as long as they could dimitri was closer than hed anticipated doug didnt want to guess wrong again the heat was already oppressive but their water supply should last until morning hed worry about replenishing it when he had to he wished he could be certain just how far north they should travel before they dared swing east to the coast and easier ground dimitri might be waiting in tamatave soaking up wine and sunshine dining on the fresh local fish logically that should be their first stop so logically they had to avoid it for the time being doug didnt mind playing a game of wits the bigger the odds the better the sweeter the pot as hed once told whitney but dimitri dimitri was a different story he hitched at the straps of his backpack until the weight settled more comfortably on his shoulders and there wasnt only himself to think of this time one of the reasons hed avoided partnerships for so long was because he preferred having one body to worry about his own he shot a look across at whitney whod been coolly silent since theyd left the train tracks and headed toward the highlands damn woman he thought for lack of anything better if she thought the coldshoulder routine was going to shake him up she was dead wrong it might make some of her fancy patentleather jerks beg for a word of forgiveness but as far as he was concerned she was a hell of a lot more attractive when her mouth was shut anyway imagine complaining because hed gotten her off the train in one piece maybe she had a few bruises but she was still breathing her problem was he decided she wanted everything all nice and pretty like that highclass apartment of hers or the tiny little piece of silk she was wearing under that skirt doug shook away that particular thought in a hurry and concentrated on picking his way over the rocks hed like to keep to the hills for a while two days maybe three there was plenty of cover and the going was rough rough enough he was certain to slow remo and some of dimitris other trained hounds down they were more accustomed to tramping down back alleys and into sleazy motel rooms than over rocks and hills those used to being hunted acclimated with more ease pausing on a crest he drew out the field glasses and took a long slow sweep below and slightly west he spotted a small settlement the cluster of tiny red houses and wide barns bordered a patchwork of fields rice paddies he decided because of their moist emerald green color he saw no power lines and was grateful the farther away from civilization the better the settlement would be a merina tribe if his memory of the guidebook was accurate just beyond was a narrow winding river part of the betsiboka eyes narrowed doug followed its trail while an idea formed true the river flowed northwest but the notion of traveling by boat had some appeal crocodiles or not it was bound to be faster than going on foot even for a short distance traveling by river was something hed have to decide on when the time came hed take an evening or two to read up on it what rivers would suit his purpose best and how the malagasy traveled by them he remembered skimming over something that had reminded him of the flatbed canoes the cajuns used doug had traveled through the bayous on one himself after nearly bungling a job in a stately old house outside of lafayette how much had he gotten for those antique pearlhandled dueling pistols he couldnt remember but the chase through the swamp where hed had to pole his way across cypress trees and under dripping moss that had been something no he wouldnt mind traveling by river again in any case hed keep his eye out for more settlements sooner or later theyd need more food and have to bargain for it remembering the woman beside him he decided that whitney might just come in handy there disgusted and aching from bruises whitney sat on the ground she wasnt going another step until shed rested and eaten her legs felt entirely too much like they had the one and only time shed tried the electric jogging track at the gym without giving doug a glance she dug into her pack the first thing she was going to do was change her shoes replacing the glasses doug turned to her the sun was straight up they could make miles before dusk lets go coolly silent whitney found a banana and began to peel it in long slow strips just let him tell her to move her ass this time with her eyes on dougs she bit into the fruit and chewed her skirt was hiked up past her knees as she sat crosslegged on the ground damp with perspiration her blouse clung to her the neat braid shed fashioned while hed watched that morning had loosened so that pale silky hair escaped to tease her cheekbones her face was as cool and elegant as marble lets move desire made him edgy she wasnt going to get to him he promised himself no way every time he let a woman get under his skin he ended up losing maybe just maybe hed get to her before they were finished but there was no way this cooleyed skinny lady was going to shake his priorities money the good life he wondered what it would be like to have her under him naked hot and completely vulnerable whitney leaned back against a rock and took another bite of fruit a rare breeze moved hot air over her idly she scratched the back of her knee up yours lord she suggested in perfectly rounded tones god hed like to make love with her until she was limp and slick and malleable hed like to murder her listen sugar weve got a lot of ground to cover today since were on foot your doing she reminded him he crouched down until they were at eye level it was my doing that kept your empty head on your sexy shoulders full of fury and frustration of unwanted needs he gripped her chin in his hand dimitri would just love to get his pudgy little hands on a classy number like you believe me hes got a unique imagination a quick thrill of fear went through her but she kept her eyes level dimitris your boogeyman doug not mine he wont be selective i wont be intimidated youll be dead he tossed back if you dont do what youre told firmly she pushed his hand away gracefully she rose though the skirt was smudged with red dust and rent with a hole at the hip it billowed around her like a cloak the rough malagasy shoes might have been glass slippers he had to admire the way she pulled it off it was innate he was sure no one could have taught her if shed been the peasant she looked like at that moment shed still have moved like a duchess one brow rose as she dropped the banana peel into his hand i never do what im told in fact i often make a point not to do try to keep that in mind in the future keep it up sugar and youre not going to have one taking her time she brushed some of the dust from her skirt shall we go he tossed the peel into a ravine and tried to convince himself hed have preferred a woman who whimpered and trembled if youre sure youre ready quite sure he took out his compass for another check north theyd keep heading north for a while yet the sun might beat down unmercifully with no shade to fight it and the ground might be misery itself to hike on but the rocks and slopes offered some protection whether it was instinct or superstition something was prickling at the back of his neck he wouldnt stop again until sundown you know duchess under different circumstances id admire that class of yours he began to walk in a steady groundeating pace right now youre in danger of becoming a pain in the ass long legs and determination kept her abreast with him breeding she corrected is admirable under any circumstances she sent him an amused glance and enviable you keep your breeding sister ill keep mine with a laugh she tucked her arm through his oh i intend to he looked down at her neat manicured hand he didnt think there was another woman in the world who could make him feel as though he were escorting her to a ball when they were fighting their way up a rocky slope in the full afternoon sun decided to be friendly again i decided rather than sulk id keep my eye open for the first opportunity to pay you back for the bruises in the meantime just how far are we going to walk the train ride wouldve taken about twelve hours and weve got to follow a less direct route you figure it out no need to be testy she said mildly cant we find a village and rent a car let me know when you see the first hertz sign itll be my treat you really should eat something douglas lack of food always puts me in a bad mood turning away from him she offered her pack go ahead have a nice mango fighting a grin he loosened the strap and reached in the fact was he could use something warm and sweet at the moment his fingers brushed over the net bag that held the fruit and touched something soft and silky curious he drew it out and examined the tiny lacetrimmed pair of bikini briefs so she hadnt worn them yet great looking mangoes they have here whitney looked over her shoulder and watched him run the material between his fingers get your hands out of my pants douglas he only grinned and held them up so that the sun beamed through them interesting phrasing how come you bother wearing something like this anyway modesty she said primly with a laugh he stuffed them back in the pack sure pulling out a mango he took a big greedy bite juice trickled wonderfully down his dry throat silk and lace always make me think of modest little nuns in underdeveloped countries what an odd imagination you have she observed as she half skidded down a slope they always make me think of sex with this she lengthened her stride to a marching pace and whistled smartly they walked and walked they slapped sunscreen on every inch of exposed skin and accepted the fact that theyd burn anyway flies buzzed and swooped attracted by the scent of oil and sweat but they learned to ignore them other than insects they had no company as the afternoon waned whitney lost her interest in the rolling rocky highlands and the stretches of valley below the earthy smells of dirt and sunbaked grass lost their appeal when she was streaked with both she watched a bird fly overhead caught in a current because she was looking up she didnt see the long slim snake that passed inches in front of her foot then hid itself by a rock there wasnt anything exotic about dripping with sweat or slipping over pebbles madagascar would have held more appeal from the cool terrace of a hotel room only the thin edge of pride kept her from demanding that they stop as long as he could walk so by god could she from time to time she spotted a small village or settlement always cupped near the river and spread out into fields from the hills they could see cook smoke and when the air was right hear the sounds of dogs or cattle voices didnt carry distance and fatigue gave whitney a sense of unreality perhaps the huts and fields were only part of a stage once through dougs field glasses she watched workers bending over the swamplike paddies many of the women with babies strapped in lambas papoosestyle on their backs she could see the moist ground shiver and give under the movement of feet in all her experience her treks through europe whitney had never seen anything quite like it but then paris london and madrid offered the glitter and cosmopolitan touches she was accustomed to shed never strapped a pack on her back and hiked over the countryside before as she shifted the weight yet again she told herself there was always a first time and a last while she might enjoy the color the terrain and the openness shed enjoy it a hell of a lot more off her feet if she wanted to perspire she wanted to do it in a sauna if she wanted to exhaust herself she wanted to do it trouncing someone in a few fast games of tennis aching and sticky with sweat she put one foot in front of the other she wouldnt come in second place to doug lord or anyone else doug watched the angle of the sun and knew theyd have to find a place to camp shadows were lengthening to the west the sky was already taking on streaks of red normally he did his best maneuvering at night but he didnt think the highlands of madagascar was a good place to try his luck in the dark hed traveled the rockies at night once and had nearly broken his leg in the process it didnt take much effort to remember his slide over the rocks the unplanned trip down the cliff had masked his trail but hed had to limp his way into boulder when the sun set theyd park and wait for dawn he kept waiting for whitney to complain to wail to demand to act in general as he considered a woman would act under the circumstances then again whitney hadnt acted the way hed expected from the first moment they had set eyes on one another the truth was he wanted her to grumble it would make it easier to justify dumping her at the first opportunity after hed skimmed her of most of her cash if she complained he could do both without a qualm as it was she wasnt slowing him down and she was carrying her share of the load it was only the first day he reminded himself give her time hothouse flowers wilted quickly when they were exposed to real air lets take a look at that cave cave shielding her eyes whitney followed his gaze she saw a very small arch and a very dark hole that cave yeah if it isnt occupied by one of our fourlegged friends itll make a nice hotel for the night inside the beverly wilshires a nice hotel he didnt even spare her a glance first wed better see if theres a vacancy swallowing whitney watched him go over strip off his pack and crawl in just barely she resisted the urge to call him out everyones entitled to a phobia she reminded herself as she walked a bit closer hers was a terror of small closedin spaces as tired as she was shed have walked another ten miles rather than crawl into that tiny arch of darkness it aint the wilshire doug said as he crawled back out but itll do they have our reservations whitney sat down on a rock and took a long look around there was nothing but more rock a few scrubby pines and pitted dirt i seem to remember paying an exorbitant amount of money for that tent that folds up like a handkerchief the one you insisted we had to have she reminded him havent you ever heard of the pleasure of sleeping under the stars when someones after my hide and theyve come close to peeling it a number of times i like having a wall to keep my back to still kneeling he picked up his pack i figure dimitris looking for us east of here but im not taking any chances it cools down in the highlands at night he added in there we can risk a small fire a campfire whitney examined her nails if she didnt have a manicure soon theyd look very tacky charming in a little place like that the smoke would suffocate us in minutes doug pulled a small hatchet out of his pack and unsnapped the leather sheath after about five feet the place opens up i can stand moving to a scrawny pine he began hacking at a branch ever go spelunking i beg your pardon cave exploring he explained grinning i knew this geology major once her daddy owned a bank as he recalled hed never been able to soak her for much more than a couple of memorable nights in a cave ive always found better things to explore than holes in the ground then youve missed a lot sugar this might not be a tourist attraction but it has some firstclass stalactites and stalagmites how exciting she said dryly when she looked toward the cave all she saw was a very small very dark hole in the rock just looking made the sweat bead cold on her forehead annoyed doug began to chop a respectable pile of firewood yeah i guess a woman like you wouldnt find rock formations very exciting unless you could wear them they were the same women who wore french dresses and italian shoes thats why for pleasure hed go for a fan dancer or a pro you got honesty there and some spine whitney stopped staring at the opening long enough to narrow her eyes at him just what do you mean a woman like me spoiled he said bringing his hatchet down with a thwack shallow shallow she rose from the rock accepting the spoiled wasnt a problem whitney figured truth was truth shallow she repeated youve a hell of a nerve calling me shallow douglas i didnt steal my way to easy street you didnt have to he tilted his head so that their eyes met his cool hers hot thats about all that separates us duchess you were born with a silver spoon in your mouth i was born to take it out and hock it tucking the firewood under his arm he walked back to the cave you wanna eat lady then get your highclass buns inside you wont get any room service here agile and quick he grabbed his pack by the straps crawled inside and disappeared how dare he with her hands on her hips whitney stared at the cave how dare he speak to her that way after shed walked miles and miles since shed met him shed been shot at threatened chased and pushed from a train and it had cost her thousands of dollars to date how dare he talk to her as though she were a simpering emptyheaded debutante he wouldnt get away with it briefly she thought of simply going on herself leaving him to his cave like any badtempered bear oh no she took a long deep breath as she stared at the opening in the rock no that was just what hed like hed be rid of her and have the treasure all to himself she wouldnt give him the satisfaction if she killed herself in the process she was sticking with him until she got every dime he owed her and a lot more a hell of a lot more she added as she gritted her teeth getting down on her hands and knees whitney started into the cave pure anger carried her the first couple of feet then the cold sweat of fear broke out and riveted her to the spot as her breath began to hitch she couldnt move forward she couldnt move back it was a box airless dark the lid was already closed to suffocate her she felt the walls the dark damp walls closing in squeezing the air out of her laying her head down on the hard dirt she fought back hysteria no she wouldnt give in to it couldnt he was just ahead just ahead if she whimpered hed hear pride was every bit as strong as fear she wouldnt have his scorn gasping for air she inched forward hed said the cave opened up shed be able to breathe if she could just crawl in a few more feet oh god she needed light and room and air balling her hands into fists she fought off the need to scream no she wouldnt make a fool of herself in front of him she wouldnt be his entertainment while she lay prone waging her own war she caught a glimpse of a flicker of light staying perfectly still she concentrated on the sound of crackling wood the light smell of pine smoke hed started the fire it wouldnt be dark she had only to pull herself a few more feet and it wouldnt be dark it took all her strength and more courage than shed known she had inch by inch whitney worked her way in until the light played over her face and the walls spread out around her drained she lay for a moment just breathing so you decided to join me with his back to her doug drew out one of the clever folding pans to heat water the thought of hot strong coffee had kept him going the last five miles dinners dutch treat sugar fruit rice and coffee ill handle the coffee lets see what you can do with the rice though she was still shaking whitney brought herself into a sitting position it would pass she told herself in moments the nausea the lightheadedness would pass then somehow shed make him pay too bad we didnt pick up a little white wine but when he turned to her he trailed off was it a trick of the light or was her face gray frowning he set the water on to heat then went to her no trick of the light he decided she looked as though shed dissolve if he touched her unsure of himself doug crouched down whats wrong her eyes were hot and hard when she looked at him nothing whitney reaching out he touched her hand jesus youre like ice come on over to the fire im fine furious she snatched her hand away just leave me alone hold on before she could spring to her feet he had her by the shoulders he could feel her tremble under his palms she wasnt supposed to look so young so defenseless women with bluechip stocks and watery diamonds had all the defense they needed ill get you some water he murmured in silence he reached for the canteen and opened it for her its a little warm take it slow she sipped it was indeed warm and tasted like iron she sipped again im all right her voice was tense fretful he wasnt supposed to be kind just rest a minute if youre sick im not sick she thrust the canteen back in his hands i have a little problem with closedin places okay im in now and ill be just fine not a little problem he realized as he took her hand again it was damp cold and trembling guilt hit him and he hated it he hadnt given her a break since theyd started hadnt wanted to once she made him soften made him care hed lose his edge it had happened before but she was trembling whitney you shouldve told me she angled her chin in a gesture he couldnt help but admire i have a bigger problem with being a fool why it never bothers me grinning he brushed the hair away from her temples she wasnt going to cry thank christ people whore born fools rarely notice but the sting had gone out of her voice her lips curved anyway im in it might take a crane to get me back out again breathing slowly she glanced around at the wide cave with the pillars of rock hed spoken of in the firelight the rocks shone rising up or plunging down here and there the cave floor was littered with dung she saw with a shudder a snake skin curled against the wall even if it is decorated in early neanderthal weve got a rope he ran his knuckles quickly back and forth over her cheek her color was coming back ill just haul you out when the time comes glancing back he saw the water beginning to simmer lets have some coffee when he turned away whitney touched her cheek where it was warmed from his hand she hadnt thought he could be so unexpectedly sweet when there wasnt an angle or was there with a sigh she stripped off her pack she still held the bankroll i dont know anything about cooking rice opening her bag she took out the mesh bag of fruit more than a few had suffered bruises and the scent was hot and ripe no sevencourse dinner had ever looked so good due to our current facilities theres nothing to do but boil and stir rice water fire he glanced over his shoulder you should be able to handle it who does the dishes she wanted to know as she poured water into another pan cookings a joint effort sos cleaning he shot her a fast appealing grin after all were partners are we smiling sweetly whitney set the pot to heat and drew in the scent of coffee the cave full of dung and damp was immediately civilized well partner how about letting me see the papers doug handed her a metal mug filled with coffee how about letting me hold half the money over the rim her eyes laughed at him coffees good douglas another of your many talents yeah i was blessed drinking half his cup down he let it run hot and strong through him ill leave you in the kitchen while i see to our sleeping arrangements whitney hauled out the sack of rice those sleeping bags better feel like feather beds after what i paid for them youve got a dollar fixation sugar ive got the dollars he mumbled under his breath as he cleared spaces for their bags while whitney couldnt catch the words she caught the drift grinning she began to scoop out rice one handful two if rice was to be their main dish she mused they might as well eat hearty she dug into the bag again it took her a moment to figure out the mechanics of the spoon that folded into itself by the time she had it opened the water was beginning to boil rapidly rather pleased with herself whitney began to stir use a fork doug told her while he unrolled the sleeping bags a spoon mashes the grains picky picky she mumbled but went through the same process on the fork as she had on the spoon how do you know so much about cooking anyway i know a lot about eating he said easily i dont often find myself in the position where i can go out and enjoy the kind of food im entitled to he unrolled the second bag next to the first after a moments consideration he moved them about a foot apart he was better off with a little distance so i learned to cook its satisfying as long as someone else is doing it he only shrugged i like it brains and a few spices and you can eat like a king even in a ratty motel room with bad plumbing and when things get tough ill work in a restaurant for awhile a job im disillusioned he let the light sarcasm pass over him the only one ive ever been able to tolerate besides you eat good and it gives you a chance to check out the clientele for a possible mark no opportunity should ever go undeveloped spreading the lower half of his body on one of the bags he leaned against the cave wall and drew out a cigarette is that a boy scout motto if it isnt it should be i bet youdve just raked in the merit badges douglas he grinned enjoying the quiet the tobacco the coffee hed learned long ago to enjoy what he could when he could and plan for more much more one way or the other he agreed hows dinner she swiped through the rice with the fork again its coming as far as she could tell he stared up at the ceiling idly studying the formation of rock that had dripped down over centuries into long spears hed always been drawn to antiquity to heritage perhaps because he didnt have much of one himself he knew that it was part of the reason he was driving himself north toward the jewels and the stories behind them rice is better sautéed in butter with mushrooms and a few slivers of almonds she felt her stomach groan eat a banana she suggested and tossed him one any idea how were going to replace our water i think we might slip down to the village below in the morning he blew out a cloud of smoke the only thing that was missing he decided was a nice hot tub and a pretty scented blonde to scrub his back it would be one of the first things he saw to when the treasure was in his hands whitney crossed her legs under her and chose another piece of fruit do you think its safe he shrugged and finished off his coffee it was always more a matter of need than safety we need water and we might bargain for some meat please youll get me excited the way i figure it dimitri knew the train was going to tamatave so thats where hell be looking for us by the time we get there im hoping hes looking someplace else she bit into the fruit so he doesnt have any idea where youre ultimately going no more than you do sugar he hoped but the itch between his shoulder blades had yet to let up taking a last deep drag doug flicked the stub of the cigarette into the fire as far as i know hes never seen the papers at least not all of them if hes never seen them how did he find out about the treasure faith sugar same as you she lifted a brow at his smirk this dimitri doesnt strike me as a man of faith instinct then there was a man named whitaker who figured to sell the papers to the highest bidder and make a nice profit without having to dig for it the idea of a treasure a documented one caught dimitris imagination i told you he had one of those indeed whitaker turning the name over in her mind whitney forgot to stir george allan whitaker the same doug blew out smoke know him casually i dated one of his nephews its thought he made his money from bootlegging among other things smuggling among other things especially in the last ten years or so remember the geraldi sapphires that were stolen lets see in seventysix she frowned a minute no you should keep up with current events sugar read that book i lifted in dc missing gems through the ages whitney moved her shoulders i prefer fiction when i read broaden your outlook you can learn anything there is to learn from books really interested she studied him again so you like to read next to sex its my favorite pastime anyway the geraldi sapphires the sweetest set of rocks since the crown jewels impressed she lifted a brow you stole them no he settled his shoulders against the wall i was on a down swing in seventysix didnt have the fare to get to rome but ive got connections so did whitaker he stole them her eyes widened as she thought of the skinny old man arranged doug corrected once he hit sixty whitaker didnt like getting his hands dirty he liked to pretend he was an expert in archeology didnt you catch any of his shows on public television so he watched pbs too a wellrounded thief no but i heard he wanted to be a landlocked jacques cousteau not enough class still he got pretty good ratings for a couple of years bullshitting a lot of hotshots with big bank accounts into financing digs he had a real smooth game going my father said he was full of shit whitney said idly your fathers got more on the ball than fudge ripple anyway whitaker played middleman for a lot of rocks and art objects that crossed from one side of the atlantic to the other about a year ago he conned some english lady out of a bunch of old documents and correspondence her interest peaked our papers he didnt care for the plural pronoun but shrugged it off the lady considered it all part of art or history cultural value shed written a lot of books on stuff like that there was some general involved whod nearly worked a deal with her but it seemed whitaker knew more about flattering matrons and whitaker had a more basic train of thought greed trouble was he was broke and had to do some campaigning for funds for the expedition thats where dimitri came in exactly like i said whitaker threw the bidding open it was supposed to be a business deal partners he added with a slow smile dimitri decided he didnt like the competitive market and made an alternate proposition doug crossed his ankles and peeled the banana whitaker could let him have the papers and dimitrid let whitaker keep all his fingers and toes whitney took another nibble of fruit but it wasnt easy to swallow sounds like a forceful businessman yeah dimitri loves to wheel and deal trouble was he used a little too much persuasion on whitaker apparently the old man had a heart problem keeled over before dimitri had the papers or his jollies im not sure which pissed him off more an unfortunate accident or so dimitri said when he hired me to steal them doug bit into the banana and savored it he went into graphic detail on how hed planned to change whitakers mind for the purpose of putting the fear of god into me so i wouldnt get any ideas myself he remembered the tiny pair of silver pliers dimitri had fondled during the interview it worked but you took them anyway only after hed doublecrossed me he told her over another bite of banana if hed played it straight hed have the papers idve taken my fee and a little vacation in cancun but this way you have them and no opportunity should go undeveloped you got it sister jesus christ doug bolted up and scrambled to the fire in automatic defense whitney curled up her legs expecting anything from a slimy snake to a hideous spider damn woman how much rice did you put in here i she broke off and stared as he grabbed at the pan rice was flowing over the sides like lava just a couple handfuls she said as she bit her lip to keep from laughing my ass well four she pressed the back of her hand to her mouth as he dug for a plate or five four or five he muttered while scooping rice onto the plates how the hell did i end up in a cave in madagascar with i love lucy i told you i couldnt cook she reminded him as she studied the brownish sticky mass on the plate i simply proved it in spades when he heard her muffled chuckle he glanced over she sat indian style her skirt and blouse filthy the ribbon at the end of her braid dangling free he remembered how shed looked the first time hed seen her cool and sleek in a white fedora and lush furs why was it she looked every bit as appealing now you laugh he tossed back shoving a plate at her youre going to have to eat your share im sure its fine with the fork shed used for cooking she poked into the rice bravely he thought she took the first bite the flavor was nutty and not altogether unpleasant with a shrug whitney ate more though shed never been in the position of being a beggar shed heard they couldnt be choosers dont be a baby douglas she told him if we can get our hands on some mushrooms and almonds well fix it your way next time with the enthusiasm of a child over a bowl of ice cream she dug in without fully realizing it whitney had had her first experience with real hunger eating at a slower pace and with less enthusiasm doug watched her hed been hungry before and figured hed be hungry again but she perhaps she was dining on rice off a tin plate in a skirt that was streaked with grime but class shone through he found it fascinating and intriguing enough to make it worthwhile discovering if it always would the partnership he mused might be more interesting than hed bargained for for as long as it lasted douglas what about the woman who gave whitaker the map what about her well what happened to her he swallowed a lump of rice butrain when she glanced up he saw the fear come and go in her eyes and was glad better for both of them if she understood this was the big leagues but her hands were steady when she reached for the coffee i see so youre the only one alive whos seen those papers thats right sugar hell want you dead and me too thats also right but i havent seen them casually doug dug for more rice if he gets his hands on you you cant tell him anything she waited a minute studying him youre a firstclass bastard doug this time he grinned because hed heard the light trace of respect i like first class whitney im going to live there the rest of my life two hours later he was cursing her again though only to himself theyd let the fire burn down to embers so that the light in the cave was dim and red somewhere deeper water dripped in a slow musical plop it reminded him of a pricey innovative little bordello in new orleans they were both exhausted both aching from the demands of a very long very arduous day doug stripped off his shoes with his only thought one of the pleasures of unconsciousness he never doubted hed sleep like a rock you know how to work that thing he asked idly as he opened his own bag i think i can handle a zipper thanks then he made the mistake of glancing over and not looking away again without any show of selfconsciousness whitney drew off her blouse he remembered just how thin the material of her teddy had looked in the morning light when she pulled off her skirt his mouth watered no she wasnt selfconscious she was nearly comatose with fatigue it never occurred to her to make a play at modesty even if shed thought it out whitney would have considered the teddy adequate cover she wore a fraction of that on a public beach her only thought was of getting horizontal of closing her eyes and of oblivion if she hadnt been so tired she might have enjoyed the discomfort she was causing in the region of dougs loins it might have given her some pleasure to know his muscles had tensed as he watched the subtle flicker of firelight play over her skin as she bent to unzip her bag shed have gotten pure feminine satisfaction knowing he sucked in his breath as the thin material rose up at her thighs and pulled over her bottom with her movements without giving it a thought she climbed into the sleeping bag and pulled up the zipper nothing was visible but a cloud of pale hair untangled from the braid with a sigh she pillowed her head on her hands good night douglas yeah he pulled off his shirt then gripped the edge of adhesive and held his breath ruthlessly he ripped and the fire snaked across his chest whitney never budged as his curse bounced off the cave walls she was already asleep cursing her cursing the pain he snapped the envelope into his knapsack before he climbed into his own bag in sleep she sighed low and quiet doug stared at the ceiling of the cave wide awake and aching from more than bruises chapter six something tickled the back of her hand fighting to cling to sleep whitney flicked her wrist in a lazy backandforth action and yawned she had always kept her own hours if she wanted to sleep until noon she slept until noon if she wanted to get up at dawn she did when the mood struck her she could work for an eighteenhour stretch with a similar enthusiasm she could sleep for the same length of time at the moment she wasnt interested in anything but the vague rather pretty dream she was having when she felt the feathery brush on her hand again she sighed only slightly annoyed and opened her eyes in all probability it was the biggest fattest spider shed ever seen big black and hairy it probed and skiddled with its bowed legs her hand only inches from her face whitney watched as it loomed full in her vision moving lazily across her knuckles in a direct line to her nose for a moment dazed with sleep she just stared at it in the dim light her knuckles her nose realization came loud and clear muffling a yelp she knocked the spider off and several feet into the air it landed with an audible plop on the cave floor then meandered drunkenly away the spider hadnt frightened her she never considered the possibility that it might have been poisonous it was simply ugly and whitney had a basic disrespect for the ugly sighing in disgust she sat up and combed her fingers through her tangled hair well she supposed when one slept in a cave one could expect a visit from ugly neighbors but why hadnt it visited doug instead deciding there was no reason why he should sleep when shed been so rudely awakened whitney turned with the full intention of giving him a hard shove he was gone and so was his sleeping bag uneasy but not yet alarmed she looked around the cave was empty with the rock formations doug had spoken of giving it the look of an abandoned and slightly dilapidated castle the cook fire was only a pile of glowing embers the air smelled ripe some of the fruit was already turning dougs pack like his sleeping bag was gone the bastard the rotten bastard he had taken himself off with the papers and left her stuck in a damn cave with a couple of pieces of fruit a sack of rice and a spider as big as a dinner plate too furious to think twice she dashed across the cave and began to crawl through the tunnel when her breath clogged up she pushed on the hell with phobias she told herself no one was going to doublecross her and get away with it to catch him she had to get out and when she caught him she saw the opening and concentrated on it and revenge panting shuddering she pulled herself into the sunshine scrambling up she drew in all of her breath and let it out on a shout lord lord you sonofabitch the sound rang out and bounced back at her half as loud but twice as angry impotently she looked around at red hills and rock how was she supposed to know which way hed gone north damn north he had the compass and he had the map after gritting her teeth whitney shouted again lord you bastard you wont get away with it with what she spun on her heel and nearly bumped into him where the hell were you she demanded in a blaze of relief and anger she gripped his shirt and yanked him against her where the hell did you go easy sugar companionably he patted her bottom if id known you wanted to get your hands on me idve stuck around longer around your throat with a jerk she released him gotta start somewhere he set his pack near the mouth of the cave dyou think id ditch you at the very first opportunity he had to admit she was sharp the idea had occurred to him but after a quick look around that morning he hadnt been able to justify leaving her in a cave in the middle of nowhere still the opportunity was bound to come up in an attempt to keep her from getting a step ahead of him he poured on the charm whitney were partners and he lifted a hand and ran a fingertip down her cheek youre a woman what kind of man would i be if i left you alone in a place like this she met his engaging smile with one of her own the kind of man whod sell the hide off the family dog if the price was right now where were you he wouldnt have sold the hide but he might have hocked the whole dog if it had been necessary youre a hard lady look you were sleeping like a baby as she had all night while hed spent a good part of it tossing turning and fantasizing he wouldnt forgive her for that easily but there was a time and place for payback i wanted to do a little scouting around and i didnt want to wake you she let out a long breath it was reasonable and he was back next time you want to play daniel boone wake me up whatever you say whitney saw a bird fly overhead she watched it for a moment until she was calm the sky was clear so was the air and it was cool the heat was a few hours off there was a quality of silence shed only heard a few times in her life it soothed well since youve been scouting how about a report everythings quiet down in the village doug drew out a cigarette which whitney plucked from his fingers pulling out another he lit them both i didnt go close enough to get any real particulars but it looks like business as usual the way i see it since everybodys calm and easy its a good time to drop in for a visit whitney looked down at her grimesmeared teddy like this ive already told you its a nice dress and it had a certain appeal with one strap hanging down her shoulder anyway i didnt pass a local beauty parlor and boutique you might go visiting looking sleazy whitney cast one long look up his body then down in fact im sure you do i on the other hand intend to wash and change first suit yourself theres probably enough water left to get some of the dirt off your face when she reached up automatically to brush at her cheeks he grinned wheres your pack she looked back at the mouth of the cave its in there her gaze was defiant her voice firm when she looked back at him im not going back in there okay ill get your gear but youre not going to be able to primp all morning i dont want to lose any time whitney merely lifted a brow as he started to crawl back in i never primp she said mildly its not necessary with an indistinguishable grunt he was gone nibbling on her lip she glanced at the cave then at the pack hed left beside it she might not have a second chance without hesitation she crouched down and began to root through it there was cooking gear to paw through and his clothes she came upon a rather elegant mans brush that had her pausing a moment when had he gotten that she wondered she knew every item down to his shorts that shed paid for light fingers she decided and dropped the brush back in when she found the envelope she took it out carefully this had to be it she glanced back at the cave again quickly she dew out a thin yellowed sheet sealed in plastic and skimmed it it was written in french in a trim feminine hand a letter she thought no part of a journal and the date my god her eyes widened as she studied the neat faded writing september she was standing in blazing sunlight on a windand weathertorn rock holding history in her hand whitney scanned it again quickly catching phrases of fear of anxiety and of hope a young girl had written it of that she was all but certain because of references to maman and papa a young aristocrat confused and afraid by what was happening to her life and her family whitney reflected did doug have any idea just what he was carrying in a canvas sack it wouldnt do to take the chance to read it thoroughly now later carefully whitney closed his pack again and set it down next to the mouth of the cave thinking she tapped the envelope against her open palm it was very satisfying to beat a man at his own game she decided then heard the sounds of his return holding the envelope in one hand she looked down at herself dumbly she passed the other hand from her breast to her waist just where the hell was she supposed to hide it mata hari mustve had a sarong at least frantic she started to slip it down the bodice of the teddy then realized the absurdity she might as well pin it to her forehead with seconds to spare she slipped it down her back and left the rest to luck your luggage ms macallister ill catch you later with your tip thats what they all say good service is its own reward she gave him a smug smile he gave one right back to her whitney had taken the pack from his hand when a sudden thought occurred to her if she could lift the envelope so easily then he opening the pack she dug for her wallet youd better get moving sugar were already late for our morning call he started to take her arm when she shoved the pack into his stomach the hiss of air coming from his lungs gave her great satisfaction my wallet douglas taking it out she opened it and saw hed been generous enough to leave her with a twenty it appears youve had your sticky fingers on it finders keepers partner though hed hoped she wouldnt find him out quite so soon he only shrugged dont worry youll get your allowance oh really you could say im a traditionalist satisfied with the new situation he started to heft his pack onto his back i feel a man should handle the money you could say youre an idiot whatever but im handling the money from here on fine she gave him a sweet smile he immediately mistrusted and im holding the envelope forget it he handed her back her pack now go change like a good girl fury leapt into her eyes nasty words scrambled on her tongue there was a time for temper whitney reminded herself and there was a time for cool heads another of her fathers basic rules of business i said im holding it and i said but he trailed off at the expression on her face a woman whod just been neatly ripped off shouldnt look smug doug glanced down at his pack she couldnt have then he looked back at her like hell she couldnt tossing down his pack he dug into it it only took a moment all right where is it standing in the full sunlight she lifted her hands palms up the brief teddy shifted over her like air it doesnt appear necessary to search me he narrowed his eyes it wasnt possible to keep them from sweeping down her hand it over whitney or youll be buck naked in five seconds and youll have a broken nose they faced each other each determined to come out on top and each with no choice but to accept a standoff the papers he said again giving masculine strength and dominance one last shot the money she returned relying on guts and feminine guile swearing doug reached in his back pocket and took out a wad of bills when she reached for them he jerked them back out of range the papers he repeated she studied him he had a very direct gaze she decided very clear very frank and he could lie with the best of them still in some areas shed trust him your word she demanded such as it is his word was worth only what he chose it to be worth with her he discovered that would be entirely too much youve got it nodding she reached behind her but the envelope had slipped down out of range therere a lot of reasons i dont like to turn my back on you but with a shrug she did so youll have to get it out yourself he ran his gaze down the smooth line of her back over the subtle curve of hip there wasnt much to her he thought but what there was was excellent taking his time he slipped his hand under the material and worked his way down just get the envelope douglas no detours she folded her arms under her breasts and stared straight ahead the brush of his fingers over her skin aroused every nerve she wasnt accustomed to being moved by so little it seems to have slipped down pretty low he murmured it might take me awhile to find it it occurred to him that he could indeed have her out of the teddy in five seconds flat what would she do then he could have her beneath him on the ground before shed taken the breath to curse him then hed have what hed sweated about the night before but then he thought as his fingers brushed the edge of the envelope she might have a hold over him he couldnt afford priorities he reminded himself as his fingers touched both the stiff manila and the soft skin it was always a matter of priorities it took all her concentration to hold perfectly still douglas youve got two seconds to get it out or lose the use of your right hand a little jumpy are you at least he had the satisfaction of knowing she was churning even as he was he hadnt missed the huskiness in her voice or the slight tremor with the tip between his finger and thumb he pulled out the envelope whitney turned quickly hand outstretched he had the map he had the money he was fully dressed she was all but naked he didnt doubt she could make her way down to the village and wangle herself transportation back to the capital if he was going to ditch her there would never be a better time her eyes stayed on his calm and direct doug didnt doubt shed read every thought in his head though he hesitated doug found in this case his word was indeed his word he slapped the wad of bills into her hand honor among thieves is a major cultural myth she finished thered been a moment just a moment when she hadnt been sure hed come through picking up her pack and the canteen she walked toward the pine it was cover of a sort though at the moment shed have preferred a steel wall with a heavy bolt you might consider shaving douglas she called out i hate my escort to look rangy he ran a hand over his chin and vowed not to shave for weeks whitney found it was easier going when the destination was in sight one memorable summer in her early teens shed stayed on her parents estate on long island her father had developed an acute obsession with the benefits of exercise every day that she hadnt been quick enough to escape shed been railroaded into jogging with him she remembered her determination to keep up with a man twentyfive years her senior and the trick shed developed of looking for the stately white dormers of the house once she saw them she could lope ahead knowing the end was in sight in this case the destination was only a huddle of buildings adjoining green green fields and a brown westwardflowing river after a day of hiking and a night in a cave it looked as tidy as new rochelle to whitney in the distance men and women worked in the rice paddies forests had been sacrificed for fields the malagasy a practical people worked diligently to justify the exchange they were islanders she remembered but without the breezy laziness island life often promoted as she looked at them whitney wondered how many had ever seen the sea cattle with bored eyes and swishing tails milled in paddocks she saw a battered jeep wheelless propped on a stone from somewhere came the monotonous ring of metal against metal women hung clothes on a line bright flowery shirts that contrasted with their plain workday clothes men in baggy pants hoed a long narrow garden a few sang as they worked a tune not so much cheerless as purposeful at their approach heads turned and work stopped no one came forward except a skinny black dog who ran in circles in front of them and sent up a clatter east or west whitney knew curiosity and suspicion when she saw it she thought it a pity she wore nothing more cheerful than a shirt and slacks she cast a look at doug with his unshaven face and untidy hair he looked more like hed just come from a party a long one as they drew closer she made out a smatter of children some of the smaller ones were carried on the backs and hips of men and women in the air was the smell of animal dung and of cooking she ran a hand over her stomach scrambling down a hill behind doug who had his nose in the guidebook do you have to do that now she demanded when he only grunted she rolled her eyes im surprised you didnt bring one of those little clipon lights so you could read in bed well pick one up the merina are of asiatic stock theyre the upper crust of the island youd relate to that of course ignoring the humor in her voice he read on they have a caste system that separates the nobles from the middle class very sensible when he shot her a look over the top of the book whitney only smiled sensibly he returned the caste system was abolished by law but they dont pay much attention its a matter of legislating morality it never seems to work refusing to be drawn doug glanced up squinting the people were drawing together but it didnt look like a welcoming committee according to everything hed read the twenty or so tribes or groups of the malagasy had packed up their spears and bows years ago still he looked back at dozens of dark eyes he and whitney would just have to take it one step at a time how do you think theyll respond to uninvited guests more nervous than she wanted to admit whitney tucked her arm into his hed slid his way without invitation into more places than he could count well be charming it usually worked think you can pull it off she asked and strode by him to the flatland at the base of the hill though whitney felt uneasy she continued to walk forward shoulders back the crowd grumbled then parted making a path for a tall leanfaced man in a stark black robe over a stiff white shirt he might have been the leader the priest the general but she knew with only a glance that he was important and he was displeased with the intrusion he was also sixfour if he was an inch abandoning pride whitney took a step back so that doug was in front of her charm him she challenged in a mutter doug scanned the tall black man with the crowd behind him he cleared his throat no problem he tried his best grin morning hows it going the tall man inclined his head regal aloof and disapproving in a deep rumbling voice he tossed out a spate of malagasy were a little short on the language mister ah still grinning doug stuck out his hand it was stared at then ignored with the grin still plastered on his face he took whitneys elbow and shoved her forward try french but your charm was working so well this isnt a good time to be a smartass sugar you said they were friendly maybe he hasnt read the guidebook whitney studied the rockhard face several long inches above hers maybe doug had a point she smiled swept up her lashes and tried a formal french greeting the man in black robes stared at her for ten pulsing seconds then returned it she nearly giggled in relief okay good now apologize doug ordered for what for butting in he said between his teeth as he squeezed her elbow tell him were on our way to tamatave but we lost our way and our supplies are low keep smiling its easy when youre grinning like my idiot brother he swore at her but softly with his lips still curved look helpless the way you would if you were trying to fix a flat on the side of the road she turned her head brow raised eyes cool i beg your pardon just do it whitney for chrissake ill tell him she said with a regal sniff but i wont look helpless when she turned back her expression changed to a pleasant smile were very sorry to have intruded on your village she began in french but were traveling to tamatave and my companion she gestured toward doug and shrugged hes lost his way were very low on food and water tamatave is a very long way to the east you go on foot unfortunately the man studied doug and whitney again coolly deliberately hospitality was part of the malagasy heritage their culture still it was extended discriminately he saw nerves in the eyes of the strangers but no ill will after a moment he bowed we are pleased to receive guests you may share our food and water i am louis rabemananjara how do you do she extended her hand and this time he accepted the gesture im whitney macallister and this is douglas lord louis turned to the waiting crowd and announced they would have guests in the village my daughter marie at his words a small coffeeskinned young woman with black eyes stepped forward whitney eyed her intricate braided hairstyle and wondered if her own stylist could match it she will see to you when you have rested you will share our food with this louis stepped back into the crowd after a quick survey of whitneys periwinkle shirt and slim pants marie lowered her eyes her father would never permit her to wear anything so revealing you are welcome if you will come with me i will show you where you can wash thank you marie they moved in maries wake through the crowd one of the children pointed at whitneys hair and spilled out with an excited babble before being shushed by his mother a word from louis sent them back to work before marie had reached a small onestory house the roof was thatched and pitched steeply to spread shade the house was built of wood and some of the boards were bowed and curled the windows sparkled outside the door was a square woven mat bleached nearly white when marie opened the door she stepped back to allow her guests to enter everything inside was neat as a pin every surface polished the furniture was rough and plain but bright cushions were plumped in every chair yellow daisylike flowers stood in a clay pot by a window where wooden slats held back the intense light and heat there is water and soap she led them farther inside where the temperature seemed to drop ten degrees from a small alcove marie produced deep wooden bowls pitchers of water and cakes of brown soap we will have our midday meal soon with you as our guests food will be plentiful she smiled for the first time we have been preparing for fadamihana before whitney could thank marie doug took her arm he hadnt followed the french but the one phrase had rung a bell tell her we too honor their ancestors what just tell her humoring him whitney did so and was rewarded with a beaming smile you are welcome to what we have she said before she left them alone what was that about she said something about fadamihana yes theyre preparing for it whatever it is feast of the dead she stopped examining a bowl to turn to him i beg your pardon its an old custom part of malagasy religion is ancestor worship when somebody dies theyre always brought back to their ancestral tombs every few years they disentomb the dead and hold a party for them disentomb them immediate revulsion took over thats disgusting its part of their religion a gesture of respect i hope no one respects me that way she began but her curiosity got the better of her she frowned as doug poured water into the bowl whats the purpose when the bodies are brought up theyre given a place of honor at the celebration they get fresh linen palm wine and all the latest gossip he dipped both hands in the bowl of water and splashed it over his face its their way of honoring the past i guess of showing respect for the people they descended from ancestor worships the root of malagasy religion theres music and dancing a good times had by all living or otherwise so the dead werent mourned whitney mused they were entertained a celebration of death or perhaps more accurately of the bond between life and death suddenly she felt she understood the ceremony and her feelings about it changed whitney accepted the soap doug offered and smiled at him its beautiful isnt it he lifted a small rough towel and scrubbed it over his face beautiful they dont forget you when you die youre brought back given a frontrow seat at a party filled in on all the town news and drunk to one of the worst things about dying is missing out on all the fun the worst thing about dying is dying he countered youre too literal i wonder if it makes it easier to face death knowing youve got something like that to look forward to hed never considered anything made it easier to face death it was just something that happened when you couldnt con life any longer he shook his head dropping the towel youre an interesting woman whitney of course laughing she lifted the soap and sniffed it smelled of crushed waxy flowers and im starving lets see whats on the menu when marie came back she had changed into a colorful skirt that skimmed her calves outside villagers were busily loading a long table with food and drink whitney whod been expecting a few handfuls of rice and a fresh canteen turned to marie again with thanks you are our guests solemn and formal marie lowered her eyes you have been guided to our village we offer the hospitality of our ancestors and celebrate your visit my father has said we will have today as holiday in your honor i only know were hungry whitney reached out to touch her hand and very grateful she stuffed herself though she didnt recognize anything but the fruit and rice she didnt quibble scents flowed on the air spicy exotic different the meat without aid of electricity had been cooked over open fires and in stone kilns it was gamey and rich and wonderful the wine cup after cup of it was potent music began drums and rough wind and string instruments that formed thready ancient tunes the fields it seemed could wait one day visitors were rare and once accepted prized a little giddy whitney swirled into a dance with a group of men and women they accepted her grinning and nodding as she mimicked their steps she watched some of the men leap and turn as the rhythm quickened whitney let her head fall back with her laugh she thought of the smoky crowded clubs she patronized electric music electric lights there each one tried to outshine the other she thought of some of the smooth selfabsorbed men whod partnered her or tried to not one of them would be able to hold up against a merina she whirled until her head spun and then turned to doug dance with me she demanded her skin was flushed her eyes bright against him she was warm and impossibly soft laughing he shook his head ill pass youre doing enough for both of us dont be a stickinthemud she poked a finger into his chest the merina know a party pooper when they see one she linked her hands behind him and swayed all you have to do is move your feet on their own power his hands slipped down to her hips to feel the movement just my feet tilting her head she aimed a deadly look from beneath her lashes if thats the best you can do she let out a quick whoop when he swung her in a circle just try to keep up with me sugar in a flash he had an arm hooked behind her and extending the other gripped her hand he held the dramatic tango pose for a moment then moved smoothly forward they broke turned and came back together damn douglas i think you might be a fun date after all as they continued stepping swaying then moving forward their dance caught the crowds approval they turned so their faces were close their bodies facing hand extended to hand as doug guided her backward her heart began to drum pleasantly both from the pleasure of being foolish and the constant brush of his body against hers his breath was warm his eyes so unusual and clear stayed on hers it wasnt often she thought of him as a strong man but now caught close she felt the ripple of muscle in his back along his shoulders whitney tilted her head back in challenge shed match him step for step he whirled her so quickly her vision blurred then she felt herself being flung back freely she let her body go so that her head nearly brushed the ground in the exaggerated dip just as quickly she was upright and caught against him his mouth was only a whisper from hers they had only to move only a slight shift of their heads would bring their lips together both were breathing quickly from the exertion from the excitement she could smell the muskiness of light sweat the hint of wine and rich meat hed taste of all of them they had only to move a fraction closer and what then what the hell doug muttered even as his hand tightened at her waist even as her lashes fluttered down he heard the roar of an engine his head swiveled around he tensed like a cat so quickly that whitney blinked shit grabbing her hand doug ran for cover because he had to make do he pushed her up against the side of a house and pressed himself against her what the hellre you doing one tango and you turn into a crazy man just dont move i dont then she heard it too loud and clear above them what is it helicopter he prayed the overhang of the steeply pitched roof and the shade it spread would keep them from view she managed to peer over his shoulder she could hear it but she couldnt see it it could be anyone could be i dont risk my life on could bes dimitri doesnt like to waste time and dammit he thought as he looked for shelter and escape how could he have found them in the middle of nowhere cautiously he glanced around there would be no running that mop of blonde hair would stand out like a road sign even under pressure youre full of charm douglas lets just hope he doesnt decide to land to get a closer look the words were hardly out of his mouth when the sound grew louder even on the far side of the house they felt the wind from the blades dust billowed up you had to give him the idea shut up a minute he glanced behind him poised to run where he asked himself in disgust where the hell to they were cornered as neatly as if theyd run down a blind alley at the whisper of a sound he whirled fists lifted marie stopped raising her hand for silence gesturing she hurried along the side of the house with her back pressed against the wall she moved along the west side to the door though it meant putting his luck into the hands of a woman again doug followed keeping whitneys hand in his once inside he signaled to them both to remain still and silent before he moved to the window keeping well to the side he peered out the helicopter was some distance away on the flatland at the base of the hills already remo was striding toward the crowd of celebrants sonofabitch doug muttered sooner or later it was going to come down to dealing with remo he had to make certain he had house advantage at the moment he had nothing more lethal than a penknife in the pocket of his jeans it was then he remembered that both he and whitney had left their packs outside near the spread of food and drink is it stay back he ordered when whitney crept up behind him its remo and two more of dimitris toy soldiers and sooner or later he admitted as he wiped a hand over his mouth it was going to come down to dealing with dimitri hed need more than luck when the time came racking his brain he looked around the room for something anything to defend himself with tell her these men are looking for us and ask her what her people are going to do whitney looked over at marie who stood quietly by the door briefly she followed dougs instructions marie folded her hands you are our guests she said simply they are not whitney smiled and told doug weve got sanctuary for what its worth yeah thats good but remember what happened to quasimodo he watched as remo faced down louis the village leader stood steelyeyed and implacable speaking briefly in malagasy the sound if not the words came through the open window remo pulled something out of his pocket photographs whitney whispered he must be showing him pictures of us him doug agreed silently and every other villager between here and tamatave if they got out of this one thered be no more parties along the way hed been stupid to believe he could take time to breathe with dimitri after him he realized along with the pictures remo produced a wad of bills and a smile both were met with awesome silence while remo tried his bargaining powers on louis another of the helicopter crew wandered to the spread of food and began sampling helpless doug watched him come closer and closer to the packs ask her if she has a gun in here a gun whitney swallowed she hadnt heard him use that tone of voice before but louis wont ask her now remos companion poured himself a cup of palm wine he had only to look down to the left it wouldnt make any difference whose side the villagers ranged themselves on if he saw the packs they were unarmed doug knew what would be tucked into a leather holster under remos coat hed felt it prod into his ribs not too many days before dammit whitney ask her at whitneys question marie nodded expressionlessly after slipping into the adjoining room she came back carrying a long deadly looking rifle when doug took it whitney grabbed his arm doug theyll have guns too therere babies out there grimly he loaded the gun hed just have to be fast and accurate damn fast im not going to do anything until i have to he crouched down rested the barrel on the windowsill and focused the site his finger was damp before he placed it on the trigger he hated guns always had it didnt matter which side of the barrel he was on he had killed in nam hed killed because a quick mind and clever hands hadnt kept him out of the draft or the stinking jungles he had learned things there he hadnt wanted to learn and things hed had to use survival that was always number one he had killed there had been one miserable night in chicago when his back had been against the wall and a knife whizzed at his throat he knew what it was to look at someone as the life eased out of them you had to know the next time anytime it could be you he hated guns he held the rifle steady one of whitneys dance partners let out a highpitched laugh holding a pitcher of wine over his head he grabbed the man beside the packs as the merina whirled leaping with the wine the packs slid away into the crowd and disappeared stop acting like an idiot remo shouted as his partner lifted his cup for more wine turning back to louis again he gestured with the photos he got nothing but a hard stare and a rumble of malagasy doug watched remo stuff the photos and money back in his pocket and stride off toward the waiting copter with a roar and a whirl it started up when it was ten feet off the ground he felt his shoulder muscles loosen he didnt like the feel of a gun in his hand as the sound of the copter died away he unloaded it you mightve hurt somebody with that whitney murmured when hed handed it back to marie yeah when he turned she saw a ruthlessness she hadnt gauged before there was an edge there that had nothing to do with fear and everything to do with cunning a thief yes that she understood and accepted but she saw now that in his own way he was just as tough just as hard as the men who searched for them she wasnt certain she could accept that as easily the look vanished from his eyes when marie came back into the room taking her hand doug lifted it to his lips as gallantly as royalty tell her we owe her our lives and we wont forget it though whitney said the words marie continued to stare up at doug woman to woman whitney recognized the look a glance at doug showed he recognized it too and loved every minute of it maybe you two would like to be alone she said dryly crossing the room she pulled open the door after all threes a crowd she let it slam with more force than necessary nothing a puff of fragrant smoke rose up in front of a highbacked brocade chair remo shifted his feet dimitri didnt care for negative reports krentz weis and me covered the whole area stopped at every village weve got five men here in town watching for them theres not a sign not a sign dimitris voice was mild with richness beneath diction among other things had been taught relentlessly by his mother the threefingered hand tapped the cigarette into an alabaster tray when one has eyes to look theres always a sign my dear remo well find them mr dimitri its just going to take a little more time it worries me from the table to the right he plucked up a faceted glass half filled with deep ruby wine on his unmarred hand he wore a ring thick glossy gold around a hard diamond theyve eluded you three he paused as he sipped letting the wine lie on his tongue he had a taste for the sweet no dear me four times now its becoming a very disturbing habit of yours to fail while his voice flowed softly he flicked on his lighter so that the flame rose straight and thin behind it his gaze locked on remos you know how i feel about failures remo swallowed he knew better than to make excuses dimitri dealt harshly with excuses he felt the sweat begin on the nape of his neck and roll slowly down remo remo the name came out in a sigh youve been like a son to me the lighter clicked off smoke plumed again thin and rich he never spoke quickly a conversation stretched to the last word was more frightening than a threat im a patient man and generous he waited for remos comment pleased when there was only silence but i expect results do succeed next time remo an employer like a parent must exercise discipline a smile moved his lips but not his eyes they were flat and passionless discipline he repeated ill get lord mr dimitri youll have him on a platter an enjoyable thought im sure get the papers his voice changed iced and the woman i find myself more and more intrigued with the woman in reflex remo touched the thin scar on his cheek ill get the woman chapter seven they waited until an hour before dusk with great ceremony food water and wine were wrapped and presented to them for the journey ahead the merina seemed to feel themselves highly entertained by the visit in a gesture of generosity that made doug wince whitney pressed bills into louiss hands his relief when they were refused was shortlived for the village she insisted then on a stroke of inspiration added that the money was to express their respect and good wishes for the ancestors the bills disappeared into the folds of louiss shirt how much did you give him doug demanded as he picked up his newly replenished pack only a hundred at his expression she patted his cheek dont be a piker douglas its unbecoming humming she took out her notebook oh no you shelled it out not me whitney noted the amount in her book with a flourish dougs tab was definitely adding up you play you pay anyway i have a surprise for you what a tenpercent discount dont be crass she looked over at the sputtering sound of an engine transportation her arm waved out in a wide gesture the jeep had definitely seen better days though it shone from a fresh washing the engine spit and missed as a merina with a bright rolled headband drove it up the rutted road as a getaway car he figured it came in a poor second to a blind mule it wont go twenty miles itll be twenty miles we dont use our feet say thank you douglas and stop being rude pierres going to drive us to the tamatave province it only took one look at pierre to see that hed freely imbibed palm wine theyd be lucky if they didnt end up sunk in a rice paddy terrific pessimistic and dealing with a headache from his own free use of wine doug said a formal goodbye to louis whitneys was much lengthier and more elaborate doug climbed into the back of the jeep and stretched out his legs get your ass in gear sweetheart itll be dark in an hour smiling at the merina who crowded around the jeep she stepped in up yours lord settling the pack on the floor at her feet she leaned back and swung one arm jauntily over the back of the seat avant pierre the jeep lurched forward bucked then rattled down the road doug felt his headache explode in tiny unmerciful blasts he closed his eyes and willed himself to sleep whitney took the teethrattling ride in stride shed been wined dined and entertained the same could be said about dinner at the club and a broadway show and this had been unique perhaps this wasnt a hansomcab ride through the park but anyone with twenty dollars could have one of those she was bouncing along a road in madagascar in a jeep driven by a merina native with a thief snoring lightly in the back it was entirely more interesting than a sedate ride through central park for the most part the scenery was monotonous red hills almost treeless wide valleys patched with fields it had cooled now that the sun was hanging low but the days baking left the road dusty it plumed under the wheels and coated the justwashed jeep there were mountains that rose up sharply but again pines were sparse it was rock and earth though there was a sameness it was the basic space that caught whitneys imagination miles of it she mused miles and miles with nothing to block the sky nothing to impede the vision she felt it would be possible to find here a sense of self that a city dweller would never understand from time to time in new york she missed the sky when the feeling came upon her she would simply hop a plane and go wherever the spirit moved her staying until her mood swung again her friends accepted it because they couldnt do anything about it her family accepted it because they were still waiting for her to settle down perhaps it was the aloneness perhaps it was a full stomach and a clear head but she felt a strange contentment it would pass whitney knew herself too well to think otherwise she hadnt been fashioned for long periods of contentment but rather for darting around the next corner to see what was waiting for now though she leaned back in the jeep and enjoyed the serenity shadows shifted lengthened thickened something small and fast dashed across the road just in front of the jeep it was over the rocks and gone before whitney could fully focus on it the air began to take on that pearly hush that lasts only moments the sun set spectacularly she had to turn and kneel on her seat to watch the western sky explode with color part of her profession dealt with incorporating tints and hues into fabrics and paints as she watched she thought about doing a room in the colors of sunset crimsons golds deep jewel blues and softening mauves an interesting and intense combination her gaze lowered and rested on doug as he slept it would suit him she decided the flash of brilliance the spark of power the underlying intensity he wasnt a man to take lightly nor was he a man to trust still she was beginning to think he was a man who could fascinate like a sunset he could shift and change before your eyes then vanish while you were still looking the moment hed taken that rifle in his hands shed seen he had a ruthlessness he could pull out and slip on at a moments notice if and when he found it necessary hed be just as ruthless with her she needed more leverage catching her tongue between her teeth whitney looked from him to the floor the pack and the envelope sat at his feet while she kept her eyes on his face for any signs of wakefulness she leaned over the pack was well out of reach the jeep jostled as she rose up enough to bend over the seat from the waist doug continued to snore lightly her fingers gripped the strap of the pack gingerly she began to lift it up there was a bang loud enough to make her gasp before she had time to fumble for a good hold the jeep veered sending her tumbling into the back doug woke up with the air knocked out of him and whitney sprawled over his chest she smelled of wine and fruit yawning he ran a hand down her hip just cant keep your hands off me blowing the hair out of her eyes she scowled at him i was watching the sunset out the back uhhuh his hand closed over hers still on the strap of his pack sticky fingers whitney he clucked his tongue im disappointed i dont know what youre talking about with a huff she struggled up and called to pierre though the spate of french went over his head doug needed no translation when the native kicked the front right tire a flat figures doug started to climb out then glanced over his shoulder located his pack and took it with him whitney reached for her own before she followed him whatre you going to do doug asked she glanced at the spare pierre rolled out just stand here and look helpless of course unless youd like me to phone triple a swearing doug crouched down and began to loosen lug nuts the spares bald as a babys ass tell our chauffeur that well walk from here hell be lucky if this gets him back to the village fifteen minutes later they stood in the middle of the road and watched the jeep bounce over ruts cheerful whitney linked her arm with dougs insects and small birds had begun to sing as the first stars came out a little evening stroll darling as much as i hate to turn you down we find cover and camp in another hour itll be too dark to see over there he decided pointing to a jumble of rocks well pitch the tent behind them we cant do anything about them spotting us from the air but well be out of sight from the road so you think theyll be back theyll be back all we have to do is not be there because she had begun to wonder if there were trees in any quantity in madagascar whitney was pleased when they came to the forest it helped ease the annoyance of being awakened at dawn the only courtesy hed given her had been a cup of coffee shoved in her face the hills going east were steep peaking up and dropping down so that walking had become a chore she was ready to swear off for good doug looked at the forest as welcome cover whitney looked at it as a welcome change though the air was mild after an hour of climbing she was sticky and out of sorts there were better ways to hunt for treasure she was certain an airconditioned car would be the first choice the forest might not have been airconditioned but it was cool whitney stepped in among fanning fern trees very pretty she decided looking up and up travelers trees he broke off a leaf stalk and poured clear water into his palm from the sheath handy read the guidebook whitney poked her finger into the puddle in his hand then laid it on her tongue but its so good for your ego to spout off knowledge at a rustle she glanced over and saw a furry white shape and long tail disappear into the brush why its a dog uhuh doug grabbed her arm before she could race after it a sifaka youve just seen your first lemur look as she followed his pointing finger whitney caught a glimpse of the snowwhitebodied blackheaded lemur as it dashed through the top of the trees she laughed and strained for another look theyre so cute i was beginning to think wed see nothing but hills and grass and rock he liked the way she laughed maybe just a bit too much women he thought it had been too damn long since hed had one this aint no guided tour he said briefly once we have the treasure you can book one right now weve got to move whats the hurry shifting her pack whitney trooped along beside him it seems to me the longer we take the less chance dimitri has to find us i get itchy not knowing where he is in front of us or behind it made him think of nam again where the jungle hid too much he preferred the dark streets and mean alleys of the city whitney glanced over her shoulder and grimaced the forest had already closed in behind them she wanted to take comfort in the deep greens the moistness and the cool air but doug was making her see gnomes well theres no one in the forest but us so far weve been one step ahead of them every time so far lets keep it that way why dont we pass the time with conversation you could tell me about the papers hed already decided she wouldnt let it go and that hed give her enough information to stop her from nagging him know much about the french revolution she shifted the hateful pack as she walked it would be best whitney calculated not to mention the quick look shed had at the one page already the less doug thought she knew the more he might tell her enough to get me though a french history class in college how about rocks i passed on geology not limestone and quartz real rocks sugar diamonds emeralds rubies as big as your fist put them together with the reign of terror and fleeing aristocrats and you have a lot of potential necklaces earrings unset stones a hell of a lot was stolen and more hidden or smuggled out right when you think about it theres more still missing than anyone will ever find were going to find a little part its all i need the treasures two hundred years old she said quietly and thought again of the paper shed skimmed part of french history royal antiques doug murmured already seeing them gleam in his hands royal the word had her glancing up he was looking off into middle distance dreaming the treasure belonged to the king of france it was close enough doug decided closer than hed intended her to get this soon it belonged to the man who was smart enough to get his hands on it its going to belong to me us he corrected anticipating her rut she fell silent who was the woman who gave whitaker the map she asked at length the english lady ah smythewright yeah lady smythewright as the name hit home whitney stared into the forest olivia smythewright was one of the few members of the gentry who fully deserved the title shed devoted herself to the arts and charity with a nearreligious fervor part of the reason or so shed often said was that she was a descendant of marie antoinettes queen beauty victim a woman some historians deemed a selfish fool and others called a victim of circumstance whitney had been to some of lady smythewrights functions and had admired her marie antoinette and lost french jewels a page of a journal dating from it made sense if olivia had believed the papers were history whitney remembered reading of her death in the times it had been a ghastly murder bloody and without apparent motive the authorities were still investigating butrain whitney thought hed never be brought to justice now or have a trial by his peers he was dead and so was whitaker lady smythewright and a young waiter named juan the motive for all sat in dougs pocket how many more had lost their lives for a queens treasure no she couldnt think of it that way not now if she did shed turn around and give up her father had taught her many things but the first the most important was to finish no matter what perhaps it had the edges of pride but it was her breeding shed always been proud of it shed go on shed help doug find the treasure then shed decide what to do about it he found himself looking around at every rustle according to his guidebook the forests abounded with life nothing very dangerous he recalled this wasnt the land of safaris in any case it was twolegged carnivores he worried about by this time dimitri would be very annoyed doug had heard some graphic stories about what happened when dimitri was annoyed he didnt want any firsthand knowledge the forest smelled of pine and morning the large leafy trees cut the glare of the sun he and whitney had lived with for days instead it came in shafts white shimmering and lovely there were flowers underfoot that smelled like expensive women flowers in trees overhead that spread out and promised fruit passionflower he thought spotting a flaring violet blossom he remembered the one hed handed whitney in antananarivo they hadnt stopped running since doug let his muscles relax the hell with dimitri he was miles away and running in circles even he couldnt track them through uninhabited forest the itch at the back of his neck was just sweat the envelope was safe tucked in the pack hed slept with it digging into his back the night before just in case the treasure the end of the rainbow was closer than ever nice place he decided glancing up to see some foxfaced lemurs scrambling in the treetops so glad you approve whitney returned maybe we can stop and have the breakfast you were in too much of a hurry for this morning yeah soon lets work up an appetite whitney pressed a hand to her stomach youve got to be kidding then she saw a swarm of large butterflies twenty perhaps thirty flow by it was like a wave swelling then dipping then swirling they were the most beautiful most brilliant blue shed ever seen as they passed she felt the light breeze their wings had ruffled on the air the sheer strength of color almost hurt her eyes god id kill for a dress that color well shop later she watched them move scatter and regroup the sight of something lovely helped her forget the hours of walking id settle for some of that mystery meat and a banana though he knew he should have been immune to her quick smile and her sweep of lashes by this time doug felt himself softening well have a picnic wonderful in another mile taking her hand in his he continued through the forest it smelled soft he thought like a woman and like a woman it had shadows and cool corners it paid to stay on your feet and keep your eyes open no one traveled here from the looks of the undergrowth no one had traveled here in some time he had the compass to guide him and that was all i dont understand why you have this obsession about covering miles because every one takes me that much closer to the pot of gold sugar were both going to have penthouses when we get home douglas shaking her head she reached down and scooped up a flower it was pale watery pink delicate as a young girl its stem was thick and tough whitney smiled and tucked it into her hair things shouldnt be that important not nearly so much when youve got them all shrugging she plucked another flower to twirl under her nose you worry too much about money what he stopped and gaped at her i worry i worry just who keeps marking down every solitary penny in her little book just who sleeps with her wallet under her pillow thats business whitney said easily she touched the flower in her hair pretty petals and a tough stem business is entirely different bullshit ive never seen anyone so bent on counting their change tallying every cent if i were bleeding youd charge me a goddamn dime for a bandaid no more than a nickel she corrected and theres absolutely no need to shout i have to shout to be heard over all that racket they both stopped brows drawing together the sound theyd just begun to notice was like an engine no doug decided even as he tensed to run it was too steady and deep for an engine thunder no he took her hand again come on lets go see what the hell that is it grew louder as they walked east louder it lost all resemblance to the sound of a motor water against rock whitney murmured when they stepped into the clearing she saw shed nearly been right water against water the falls plunged down twenty feet into a clear gurgling lagoon the white agitated water was struck by the sun on its journey down then turned to a deep crystal blue the falls made a sound of rushing of power and speed and yet it was a picture of serenity yes the forest was like a woman doug thought again intensely beautiful powerful and full of surprises without realizing it whitney rested her head against dougs shoulder its lovely she murmured absolutely lovely just as though it were waiting for us he gave in and slipped an arm around her nice spot for a picnic arent you glad we waited she had to match his grin a picnic she agreed with her eyes dancing and a bath bath a wonderful cool wet bath catching him by surprise she gave him a quick smacking kiss then dashed to the side of the lagoon im not passing this up douglas she dropped her pack and began to dig inside just the thought of getting my body into water and washing off the dirt of the past couple of days makes me crazy she brought out a cake of french milled soap and a small bottle of shampoo doug took the soap and held it under his nose it smelled like her feminine fresh expensive gonna share all right and in this case because im feeling generous no charge his grin tilted as he tossed the soap back to her cant take a bath with your clothes on she met the challenge in his eyes and undid her top button ive no intention of keeping them on slowly she undid the range of buttons waiting while his gaze followed the trail a light breeze ruffled the edges and tickled the line of bare skin all you have to do she said softly is turn around when he lifted his gaze to hers and smiled she gestured with the cake in her hand or no soap talk about spoilsports he mumbled but turned his back in seconds whitney stripped and dove cleanly into the pool breaking the surface she treaded water your turn with the simple pleasure of having water against her skin she dipped her head back and let it flow through her hair dont forget the shampoo the water was clear enough to give him a tempting silhouette of her body from the shoulders down water lapped over her breasts her feet kicked gently feeling the stir the dull dangerous stir of desire he concentrated on her face it didnt help it glowed with laughter washed clean of the light sophisticated makeup she put on every morning her hair was sleek turned dark with water and sun as it framed the elegant bones that would keep her a beauty even when she was eighty doug picked up the little plastic bottle of shampoo and tossed it in his hand under the circumstances he thought it wise to look at the humor in the situation he had a ticket to a milliondollar prize literally at his fingertips a determined and very clever enemy breathing down his throat and he was about to skinnydip with an icecream princess after pulling his shirt over his head he reached for the snap of his jeans youre not going to turn around are you dammit she liked it when he grinned that way the cheerful cockiness was just plain appealing lavishly she began to soap one arm she hadnt realized how much shed missed that cool slick feeling want to brag do you douglas im not easily impressed he sat down to remove his shoes leave me my share of the soap move a little faster then she began to soap her other arm in the same long smooth stroke god this is better than elizabeth ardens with a sigh she lay back and lifted one leg out of the water when he stood and dropped his jeans she gave him a thorough critical study her expression was bland but she didnt miss the lean muscled thighs the taut stomach the narrow hips just covered with low snug briefs he had the clean sleek build of a runner and that she supposed was what he was adequate she said after a moment since you apparently like to pose its a pity i didnt bring my polaroid unstung he pulled off the briefs for a moment he was poised naked and she was forced to admit magnificent at the edge of the lagoon his dive was sharp before he surfaced a foot away from her what hed seen underwater made his mouth go dry with desire soap he said as cool as she and offered the shampoo in trade dont forget behind the ears using a generous hand she poured shampoo into her palm hey halfs mine remember youll get it anyway ive more hair than you she worked it into a lather while she scissored her feet to keep above water he gestured with the soap before rubbing it over his chest and ive more body with a smile she sank below the surface leaving a frothy trail of suds where her hair fanned out the beat of water sucked them down and away unable to resist she swam down deeper she could hear the vibrations of the falls drumming drumming see rocks sparkling a foot beneath her taste the clear sweet water that was kissed by the sun glancing up she saw the strong lean body of the man who was now her partner the idea of danger or men with guns of being pursued seemed ludicrous this was paradise whitney didnt believe in cunning snakes behind luscious flowers when she surfaced she was laughing this is fabulous we should book in for the weekend he saw the sun shoot sparks into her hair next time ill even spring for the soap yeah he looked attractive dangerously so she discovered she preferred a touch of danger in a man the word boredom the only word she considered a true obscenity wouldnt apply to him unexpected that was the word she found it had a sensuous ring testing him and perhaps herself she treaded slowly until their bodies were too close for safety trade she murmured keeping her eyes on his as she held out the bottle his fingers tightened on the slick soap so that it nearly slid out of them just what the hell was she up to he asked himself hed been around enough to recognize that look in a womans eyes it said maybe why dont you persuade me the trouble was she wasnt anything like the women hed known he wasnt entirely sure of his moves instead he equated her to a job a highclass luxury apartment complex that took careful casing meticulous planning and intricate legwork before he took it down better that he be the thief with her he knew the rules because hed made them sure he opened his palm so that she had to slide the wet cake of soap from it in response she tossed the bottle high laughing as she retreated doug plucked it inches above the water i hope you dont mind a touch of jasmine lazily she lifted her other leg and began to run the soap up and down her calf i can handle it he poured the shampoo directly on his hair rescrewed the cap then tossed it on the ground beside the lagoon ever been to a public bath no curious she glanced back over have you i was in tokyo a couple years back its an interesting experience i usually like to keep the quantity in my tub down to two she ran the soap up a thigh cozy but not crowded ill bet he ducked under to rinse off and to cool off she had legs that went all the way up to her waist convenient too she said when hed surfaced especially when you need your back scrubbed with a smile she held out the soap again would you mind so she wanted to play games he decided well he rarely turned one down as long as hed figured the odds taking the soap from her he began to run it over her shoulder blades marvelous she said after a moment it wasnt easy to keep her voice even when her stomach had begun to tighten but she managed but then i suppose a man in your line of work has to have clever hands it helps i suppose all that ice cream could buy milliondollar skin it helps his hand ran lower down her spine then slowly up again unprepared for the jolt it brought her whitney shuddered doug grinned cold just who had she managed to push anyway she wondered the water gets chilly unless you move around telling herself it wasnt a retreat she gently sidestroked away not that easy sugar doug thought he tossed the soap onto the grass beside the shampoo in a quick move he grabbed her ankle problem effortlessly he pulled her back toward him as long as were playing games i dont know what youre talking about she began but the sentence ended on a quick gasp as her body collided with his the hell you dont he found he enjoyed it the uncertainty the annoyance and the flare of awareness that came and went in her eyes her body was long and slim deliberately he tangled her legs with his so that she was forced to grab his shoulders to stay afloat watch your step lord she warned water games whitney ive always been a sucker for them ill let you know when i want to play his hands slid up to just under her breasts didnt you shed asked for it knowing it didnt improve her temper one whit yes shed wanted to play with him but on her terms in her own time she discovered she was over her head in more ways than one and she didnt care for it her voice became very cool her eyes were equally chilly you dont really consider were in the same league do you long ago shed discovered insults given coldly were the most successful of defenses no but then ive never paid much attention to caste systems you want to play duchess go ahead he slid his thumbs up over her nipples and heard her breath shudder in then out as i recall royalty always had a penchant for taking commoners to bed ive no intention of taking you to mine you want me youre flattering yourself youre lying temper flared the warm liquid pull in her stomach battled with it the waters getting cold douglas i want to get out you want me to kiss you id sooner kiss a toad he grinned shed practically hissed at him i wont give you warts making up his mind on the instant he covered her mouth with his she stiffened no one ever kissed her without her consent and without jumping through the hoops she tossed out first who the hell did he think he was and her heart pounded against his her pulses raced her head swam she didnt give a damn who he was with a spurt of passion that rocked them both she moved her mouth on his tongues met his teeth scraped her lower lip while he slid his arms around her back to mold them closer together surprises he thought as he began to lose himself in her the lady was full of them he tasted cool fresh different so excitingly different passion took them beneath the surface wrapped together they came up again mouths fused water cascading off skin thered never been anything like him in her life he didnt ask but took his hands moved over her body with an intimacy shed always doled out stingily she chose a lover sometimes impulsively sometimes calculatingly but she chose this time shed been given no choice the moment of helplessness was as exhilarating as anything shed ever experienced hed bring her madness in bed if he could take her so far with a kiss hed take her up over beyond whether she wanted to go or not and oh now with the water lapping over her with his hands stroking and his mouth growing hotter hungrier she wanted to go and then she thought hed give her a salute a cocky grin and slip off into the night once a thief always a thief whether it was gold or a womans soul perhaps she hadnt chosen this beginning but shed hold on long enough to choose her own end she pushed regrets aside pain was something to be avoided at all costs even if the cost was pleasure whitney let her body go limp as in total surrender then quickly she lifted her hands to his shoulders and pushed hard doug went under without a chance to gulp in air before hed surfaced whitney was at the side of the lagoon and climbing out games over my point she grabbed up her blouse and pulled it on without bothering to dry fury hed thought he knew precisely what it felt like women he had thought hed known what buttons to push doug discovered he was just learning swimming to the side he hauled himself out whitney was already pulling on her slacks a nice diversion she said letting out a quiet relieved breath when she was fully clothed now i think wed better have that picnic im starving lady keeping his eyes on her doug picked up his jeans what ive got in mind for you is no picnic really on solid ground again she reached in her pack and found her brush she began to pull it slowly through her hair water rained out in gemlike drops you look like you could use a bit of raw meat at the moment is that the look you use to scare little old ladies out of their purses im a thief not a mugger he snapped his jeans and tossing wet hair out of his eyes approached her but i might make an exception in your case dont do anything youd regret she said softly he gritted his teeth im going to love every minute of it when he gripped her shoulders she stared up at him solemnly you simply arent the violent sort she told him however her fist connected with his stomach hard and fast gasping he bent double i am whitney dropped her brush back in the pack and hoped he was too dazed to see her hand shake that does it holding his sore stomach he sent her a look that mightve made dimitri step back and reconsider douglas she held up a hand as she might to a lean vicious dog take a few deep breaths count to ten what else was there she wondered frantically jog in place she hazarded dont lose control im in complete control he said between his teeth as he stalked her let me show you some other time lets have some wine we can she broke off as his hand closed over her throat doug it came out in a squeak now he began then looked up at the whirl of engines sonofabitch he wouldnt mistake the sound of the helicopter a second time it was almost overhead and they were in the open wide fucking open he thought on a surge of fury releasing her he began to grab up gear move ass he shouted picnics over if you tell me to move ass one more time just move it he shoved the first pack at her even as he hauled up the other now get those pretty long legs moving sugar we aint got much time he locked his hand over hers and headed for the trees in a dead run whitneys hair flowed out behind them above in the small cabin of the copter remo lowered his binoculars for the first time in days a grin moved under his moustache lazily he stroked the scar that marred his cheek weve spotted them radio mr dimitri chapter eight do you think they saw us at top speed doug headed dead east and kept to the thickest part of the forest roots and vines snatched at their feet but he never lost his footing he ran instinctively through a foreign forest crowded with bamboo and eucalyptus just as he had through manhattan leaves swung out and lashed back as they pushed through whitney mightve complained when they swatted into her face but she was too busy saving her breath yeah i think they saw us he didnt waste time on fury on frustration on panic though he felt all every time he thought theyd gained some time he found dimitri on his heels like some wellgroomed english hound whod tasted blood he needed to rework his strategy and hed have to do it on his feet through experience hed come to believe it was the best way if you had too much time to think you thought too much about consequences theres no place for them to put that copter down in this forest it made sense so we stay in the forest no he was loping along like a marathon runner smoothly breath even whitney could detest him for it even as she admired it overhead lemurs chattered in wild fear and excitement dimitrill have men combing this area within the hour that made sense as well so we get out of the forest no exhausted from the run whitney stopped leaned her back against a tree and just slid down to the mossy ground beneath shed once arrogantly considered herself in shape the muscles in her legs screamed in revolt whatre we going to do she demanded disappear doug frowned not at her nor at the steady whirling sound of blades and engine overhead he looked off into the forest while the plan formed in his mind it was risky in fact it was undoubtedly foolhardy he glanced up to where a canopy of leaves was all that separated them from remo and a then again it might work disappear he murmured thats what were going to do crouching down he opened a pack looking for your fairy dust im looking to save that alabaster skin of yours sugar he pulled out the lamba whitney had bought in antananarivo while she sat he draped it over her head going more for coverage than style goodbye whitney macallister hello malagasy matron whitney blew pale blonde hair out of her eyes one elegant fineboned hand folded over the other youve got to be kidding got a better idea she sat for a moment the forest was no longer quiet with the intrusion of helicopter blades overhead its shade and spreading trees and mossy scent no longer equalled protection in silence she crossed the lamba under her chin and tossed the ends back a lousy idea was better than none at all usually okay lets move taking her hand he hauled her to her feet weve got work to do ten minutes later he found what hed been looking for near the bottom of a rocky uneven slope was a clearing with a handful of bamboo huts the grass and vegetation on the incline had been slashed and burned then planted with hill rice below gardens had been cleared and hoed so that the leafy vines of beans wound up around poles she could see an empty paddock and a small leanto where chickens scratched for whatever they could find the hill was steep so that the small buildings rose on stilts to compensate for the irregular terrain roofs were thatched but even with the distance looked in need of repair a line of crude steps dug directly into the hill ran down to a narrow rutted path below them the path went east doug kept low behind the cover of small scrubby bushes and watched for any sign of life balancing herself with a hand on his shoulder whitney looked over his head the cluster of houses looked cozy remembering the merina she felt a certain safety are we going to hide down there hidings not going to do us much good for very long taking out his field glasses he lay down on his belly and took a closer look at the huddle of houses there was no cook smoke no movement at any of the windows nothing making up his mind quickly he handed the glasses to whitney can you whistle can i what whistle he made a low steady sound through his teeth i can whistle better than that she said with a sniff terrific you watch through the glasses if you see anyone coming back toward the huts whistle if you think youre going down there without me look im leaving the packs here both of them he grabbed her hair so that he could pull her face close i figure you want to stay alive more than you want to get your hands on the envelope she nodded coolly staying alives become quite a priority lately it had always been his so stay put whyre you going down there if were going to pass ourselves off as a couple of malagasy we need to acquire a few more things acquire she lifted a brow youre going to steal them thats right sugar and youre the lookout after a moments thought whitney decided she rather liked the idea of being a lookout perhaps in another time and place it mightve had a crude ring but shed always believed in enjoying each experience within its own frame if i see anyone coming back i whistle you got it now stay down out of sight remo could come buzzing by in the copter getting into the spirit whitney shifted onto her stomach and scanned with the glasses just do your job lord ill do mine with a quick glance toward the heavens doug began to scramble his way down the steep slope behind the huts the steps such as they were would leave him in the open for too long he avoided them loose pebbles bounced against his calves and once the eroded slope gave out under him and sent him sliding five feet before he could gain another foothold already he was working out an alternate plan in case he ran into someone he couldnt speak the language and his french interpreter was now his lookout god help him but he had a few very few he thought grimly dollars in his pocket if worse came to worst he might buy most of what they needed pausing a moment straining to hear any sound he dashed into the open toward the first hut hed have liked it better if the lock had had more character doug had always found a certain satisfaction in outwitting a clever lock or a clever woman he glanced up and around toward where whitney waited he hadnt finished with her yet but in the case of the lock he had to make do with what there was in seconds he was inside comfortable on the soft ground of the forest whitney watched him through the glasses he moved very well she decided because shed been running with him almost since the moment theyd met she hadnt been able to appreciate the smoothness with which he moved impressive she decided and touched her tongue to her top lip she remembered the way hed held her in the water of the lagoon and much more dangerous she reminded herself than shed initially believed when he disappeared into the hut she began a slow sweep with the field glasses twice she caught a movement but it was only that of animals in the trees something resembling a hedgehog waddled out into the sunlight lifted its head to scent then slipped back into the bush she heard flies buzzing and the whine of insects thats what reminded her the sound of the copter had ceased she kept her mind set on doug willing him to hurry though the settlement below seemed sparse and dingy this was a much lusher madagascar than the one shed passed through over the last two days it was green and wet thriving with life she knew there were birds or animals overhead as she listened to the leaves rustle once through the field glasses she thought she spotted a fat partridge fly low over the clearing she could smell grass and the light fragrance of flowers that grew in the shade her elbows pushed through the springy moss to where the ground was dark and rich a few yards away the hill sloped steeply and erosion had washed soil down to rock as she lay still a fresh hush fell over the forest a humming silence that was touched with the mystery shed first anticipated when doug had mentioned the countrys name had it really only been a matter of days she mused since theyd been in her apartment him pacing impatient trying to wheedle a stake out of her already everything that had come before that night seemed like a dream she hadnt even unpacked from paris yet she could remember nothing exciting from her trip there she couldnt think of a dull moment since doug had jumped into her car in manhattan definitely more interesting she decided she looked back at the huts but they were as quiet now as theyd been before doug had scrambled down the hill hed be very good she thought at his chosen profession his hands were quick his eye keen and he was light very light on his feet though she wasnt looking for a career change herself she thought it might be fun to have him teach her a few tricks of his trade she was a quick study and good with her hands that and a certain steelcoated charm had helped her achieve success in her business without the help of her influential family werent the same basic abilities required in dougs field perhaps just for the experience naturally she could try her hand at being a thief after all black was one of her best colors she had a trim little angora sweater that would do very nicely she thought and if she remembered right she owned a pair of black jeans yes she was certain of it snug black jeans with a row of silver studs down one leg really she could be outfitted in no time if she picked up a pair of black sneakers she could try the family estate on long island for starters the security system there was complex and intricate so intricate her father set it off regularly then bellowed at the servants to shut it down again if she and doug could manage to get through it there was the rubens the pair of tang horses the perfectly hideous solidgold salver her grandfather had given to her mother she could take a few choice pieces box them up and ship them back to her fathers new york offices it would drive him crazy amused at the thought whitney scanned again daydreaming she nearly missed the movement to the east with a jerk she brought the glasses back to the right and focused the three bears were coming back she thought and goldilocks was going to be caught with his fingers in the porridge she drew in her breath to whistle when a voice close behind her had her gulping instead we flush em out in here or we drive em out leaves rustled smartly behind her and just overhead either way lords lucks running out the man who spoke hadnt forgotten having a bottle of whiskey swung into his face as he spoke he touched the nose doug had broken in the bar in manhattan i want first shot at lord myself i want first shot at the woman another voice piped up high and whiny whitney felt as though something slimy had passed over her skin pervert the first man grumbled as he pushed his way through the forest you can play with her barns but remember dimitri wants her in one piece as for lord the boss doesnt care how many pieces hes in whitney lay still on the ground eyes wide mouth dry shed read somewhere that true fear mists over hearing and sight she could now verify it firsthand it occurred to her that the woman they spoke of so casually was herself all they had to do was look over the rise they were approaching and theyd see her spread out on the forest floor like goods in a marketplace frantic she looked back toward the huts a hell of a lot of good doug would do her she thought grimly he could come out into the open at any moment from their position on the rise dimitris men would simply pick him off like a bear in a shooting gallery if he stayed where he was much longer the malagasy who were trooping home might create a bit of a scene when they found him systematically looting their hut first things first whitney cautioned herself she needed better cover and she needed it quickly moving only her head she looked from side to side her best shot seemed to be a wide downed tree between her and a thicket of bushes without giving herself time to consider she gathered both packs and scrambled for it on all fours scraping her skin on the bark she rolled over the tree and hit the ground with a thud hear something holding her breath whitney flattened herself against the trunk now she couldnt even see down to the huts and doug but she could see an army of tiny rustcolored insects burrowing into the dead tree an inch from her face fighting revulsion she kept still doug was on his own now she told herself and so was she overhead came a rustling that might have been thunder by the way it echoed in her head fear gripped followed by a wave of giddiness how the hell was she going to explain to her father that shed been kidnapped by a couple of thugs in a forest in madagascar on her way to find lost treasure with a thief he didnt have much of a sense of humor because she knew her fathers wrath and didnt know dimitri the idea of the first worried her a great deal more than the second she nearly crawled into the tree the rustling came again there was no more casual conversation between the men stalking was done in silence she tried to imagine them walking toward her around her beyond her but her mind iced over with fear silence dragged on until sweat pearled on her forehead whitney screwed her eyes shut as though like a child she believed the idea of i cant see you you cant see me it seemed easy to hold her breath when her blood was slowed and thickened with terror there was a quiet thump on the trunk directly above her head resigned she opened her eyes staring at her with intense eyes out of a black face was a smoothcoated lemur jesus the word came out on a trembling breath but there wasnt time for relief she could hear the men approaching more cautiously now she wondered if being stalked in central park brought the same chilling fear get she hissed at the lemur go on she lay there making faces at him not daring to move obviously more amused than intimidated he began making faces back at her whitney shut her eyes on a sigh sweet christ the lemur sent up a chatter that brought both men rushing to the rise she heard a highpitched whoop and the retort of a gun then watched the wood splinter and fly no more than six inches above her face at the same moment the lemur leaped off the trunk and into the thicket idiot whitney heard the quick hard sound of a slap then incredibly a giggle it was the giggle more than the shot more than the stalking that had her body limp with terror almost got him another inch and idve plugged the little bastard yeah and that gunshot probably has lord running like a rabbit i like shooting rabbits little fuckers freeze and look right at you when you pull the trigger shit she recognized disgust when she heard it and nearly sympathized get going remo wants us moving north nearly got me a monkey the giggle sounded again never shot a monkey before pervert the word and the echoing laughter drifted away moments passed whitney lay still and silent as a stone the insects had decided to explore her arm as well as the tree but she didnt move she decided she might have found a very good place to spend the next few days when a hand closed over her mouth she jerked like a spring taking a nap doug whispered in her ear watching her eyes he saw surprise turn to relief and relief to fury as a precaution he held her down a moment longer take it easy sugar they arent that far away yet the moment her mouth was free she started i nearly got shot she hissed at him by some whiny little creep with a cannon he saw the fresh splinters in the tree above her head but shrugged you look okay to me no thanks to you she brushed at the sleeve of her blouse allowing the disgust as insects scattered into the moss while you were down there playing robin hood two nasty men with equally nasty guns came strolling by your name was mentioned fames a burden he murmured it had been close he thought with a glance at the splintered tree again too close no matter how he maneuvered no matter how often he shifted direction and tactics dimitri hung on doug knew the sensation of being tracked he also knew the sweaty gutfluttering feeling of the hunted when the hunter was closing in he wasnt going to lose he looked into the forest and forced himself to stay calm he wasnt going to lose when hed almost won by the way youre a lousy lookout youll have to excuse the fact that i was preoccupied and couldnt whistle i nearly had to talk my way out of a very sensitive situation back to business he told himself if dimitri was close theyd just have to move faster and jazz up their footwork however i managed to pick up a few things and get out before it got crowded it figures it didnt matter that she was relieved he was in one piece and that she was more than pleased to have him with her again she wouldnt let him know it there was this lemur and whitney broke off when she saw one of the things hed brought with him what she began in a tone that was obviously as offended as it was curious is that a present doug picked up the straw hat and offered it i didnt have time to wrap it its unattractive and has absolutely no style it has a wide brim he returned and dropped it on her head since it isnt possible for me to stick a bag over your head this has to do how flattering i picked you up a little outfit to go with it he tossed her a stiff shapeless cotton dress the color of sunbleached dung douglas really whitney picked up a sleeve between her thumb and fingertip she felt a revulsion nearly identical with that shed experienced the morning shed woken with the spider ugly was ugly after all i wouldnt be caught dead in this thats just what were shooting for sugar she remembered the wood splintering a few inches above her nose perhaps the dress would pick up a bit of style when it was worn and while im wearing this fetching little number what about you he picked up another straw hat this one with a slightly peaked cap very chic she smothered her laughter when he held up a long plaid shirt and wide cotton pants our host obviously likes his rice doug commented as he spread the generous waist of the pants but well manage i hate to bring up the previous success of your disguises but then dont he rolled the clothes into a ball in the morning you and i are going to be a loving malagasy couple on their way to market why not a malagasy woman and her idiot brother on their way to market dont press your luck feeling a bit more confident whitney examined her slacks theyd been torn at the knee on the bark the hole annoyed her a great deal more than the bullet had just look at this she demanded if this keeps up i wont have a decent outfit left ive already ruined a skirt and a perfectly lovely blouse and now this she could stick three fingers in the hole i just bought these slacks in dc look i brought you a new dress didnt i whitney glanced at the ball of clothes how droll bitch later he advised right now tell me if you overheard anything i should know she sent him a smoldering look reached in her pack and pulled out her notebook these slacks are on your tab douglas isnt everything twisting his head he looked down at the amount she noted eightyfive dollars who the hell pays eightyfive bucks for a pair of cotton pants you do she said sweetly just be grateful im not adding on the tax now satisfied she dropped the notebook back in her pack one of the men was a creep only one of them i mean a firstclass creep with a voice like a slug he giggled doug momentarily forgot his growing tab barns yes thats it the other man called him barns he tried to shoot one of those cute little lemurs and nearly took off the tip of my nose as an afterthought she dug in her pack for her compact to make certain there was no damage if dimitri had set his pet dog loose doug knew he was feeling confident barns wasnt on the payroll because of his brains or cunning he didnt kill for profit or for practicality he killed for fun whatd they say whatd you hear satisfied she patted on a bit of powder it came through loud and clear that the first man wanted to get his hands on you it sounded personal as for barns nervous again she reached in dougs pocket and pulled out a cigarette he prefers me which i suppose shows some discrimination he felt a well of fury rise up so quickly he nearly choked on it while he battled it back doug took out a pack of matches and lit the cigarette since he was running low theyd have to share awhile saying nothing he took the cigarette from whitney and drew smoke in deeply hed never seen barns in action but hed heard what hed heard wasnt pretty even up against some of the obscenities that happened with regularity in places whitneyd never heard of barns had a penchant for women and small fragile things there was a particularly gruesome story about what hed done to a sharp little hooker in chicago and what had been left of her after hed done it doug watched whitneys slender elegant fingers as she took the cigarette again barns wouldnt get his sweaty hands on her not if he had to cut them off at the wrist first what else shed only heard that tone of voice from him once or twice before when hed held a rifle in his hand and when his fingers had closed around her throat whitney took a long pull on the cigarette it was easier to play the game when doug seemed halfamused and halffrustrated when his eyes went cool and flat in just that way it was a different story she remembered a hotel room in washington and a young waiter with a red stain spreading over the back of his neat white jacket doug can it be worth it impatient he kept his eyes trained on the rise above their heads what your end of the rainbow your pot of gold these men want you dead you want to jingle some gold in your pocket i want more than jingles sugar im going to drip with it while youre dripping theyll be shooting at you yeah but ill have something his gaze shifted and locked on hers ive been shot at before ive been running for years she met the look as intense as he when do you plan to stop when i have something and this time im going to get it yeah he blew out a long stream of smoke how could he explain to her what it was like to wake up in the morning with twenty dollars and your wits would she believe him if he told her he knew hed been born for more than twobit hustling hed been given a brain hed honed the skill all he needed was a stake a big one yeah its worth it she was silent a moment knowing shed never really understand the need to have you had to be without first it wasnt as simple as greed which she would have understood it was as complex as ambition and as personal as dreams whether she was still following her first impulse or something deeper she was with him they were heading north the first man said remod told them to they figure to flush us out in here or drive us out where they can pick us up logical as if it were pricey columbian they passed the virginia tobacco back and forth so for tonight we stay put here as close to the huts as we can without being spotted with regret he stubbed out the cigarette as it burned into the filter well start out just after dawn whitney took his arm i want more he gave her a long look that reminded her of a moment by the waterfall more what ive been chased and shot at a few minutes ago i lay behind that tree wondering how much longer i was going to live she had to take a deep breath to keep her voice steady but her gaze never faltered i stand to lose every bit as much as you do doug i want to see the papers hed wondered when shed back him into a corner hed only hoped they could be closer before she did abruptly he realized hed stopped looking for opportunities to ditch her it seemed hed taken a partner after all but it didnt have to equal fiftyfifty going to his pack he searched through the envelope until he came to a letter that hadnt been translated if it hadnt been his deduction was it wasnt as vital as those which had on the other hand he couldnt read it whitney might pass on something useful here he handed her the carefully sealed page before he sat on the ground again they looked each other over wary distrustful before whitney lowered her gaze to the sheet it was dated october dear louise she read i pray as i write this letter will reach you and find you well even here so many miles away word comes to us of france this settlement is small and many people walk with their eyes regarding the ground we have left one war for the threat of another political intrigue can never be escaped it seems every day we search for french troops the exile of another queen and my heart is divided as to whether i would welcome them or hide still there is a certain beauty here the sea is close and i walk in the mornings with danielle and gather shells she has grown so in these last months seen more heard more than any mother can bear for her daughter yet from her eyes the fear is fading she picks flowers flowers such as i have never seen grow in any place though gerald still mourns the queen i feel in time we can be happy here i write you louise to beg you to reconsider to join us even in dijon you cannot be safe i hear the stories of homes burned and looted of people dragged to prison and to death there is here a young man who received word that his parents were driven from their home near versailles and hung at night i dream of you and fear desperately for your life i want my sister with me louise safe gerald will open a store and danielle and i have planted a garden our lives are simple but there is no guillotine and no terror there is so much i need to talk with you about sister there are things i dare not write in a letter i can tell you only that gerald received a message and an obligation from the queen only months before her death it burdens him in a plain wooden box he holds a part of france and marie which will not release him i beg you do not cling to what has turned against you do not tie your heart as my husband has to what is surely over depart from france and what is past louise come to diegosuarez your devoted sister magdaline slowly whitney handed the sheet back to him do you know what that is a letter because he hadnt been unaffected doug slipped it back into the envelope the family came here to escape the revolution according to other documents this gerald was some sort of manservant to marie antoinette its important she murmured damn right every paper in heres important because every one adds a piece to the puzzle she watched him secure the envelope in his pack and thats all what else he shot her a look sure i feel sorry for the lady but shes been dead quite a while im alive he put his hand on the pack this is going to help me live exactly the way ive been waiting to that letter is nearly two centuries old thats right and the only thing in it that still exists is whats in a little wooden box its going to be mine she studied him a moment the intense eyes the sensitive mouth with a sigh she shook her head lifes not simple is it no because he needed to take the lonely look from her face he smiled who wants it to be shed think later whitney decided shed demand to see the rest of the papers later for now she wanted only to rest body and mind she rose what now now he scanned the immediate area we make do with our accommodations making a primitive camp deep in the trees on the hill they ate merina meat and drank palm wine they built no fire through the night they took turns keeping watch and sleeping for the first time since they began the journey together they barely spoke between them was the breath of danger and the memory of a wild mindless moment under a waterfall dawn in the forest brought streams of gold shafts of rose misty greens the scent was like that of a hothouse with its doors just flung open the light was dreamy the air soft carrying the cheerful sound of birds greeting the sunlight dew skimmed over the ground and clung to leaves a shaft of sunlight turned tiny drops into rainbows there were corners of paradise in the world lazy content whitney cuddled closer to the warmth beside her she sighed when a hand stroked down her hair pleased with the feelings drifting through her she settled her head on a male shoulder and slept it wasnt difficult to lose time watching her this way doug gave himself a moment of pleasure after a long tense night she was a stunner and when she slept there was a softness about her that her tart wit concealed when she was in gear her eyes often dominated her face now with them closed it was possible to appreciate the sheer beauty of her bone structure the flawless purity of her skin a man could fall very quick and very deep with a woman like this though he was surefooted doug had already had a stumble or two himself he wanted to make love with her slowly luxuriously on a soft springy bed piled with pillows lined with silk lit by candles his imagination had no trouble setting the scene for him he wanted it but hed wanted many things in his life doug considered one of the highest marks for success the ability to separate what you wanted from what you could get and what you could get from what would pay off he wanted whitney and had a good chance of having her but instinct warned him it wouldnt pay off a woman like her had a way of tossing out strings on a man then tugging on them when they were good and tight he had no intention of being tied down or tied to take the money and run he reminded himself that was the name of the game in sleep whitney stirred and sighed awake so did he it was time for a little distance he decided reaching across her he shook her by the shoulder rise and shine duchess hmmm she simply curled into him as warm and sinuous as a napping cat he was forced to let out a very long very slow breath whitney get your ass in gear the phrase penetrated the fogs of sleep frowning she opened her eyes im not sure fifty percent of a pot of golds worth having to hear your charming voice every morning we aint growing old together anytime you want to back out just say the word it was then it occurred to her that their bodies were pressed close like lovers after a night of passion and compassion one thin arched and elegant brow lifted and what do you think youre doing douglas waking you up he told her easily youre the one who started crawling all over me you know what a hard time you have resisting my body no but i do know what a hard time i have resisting putting a few dents in it pushing him away she sat up and shook her hair back oh god his reflexes were quick he had her under him again in a move swift enough to knock her breathless though neither of them realized it hed made one of the few purely unselfish gestures in his life hed shielded her body with his without a second thought to his own safety or to profit what christ must you habitually manhandle me resigned she sighed and pointed straight up cautiously he followed the line of her finger above their heads dozens of lemurs stood in the tops of the trees their slim arching bodies were upright their long thin arms reaching up and up toward the sky with their bodies stretched lining the branches they resembled a row of ecstatic pagans at sacrifice doug let out an oath and relaxed youre going to be seeing a lot of those little fellas he told her as he rolled aside do me a favor and dont shout every time we run into one i didnt shout she was much too charmed to be annoyed as she pulled up her knees and circled them with her arms it looks as though theyre praying or worshiping the sunrise so the legend goes doug agreed as he began to strike camp sooner or later dimitris men would double back doug wasnt going to leave them a sign actually theyre just warming themselves i prefer the mystique good youll have plenty of mystique in your new dress he tossed it to her put it on theres one more thing i want to get from below while youre shopping why dont you look for something a bit more attractive im fond of silk raw or refined something in blue with a bit of drape at the hips just put it on he ordered and disappeared huffing and far from pleased whitney stripped off the soft expensive and ruined clothes shed bought in washington and pulled the shapeless tunic over her head it fell lifelessly to her knees maybe with a nice wide leather belt she muttered something in scarlet with a really flashy buckle she ran a hand down the nubby cotton and scowled the hemline was all wrong and the color was simply hopeless she absolutely refused to look like a dowd whether she was attending the ballet or running from bullets sitting on the ground she dug out her makeup case at least she could do something about her face when doug returned she was trying and rejecting several different styles of wrapping the lamba over her shoulders nothing she said in disgust absolutely nothing works with this sack i think id rather wear your shirt and pants at least she broke off as she turned around good god whats that a pig he said precisely as he struggled with the squirming bundle of course its a pig whats it for more cover he fastened the rope hed slipped around the pigs neck to a tree with a few indignant squeaks it subsided in the grass the packsll go in those baskets i lifted so it looks like were carrying our wares to market the pigs a little more insurance lots of farmers in this region take livestock to market he stripped off his shirt as he spoke whatd you put that stuff on your face for the important thing is for nobody to see any more of it than absolutely necessary i might have to wear this shroud but i refuse to look like a hag youve got a real problem with vanity he told her as he pulled on his newly acquired shirt i dont see vanity as a problem she countered when its justified pile your hair under that hat all of it she did turning slightly away while he peeled off his jeans and replaced them with the cotton pants to make up for the wide gap of inches he cinched them with another piece of rope when she turned they studied each other the pants gathered generously at his waist billowing down over his hips and riding to several inches above his ankles the lamba hed draped over his shoulders and back hid his build the hat shadowed his face and covered most of his hair he might get away with it as long as no one looked too closely whitney decided the long wide dress concealed every dip and curve of her body it left her feet and ankles exposed much too elegant ankles doug observed and decided theyd have to be coated with dust and dirt the lamba draped around her throat over her shoulders and down her arms was a good touch for the most part her hands would be hidden the straw hat had none of the style and flash of the white fedora shed once worn yet despite the fact that it thoroughly covered her head and hair it did nothing to disguise the classic and very western beauty of her face you wont get a mile he muttered what do you mean your face christ do you have to look like something that just stepped off the cover of vogue her lips curved ever so slightly yes dissatisfied doug rearranged her lamba with a bit of ingenuity he brought it further up on her throat so that her chin was nearly buried in the folds then pulled her hat down further on her head tilting down the front brim just how the hell am i supposed to see she blew at the lamba and breathe you can fold the brim back when nobodys around with his hands on his hips he stood back to take a long critical look she looked shapeless sexless and overwhelmed by the circling shawl until she looked up and shot him a glare there was nothing sexless about those eyes he thought they reminded him that there was indeed a shape under all that cotton he shoved the packs into the baskets and covered them with the handfuls of fruit and food they had left when we get out on the road you keep your head down and walk behind me like a properly disciplined wife shows what you know about wives lets get moving before they decide to backtrack this part of the forest he hefted a basket on each shoulder and started back down the steep uncertain path didnt you forget something you get the pig lover deciding her choices were limited whitney untied the rope from the tree and began to tug the uncooperative pig behind her eventually she found it simpler to bundle him up in her arms like a recalcitrant child he squirmed oinked and subsided come along little douglas daddys taking us to market smartass doug grumbled but grinned as they cleared the trees there is a bit of a resemblance she said as she skidded to a stop at the bottom around the snout well take this road east he said ignoring her with any luck well make it to the coast by nightfall struggling with the pig whitney navigated down the steep dirt steps for chrissake whitney put the damn pig down he can walk i dont think you should swear in front of the baby gently she set him down tugging on the rope so that he swayed along beside them mountain brush and cover were left behind from a helicopter she mused theyd probably look enough like farmers to get away with it up close what if we run into our hosts she began casting a quick look at the huts behind them they might recognize this designer original well take our chances doug started down the narrow road and decided whitneys feet would be dirty enough within a mile theyd be a lot easier to deal with than dimitris ape patrol because the road ahead looked endless and the day was only beginning whitney decided to take his word for it chapter nine after thirty minutes whitney knew the lamba was going to smother her it was the kind of day where she felt it best to wear as little as possible while doing as little as possible instead she was trapped inside a longsleeved longskirted sack wound inside yards of lamba and assigned to a thirtymile hike this one would be great for her memoirs she decided travels with my pig in any case she was becoming rather fond of the little fellow he had a princely kind of waddle trooping along with his head swiveling from side to side now and again as though he were leading a procession she wondered how hed like an overripe mango you know whitney decided hes rather sweet doug glanced down at the pig hed be sweeter barbecued thats revolting she shot him a long critical look you wouldnt no he wouldnt only because he didnt have the stomach for it but there was no reason to let whitney know he had a certain delicacy if he was going to eat ham he wanted it all nicely cured and packaged first ive got this recipe for sweetandsour pork worth its weight in gold just keep it filed she said smartly this little piggys under my protection i did three weeks in a chinese restaurant in san francisco before i left town i had the classiest ruby necklace outside of a museum a black pearl tiepin as big as a robins egg and a pad full of great recipes all he had left were the recipes they satisfied him you marinate the pork overnight its so tender it practically dissolves on the plate stuff it herb sausage in a very thin casing grilled your iqs all in your stomach the road became more even smoother and wider as they left the hills behind the eastern plane was lush and green and humid and much too open for dougs thinking he glanced overhead at power lines a disadvantage dimitri could issue orders quickly over the phone from where was he south following the trail doug so desperately tried to cover behind just behind and closing in they were being followed of that he was certain he recognized the feeling and hadnt been able to shake it since theyd left new york and yet doug shifted the basket he couldnt lose the notion that dimitri knew the destination and was waiting patiently to close the net doug glanced around again hed have slept easier knowing from which direction he was being hunted though they didnt dare risk the use of his field glasses they could see wide welltended plantations with long stretches of flatland that could accommodate the landing of a helicopter flowers sprang up everywhere to bake in the heat dust from the road coated petals but didnt make them any less exotic the view was excellent the day clear all the easier to spot two people and one pig traveling down the eastern road he kept the pace steady hoping to come across a group of travelers they could blend with one glance at whitney reminded him that blending wasnt a simple matter do you have to walk as though you were strolling toward bloomingdales i beg your pardon she was getting the hang of leading the pig and wondered if it would make a more interesting pet than a dog you walk rich try for humble she heaved a longsuffering sigh douglas i might have to wear this very unattractive outfit and lead a pig on a rope but i wont be humble now why dont you stop griping and enjoy the walk everythings pretty and green and the air smells like vanilla theres a plantation over there they grow it and on a plantation were vehicles he wondered just how risky it would be to attempt to liberate one really she squinted as she looked into the sun the fields were wide and very green dotted with people it grows in a little bean doesnt it she asked idly ive always been fond of the scent in those slim white candles he shot her a mild look white candles white silk that was her style ignoring the image he gave his attention back to the fields they were passing there were too many people working in them and too much open space to try hotwiring a pickup at the moment the weathers certainly become tropical hasnt it sweltering she dabbed at her forehead with the back of her hand trade winds bring in the moisture its hot and humid till around next month but weve missed the cyclone season theres good news she murmured she thought she could actually see the heat rising from the road in waves oddly it brought a flash of nostalgia for new york in high summer where the heat bounced up off the sidewalks and you could choke on the smell of sweat and exhaust a late brunch at the palm court would be nice with strawberries in cream and a tall iced coffee she shook her head and ordered herself to think of something else on a day like this id like to be in martinique who wouldnt ignoring his testy tone of voice she went on ive a friend with a villa there ill bet perhaps youve heard of him robert madison he writes spy thrillers madison surprised doug gave her his attention again the pisces symbol impressed that hed named what she considered madisons best work she looked at him under the brim of her hat why yes youve read him yeah doug shifted the bags on his shoulders ive managed to get a bit beyond see spot run shed already gauged that for herself dont be cranky it just happens that im a rather avid fan weve known each other for years bob moved to martinique when the irs made it uncomfortable for him in the states his villas quite lovely with a spectacular view of the sea right now id be sitting beside the pool on the terrace with an enormous frozen margarita watching halfnaked people play on the beach that was her style all right he thought incomprehensibly annoyed terraced pools and sultry air little whitesuited houseboys serving drinks on silver platters while some jerk with more looks than brains rubbed oil on her shoulder blades hed done both the serving and the rubbing in his time and couldnt say he preferred one to the other as long as the haul was rich if you had nothing to do on a day like this what would you choose he struggled against the image of whitney lying halfnaked on a lounge skin slick with oil id be in bed he told her with a clever redhead with green eyes and big a rather ordinary fantasy whitney interrupted ive rather ordinary urges she feigned a yawn so im sure does our pig look she went on before he could retort somethings coming he saw the dust plume in the road ahead muscles tense he looked right and left if necessary they could make a run for it over the fields but it wasnt likely theyd get far if their impromptu costuming didnt work it could all be over within minutes just keep your head down he told whitney and i dont care how much it goes against the grain look humble and subservient she tilted her head so that she looked at him from under the brim of her hat i wouldnt have the least idea how keep your head down and walk the trucks engine sounded welltuned and powerful though the paint was splashed with dirt doug could see it was fairly new hed read that many of the plantation owners were welloff growing wealthy through the sale of vanilla coffee and cloves that thrived in this region as the truck drew closer he shifted the bag on his shoulder slightly so that most of his face was hidden his muscles tingled and tensed the truck barely slowed as it passed them all he could think of was how quickly they could get to the coast if he could get his hands on one it worked whitney lifted her head and grinned he drove right by us without a glance mostly if you give people what they expect to see they dont see anything how profound human nature he tossed back still regretting that he wasnt behind the wheel of the truck ive gotten into plenty of hotel rooms wearing a red bellmans jacket and a fivedollar smile you rob hotels in broad daylight for the most part people arent in their rooms during the day she thought about it a moment then shook her head it doesnt sound nearly as thrilling now stalking around in the dead of night in a black suit with a flashlight while people are sleeping right in the same room thats exciting and thats how you get ten to twenty risk adds to the excitement have you ever been to jail no its one of the small pleasures in life ive never experienced she nodded it confirmed her opinion that he was good at what he did what was your biggest heist though the sweat was running freely down his back he laughed christ where do you get your terminology starsky and hutch reruns come on douglas this is called passing the time if she didnt pass the time shed collapse on the road in a puddle of dripping exhaustion once shed thought shed never be any more hot and uncomfortable than shed been hiking over the highlands shed been wrong you mustve had one big haul in your illustrious career he said nothing for a moment as he looked down the straight endless road but he wasnt seeing the dust the ruts the short shadows cast by the piercing noontime sun i had my hands on a diamond as big as your fist a diamond it so happened she had a weakness for them the icy glitter the hidden colors the ostentation yeah not just any rock a big glittery granddaddy the prettiest piece of ice ive ever seen the sydney diamond the sydney she stopped gaping god its fortyeight and a half carats of perfection i remember it was on exhibition in san francisco about three no four years ago it was stolen she broke off astonished and deeply impressed you thats right sugar he enjoyed the fascinated surprise on her face i had that sonofabitch in my hand in memory he looked down at his empty palm it was scratched now from the flight through the forest but he could see the diamond in it gloating up at him i swear you could feel the heat from it see a hundred different pictures by putting it up to the light it was like holding a cool blonde while her blood ran hot she could feel it the arousal the pure physical thrill since shed received her first string of pearls whitney had often pinned and draped on diamonds and other glitters it pleased her but the pleasure of imagining holding the sydney was much deeper of plucking it out of its cold glass case and watching light and life gleam in your hand how melvin feinstein the worm the little bastard was my partner whitney saw from the set of his mouth that the story wasnt going to have a happyeverafter ending and the worm earned his name in more ways than one he was fourfootsix i swear he could slip under the crack of a door he had the blueprints of the museum but he didnt have the brains to handle the security thats where i came in you handled the alarms everybodys got a specialty he looked back back over the years in san francisco where the days had been misty and the nights cool we cased that job for weeks calculating every possible angle the alarm system was a beauty the best id ever come across that memory was pleasant the challenge of it and the logic by which hed outwitted it with a computer and figures you could find more interesting answers than the balance of your checkbook alarmsre like women he mused they bait you wink at you with a little charm and the right skill you figure out what makes them tick patience he murmured nodding to himself the right touch and youve got them just where you want them a fascinating analogy im sure she watched him coolly from under the brim of her hat one might even say they have a habit of going off when provoked yeah but not if you keep a step ahead youd better go on with your story before you get in any deeper douglas his mind was back in san francisco on a chilled night where the fog came in long fingers to sweep the ground we got in through the ducts easier for the worm than me had to shoot out a line and go hand over hand because the floors were wired i lifted it the worm has clumsy hands and he wasnt long enough to reach the display anyway i had to hang down over the case it took me six and a half minutes to cut through the glass then i had it she could see it doug hanging by his feet over the display dressed in black while the diamond glinted up at him the sydney was never recovered thats right sugar its one of the little entries in the book in my pack there was no way he could explain to her the pleasure and frustration he felt reading about it if you had it why arent you living in a villa in martinique good question with something between a smile and a sneer he shook his head yeah thats a damn good question i had it he murmured half to himself he angled his hat forward but still squinted against the sun for a minute i was one rich sonofabitch he could still picture it still feel the nearsexual pull of hanging over the display case holding the glittering piece of ice in his hand the world under his feet what happened the image and the feeling shattered like a diamond split carelessly we started back out like i said the worm could squirm through the ducts like a slug by the time i got through he was gone the little bastardd lifted the rock right out of my bag and vanished to top it off he put an anonymous call through to the police they were crawling all over my hotel when i got back i hopped a freighter with the shirt on my back thats when i spent some time in tokyo what about the worm last i heard he had himself a cozy yacht and was running a highclass floating casino one of these days he relished the fantasy a moment then shrugged anyway that was the last time i took a partner until now she reminded him he looked down at her his eyes narrowed he was back in madagascar and there was no chilling fog there was only sweat aching muscles and whitney until now in case you have any notion of imitating your friend the worm douglas remember there isnt a hole deep enough for you to slide into sugar he pinched her chin trust me ill pass thanks for a time they walked in silence doug reliving every step of the sydney diamond job the tension the coolheaded concentration that kept the blood very still and the hands very steady the thrill of holding the world in his hands if only for a moment hed have it again that much he promised himself it wouldnt be the sydney this time but a box of jewels that would make the sydney look like a prize in a cracker jack box this time nobodyd take it from him no bowlegged midget and no classy blonde too many times hed had the rainbow in his hands and watched it vanish it wasnt so bad if you blew it yourself on foolishness and chances but when you were stupid enough to trust someone that had always been one of his big problems he might steal but he was honest somehow he figured other people were as well until he ended up with empty pockets the sydney whitney mused no secondclass hood wouldve attempted to steal it or have succeeded the story confirmed for her what shed thought all along doug lord was a class act in his own fashion and there was one more thing hed be very possessive with the treasure when and if they found it that was something shed have to think about carefully absently she smiled at two children racing across the field to her left perhaps their parents were working on the plantation perhaps they owned it still their lives would be simple she thought it was interesting how appealing simplicity could be from time to time she felt the cotton dress rub uncomfortably over her shoulder then again there was something to be said for luxury lots of it they both jolted at the sound of an engine behind them when they turned the truck was practically on top of them if theyd had to run they wouldnt have gotten ten yards doug cursed himself then cursed again when the driver leaned out and called to them it wasnt a new model like the truck that had passed them earlier nor was it quite as rickety as the merina jeep the engine ran smoothly enough as it idled in the middle of the road the back was loaded with wares from pots and baskets to wooden chairs and tables a traveling salesman whitney decided already eyeing what he had to offer she wondered how much he wanted for the colorful clay pot it would look rather nice on a table with a collection of cacti the driver would be a betsimisaraka doug calculated both from the region they were traveling in and the european touch of his derby he grinned showing a mouthful of healthy white teeth as he gestured for them to approach the truck well what now whitney asked under her breath i think weve just hitched a ride sugar whether we want to or not wed better give your french and my charm another try lets simply use my french shall we forgetting to look humble she walked to the truck while she peered from under the brim of her hat she gave the driver her best smile and made up a story as she went along she and her husband though she had to swallow a bit on that one were traveling from their farm in the hills to the coast where her family lived her mother she decided on the spot was ill she noticed that his curious dark eyes roamed her face pale and regal under the simple straw hat without breaking rhythm whitney rattled off an explanation apparently satisfied the driver gestured to the door he was traveling to the coast they were welcome to a ride stooping whitney gathered up the pig come on douglas weve got a new chauffeur doug secured the baskets in the back then climbed in beside her luck could play either way he knew that well enough this time he was willing to believe it had played on his side whitney laid the pig on her lap as though it were a small weary child whatd you tell him he asked her as he nodded to the driver and grinned whitney sighed absorbing the luxury of being driven i told him were going to the coast my mothers ill sorry to hear it its very likely a deathbed scene so dont look too happy your mother never liked me thats beside the point besides its merely that she wanted me to marry tad he paused in the act of offering one of their few cigarettes to the driver tad who she enjoyed the scowl on his face and smoothed the skirt of her dress tad carlyse iv dont be jealous darling after all i chose you lucky me he muttered howd you get around the fact that we arent natives im french my father was a sea captain who settled on the coast you were a teacher on holiday we fell madly in love married against our familys wishes and now work a small farm in the hills by the way youre british doug played back the story in his head and decided he couldnt have done better good thinking how longve we been married i dont know why i just wondered if i should be affectionate or bored whitney narrowed her eyes kiss ass even if were newlyweds i dont think i should be that affectionate in front of company barely smothering a chuckle whitney closed her eyes and pretended she was in a plush limo within moments her head was snuggled on dougs shoulder the pig snored gently in her lap she dreamed she and doug were in a small elegant room washed with candlelight that wafted the scent of vanilla she wore silk white and thin enough to show the silhouette of her body he was all in black she recognized the look in his eyes the sudden darkening of that clear clear green before his clever hands ran up her body and his mouth covered hers she was weightless floating unable to touch the ground with her feet yet she could feel every plane and line as his body pressed against hers smiling he drew away from her and reached for a bottle of champagne the dream was so clear that she could see the beads of water on the glass he pried the cork it opened with an earsplintering blast when she looked again he held only a jagged bottle in his hand at the door was the shadow of a man and the glint of a sun they were crawling through a small dark hole sweat rolled from her somehow she knew they were winding through ducts yet it was like the tunnel to the cave dark dank suffocating just a little bit farther she heard him speak and saw something glitter up ahead it was light beaming off the facets of an enormous diamond for a moment it filled the darkness with a wild almost religious light then it was gone and she was standing alone on a barren hill lord you sonofabitch rise and shine sugar this is our stop you worm she muttered thats no way to talk to your husband opening her eyes she looked into his grinning face you sonofa he cut the oath off kissing her hard and long with his lips only a breath from hers he pinched her were supposed to be in love sugar our friendly chauffeur might have a grasp of some of the cruder english expressions dazed she squeezed her eyes shut then opened them again i was dreaming yeah and it sounds like i didnt come off very well doug hopped out to retrieve the baskets in the back whitney shook her head to clear it then looked through the windshield a town it was small by any standard and the air had a scent that brought fish to mind rather sharply but it was a town as thrilled as if shed woken in paris on an april morning whitney jumped from the truck a town meant a hotel a hotel meant a tub hot water a real bed douglas youre wonderful with the pig sandwiched and squealing between them she hugged him jesus whitney youre getting pig all over me absolutely wonderful she said again and gave him a loud exuberant kiss well yeah he found his hand could settle comfortably at her waist but a minute ago i was a worm a minute ago i didnt know where we were you do now why dont you fill me in in town hugging the pig against her she whirled away hot and cold running water box springs and mattresses wheres the hotel shading her eyes she began to scan look i wasnt planning on staying there she said triumphantly it was clean and without frills more along the lines of an inn than a hotel it was a town of seamen fishermen with the indian ocean close at its back a seawall rose high as protection against the floods that came every season here and there nets were spread over it to dry in the sun there were palm trees and fat orange flowers growing in vines against clapboard a gull nestled at the top of a telephone pole and slept the straight lines of the coast prevented it from being a port but the little seaside town obviously enjoyed a smarter of tourist trade now and then whitney was already thanking the driver though it surprised him doug didnt have the heart to tell her they couldnt stay hed planned to replenish supplies and see about transportation up the coast before they went on he watched her smile at their driver one night couldnt hurt he decided they could start out fresh in the morning if dimitri was close at least doug would have a wall at his back for a few hours a wall at his back and a few hours to plan the next step he swung a basket over each shoulder give him the pig and say goodbye whitney smiled at the driver a last time then started across the street there were shells crushed underfoot mixed with dirt and a stingy spread of gravel abandon our firstborn son to a traveling salesman really douglas itd be like selling him to the gypsies cute and i understand you mightve formed a bit of an attachment so would you if you hadnt been thinking with your stomach but what the hell are we going to do with it well find him a decent home whitney just outside the inn he took her arm thats a slab of bacon not a pomeranian ssh cuddling the pig protectively she walked inside it was marvelously cool there were ceiling fens lazily circling that made her think of ricks place in casablanca the walls were whitewashed the floors dark wood scarred but scrubbed someone had tackedbleached woven mats to the walls the only decoration a few people sat at tables drinking a dark gold liquid in thick glasses whitney caught the scent of something unidentifiable and wonderful drifting through an open door in the back fish stew doug murmured as his stomach yearned something close to bouillabaisse with a touch of rosemary he said closing his eyes and a little garlic because her mouth watered whitney was forced to swallow it sounds like lunch to me a woman came through the door wiping her hands on a big white apron that was colored like a parade flag from her cooking though her face was creased deeply and her hands showed work as well as age she wore her hair in gay braided rings like a young girl she scanned whitney and doug looked at the pig for only a moment then spoke in quick heavily accented english so much for dougs disguises you wish a room please struggling to keep her eyes from drifting beyond the woman to the doorway where scents poured out whitney smiled my wife and i would like a room for the night a bath and a meal for two the woman said then looked again at the pig or for three i found the little pig wandering on the side of the road whitney improvised i didnt like to leave it perhaps you know someone whod care for it the woman eyed the pig in a way that had whitney hugging it tighter then she smiled my grandson will take care of it he is six but he is responsible the woman held out her arms and reluctantly whitney handed her erstwhile pet over hefting the pig under one arm the woman reached in her pocket for keys this room is ready up the stairs and two doors on the right you are welcome whitney watched her go back into the kitchen with the pig under her arm now now sugar every mother has to let her children go one day she sniffed and started for the stairs he better not be on the menu tonight the room was a great deal smaller than the cave theyd slept in but it had a few cheerful seaside paintings on the wall and a bed covered in a flashy floral print that had been meticulously patched the bath was no more than an alcove separated from the bedroom by a bamboo screen heaven whitney decided after one look and flopped facedown on the bed it smelled only lightly of fish i dont know how celestial it is he checked the lock on the door and found it sturdy but itll do until the real thing comes along im going to crawl into the tub and wallow for hours all right you take the first shift without ceremony he dumped the baskets on the floor im going to do a little checking around and see what kind of transportation we can get heading up the coast id prefer a nice stately mercedes sighing she pillowed her head on her hands but id settle for a wagon and a threelegged pony maybe i can find something in between taking no chances he pulled the envelope out of his pack and secured it under the back of his shirt dont use all the hot water sugar ill be back be sure to check on room service wont you i hate it when the canapés are late whitney heard the door click shut and stretched luxuriously as much as shed like just to sleep she decided she wanted a bath more rising she stripped off the long cotton dress and let it fall in a heap my sympathies to your former owner she murmured then threw the straw hat like a frisbee across the room over her naked skin her hair cascaded like sunlight cheerful she turned the hot tap on full and searched through her pack for her cache of bath oil and bubbles in ten minutes she was steeped in steaming fragrant frothy water heaven she said again and shut her eyes outside doug took in the town quickly there were a few little shops with handicrafts arranged in the windows colorful hammocks hung on hooks from porch rails and a row of sharks teeth were lined on a stoop obviously the people were accustomed to tourists and their odd penchant for the useless the scent of fish was strong as he wandered down toward the wharf there he admired the boats the coils of rope and the nets spread out to dry if he could figure out a way to keep some fish on ice hed bargain for it miracles could be accomplished with a fish over an open fire if one had the right touch but first there was a matter of the miles he had yet to travel up the coast and how he was going to go about it hed already decided that going by water would be the quickest and most practical way from the map in the guidebook hed seen that the canal des pangalanes could take them all the way to maroantsetra from there theyd have to travel through the rain forest hed feel safer there with the heat the humidity and the plentiful cover the canal was the best route all he needed was a boat and someone with the skill to guide it spotting a small shop he wandered over he hadnt seen a paper in days and decided to buy one even if he had to depend on whitney to translate as he reached for the door he felt a quick flash of disorientation from within he heard the unmistakable toughrock sound of pat benatar hit me with your best shot she challenged as he pushed the door open behind the counter stood a tall lanky man whose dark skin gleamed with sweat as he moved to the beat pouring out of a small expensive portable stereo while his feet shuffled he polished the glass in the windows to the side of the counter and belted out the lyrics with benatar fire awaaay he shouted then turned as the door slammed behind doug good afternoon the accent was decidedly french the faded tshirt he wore read city college of new york the grin was youthful and appealing on the shelves behind him were trinkets linens cans and bottles a general store in nebraska wouldnt have been better stocked may i interest you in some souvenirs ccny doug questioned as he crossed the bare wood floor american reverently the man turned benatar down to a muffled roar before he held out his hand you are from the states yeah new york the young man lit up like a firecracker new york my brother he tugged on the tshirt he goes to college there student exchange going to be a lawyer yes sir a hotshot it was impossible not to grin with his hand still caught in the mans grasp doug shook lightly im doug lord jacques tsiranana america obviously reluctant he released dougs hand i go there myself next year to visit you know soho yeah and until that moment he hadnt realized just how much he missed it yeah i know soho i have a picture digging in behind the counter he brought out a bent snapshot it showed a tall muscular man in jeans standing in front of tower records my brother he buys the records and puts them on the tapes for me american music jacques pronounced rock and roll how about that benatar great pipes doug agreed handing the snapshot back so what are you doing here when you could be in soho doug shook his head there had been times hed asked himself the same question my ah lady and i are traveling up the coast vacation he took a quick glimpse at dougs clothes he was dressed like the humblest malagasy peasant but there was a look of sharp authority in his eye yeah like a vacation if you didnt count the guns and the running i thought it might give her a kick to go up the canal you know scenic pretty country jacques agreed how far to here doug drew the map out of his pocket and ran a finger along the route all the way to maroantsetra some kick jacques murmured two days two long days in places the canal is hard to navigate his teeth shone crocodiles shes tough he claimed thinking of that very sensitive very soft skin you know the kind who digs camping out and open fires what we need is a good guide and a strong boat you pay in american dollars doug narrowed his eyes it looked like luck was indeed playing on his side it can be arranged jacques poked his thumb into the printing on his shirt then i take you got a boat the best boat in town built it myself got a hundred doug looked down at his hands they appeared competent and strong fifty up front well be ready to go in the morning eight oclock bring your lady here at eight oclock well give her a kick unaware of the pleasures in store for her whitney half dozed in the tub each time the water had cooled a bit she had let in another stream of hot as far as she was concerned she could spend the night there her head rested against the back lip her hair fell behind wet and shining trying for a worlds record doug asked from behind her with a gasp she jerked up so that water lapped dangerously near the edge you didnt knock she accused and i locked the door i picked it he said easily need to keep in practice hows the water without waiting for an answer he dipped in a finger smells good his gaze skimmed over the surface looks like your bubblesre starting to give out theyve got a few minutes left in them why dont you get rid of that ridiculous outfit grinning he began to unbutton his shirt thought youd never ask on the other side of the screen smiling she examined her toe just above the waters surface ill get out so you can have your turn shame to waste all that pretty hot water putting a hand on either side of the tub he leaned over her since were partners we should share you think so his mouth was very close and she was very relaxed reaching up she trailed a damp finger down his cheek just what did you have in mind a little gently he brushed her lips with his unfinished business business she laughed and let her hand roam over his neck want to negotiate on impulse she pulled and offbalance he slid into the tub water heaved over the side giggling like a schoolgirl she watched as he swiped bubbles from his face douglas you never looked better tangled with her he struggled to keep from submerging she likes games well you looked so hot and sweaty generous she offered the soap then laughed again when he rubbed it over the shirt that clung to him why dont i give you a hand before she could avoid it he ran the soap down from her throat to her waist i seem to remember you owe me a back scrub aware and still amused she took the soap from him why dont you both of them tensed at the knock at the door dont move doug whispered i wasnt going to untangling himself he climbed out of the tub water ran everywhere it swished in his shoes as he went to his pack and dug out the gun hed buried in it he hadnt had it in his hands since their flight from washington he didnt like the feel of it any more now if dimitri had found them he couldnt have cornered them more neatly doug glanced at the window behind him he could be out and down in seconds then he glanced at the bamboo screen in a tub of cooling water whitney sat naked and completely vulnerable doug gave a last regretful look at the window and escape shit doug quiet holding it close barrel up he moved to the door it was time to try his luck again yeah captain sambirano police at your service shit looking around quickly doug stuck the gun in the back waistband of his pants your badge captain coiled to spring doug opened the door a crack and examined the badge then the man he could spot a cop ten miles away reluctantly he opened the door what can i do for you the captain small rotund and very western in dress stepped inside i seem to have interrupted you having a bath doug saw the puddle forming at his feet and reached for a towel behind the screen i beg your pardon mr wallace peter wallace mr wallace it is my custom to greet anyone who passes through our town we have a quiet community the captain gently tugged on the hem of his jacket doug noticed his nails were short and polished from time to time we entertain tourists who are not fully aware of the law or our customs always happy to cooperate with the police doug said with a wide smile as it happens im moving on tomorrow a pity you cant extend your stay you are perhaps in a hurry peter whitney poked her head and one naked shoulder around the screen excuse me she did her best to blush as she swept her lashes down then up again whether the blush worked or not the captain took off his hat and bowed madam my wife cathy cath this is captain sambirano how do you do charmed im sorry i cant come out just now you see im she trailed off and smiled of course you must forgive the interruption mrs wallace mr wallace if i can be of any help to you during your stay please do not hesitate how sweet halfway out the door the captain turned back and your destination mr wallace oh were following our noses doug claimed cathy and i are graduate students botany so far weve found your country fascinating peter the waters getting cold doug glanced over his shoulder looked back and grinned its our honeymoon you understand naturally may i congratulate you on your taste good afternoon yeah see you doug closed the door leaned back against it and swore i dont like it wrapped in a towel whitney came out from behind the screen what do you think that was all about i wish i knew but one thing when cops start nosing around i look for other accommodations whitney took a long look at the gaily covered bed but doug sorry sugar get yourself dressed he began to strip off his own dripping clothes were catching a boat a little ahead of schedule you have something new after fondling a glass chess piece dimitri moved bishops pawn we think they headed toward the coast think at the snap of dimitris fingers a darksuited man placed a crystal goblet in his hand there was a little settlement in the hills remo watched dimitri drink and swallowed on his own dry throat he hadnt had a decent nights sleep in a week when we checked it out the family was in an uproar somebodyd ripped them off while they were in the fields i see the wine was excellent but of course hed brought his own stock with him dimitri enjoyed traveling but not inconvenience and what precisely was acquired from these people a couple hats some clothes baskets he hesitated and dimitri prompted too gently for comfort a pig a pig dimitri repeated and chuckled remo nearly let his shoulders relax how ingenious i begin to regret lord must be disposed of i could put a man like him to good use go on remo the rest a couple kids saw a peddler in a truck pick up a man and woman and a pig late this morning they headed east there was a long silence remo wouldnt have broken it if thered been a knife in his back dimitri studied the wine in his goblet then sipped drawing the moment out he could hear remos nerves stretching stretching his gaze came up i suggest you also head east remo i in the meantime will move on he ran his fingers over another chess piece admiring the craftsmanship the detail ive calculated the area our quarries are headed for while you track them i shall wait he brought the goblet to his lips again breathing deeply of the bouquet of the wine i grow weary of hotels though the service here is quite excellent when i entertain our guest id like to do so with more privacy setting down the wine he picked up the white knight and its queen yes i do love to entertain in a quick move he smashed the pieces together the shards tinkled lightly as they fell onto the table chapter ten we didnt eat well eat later youre always saying that and another thing whitney said i still dont understand why we have to check out this way she gave a quick grimace to the pile of borrowed clothes in a heap on the floor whitney wasnt accustomed to seeing anyone move quite so fast as doug had in the last five minutes ever heard of an ounce of prevention sugar with a little salt id eat an ounce of prevention at the moment whitney scowled down at his fingertips on the window ledge in a flash they were gone and she held her breath as she watched him drop to the ground below doug felt his legs sing briefly a quick glance around showed him that no one had seen his leap but a fat battlescarred cat dozing in a patch of sunshine looking up he signaled to whitney toss down the packs she did with an enthusiasm that nearly knocked him off his feet take it easy he said between his teeth setting them aside doug braced himself beneath the window okay now you me youre all thats left lover come on ill catch you it wasnt that she doubted him after all shed taken the precaution of slipping her wallet out of her pack and making certain he saw her before hed climbed through the window in the same way she remembered that hed switched the envelope to the pocket of his jeans trust among thieves was obviously the same sort of myth as honor whitney thought it rather strange that the drop looked so much longer now than it had when hed hung by his fingers she frowned down at him a macallister always leaves a hotel by the front door we aint got time for family traditions for chrissake come on before we draw an audience setting her teeth she swung a leg over agilely but very slowly she twisted herself around and lowered it only took her an instant to discover she didnt like the sensation of hanging from the window ledge of an inn in madagascar one bit doug drop doug ordered im not sure i can you can unless you want me to start throwing rocks he might whitney closed her eyes held her breath and let go she fell free for hardly more than a heartbeat before his hands clamped around her hips then slid up to her armpits even so the abrupt stop took the breath from her see he told her when he placed her lightly on the ground nothing to it youve got real potential as a cat burglar goddamn it turning she examined her hands i broke a nail now what am i supposed to do yeah thats tragic he bent to pick up the packs i guess i could shoot you and put you out of your misery she snatched her pack out of his hands very droll i happen to think walking around with nine fingernails is extremely tacky put your hands in your pockets he suggested and started to walk just where are you going now ive arranged for a little trip by water he slid his arms through the straps until the pack rested comfortably on his back all we have to do is get to the boat unobtrusively whitney followed as he wound his way around keeping to the backs of houses away from the street all this because some fat little policeman dropped by to say hello fat little policemen make me nervous he was very polite yeah fat little polite policemen make me more nervous were being very rude to the nice lady who took our pig whats the matter sugar never skip out on a bill before certainly not she sniffed racing along behind him as he crossed a narrow side street nor do i intend to begin i left her twenty twenty grabbing her doug stopped behind a tree beside jacquess store what the hell for we didnt even use the bed we used the bath she reminded him both of us christ i didnt even take my clothes off resigned he studied the little faded frame building beside them while she waited for doug to move again whitney glanced back wistfully toward the hotel another complaint sprang to her mind before she saw a man in a white panama crossing the street idly she watched him until sweat began to pool at the base of her spine doug her throat had gone dry with an anxiety she couldnt explain doug that man look she grabbed his hand turning only slightly i swear hes the same one i saw at the zoma then again on the train jumping at shadows doug muttered but glanced back no whitney gave his arm a quick tug i saw him i saw him twice why should he turn up again why should he be here whitney but he broke off as he watched the man stroll down to meet the captain and he remembered with sudden clarity a man jolting out of his seat on the train in the middle of the confusion dropping a newspaper onto the ground and looking him straight in the eye coincidence doug pulled whitney back behind the tree he didnt believe in them is it one of dimitris men i dont know who else could he be dammit i dont know frustration tore through him he felt he was being chased from all sides knew it but couldnt understand it whoever he is were getting out he looked back at jacquess shop better go in the back way he might have customers and the less people that see us the better the back door was locked crouching down doug took out his penknife and went to work within five seconds the lock clicked open whitney counted impressed she watched him pocket the knife again id like you to teach me how to do that a woman like you doesnt have to pick locks people open doors for you while she thought this over he slipped in the back it was part storage room part bedroom part kitchen beside the narrow neatly made bunk was a collection of half a dozen cassette tapes upbeat elton john music seemed to pour through the wallboards tacked to them was a fullcolor poster of a pouting sexy tina turner beside her was an ad for budweiser the king of beers a new york yankees pennant and an evening shot of the empire state building why do i feel as though ive just walked into a room on second avenue and because she did she felt ridiculously safe his brothers an exchange student at ccny that explains everything whose brother shh padding silently on the balls of his feet like a cat doug moved to the door that connected with the shop he opened it a crack and peered through jacques leaned over the counter in the midst of a transaction that involved what was obviously a detailed exchange of town gossip the bony darkeyed girl had apparently come in to flirt more than shed come in to buy she poked among spools of colored thread and giggled whats going on whitney maneuvered herself so that she could peek through the crack under dougs arm ah romance she proclaimed i wonder where she got that blouse just look at the embroidery work well have a fashion show later the girl bought two spools of thread giggled for another moment or two then left doug opened the door another inch and made a hissing sound through his teeth it was no competition for elton john jacques continued to swivel his hips as he picked up on the lyrics with a glance to the window that opened onto the street doug eased the door open a bit more and called jacques by name jolting jacques nearly upset the display of spools he was rearranging man you gave me a scare still cautious doug crooked a ringer and waited for jacques to saunter over what you doing hiding back here a change of schedule doug told him taking jacquess hand he jerked him inside he realized jacques smelled of english leather we want to take off now now narrowing his eyes jacques studied dougs face he might have lived in a small seaside village all of his life but he wasnt a fool when a man was on the run it showed in his eyes you got trouble hello jacques stepping forward whitney held out her hand im whitney macallister you must forgive douglas for neglecting to introduce us hes often rude jacques took the slim white hand in his and was instantly in love hed never seen anything so beautiful as far as he could tell whitney macallister outshone turner and benatar and the high priestess ronstadt put together his tongue quite simply tied itself in knots shed seen the look before in a slick threepiecesuited professional on fifth avenue it bored her in a trendy club on the west side it amused her in jacques she found it sweet we have to apologize for barging in on you this way its he had to search for the americanisms that were usually on the tip of his tongue okay he managed impatient doug laid a hand on jacquess shoulder we want to move his sense of fair play wouldnt allow him to drag the young man blindly into the mess they were in his sense of survival prevented him from telling all we had a little visit from the local police jacques managed to drag his gaze away from whitney sambirano thats right asshole jacques proclaimed rather proud of the way the word rolled off his tongue you dont worry about him hes just nosey like an old woman yeah maybe but weve got some people whod like to find us we dont want to be found jacques took a moment to look from one to the other a jealous husband he thought he needed nothing more to trigger his sense of romance we malagasy dont worry about time the sun rises the sun sets you want to leave now we leave now terrific were a little low on supplies no problem you wait here howd you manage to find him whitney asked when jacques went through to the front again hes wonderful sure just because he was making bugeyes at you bugeyes she grinned and sat down on the edge of jacquess bed really douglas wherever do you dig up some of your quaint expressions his eyes nearly fell out of his head yes she brushed a hand through her hair they did didnt they you really eat it up dont you annoyed he paced the small room and wished he could do something anything he could smell trouble and it wasnt as far away as hed have liked you just love it when men drool you werent exactly offended when little marie all but kissed your feet as i recall you strutted around like a rooster with two tails she helped save our skins that was simple gratitude with a touch of simple lust thrown in lust he stopped directly in front of her she couldntve been more than sixteen which made it all the more disgusting yeah well old jacques here must be pushing twenty my my whitney pulled out her emery board and began to repair her chipped nail that sounds distinctly like jealousy shit he paced from one door to the other this is one man who wont drool over you duchess ive got better things to do giving him a half smile whitney continued to file and hum along with elton john a few moments later there was silence when jacques came back in he was carrying a goodsize sack in one hand and his portable stereo in the other with a grin he packed the rest of his tapes now were ready rock and roll wont anyone wonder why you closed up early doug opened the back door a crack and peered out close up then close up now nobody cares nodding doug opened the door for him then lets go his boat was docked less than a quarter mile away and whitney had never seen anything like it it was very long perhaps fifteen feet and no more than three feet wide she thought of a canoe shed once paddled at summer camp in upstate new york this was along the same lines if one stretched it out light on his feet jacques hopped in and began to stow the gear the canoe was traditional malagasy his hat was a new york yankees fielders cap and his feet were bare whitney found him an odd and endearing combination of two worlds nice boat doug murmured wishing he saw an engine somewhere i built her myself in a gesture she found very smooth and very courtly he held out a hand for whitney you can sit here he told her indicating a spot in the center very comfortable thank you jacques when he saw she was settled opposite where he would sit he handed a long pole to doug we pole out here when the waters shallow taking one himself jacques pushed off the boat glided out like a swam on a lake relaxing whitney decided the boat trip had possibilities the scent of the sea feathery leaves dancing in the breeze the gentle movement beneath her then two feet away she saw the ugly leathery head skim the surface ahit was all she could manage yes indeed with a chuckle jacques continued to pole those crocks theyre everywhere you have to watch out for them he made a sound somewhere between a hiss and a roar the round sleepy eyes at the surface came no closer without a word doug reached in his pack dug out the gun and hitched it in his belt again this time whitney made no objection when the water deepened enough for them to use the paddles jacques switched on his stereo vintage beatles blasted out they were on their way jacques paddled tirelessly with a smooth energy and enthusiasm whitney admired through the hour and a half beatle extravaganza he sang along in a clear tenor grinning when whitney joined in with him from the stores jacques had brought aboard they had a late impromptu lunch of coconut meat berries and cold fish when he passed whitney the canteen she drank deeply expecting plain water tilting the canteen down again she swished the liquid around in her mouth it wasnt unpleasant but it wasnt plain water either rano vola jacques told her good for traveling dougs paddle cut through the water smoothly they make it by adding water to rice that sticks to the bottom of the cooking pot whitney swallowed trying to do it graciously i see shifting a bit she passed the canteen down to doug you come from new york too yes whitney popped another berry into her mouth doug tells me your brother goes to college there law school the letters on his tshirt nearly trembled with pride hes going to be a hotshot hes been to bloomingdales whitney practically lives there doug said under his breath ignoring him she spoke to jacques do you plan to go to america next year he told her resting his paddle across his lap i visit my brother were going to do the town times square macys mcdonalds i want you to call me as if she were in a plush eastside restaurant whitney drew a card out of her wallet and handed it to him like its owner the card was smooth classy and slender well have a party party his eyes lit up a new york party visions of glittering dance floors wild colors and wilder music raced in his head absolutely with all the ice cream you can eat dont be cranky douglas you can come too jacques was quiet a moment while his imagination worked out all the fascinations of a party in new york his brother had written about women with dresses that came high above the knee and cars as long as the canoe he rowed there were buildings as high as the mountains to the west once his brother had eaten in the same restaurant as billy joel new york jacques thought awed maybe his new friends knew billy joel and would invite him to the party he fondled whitneys card before tucking it into his pocket you two are he wasnt quite sure of the american term for what he meant not a polite one anyway business partners whitney provided smiling yeah were all business scowling doug cut through the water with his pole jacques mightve been young but he hadnt been born yesterday you have business what kind at the moment were into travel and excavation whitney lifted a brow at dougs terminology in new york im an interior designer dougs a freelancer he finished i work for myself best way jacques agreed while his feet tapped out the beat when i was a boy i worked on a coffee plantation do this do that he shook his head and smiled now i have my own shop i say do this do that but i dont have to listen chuckling whitney stretched her back while the music reminded her of home later the sunset reminded her of the caribbean the forest on either side of the canal had become denser deeper more junglelike reeds grew along the verge thin and brown before they gave way to dense foliage at the sight of her first flamingo all pinkfeathered and fragilelegged she was charmed she saw the iridescent blue flash in the brush and heard the quick repetitive song jacques identified as the coucals once or twice she thought shed caught sight of a fast agile lemur the water becoming shallow enough now and then to require the poles was washed with red and skimmed with insects through the trees to the west the sky was lit up like a forest fire she decided a ride in an outrigger canoe had a lot more allure than punting on the thames though it was just as relaxing except for the occasional crocodile over the quiet dusk and jungle silence jacquess stereo poured out what any selfrespecting dj would have called hit after hit commercialfree she couldve floated for hours wed better camp turning her eyes away from the sunset she smiled at doug hed long before stripped off his shirt his chest gleamed in the dim light with a light sheen of sweat so soon he bit back a retort it wasnt easy to admit that his arms felt like rubber and his palms burned not when young jacques was still bopping with the beat looking as though he could row until midnight without slackening pace itll be dark soon was all he said okay jacquess lean limber muscles rippled as he stroked well find an anumberone campsite he turned his shy smile on whitney you should rest he told her long day on the water mumbling under his breath doug rowed toward shore jacques wouldnt allow her to carry a pack hefting hers and his sack he entrusted her with his stereo single file they walked into the forest where the light was rosecolored touched with mauve birds they couldnt see sang to the darkening sky leaves shimmered green damp with the moisture that was always present now and then jacques would stop and hack at vines and bamboo with a small sickle the scent was rich vegetation water flowers flowers that climbed through vines and burst through bush shed never seen so many colors in one place nor had she expected to insects hovered humming and whining in the twilight on a frantic rustle of leaves a heron rose out of the bush and glided toward the canal the forest was hot wet and close and had all the tastes of the exotic they set up camp to the tune of springsteens born in the usa by the time they had a fire started and coffee heating doug found something to be cheerful about out of jacquess sack came a few small containers of spice two lemons and the rest of the carefully wrapped fish with them he found two packs of marlboros at the moment they meant nothing compared with the other loot at last he held a container that smelled something like sweet basil up to his nose a meal with style he might have been sitting on the ground surrounded by thick vines and insects just beginning to bite but he liked the challenge hed eaten with the best of them in the kitchens and under chandeliers tonight would be no different breaking out the cooking utensils he prepared to enjoy himself dougs quite the gourmand whitney told jacques im afraid weve had to make do with whats been available so far it hasnt been easy for him then she sniffed the air mouth watering she turned to see him sautéing the fish over the fire douglas his name came out on a sultry breath i think im in love yeah eyes intense hands firm he gave the fish an expert flick thats what they all say sugar that night the three of them slept deeply replete with rich food plum wine and rock and roll when the dark sedan pulled into the small seaside town an hour past dawn it drew quite a crowd in charge impatient and out of sorts remo stepped out and brushed through a huddle of children having the instinct of the young and the vulnerable they made way for him with a jerk of his head he signaled the two other men to follow they didnt deliberately try to look out of place if theyd come into town on mules dressed in lambas theyd still have looked like hoods the way theyd lived the way they intended to live badly oozed through their pores the townspeople though inherently wary of strangers were also inherently hospitable still no one approached the three men the island term for taboo was fady remo and company though trim in their crisp summer suits and glossy italian shoes were definitely fady remo spotted the inn and signaling his men to circle the sides of the building approached the front the woman of the inn had on a fresh apron breakfast smells came from the rear though only two tables were occupied she looked at remo sized him up and decided she had no vacancies looking for some people he told her though he didnt expect anyone on that godforsaken island to speak english he simply pulled out the glossies of doug and whitney and waved them under her nose not by a flicker did she show any recognition perhaps theyd left abruptly but thered been twenty dollars american money on the dresser their smiles hadnt reminded her of a lizard she shook her head remo peeled a tendollar bill from the wad he carried the woman simply shrugged and handed him back the photos her grandson had spent an hour the evening before playing with his new pig she preferred his smell to remos cologne look grandma we know they got off here why dont you make this easy on everybody as incentive he peeled back another ten the innkeeper gave him a blank look and another shrug they are not here she said surprising him with her precise english ill just take a look myself remo started for the stairs good morning like doug remo had no trouble recognizing a cop in a onehorse town in madagascar or in an alley in the lower forties i am captain sambirano stiffly proper he offered his hand he admired remos taste in clothes noticed the stillpuffy scar on his cheek and the cool grimness in his eye neither did he miss the healthy wad of bills in his hand perhaps i can be of some assistance he didnt like dealing with cops remo considered them basically unstable in a year he could make approximately three times what the average police lieutenant pulled in for doing the same thing backwards but more he didnt like the thought of going back to dimitri with empty hands im looking for my sister doug had said he had brains remo put them to use she ran off with this guy nothing but a twobit thief the girls infatuated if you know what i mean the captain nodded politely indeed dads worried sick remo improvised he pulled out a thin cuban cigar from a flat gold case offering one he noticed the captains appreciation of the fragrance and the glint of classy metal he knew which approach to take ive managed to track them this far but he let the sentence trail off and tried to look like a concerned brother well do anything to get her back captain anything while he let that sink in remo pulled out the photos the same photos the captain noted silently that the other man had shown him only the day before his story had been that of a father seeking his daughter as well and as well hed offered money my fathers offering a reward to anyone who can help us understand that my sisters my fathers only daughter and the youngest he added for clout he remembered without much affection how pampered his own kid sister had been hes prepared to be generous sambirano looked down at the pictures of whitney and doug the newlyweds whod left town rather abruptly he glanced over at the innkeeper who kept her lips folded in disapproval those eating breakfast understood the look and went back to their meal the captain wasnt impressed by remos story anymore than hed been impressed by dougs the day before whitney beamed up at him she however had impressed him then and now a lovely woman you can imagine how my father feels captain knowing shes with a man like him scum there was enough passion in the word to let the captain know the animosity wasnt feigned if one man found the other one would die it mattered little to him as long as neither died in his town he saw no reason to mention the man in the panama with a similar set of pictures a brother he said slowly as he drew the cigar under his nose is responsible for the welfare of his sister yeah im worried sick about her god knows what hell do when her money runs out or when he just gets tired of her if theres anything you can do i promise to be very grateful captain the captain had chosen law enforcement in the quiet little town because he hadnt much ambition that is he didnt care to sweat in the fields or callous his hands on a fishing boat but he did believe in making a tidy profit he handed remo the photographs i sympathize with your family i have a daughter myself if youll come with me to my office we can discuss this further i believe i can help you dark eyes met dark eyes each recognized the other for what he was each accepted that business was indeed business id appreciate that captain id appreciate that very much as he walked through the door remo touched the scar on his cheek he could almost taste dougs blood dimitri he thought with a flood of relief was going to be very pleased very pleased chapter eleven over her breakfast coffee whitney added jacquess fiftydollar advance and retotaled the list of dougs expenses a treasure hunt she decided had quite an overhead while the others had slept during the night doug beside her in the tent jacques content under the stars whitney had lain awake for some time going over the journey in many ways it had been a lark an exciting somewhat twisted vacation complete with souvenirs and a few exotic meals if they never found the treasure she wouldve written it off just that way except for the memory of a young waiter whod died only because hed been there some people are born with a certain comfortable naiveté that never leaves them mainly because their lives remain comfortable money can provoke cynicism or cushion it perhaps her wealth had sheltered her to some extent but whitney had never been naive she counted her change not because she had to worry about pennies but because she expected value for value she accepted compliments with grace and a grain of salt and she knew to some life was cheap death could be a means to an end something accomplished for revenge for amusement or for a fee the fee might vary the life of a statesman was certainly worth more on the open market than the life of a ghetto drug dealer one might be worth no more than the price of a syringe full of heroin the other hundreds of thousands of cool clean swiss francs a business some had taken the exchange of life for gain to the height and routine of a brokerage firm shed known it before considered it the way one considered many of the daily social ills aloofly but now shed dealt with it personally an innocent man had died and she might very well have killed a man herself there was no telling how many other lives had been lost or bought and sold in the quest for this particular pot of gold dollars and cents she mused as she looked down at her neat columns and totals on the notepad but it had become much more than that perhaps like many of the carelessly wealthy shed often skimmed over the surface of life without seeing the eddies and currents the less fortunate had to pit themselves against perhaps shed always taken such things as food and shelter for granted until the last few weeks and perhaps whitneys own personal view of right and wrong often depended on circumstances and her own whims but she had a strong sense of good and bad doug lord might be a thief and in his life he mightve done innumerable things that were wrong by societys standards she didnt give a hang about societys standards he was shed come to believe intrinsically good just as she believed dimitri was intrinsically bad she believed it not naively but completely with all the healthy intelligence and instinct shed been born with shed done something more while the others had slept restless whitney had finally decided to glance through the books doug had taken from the washington library to pass the time shed told herself as she flicked on a flashlight and located the books as shed begun to read about the jewels the gems lost over the centuries shed become caught up the illustrations hadnt particularly moved her diamonds and rubies meant more in three dimensions but theyd made her think reading through the history of this necklace that diamond shed understood personally that what men and women craved for adornment others had died for greed desire lust they were things whitney could understand but passions she felt too shallow to die for but what of loyalty whitney had gone back over the words shed read in magdalines letter shed spoken of her husbands grief over the queens death but more his obligation to her how much had the man gerald sacrificed for loyalty and what had he kept in a wooden box the jewels had he kept his heritage in a wooden box and mourned a way of life that could never be his again was it money was it art was it history as shed closed the book she had been left uncertain whitney had respected lady smythewright though shed never quite comprehended her fervor now she was dead for little more than having a belief that history whether it was written in dusty volumes or glittered and shone belonged to everyone antoinette had lost her life along with hundreds of others with rough justice on the guillotine people had been driven from their homes hunted and slaughtered others had starved in the streets for an ideal no whitney doubted people often died for ideals any more than they truly fought for them theyd died because theyd been caught up in something that had swept over them and carried them along whether they wanted to go or not what would a handful of jewels have meant to a woman walking up the steps to the guillotine it made a treasure hunt seem foolish unless unless it had a moral maybe it was time whitney discovered her own because of this and because of a young waiter named juan whitney was determined to find the treasure and to kick dust in dimitris face when she did she faced the morning confidently no she wasnt naive still whitney held to the basic belief that good would ultimately outdo bad especially if good was very clever what the hellre you going to do when the batteries on that thing run down whitney smiled up at doug before she slipped the thin handheld calculator and her notepad back in her bag she wondered what he would think if he knew shed spent several hours during the night analyzing him and what they were doing duracell she said sweetly would you like some coffee yeah he sat down a bit leery of the way she poured and served so cheerfully she looked exquisite hed figured a few days on the road would leave her a bit haggard a little rough around the edges he scraped his palm over the stubble on his own chin instead she looked radiant her pale angelblonde hair shone as it rippled down her back the sun had warmed her skin bringing up touches of rose that only accented its flawlessness and the classic line of bone no she looked anything but haggard at the moment doug accepted the coffee and drank deeply this is a lovely spot whitney said bringing up her knees and circling them with her arms he glanced around moisture dripped from leaves in quiet plipplops the ground was damp and spongy he slapped at a mosquito and wondered how long the repellent would hold out the mist rose off the ground in little fingers like steam in a turkish bath if you like saunas whitney cocked a brow woken up on the wrong side of the bedroll didnt we he only grunted hed woken up itchy as any healthy man would after spending the night next to a healthy woman without having the luxury of taking things to their natural conclusion look at it this way douglas if there were an acre of this in manhattan people would be scrambling for it piling in on top of each other she lifted her hands palms up birdsong burst out in an ecstasy of sound a chameleon crawled onto a dull gray rock and slowly faded into it flowers seemed to pour out of the ground and the green green of leaves and ferns still damp with dew gave everything a lushness weve got it all to ourselves he poured a second cup of coffee i figured a woman like you would prefer crowds a time and place douglas she murmured a time and place then she smiled so simply so exquisitely he felt his heart stop i like being here with you the coffee had scalded his tongue but he didnt notice he swallowed it still staring at her hed never had any problem with women pouring on the roughedged cocky charm that hed learned very young they found appealing now when he couldve used a surplus of what came so handily to him he couldnt find any at all oh yeah he managed amused that he could be thrown off so easily she nodded yeah ive given it some thought leaning over she kissed him very very lightly just what do you think of that he might stumble but years of experience had taught him how to land on his feet reaching out he gathered her hair in his hand well maybe we should he nipped at her lip discuss it she liked the way he kissed without quite kissing the way he held her without really holding her she remembered what it had been like when hed done both thoroughly perhaps we should their lips did no more than tease each others eyes open they nibbled testing tempting they didnt touch each was used to leading to being in control to lose the edge that was the primary mistake in matters of love and money to both of them as long as the reins were held even loosely then neither of them felt they would go where they didnt lead lips warmed thoughts clouded priorities shifted his hand tightened on her hair hers gripped his shirtfront in that rare instant that moves timelessly they were caught close need became the leader and desire the map each surrendered without hesitation or regret beyond the thick moist leaves came a bright bubbling blast of cyndi lauper like children caught with their fingers deep in the cookie jar whitney and doug sprang apart jacquess clear tenor echoed with cyndis cheery voice both of them cleared their throats companys coming doug commented and reached for a cigarette yes rising whitney brushed at the seat of her thin baggy slacks they were a bit damp with dew but the heat was already drying the ground she watched sunbeams slash through the tops of cypress as i said a spot like this seems to draw people well i think ill she trailed off in surprise when his hand circled her ankle whitney his eyes were intense as they became when least expected his fingers were very firm one day were going to finish this she wasnt used to being told what shed do and saw no reason to begin now she sent him a long neutral look perhaps absolutely the neutral look became a hint of a smile douglas youre going to find out i can be very contrary youre going to find out i take what i want he said it softly and her smile faded its my profession man oh man we got ourselves some coconuts coming through the bush jacques shook the net bag he carried whitney laughed when he pulled one out and tossed it to her anyone got a corkscrew no problem making use of a rock jacques slammed the coconut against it sharply the chameleon scrambled away without a sound with a grin he broke the fruit apart and handed the two pieces to whitney how clever a little rum and you could have pina coladas brow arched she handed a half to doug dont be testy darling im sure you couldve climbed up a palm tree too grinning jacques carved out a piece of the meat with a small knife its fady to eat anything white on wednesdays he said with a simplicity that caused whitney to study him more carefully he popped the coconut into his mouth with a kind of guilty relish its worse not to eat at all she looked at the fielders cap the tshirt and the portable radio it was difficult for her to remember that he was malagasy and part of an ancient tribe with louis of the merina it had been easy hed looked the part jacques looked like someone shed pass crossing broadway and fortysecond are you superstitious jacques he moved his shoulders i apologize to the gods and spirits keep them happy reaching in his front pocket he drew out what looked like a small shell on a chain an ody doug explained both amused and tolerant he didnt believe in talismans but in making your own luck or cashing in on someone elses its like an amulet whitney studied it intrigued by the contrasts between jacquess americanized dress and speech and his deepseated belief in taboos and spirits for luck she asked him for safety the gods have bad moods he rubbed the shell between his fingers then offered it to whitney you carry it today all right she slipped the chain over her neck after all she thought it wasnt so odd her father carried a rabbits foot that had been tinted baby blue the amulet fell along the same lines or perhaps more along the lines of a st christophers medal for safety you two can carry on the cultural exchange later lets get moving as he rose doug tossed the fruit back to jacques whitney winked at jacques i told you he was often rude no problem jacques said again then reached into his back pocket where hed carefully secured the stem of a flower pulling it out he offered it to whitney an orchid it was white pure spectacular white and so delicate it seemed as though it would dissolve in her palm jacques its exquisite she touched it to her cheek before she threaded the stem through the hair above her ear thank you when she kissed him she heard the audible click of his swallow looks nice he began to gather gear quickly lots of flowers here in madagascar any flower you want you find it here still chattering he began to cart gear to the canoe you wanted a flower doug muttered all you had to do was bend over and yank one up whitney touched the petals above her ear some men understand sweetness she commented and other dont picking up her pack she followed jacques sweetness doug grumbled as he struggled with the rest of the gear ive got a pack of wolves after me and she wants sweetness still muttering he kicked out the campfire i couldve picked her a damn flower a dozen of them he glanced over his shoulder at the sound of whitneys laughter oh jacques its exquisite he mimicked with a snort of disgust doug checked the safety on his gun before he secured it in his belt and i can open a goddamn coconut too he gave the fire one last kick before hefting the remaining gear and starting toward the canoe when remo nudged one expensively shod toe into the campfire it was no more than a pile of cold ash the sun was straight up and streaming there was no relief from the heat in the shade hed removed his suit jacket and tie something hed never have done in front of dimitri during working hours his oncecrisp arrow shirt was limp with sweat tracking lord was becoming a pain in the ass looks like they spent the night here weis a tall bankerishlooking man whod had his nose broken by a whiskey bottle swiped sweat from his forehead he had a line of insect bites on his neck that constantly plagued him i guess were about four hours behind them whatre you part apache giving the fire a last violent kick remo turned his gaze rested on barns whose round moon face was creased in smiles whatre you grinning at you little asshole but barns hadnt stopped grinning since remo had told him to take care of the malagasy captain he knew barns had but even a man of remos experience didnt want to hear the details it was common knowledge that dimitri had an affection for barns the way one had an affection for a halfwitted dog who dropped mutilated chickens and small mangled rodents at your feet he also knew that dimitri often let barns take care of employees on their way out dimitri didnt believe in unemployment benefits lets go he said briefly well have them before sundown whitney had herself nestled comfortably between the packs lengthening shadows from cypress and eucalyptus fell on the dunes alongside the canal and on the thick brush on the opposing side thin brown reeds waved in the current from time to time a startled egret folded in its legs and lifted off into the brush with a whoosh of wings and rush flowers poked out profuse in places red orange and melting yellow orchids grew as haphazardly as poppies in a meadow butterflies sometimes alone sometimes in troups swooped and fluttered around the petals their color was a blaze against vegetation and the dung brown of the canal here and there crocodiles stretched on sloping banks and took in the sun most barely turned a head as the canoe rowed by the fragrance lifting over the scent of the river was lazily rich with the brim of jacquess cap shielding her eyes she lay crossways in the canoe her feet resting on the edge the long fishing pole jacques had fashioned rested loosely in her hands as she half dozed she decided shed discovered just what huck finn had found so appealing about floating down the mississippi a good deal of it was bone laziness and the rest was wideeyed adventure it was whitney reflected a delightful combination and just what do you plan to do if a fish reaches up and bites on that bent safety pin taking her time whitney stretched her shoulders why id drop him right in your lap douglas im sure youd know exactly what to do with a fish you cook em up good jacques paddled with the long steady strokes that wouldve made a yale alumnuss heart patter with pride tina turner helped him keep the rhythm my cooking he shook his head pretty bad when i get married i have to make sure my wife cooks good like my mama whitney made a snorting sound from under the cap a fly landed on her knee but it was too much effort to brush it aside another man whose hearts in his stomach look the kids got a point eatings important to you its more like a religion do it with the proper tradition and respect or not at all she shifted the brim of her cap so that she could see jacques more clearly young she thought with a goodhumored goodlooking face and wellmuscled body she didnt think hed have any trouble attracting the girls so youre putting your stomach on the same level with your heart what happens if you fall for a girl who cant cook jacques considered this he was only twenty and answers were as easy and basic as life the smile he gave her was young innocent and cocky enough to make her chuckle id take her to my mother so she could learn very sensible doug agreed he broke rhythm to pop a piece of coconut into his mouth i dont suppose you ever considered learning to cook whitney watched jacques mull this over while his lean strong arms worked the paddles smiling at him she ran a finger over the shell that nestled just above her breasts a malagasy wife cooks the meals in between the times she takes care of the house the children and tills the fields i imagine whitney put in jacques nodded and grinned but she takes care of the money too whitney felt the lump of her wallet in her back pocket thats very sensible she agreed smiling at doug he had the envelope secure in his own pocket i thought youd like that again its a simple matter of people doing what theyre best suited for she started to settle back again when her line jerked with her eyes wide she sat straight up oh god i think ive got one one what a fish gripping the pole fiercely she watched the line bob a fish she said again a big goddamn fish a grin split dougs face as he saw the improvised fishing line grow taut sonofabitch now take it easy he advised as she scrambled to her knees and rocked the boat dont lose it thats tonights main course im not going to lose it she said between gritted teeth and she wouldnt but she didnt have any idea what to do next after another moment of struggle she turned to jacques what now pull him up easy its a big bastard drawing his paddle into the canoe he went to her with light movements that kept the boat steady yessirree we eat tonight hes going to fight he rested a hand on her shoulder while he looked over the side hes thinking about the frying pan come on sugar you can do it doug left the oars behind to creep to the center and root just bring im up and hed fillet him sauté him and serve him on a bed of fluffy rice giddy excited determined whitney caught her tongue between her teeth if either man had offered to take the pole from her shed have snarled using arm muscles she only remembered during an occasional brief set of tennis she brought the fish out of the water wiggling on the end of the line he caught the glint of the late afternoon sun it was only a simple trout flopping frantically but for a moment he looked regal a flash of silver caught against the deepening blue of the sky whitney gave out a war whoop and fell back on her rump dont drop him now she wont reaching out jacques caught the line between his thumb and fingers drawing it gently in the fish waved back and forth like a flag in a breeze shes caught herself one big fat fish in a quick move he drew out the hook and held up the catch how about that some luck he grinned fish in hand while tina turner gritted out a tune from the tape player behind him it happened so fast still as long as she lived whitney would remember the instant as though it had been captured frame by frame on film one moment jacques was standing glistening with healthy sweat and triumph her laughter was still hanging on the air the next he was tumbling into the water the explosion never even registered in her mind jacques dazed she scrambled to her knees down doug had her pinned beneath him so that her breath came in gasps he held her down while the boat rocked and he prayed they wouldnt capsize doug lie still understand but he wasnt looking at her though his head was only inches above hers he scanned the shore on either side of the canal the brush was thick enough to hide an army where the hell were they keeping his movements slow he reached for the gun in his belt when whitney saw it she shifted her head to look for jacques did he fall i thought i heard a when she saw the answer in dougs eyes she arched like a bow no she struggled nearly knocking the gun from dougs hand as she tried to get up jacques oh god stay down he gave the order between his teeth as he locked his legs around hers theres nothing you can do for him now when she continued to fight he dug his fingers in hard enough to bruise her hes dead dammit dead before he hit the water her eyes were wide swimming as she stared up at him without a word she closed them and lay still if he felt guilt if he felt grief hed deal with them later now it was back to the first priority staying alive he could hear nothing but the gentle lap of water as the boat drifted in the current they could be on either side that he knew what he didnt know was why they hadnt simply riddled the canoe with bullets the thin outer skin would be no protection they had orders to take them alive doug glanced down at whitney she remained still and passive eyes shut or to take one of them alive he realized dimitri would be curious about a woman like whitney macallister hed know everything there was to know about her by now no he wouldnt want her dead hed want to entertain her for a time be entertained by her then ransom her back they wouldnt shoot at the canoe but simply wait them out the first order of business was to find out where they were waiting doug could already feel the sweat pooling between his shoulder blades that you remo he shouted youre still using too much of that fancy cologne i can smell you out here he waited a moment straining to hear any sound dimitri know ive had you running around in circles youre the one whos running lord on the left he didnt know how he was going to do it yet but he knew theyd have to get to the opposite shore yeah maybe im slowing down checking off different angles doug kept talking the birds that had fled skyward screaming at the sound of the shot were calm again a few had resumed their lazy chatter he saw that whitney had opened her eyes again but she wasnt moving maybe its time we talked deal you and me remo with what i got you could fill a swimming pool with that french cologne ever think about branching out on your own remo you got brains arent you getting tired of taking orders and doing somebody elses dirty work you want to talk lord paddle over well have a nice little business meeting paddle over and youll put a bullet in my brain remo come on lets not insult each others intelligence maybe just maybe he could angle one of the poles in the water and guide the boat if he could wait until dusk they might have a chance youre the one who wants to deal lord what do you have in mind i got the papers remo gently he tugged open his pack he also had a box of bullets and i got me a classy lady theyre both worth a hell of a lot more money than youve ever seen he shot whitney a look she was staring at him pale and dryeyed dimitri tell you i got me a heiress remo macallister you know macallisters ice cream best goddamn fudge ripple in the states you know how many million they made off fudge ripple alone remo you know how much her old mand pay to get her back in one piece he slid the box of bullets into his pocket while whitney watched play along with me sugar he told her as he checked to see that his gun was fully loaded we both might get out breathing im going to give him a list of your attributes when i do i want you to start swearing at me rock the boat kick up a scene while youre doing it grab that pole okay expressionless she nodded there aint much meat on her but she really warms up the sheets remo and she aint too particular about who she warms them up with know what i mean i got no problem sharing the wealth you rotten sonofabitch with a screech that wouldve done a fishwife proud whitney reared up he hadnt meant for her to put herself in range and grabbed for her wound up she swung at his hand and knocked it away youve absolutely no style she shouted standing straight absolutely no class id as soon sleep with a slug as let you into my bed in the lowering light she was magnificent passionate hair streaming behind her eyes dark he didnt have any doubt that remos attention was fixed on her grab the pole and dont get so damn personal he muttered you think you can talk to me that way you worm snatching up the pole whitney raised it over her head good good now he trailed off when he saw the expression on her face hed seen vengeance in a womans eyes before automatically he lifted a hand hey wait a minute he began as the pole smashed down he rolled aside in time to see weis come tumbling into their boat from a small dark raft theyd have capsized then if whitney hadnt lost her balance and fallen half over the opposite end righting their boat again jesus get down but the warning ended on a whoosh of air as he started to struggle with weis whitneys blow had caught the big man on the shoulder knocking his gun aside but annoying him more than harming him and he remembered the sensation of having his nose shatter whitney lifted the pole again and would have brought it down but doug rolled on top of him the boat swayed taking in water she saw jacquess body floating on the surface of the canal before she froze her heart to fight for her life for gods sake give me a clear shot she shouted then tumbled backward when the boat rocked violently on shore remo pushed barns aside lords mine you little bastard remember it taking out his gun he focused and waited it looked like a game whitney thought as she shook her head to clear it two overgrown boys wrestling in a boat any moment one might cry uncle then theyd brush themselves off and go on to other amusements she tried to stand again but nearly tipped over the side she could see the gun still in dougs hand but the other man outweighed him by at least fifty pounds balancing herself on her knees she gripped the pole again damn it doug how can i smash him if youre laying on top of him move sure panting doug managed to pry weiss hand from around his throat just give me a minute then his head jerked back as weis caught him on the jaw doug tasted blood you broke my fucking nose weis said as he dragged doug to his feet was that you they stood legs braced as weis began slowly to turn dougs gun hand so that the barrel pointed at his face yeah and im going to blow yours off look dont take it so personally planting his feet doug was certain he felt something rip inside his left shoulder it was something to think about later when the barrel of a gun wasnt staring him in the face sweat ran from him as he fought to keep weiss finger from slipping over the trigger he saw the smile and cursed that it was the last thing hed ever see abruptly weiss eyes widened and air whooshed out of his mouth as whitney shoved the pole smartly into his stomach gripping doug for balance weis shifted in the next instant his body jerked hed become dougs shield at the instant remo had fired from shore with a look of surprise he fell like a stone against the side of the canoe the next thing whitney knew she was swallowing water on the first panic she surfaced choking and thrashing grab the packs doug shouted shoving them at her as he treaded beside the overturned canoe two bullets struck the water inches from his head holy shit he saw the jaws of the first crock open and close over weiss torso and he heard the sickening sound of ripping flesh and breaking bone making one frantic grab he locked his fingers over the strap of one pack the other floated just out of range go he shouted again just go get to shore she too saw what remained of weis and struck out blindly a dull red mist floated over the brown river water what she didnt see until it was nearly on top of them was the second crock doug he turned in time to see jaws open he fired five shots point blank before they closed again and sunk in a pool of red there were more doug fumbled for the box of bullets knowing hed never get them all in a desperate move he propelled himself between whitney and an oncoming crock lifting the gun butt first he waited for the impact the pain he was braced lips pulled back in a snarl the top of the crocks head exploded when he was less than an arms length away before doug could react three more crocks went under tails swishing blood swirled around him the shots hadnt come from remo even as doug turned toward shore he knew it theyd come from farther south either they had a fairy godmother or someone else was on their trail he caught a movement and a glimpse of a white panama when he saw whitney just behind him he didnt stop to think about it go dammit he grabbed her arm and pulled her toward the bank whitney didnt look back but simply forced her legs to kick her through the water to shore doug half dragged her over the wet reeds on the edge of the canal and into the bush panting aching he propped himself on the trunk of a tree ive still got the papers you sonofabitch he shouted across the canal ive still got them why dont you take a little swim across the canal and try to take them from me for a moment he closed his eyes and just worked on getting his breath back he could hear whitney heaving up canal water beside him you tell dimitri ive got them and you tell him i owe him one he wiped the blood from his mouth then spat you got that remo you tell him i owe him and by god im not finished yet wincing he rubbed the shoulder hed wrenched during the struggle with weis his clothes were plastered to him wet bloody and stinking with mud a few yards away in the canal crocodiles were in a frenzy of feeding the gun was still in his hand empty deliberately doug took out the box of bullets and reloaded okay whitney lets she was curled into a ball beside him her head on her knees though she made absolutely no sound he knew she was weeping at a loss he ran a hand through his dripping hair hey whitney dont she didnt move she didnt speak doug looked down at the gun in his hand violently he shoved it back in his belt come on honey weve got to move he started to put his arms around her but she jerked back though tears ran freely down her face her eyes burned when she looked at him dont touch me youve got to move lord thats what youre made for moving running why dont you just take that allimportant envelope and get lost here reaching in her pocket she struggled to pull her wallet out of her clinging slacks she threw it at him take this too its all you care about all you think about money she didnt bother to wipe at the tears but watched him through them theres not much cash in there only a few hundred but theres plenty of plastic take it all it was what hed wanted all along wasnt it the money the treasure and no partner he was closer than ever and alone hed get there faster and have the whole pot to himself it was what hed wanted all along doug dropped the wallet back in her lap and took her hand lets move im not going with you you go after your pot of gold alone douglas nausea heaved in her stomach rising in her throat she swallowed it down see if you can live with it now im not leaving you here alone why not she tossed back you left jacques back there she looked over toward the river and the shaking started you left him leave me whats the difference he grabbed her shoulders hard enough to make her wince he was dead there was nothing we could do we killed him that thought had already rammed into him perhaps because of it he gripped her harder no i got enough baggage to carry around without that dimitri killed him the same way hed swat a fly off the wall because it doesnt mean any more to him than that he killed him without even knowing his name because killing doesnt make him sweat it doesnt make him sick it doesnt even make him wonder when its going to be his turn do you he went very still a moment while water dripped from his hair yeah dammit i do he was so young her breath hitched as she grabbed his shirt all he wanted was to go to new york hell never get there more tears spilled over but this time she began to sob with them hell never get anywhere and all because of that envelope how many people have died for it now she felt the shell jacquess ody for safety for luck for tradition whitney wept until she ached from it but the pain didnt cleanse he died because of those papers and he didnt even know they existed were going to follow this thing through doug told her as he pulled her closer and were going to win why the hell does it matter so much you want reasons he drew her back so that his face was inches from hers his eyes were hard his breath fast therere plenty of them because peopleve died for it because dimitri wants it were going to win whitney because were not going to let dimitri beat us because that kids dead and hes not going to have died for nothing its not just the money now shit its never just the money dont you see its the winning its always the winning and making dimitri sweat because we did she let doug draw her into his arms cradle her there the winning once you dont care about winning youre already dead that she understood because the need was in her as well therell be no fadamihana for jacques she murmured no festival for him well give him one he stroked her hair remembering the way jacques had looked when hed held the fish a real new york party she nodded turning her face into his throat a moment dimitri isnt going to get away with this doug not with this were going to beat him yeah were going to beat him drawing her away he rose theyd lost his pack in the canal so theyd lost the tent and cooking utensils hefting hers doug secured it to his back they were wet tired and still grieving he held out his hand get your ass in gear sugar wearily she stood and tucked the wallet back in her pocket she sniffed inelegantly up yours lord they walked north in the lowering evening light chapter twelve they had eluded remo but they knew he was hot on their heels and so they did not stop they walked as the sun set and the forest took on lights only artists and poets fully understand in twilight when the air turned pearly gray with mist as the dew fell they walked still the sky darkened went black before the moon rose a majestic ball white as bone stars glittered like jewels of another age moonlight turned the forest into a fairy tale shadows lowered and shifted flowers closed their petals and slept as animals that knew only night stirred there was a flutter of wings a thrash of leaves and something screamed in the bush they walked when whitney wanted to drop into a ball of mindless exhaustion she thought of jacques gritting her teeth she went on tell me about dimitri doug paused only long enough to pull the compass out of his pocket to check their direction he saw her fingering the shell as she had off and on during the hike but hed run dry of comforting words i already did not enough tell me more he recognized the tone of voice she wanted revenge and revenge doug knew was a dangerous ambition it could blind you to priorities like staying healthy just take my word for it you dont want a personal acquaintance but youre wrong though breathless her voice was soft and firm she wiped sweat from her forehead with the back of her hand tell me about our mr dimitri hed lost track of the miles theyd covered even the hours he was only sure of two things they had put distance between themselves and remo and they needed to rest well camp here we should be deep enough in the haystack haystack she sank down gratefully on the soft springy ground if itd been possible her legs wouldve wept with relief were the needle this is the haystack got anything in here we can use whitney pulled makeup out of her pack lacy underwear clothes already rent filthy or ruined and what was left of the bag of fruit shed bought in antananarivo a couple of mangoes and a very ripe banana think of it as a portable waldorf salad doug advised as he plucked up one of the mangoes all right whitney followed suit and stretched out her legs dimitri douglas tell me hed hoped to set her mind on some other scene he shouldve known better jabba the hutt in an italian suit he said as he bit into the fruit dimitri could make nero look like a choirboy he likes poetry and porno flicks eclectic taste yeah he collects antiques specializes in torture instruments you know thumbscrews whitney felt the little pulse in her right thumb throb fascinating sure dimitris a real fascination he has an affection for soft pretty things both of his wives were stunners he gave her a long level look hed like your style she tried not to shudder so hes married married twice doug explained and tragically widowed twice if you catch the drift she did and bit into the fruit thoughtfully what makes him so successful she decided for lack of a better term brains and a streak of icecold mean ive heard he can quote chaucer while hes sticking pins between your toes she lost her appetite for the fruit is that his style poetry and torture he doesnt simply kill he executes and he executes with ceremony he keeps a firstclass studio where he tapes his victims before during and after oh god she studied dougs face wanting to believe he was weaving a tale youre not making that up i aint got that much imagination his mother was a schoolteacher i hear with a few wires crossed juice dribbled down his chin and he wiped at it absently story goes that when he couldnt recite some poem byron or somebody i think she hacked off his pinky she whitney choked then forced herself to swallow his mother cut off his finger because he couldnt recite thats the story on the streets seems she was religious and got her poetry and theology a little mixed figured if the kid couldnt quote byron he was being sacrilegious for the moment she forgot the horror and death dimitri had been responsible for she thought of a young boy thats horrible she shouldve been taken away he wanted her to shy away from revenge but he didnt want to replace it with pity one was as dangerous as the other dimitri saw to that too when he left home to start his own business he went out in a blaze he torched the whole damn apartment building where his mother lived he killed his own mother he got her and twenty or thirty other people he didnt have anything against them you understand they just happened to be there at the time revenge amusement or gain she murmured remembering her earlier thoughts on killing that about sums it up if theres such a thing as a soul whitney dimitris is black with boils running on it if theres such a thing as a soul she repeated were going to help his into hell he didnt laugh shed said it too quietly he studied her face pale and tired in the bright moonlight she meant what she said he was already indirectly responsible for the death of two innocents in that moment he took responsibility for whitney another first for doug lord sugar he shifted so that he sat next to her the first thing we have to do is stay alive the second is to get to the treasure thats all we have to do to make dimitri pay its not enough youre new at this listen you get in a kick when you can then you back off thats the way to stay in business she wasnt listening uncomfortable doug came to a decision maybe its time you got a look at the papers he didnt have to see her face to know she was surprised he could feel it in the way her shoulder moved against him well well she said softly break out the champagne get smart and i might change my mind relieved by her grin he reached in his pocket reverently he held the envelope this is the key he said the goddamn key and im using it to get through the lock ive never been able to pick drawing out papers one by one doug smoothed them mostly in french like the letter he murmured but someone already translated a good bit he hesitated another moment then handed her a yellowed sheet enclosed in clear plastic look at the signature whitney took it skimming down the text my god yeah let em eat cake looks like she sent this message a few days before she was taken prisoner the translations here but whitney was already reading the leader written in the tragic queens own hand leopold has failed me she murmured leopold ii holy roman emperor and maries brother she lifted her gaze to dougs youve done your homework i like to know the facts on any job ive been boning up on the french revolution marie was playing politics and struggling to secure her position she didnt pull it off by the time she wrote that she knew she was almost finished with only a nod whitney went back to the letter he is more emperor than brother without his help i have few to turn to i cannot tell you my dear valet of the humiliation of our forced return from varennes my husband the king disguised as a common servant and myself it is too shameful to be arrested arrested and returned to paris like criminals with armed soldiers the silence was like death even though we breathed it was a funeral procession the assembly has said that the king had been kidnapped and has already revised the constitution this ploy was the beginning of the end the king has believed that leopold and the prussian king would intervene he communicated to his agent le tonnelier that things would be the better for it a foreign war gerald should have extinguished the fires of this civil unrest the girondist bourgeoisie has proved incapable and they fear the people who follow robespierre the devil you understand that though war was declared on austria our expectations were not met the military defeats of the past spring have demonstrated the girondins do not comprehend how it is to conduct a war now there is talk of a trial your king on trial and i fear for his life i fear my trusted gerald for all our lives now i must beg your help depend on your loyalty and friendship i am not able to flee so i must wait and trust i beg you gerald to receive that which my messenger brings you guard it your love and loyalty i must depend upon now that everything is crumbling around me i have been betrayed time and time again but it is sometimes possible to turn the betrayal into advantage this small portion of what is mine as queen i entrust to you it perhaps will be needed to pay for the lives of my children even if the bourgeois are successful they too will fall take what is mine gerald lebrun and guard it for my children and theirs the time will come when we again take our rightful place you must wait for it whitney looked down at the words written by a stubborn woman who had plotted and maneuvered herself to her own death but still shed been a woman a mother a queen she had only a few months to live whitney murmured i wonder if she knew and it occurred to her that the letter itself belonged safely behind glass in some tidy corner of the smithsonian thats what lady smythewright would have felt thats why shed been foolish enough to give it and the rest to whitaker now they were both dead doug do you have any idea just how valuable this is thats just what were going to find out sugar he muttered stop thinking in dollar signs i mean culturally historically yeah im going to buy a boatload of culture contrary to popular belief one cant buy culture doug this belongs in a museum after ive got the treasure ill donate every sheet im going to be needing some tax writeoffs whitney shook her head and shrugged first things first she decided what else is there pages from a journal looks like it was written by this geralds daughter hed read the translated parts and they were grim without a word he handed a page to whitney it was dated october and in the young hand and simple words were a black fear and a confusion that was ageless the writer had seen her queen executed she appeared pale and plain and so old they brought her in a cart through the streets like a drab she revealed no fear as she mounted the steps maman has said she was a queen to the end people crowded around and merchants sold wares as though at a fair it smelled like animals and flies came in clouds i have seen other people pulled in carts through the streets like sheep mademoiselle fontainebleu was among them last winter she ate cakes with maman in the salon when the blade descended on the queens neck people cheered papa wept never have i seen him weep before and i could only stand holding his hand seeing his tears i was afraid more afraid than when i saw the carts or watched the queen if papa wept what would happen to us that same night we left paris i think perhaps i will never see it again or my pretty room that looks over the garden mamans beautiful necklace of gold and sapphire has been sold papa tells us we will go on a long journey and must be brave whitney turned to another sheet dated three months later i have been sick unto death the boat sways and rocks and stinks from the filth of the wretched belowdecks papa also has been ill for a time we feared he would die and we would be alone maman prays and sometimes when he is feverish i remain and hold his hand it seems so long ago that we were happy maman grows thin and papas beautiful hair more gray every day while he lay in his bed he had me bring to him a little wooden chest it appeared plain as one in which a peasant girl might hide her trinkets he told us that the queen had sent it to him enlisting his trust one day we would return to france and release the contents to the new king in her name i was tired and ill and wished to lie down but papa made both maman and me swear we would bide by his oath when we had sworn he opened the box i have seen the queen wear such things with her hair piled high and her face glowing with laughter in the simple box the emerald necklace i had seen once upon her breasts seemed to catch the light of the candles and throw it upon the other jewels there was a ruby ring with diamonds like a starburst and a bracelet of emeralds to match the necklace there were stones yet to be set but as i looked my eyes were dazzled i saw a diamond necklace more beautiful than all the rest it was set in tiers but each stone some bigger than i have ever seen seemed alive of its own i remembered maman speaking of the scandal of cardinal de rohan and the necklace of diamonds papa had told me the cardinal had been tricked the queen used and that the necklace itself had disappeared still i wondered as i looked into the box if the queen had contrived to find it whitney set the paper down but her hands werent steady the diamond necklace was supposed to have been broken up and sold supposed doug repeated but the cardinal was banished and the comtesse de la motte was caught tried and sentenced she escaped to england but ive never read anything that proved she had the necklace no whitney studied the page of the journal the paper itself wouldve made any museum curator worth his salt drool as for the treasure that necklace was one of the catalysts for the revolution it was worth a pretty penny then doug handed her another page care to estimate what it might be worth today priceless whitney thought but knew he wouldnt understand her meaning the sheet hed given her listed in detailed inventory what the queen had entrusted to gerald jewels were described and valued as with the pictures in the book whitney found them unexciting still one shone out among the rest a diamond necklace valued at more than a million livres doug would understand that whitney mused then set the paper aside and took up the journal again more months had passed and gerald and his family were settled on the northeast coast of madagascar the young girl wrote of long harsh days i yearn for france for paris for my room and the gardens maman says we must not complain and sometimes goes with me for walks along the shore those are the best times with the birds flying and shells to find maman looks happy then but sometimes she looks out to sea and i know she too longs for paris winds blow in from the sea and ships come news from home is of death the terror rules the merchants say that there are thousands of prisoners and many have faced the guillotine others have been hung even burned they talk of the committee of public safety papa says that paris is unsafe because of them if one mentions the name of robespierre he will not speak at all so while i long for france i begin to understand that the home i knew is gone forever papa works hard he has opened a store and trades with other settlers maman and i have a garden but we grow only vegetables flies plague us we have no servants and must fend for ourselves i regard it as an adventure but maman tires easily now she is with child i look forward to the baby coming and wonder when i will have my own at night we sew though we have few coins for extra candles papa is constructing a cradle we do not speak of the little box hidden under the floor in the kitchen whitney set the page aside how old was she i wonder fifteen he touched another paper sealed in plastic her record of birth her parents marriage lines he handed it to whitney and death certificates she died when she was sixteen he picked up a last page this gives us the rest of it to my son whitney began and glanced up at doug you sleep in the cradle i made you wearing the little blue gown your mother and sister sewed they are departed now your mother giving you life your sister from a fever striking so quickly there was no time for a doctor i have discovered your sisters journal and read it wept over it one day when you are older it too will be yours i have done what i thought i must for my country my queen my family i have saved them from the terror only to lose them in this strange foreign place i have not the will to continue the sisters will care for you as i cannot i can give to you only these pieces of your family the words of your sister your mothers love with them i add the responsibility i took for our queen a letter will be left with the sisters instructions for passing you this package when you are of age you inherit my responsibility and my oath to the queen though it will be buried with me you will again take it up and fight for the cause when the time is right come to where i rest and find marie i pray you do not fail as i have done he killed himself whitney set the letter down with a sigh hed lost his home his family and his heart she could see them french aristocrats displaced by politics and social unrest floundering in a strange country struggling to adjust to a new life and gerald living and dying by his promise to a queen what happened as best i can make out the baby was taken into a convent he shifted through more papers he was adopted and immigrated with his family to england it looks like the papers were stored away and just forgotten until lady smythewright unearthed them and the queens box buried doug said with a faraway look in his eye in a cemetery in diegosuarez all we have to do is find it and then then we take a stroll on easy street whitney looked down at the papers in her lap there were lives scattered there dreams hopes and loyalty is that all isnt it enough this man made a promise to his queen and shes dead doug pointed out france is a democracy i dont think anyone would back us up if we decided to use the treasure to restore the crown she started to speak then found herself too tired to argue she needed time to take it all in evaluate her own standards in any case theyd yet to find it doug had said it was the winning after hed won shed talk to him about morals so you think you can find a cemetery stroll in and dig up a queens treasure damn right he gave her a quick dashing smile that made her believe him it might already have been found uhuh he shook his head and shifted one of the pieces the girl described the ruby ring there was a whole section on it in the library book that ring had been passed down through royal succession for a hundred years before it was lost during the french revolution if that or any of the other pieces had turned up underground or otherwise idve heard about it its all there whitney waiting for us its plausible the hell with plausible ive got the papers weve got the papers whitney corrected as she leaned back against a tree now all we have to do is find a cemetery thats been around for two centuries she closed her eyes and went instantly to sleep it was hunger that woke her the deep hollow kind shed never experienced on a moan she rolled over and found herself nose to nose with doug morning she ran her tongue around her teeth id kill for a croissant a mexican omelette he closed his eyes as he pictured it cooked to a deep gold and just busting with peppers and onions whitney let that lie in her imagination but it didnt fill her stomach we have one brown banana around here its serve yourself rubbing his hands over his face doug sat up it was well past dawn the sun had already burned off the mist the forest was alive with sound and movement and the smells of morning he glanced up to the treetops where birds hid and sang the place is loaded with fruit i dont know what lemur meat tastes like but no he grinned as he rose just a thought how about light fare fresh fruit salad sounds delightful when she stretched the lamba slipped off her shoulder fingering it whitney realized doug must have spread it over her the night before after all that had happened all theyd seen he could still manage to surprise her as if it were the most elegant of silks whitney folded and repacked it you get the fruit ill get the coconuts whitney reached up into the branches these look like stunted bananas pawpaws whitney picked three and grimaced at them what i wouldnt give for one lowly apple just as a change of pace take her out to breakfast and she complains least you could do is buy me a bloody mary she began then turned to see him halfway up a palm tree douglas she said moving cautiously closer do you know what youre doing im climbing a goddamn tree he managed as he shinnied up another foot i hope youre not planning on falling and breaking your neck i hate to travel alone all heart he muttered under his breath its not so different from climbing into a thirdstory window a nice brick building isnt likely to give you splinters in sensitive places reaching up he yanked off a coconut stand back sugar i might be tempted to aim for you lips curved she did so one then two then three coconuts landed at her feet taking one up she smacked it against a tree trunk until it cracked well done she told doug when he dropped to the ground i believe id like a chance to watch you work he accepted the coconut she offered and sitting on the ground pulled out his pocketknife to carve out the meat it reminded her of jacques whitney touched the shell she still wore then pushed back the grief you know most people in your position wouldnt be so tolerant he decided of somebody in my line of work im a firm believer in free enterprise whitney dropped down beside him its also a matter of checks and balances she concluded with her mouth full checks and balances say you steal my emerald earrings ill keep it in mind lets keep this hypothetical she shook the hair back from her face and gave a fleeting thought to digging out her brush food came first well the insurance companys stuck with shelling out the cash ive been paying them outrageous premiums for years and i never wear the emeralds because theyre too gaudy you hock the emeralds someone else buys them who finds them attractive and i have the cash to buy something entirely more suitable in the long run everyones happy it could almost be considered a public service he broke off a piece of coconut and chewed i guess i never thought about it that way of course the insurance companys not going to be happy she added and some people might not appreciate losing some particular piece of jewelry or the family silver even if it was too ornate youre not always doing a good deed by breaking into their house you know guess not and i suppose i have more respect for straight honest stealing than computer crimes and whitecollar swindling like the crooked stockbrokers she continued as she sampled coconut fooling around with some little old ladys portfolio until theyve pocketed the profits and shes left with nothing thats not on the same level with picking someones pocket or lifting the sydney diamond i dont want to talk about the sydney he mumbled in one way it does keep the cycle going then again she paused to dig out more fruit i dont think robbery has a very good occupation potential an interesting hobby certainly but as a career it has its limitations yeah ive been thinking about retiring when i can do it in style when you get back to the states whats the first thing youre going to do buy a silk shirt and have my initials monogrammed on the cuffs im going to have an italian suit to go over it and a sleek little lamborghini to set it all off he sliced a mango in half wiped the blade on his jeans and offered her a piece what about you im going to stuff myself whitney told him with her mouth full im going to make a career out of eating i think ill start out with a hamburger smothered with cheese and onions and work my way up to lobster tails lightly broiled and drowned in melted butter for somebody so preoccupied with eating i dont see how youre so skinny she swallowed mango its lack of occupation that leads to preoccupation she told him and im slender not skinny mick jaggers skinny grinning he popped another piece of fruit into his mouth you forget sugar ive had the privilege of seeing you naked yours aint exactly an hourglass figure with a brow lifted she licked juice from her fingers ive a very delicate build she said and when he continued to grin she moved her gaze up and down him and youll remember i also have had the fascination of seeing you stripped it wouldnt hurt you to pump a little iron douglas obvious muscles get in the way id rather be subtle you certainly are he shot her a look as he tossed a coconut shell aside you like biceps and triceps bulging out of a sleeveless tshirt masculinity she said lightly is very arousing a confident male doesnt find it necessary to ogle an over endowed woman who chooses to wear tight sweaters to disguise the fact she has a very small brain i guess you dont like being ogled certainly not i prefer style to cleavage good thing theres no need to be insulting just being agreeable he remembered too well the way shed wept in his arms the day before and how helpless hed felt now he found he wanted to touch her again watch her smile feel the softness anyway he said working his way back from a long drop you might be skinny but i like your face her lips curved in that cool aloof smile he found maddeningly alluring really what about it your skin going with the impulse he ran the back of his knuckles down her jawline i came across this alabaster cameo once it wasnt big he remembered as he traced a finger down her cheekbone probably wasnt worth more than a few hundred but it was the classiest thing id ever picked up he grinned then let his hands roam into her hair until you she didnt move away but kept her eyes on his as his breath feathered over her skin is that what you did douglas pick me up you could look at it that way couldnt you he knew he was making a mistake even as his lips brushed over hers he knew he was making a very big mistake hed made them before since i did he murmured i havent known exactly what to do with you im not an alabaster cameo she murmured as her arms wound around his neck or the sydney diamond or a pot of gold im not a member of the country club and i dont have a villa in martinique it would seem she traced the outline of his mouth with her tongue we have very little in common nothing in common he corrected as his hands slid up her back people like you and me cant bring each other anything but trouble yeah she smiled and the eyes beneath the fringe of long luxurious lashes were dark and amused when do we start we already have when their lips met they were no longer a lady and a thief passion was a great equalizer together they rolled onto the soft forest floor she hadnt meant for it to happen but she had no regrets attraction that shed felt from the moment hed removed the sunglasses in her elevator and looked at her with his clear direct eyes had been edging toward something deeper broader more unsettling hed begun to touch something in her and now with passion he released a great deal more her mouth was as hot and hungry as his that had happened before her pulse raced no new experience her body stretched and arched at the touch of a mans hands shed felt those sensations before but this time this first and only time she let her mind go and experienced lovemaking as it was meant to be mindless liberating pleasure though the surrender of her best defense her mind was complete she wasnt passive her need was as great as his as primitive as overwhelming as elemental when they undressed each other in a frenzy her hands were as quick as his flesh against flesh warm firm sleek mouth against mouth open hot hungry they rolled over the soft ground with no more inhibitions than children but with passion fullgrown and straining she couldnt get enough of him and tasted touched as if shed never known a man before in that moment she could remember no others he filled her heart mind threatening to stay so that there would never be room for another she understood and after the first fear accepted hed wanted women before desperately or so hed thought until now he hadnt known the full meaning of desperation until now he hadnt known what it was to want she was seeping into him pore by pore women were allowed to pleasure and be pleasured but they werent allowed intimacy intimacy meant complications a man on the run couldnt afford but there was no stopping her his hands might run along her skin clever skilled strong but it was she who led he knew a man was at his most vulnerable when in a womans arms mother wife or lover yet he forgot anything but the need to be there she melted into him dangerously warm dangerously soft but he took and cursed the consequences naked agile exquisite she moved under him wrapped around him with his face buried in her hair doug heard the door lock behind him he heard the bolt slide quietly into place he didnt give a damn taking his time he ran kisses down her face forehead nose mouth chin he felt her smile answer his her elegant pampered fingers slid down to his hips they both had their eyes open when he plunged into her he filled her and moaned at the exquisite heat and softness that encompassed him her face was dappled with sun and shade her eyes halfclosed as she matched him stroke for stroke pulse for pulse speed built needs whirled as his thoughts began to tumble and skid his last rational flash was that perhaps hed already found the end of the rainbow they lay in silence neither were children neither were without experience both knew theyd never made love before both were wondering what the hell they were going to do about it gently she ran a hand up and down his back he drew in the scent of her hair i guess we knew this would happen she said after a moment i guess we did she looked up at the canopy of trees overhead and the pure blue beyond them what now it wasnt practical to think beyond the present if her question dealt with the future doug thought it best to pretend otherwise he kissed her shoulder we get to the nearest town beg borrow or steal transportation and head to diegosuarez whitney closed her eyes briefly then opened them again she had after all walked into this with them open shed keep them that way the treasure were going to get it whitney its only a matter of days now and then the future again propping himself on his elbows he looked down at her anything you want he said because he couldnt think of anything but how beautiful she was martinique athens zanzibar well buy a farm in ireland and raise sheep she laughed because it seemed so simple just now we could plant wheat in nebraska with about the same rate of success right what we should do is open an american restaurant right here in madagascar ill cook and you do the books abruptly he sat up gathering her with him somehow hed stopped being alone and hadnt fully realized it until that moment stopped being alone when alone had always seemed the best angle he wanted to share to belong to have someone there right beside him it wasnt smart but it was were going to get that treasure whitney after we do nothing can stop us anything we want anytime we want i can shower diamonds in your hair he ran a hand through it forgetting for the moment that she could have her pick of diamonds now if she chose she felt a twinge of regret and of something like grief he could see no further than his pot of gold not now perhaps not ever smiling she ran a hand over his cheek yet shed known that all along well find it well find it he agreed drawing her closer and when we do well have it all they walked through another day to dusk while whitneys stomach rumbled and her legs went to rubber like doug she fixed her mind on the goal of diegosuarez it helped keep her feet moving and her mind from questioning theyd come this far for the treasure whatever happened before after or in between theyd find it the time for thinking questioning analyzing would come after she shook her head at the fruit doug offered my system would punish me if i sent any more mango down as if to soothe it she placed her hand over her stomach i thought mcdonalds had franchises everywhere do you realize how far weve walked without seeing one golden arch forget the fast food when were finished with this ill fix you a fivecourse dinner thatll make you think youve gone to heaven id settle for a hot dog with everything for somebody who thinks like a duchess youve got the stomach of a peasant even serfs had a leg of mutton now and again look well then he grabbed her and shoved her into the bush what is it a light up ahead see it cautiously she looked over his shoulder and angled her head it was there faint and white through the dim light and thick foliage automatically she dropped her voice to a whisper remo i dont know maybe he went silent as he thought of and rejected a half dozen ideas well take it slow it took them fifteen minutes to reach the tiny settlement by then it was fully dark they could see the light through the window of what seemed to be a small store or trading post moths as big as the palm of her hand batted against the glass outside was a jeep ask and you shall receive doug said under his breath lets have a look crouching he made his way over to the window what he saw inside made him grin remo his tailored shirt stained and limp sat at a table scowling into a glass of beer across from him was barns balding molelike and grinning at nothing in particular well well doug breathed looks like our lucky day whatre they doing here running in circles remo looks like he needs a shave and a husky norwegian masseuse doug counted three others in the bar all giving the americans a wide berth he also saw two bowls of steaming soup a sandwich and what looked like a bag of potato chips saliva pooled in his mouth a shame we cant order something to go whitneyd seen the food as well she barely stopped herself from pressing her nose up against the glass cant we wait until they leave and then go in and eat they leave so does the jeep okay sugar youre going to be lookout again this time do a better job i told you i couldnt whistle last time because i was busy staying alive were both going to stay alive and were going to liberate ourselves a set of wheels come on moving quickly he circled the hut with whispers and hand signals he positioned whitney near the front window while he crept to the jeep and went to work she watched gasping when remo rose and began to pace eyes wide she looked back at the jeep sprawled on the floor doug was hidden from view she gritted her teeth and pressed her back to the wall as remo passed the window make it fast she hissed to doug hes getting restless dont rush me he muttered as he freed wires these things take a delicate touch she glanced inside in time to see remo shove bams to his feet you better get your delicate touch moving douglas theyre coming swearing he wiped sweat from his fingers another minute all he needed was another minute pile in sugar were almost there when she didnt respond he looked up to see the little front porch of the hut was empty sonofabitch struggling with the wires he searched for her whitney goddammit this is no time to take a walk still swearing fingers working he scanned the settlement nothing he jolted at the sound of squeals barks and confusion as the engine roared into life as he started to leap out of the jeep gun raised whitney raced around the side of the hut and jumped inside hit the gas sugar she panted or well have company the words werent out of her mouth before he had the jeep roaring down the narrow dirt road a lowhanging branch swiped against the windshield and broke with a crack like a gunshot glancing over his shoulder he saw remo running around the side of the hut he pushed whitneys face into the seat and the gas pedal to the floor before the first of three shots rang out whered you go doug demanded as they left the light of the settlement behind a hell of a lookout you make when i nearly get myself shot looking for you thats gratitude she shook back her hair as she sat up if i hadnt created a diversion youd never have gotten the jeep hotwired in time he slowed down only enough to assure himself he wouldnt smash the jeep against a tree whatre you talking about when i saw remo was coming out i figured you needed a diversion like in the movies terrific he negotiated a bend bumped over a rock and kept on going so i ran around back and let the dog into the pigsty whitney brushed the hair out of her eyes and revealed a very smug smile it was quite entertaining but i couldnt hang around to watch it did however work perfectly lucky you didnt get your head shot off he mumbled i continue to prevent you from having yours shot off and you resent it she returned typical male ego i dont know why i she trailed off and sniffed the air whats that smell what smell that smell it wasnt grass damp or animal odors to which they had become accustomed she sniffed again then turned and kneeled on the seat it smells like she lowered so that when doug turned his head he saw only her slim wellshaped bottom chicken triumphant whitney leapt up again holding a drumstick its chicken she said again taking an enormous bite they have a whole cold chicken back here and a pile of cans cans with food in them olives she announced digging in the back again big fat greek olives wheres the can opener while she dug head down doug plucked the drumstick from her hand dimitri believes in eating well he said over a healthy bite he could have sworn he felt it slide all the way down remos smart enough to raid the larder when hes going to be on the road ill say with a light in her eyes she flopped back on the seat again beluga she held the small tin between her thumb and finger and theres a bottle of pouillyfuisse any salt of course grinning he handed her the halfeaten drumstick looks like were traveling to diegosuarez in style sugar whitney retrieved the bottle of wine and drew out the cork sugar she drawled i never travel any other way chapter thirteen they made love in the jeep like giddy teenagers high on exhaustion and wine the moon was white the night still there was music from night birds insects and frogs with the jeep pulled deep into the bush they feasted on caviar and one another while the forest sang around them whitney laughed as they struggled to have more of each other on the small uncooperative front seat of the jeep with her clothes half on half off her mind light and her hunger satisfied whitney rolled on top of him and grinned i havent had a date like this since i was sixteen oh yeah he ran a hand up her thigh to her hip her eyes were dark glazed with a combination of weariness wine and passion doug promised himself hed see them like that again when they were in some cozy hotel on the other side of the world so a guy could get you into the back seat with a little wine and caviar actually it was crackers and beer she sucked beluga from her finger and i ended up punching him in the stomach youre a fun date whitney she tipped the last drops from the bottle into her mouth around them the forest was full of insects rubbing their wings and singing i am and have always been selective selective huh he shifted so that she lay across him as he supported himself against the door of the jeep what the hellre you doing here with me then shed asked herself the same question and the simplicity of the answer left her uneasy she wanted to be for a moment she was silent nestling her head against his shoulder it felt right there and though it was foolish safe i suppose i fell for your charm they all do whitney tilted her head smiled then sunk her teeth not so gently into his bottom lip hey while she laughed he pinned her arms to her side so she wants to play rough you dont scare me lord no enjoying himself he gripped both her wrists in one hand and circled her neck with the other her eyes never flickered maybe ive been too easy on you so far go ahead she challenged do your worst she looked up at him with that cool half smile her whiskey eyes dark and sleepy doug did what hed avoided all his life what hed avoided more cleverly more carefully than smalltown sheriffs and bigcity cops he fell in love jesus youre beautiful there was something in the tone of his voice before she could analyze it or the look that had come into his eyes his mouth was on hers they both fell into passion it was as the first time he hadnt expected it to be the feelings the needs that swam through him were just as intense just as overwhelming he was just as helpless under his hands her skin flowed like water under his mouth her lips were strong more potent than sweet the lightheaded weariness passed into a lightheaded power with her he could do and have anything the night was hot the air moist and heavy with the scent of dozens of heatsoaked flowers nightfeeding insects rubbed their wings and whined he wanted candlelight for her and a soft cool feather bed with silkcovered pillows he wanted to give something new for a man who while generous always took first her body was so delicate it captivated him in a way all the others the flamboyant the obvious the professional never had her curves were subtle her bones long and elegant her skin was soft in a way that spoke of daily pampering he told himself thered be a time when hed have the luxury of exploring every inch of her slowly thoroughly until he knew her like no other man ever had like no other man ever would there was something different about him he was no less passionate but she knew there was something her senses were tangled layered one on top of the other so that she was caught in a delicious mass of sensation she could feel but what she felt came from him the stroke of a fingertip the brush of lips she could taste but it was his flavor which filled her warm male exciting she heard him murmur to her and her own whispered answer floated on the air his scent reached her muskier more intoxicating than the hothouse that surrounded them until now she hadnt understood what it meant to be steeped in someone until now she hadnt wanted to she opened he filled he gave she absorbed from the beginning theyd raced together this was no different heart pounding against heart bodies close they crossed the line all lovers seek they slept lightly only an hour but it was a luxury they took greedily curled together on the seat of the jeep the moon was lower now doug watched its position through the trees before he nudged her weve got to move remo might still be scrambling for transportation then again he might already be on the road behind them either way he wouldnt be cheerful whitney sighed and stretched how much farther i dont know another hundred maybe hundred and twenty miles okay yawning she began to dress ill drive he snorted as he pulled on his jeans the hell you will ive driven with you before remember i certainly do after a brief inspection whitney decided the wrinkles in her clothes were permanent she wondered if there was any chance of finding a dry cleaner just as i remember i saved your life then too saved it doug turned to see her rooting out her brush you nearly got us both killed whitney flicked the brush through her hair i beg your pardon through my superior skill and maneuvering i not only saved your ass but detained remo and his band of merry men doug turned on the ignition i guess its all a matter of perspective anyway ill drive youve had too much to drink whitney cast him a long withering look the macallisters never lose their wits she grabbed the door handle as they bumped through the brush and onto the road all that ice cream doug decided as he set a steady speed it coats the stomach so the booze neutralizes very droll she released the door handle propped her feet on the dash and watched the night whiz by it occurs to me that youre quite aware of my family history and background what about yours which story do you want he asked lightly i keep a variety depending on the occasion everything from the destitute orphan to the misplaced aristocrat im sure whitney studied his profile who was he she wondered and why did she care she didnt have the first answer but the time had passed when she could pretend she didnt have the second what about the real one just for variety he could have lied it would have been a simple matter for him to have given her the story of a homeless little boy sleeping in alleys and running from a vicious stepfather and he could have made her believe it settling back doug did what he did rarely he told the unvarnished truth i grew up in brooklyn a nice quiet neighborhood bluecollar plain and settled my mother kept house and my father fixed drains both my sisters were cheerleaders we had a dog named checkers it sounds very normal yeah it was and sometimes rarely he could bring it back in focus and enjoy it my father belonged to the moose and my mom made the best blueberry pie you ever tasted they both still do and what about young douglas lord because i was ah clever with my hands my father thought id make a good plumber it just didnt seem like my idea of a good time the hourly rate of a union plumbers quite impressive yeah well ive never been into working by the hour so instead you decided to how do you term it freelance a vocations a vocation i had this uncle the family always kept kind of quiet about him a black sheep she asked interested i guess you wouldnt have called him lily white seems hed done some time anyway to keep it short he came to live with us for awhile and worked for my dad he shot whitney a quick appealing grin he was good with his hands too i see so you came by your talent dare i say honestly jack was good he was real good except he had a weakness for the bottle when he gave into it he got sloppy get sloppy you get caught one of the first things he taught me was never to drink on the job i dont imagine youre referring to unstopping pipes no jack was a secondrate plumber but he was a firstclass thief i was fourteen when he taught me to pick a lock never been real sure why he took to me one thing was i liked to read and he liked to hear stories he wasnt much on sitting down with a book but hed sit there for hours if youd tell him the story of the man in the iron mask or don quixote shed been aware from the beginning of a sharp intellect and a varied kind of taste so young douglas liked to read yeah he moved his shoulders and negotiated a curve first thing i stole was a book we werent poor really but we couldnt afford to stock the kind of library i wanted needed he corrected he needed the books the escape from the everyday the same way hed needed food no one had understood anyway jack liked hearing stories i remember what i read authors hope readers do no i mean i remember almost line for line its just the way it is got me through school she thought about the ease with which hed spouted off facts and figures from the guidebook you mean you have a photographic memory i dont see it in pictures i just dont forget thats all he grinned thinking it got me a scholarship to princeton whitney sat up straight you went to princeton his grin widened at her reaction until then hed never considered the truth more interesting than fiction no i decided rather than college i wanted onthejob training youre telling me you turned down a princeton scholarship yeah prelaw seemed pretty cut and dried prelaw she murmured and had to laugh so you mightve been a lawyer ivy league at that idve hated it just as much as idve hated unstopping johns there was uncle jack he always said he didnt have any kids and wanted to pass on his trade ah a traditionalist yeah well in his way he was i caught on quick i had a hell of a lot more fun tripping a lock than i did conjugating verbs but jack had this thing about education he wouldnt take me on a real job until i had my highschool diploma and a little math and science come in handy when youre dealing with security systems with the talent she imagined doug couldve been one of the top engineers in the business she let it pass very sensible we went on the road did pretty well for ourselves for about five years small clean jobs hotels mostly one memorable night we picked up ten thousand at the waldorf he smiled reminiscently we went to vegas and dropped most of it but it was a hell of a time easy come easy go if you cant have fun with it theres no use taking it she had to smile at that her father was fond of saying if you couldnt have fun with it there was no use making it she supposed hed appreciate dougs slight variation on the theme jack had this idea about hitting this jewelry store wouldve set us up for years we only had a few details to work out what happened jack fell off the wagon he tried to pull the job on his own what you might call an ego thing i was getting better and he was slipping a bit i guess it was hard to take anyway he got sloppy it wouldnt have been so bad if he hadnt broken the rules and taken a gun with him doug swung his arm back on the seat and shook his head that little flourish cost him ten good years so uncle jack went up the river and you up the river he murmured amused i hit the streets i was twentythree and a hell of a lot greener than i thought i was but i learned fast enough hed given up a princeton scholarship to climb in secondstory windows the education might have bought him some of the luxury he seemed to crave and yet and yet whitney couldnt see him choosing the welltrod road what about your parents they tell the neighbors i work for general motors my mother keeps hoping ill get married and settle down maybe become a locksmith by the way he added as one thought led to another whos tad carlyse iv tad whitney noticed that the sky in the east was beginning to lighten she mightve closed her eyes and slept if her eyelids hadnt felt filled with grit we were sort of engaged for a time he immediately and completely detested tad carlyse iv sort of engaged well lets say tad and my father considered us engaged i considered it a matter for debate they were both rather annoyed when i opted out tad doug visualized a blond with a weak jaw in a blue blazer white deck shoes and no socks what does he do do whitney fluttered her lashes why i suppose youd say tad delegates hes the heir to carlyse and fitz they manufacture everything from aspirin to rocket fuel yeah ive heard of them more megamillions he thought and hit the next three ruts rather violently the kind of people who stepped on an ordinary man without ever noticing the bump so why arent you mrs tad carlyse iv probably for the same reason you didnt become a plumber it didnt seem like a great deal of fun she crossed her feet at the ankles you might want to back up douglas i believe you missed that last pothole it was full morning when they stood on the rise of a mountain overlooking diegosuarez from that distance the water in the bay was achingly blue but the pirates whod once roamed there wouldnt have recognized it the ships that dotted the water were gray and sturdy there were no sleek sails billowing no wooden hulls rolling the bay that had once been a pirates dream and an immigrants hope was now a major french naval base the town that had once been the pride of buccaneers was a tidy modern city of some fifty thousand malagasy french indian oriental british and american where there had once been thatched huts stood steel and concrete buildings well here we are whitney linked her arm with his why dont we go down book into a hotel and have a hot bath were here he murmured he thought he could feel the papers growing warm in his pocket first we find it doug whitney turned so that she faced him her hands on his shoulders i understand this is important to you i want to find it too but look at us she glanced down at herself were filthy were exhausted even if it didnt matter to us people are bound to notice we arent going to socialize he looked over her head to the town below to the end of the rainbow well start with the churches he went back to the jeep resigned whitney followed fifty miles behind jolting along the northern road in a renault with a bad exhaust were remo and barns because he needed to think remo let barns drive the little molelike man gripped the wheel with both hands and grinned straight ahead he liked to drive almost as much as he liked to run over whatever furry little thing might dash out on the road when we catch em i get the woman right remo shot barns a look of mild disgust he considered himself a fastidious man he considered barns a slug you better remember dimitri wants her if you mess her up you might just piss him off i wont mess her up his eyes gleamed a moment as he remembered the photo she was so pretty he liked pretty things soft pretty things then he thought of dimitri unlike the others he didnt fear dimitri he adored him the adoration was simple basic in much the same way a small ugly dog might adore his master even after a few good kickings what few brains barns had been blessed with had been rattled well over the years if dimitri wanted the woman hed bring the woman to him he gave remo an amiable smile because in his own fashion barns liked remo dimitri wants lords ears he said with a giggle want me to cut em off for you remo just drive dimitri wanted lords ears but remo was well aware he might settle for a substitute if hed had any hope that he wouldve gotten away with it hed have headed the car in the opposite direction dimitri would find him because dimitri believed an employee remained an employee until death premature or otherwise remo could only pray he still had his own ears after he reported to dimitri at his temporary headquarters in diegosuarez five churches in two hours she thought and theyd found nothing their luck had to come in soon or run out what now she demanded as they pulled up in front of yet another church this one was smaller than the others theyd been to and the roof needed repair we pay our respects the town was built on a promontory jutting out over the water though it was still morning the air was hot and sticky overhead palm fronds barely moved in the slight breeze with a little imagination doug could picture the town as it had once been rowdy simple protected by mountains on one side and the manmade wall on the other as he strode away from the jeep whitney caught up with him care to guess how many churches how many cemeteries there are around here better yet how many there were thatve been built over you dont build over cemeteries makes people nervous he liked the layout here the front door was hanging crooked on its hinges making him think no one used the church with any regularity around the side a bit overgrown and canopied by palms were groups of headstones he had to crouch down to read the inscriptions doug dont you feel a bit ghoulish skin chilled whitney rubbed her arms and looked over her shoulder no the answer was simple as he peered closely at headstone after headstone deads dead whitney dont you have any thoughts on what happens after he shot her a look whatever i think whats buried six feet down doesnt have any feelings at all come on give me a hand it was pride that had her crouching down with him and tugging vines from headstones the dates are good see and the names are french the tingle at the back of his neck told him he was closing in if we could just bonjour whitney sprang to her feet poised to run before she saw the old priest step through the trees she fought to keep guilt off her face as she smiled and answered him in french good morning father his black cassock was a stark contrast to his pale hair pale eyes pale face his hands when he folded them were spotted with age i hope were not trespassing everyone is welcome to gods house he took in their bedraggled appearance youre traveling yes father doug stood up beside her but said nothing whitney knew it was up to her to spin the tale but she found she couldnt tell a direct lie to a man in a white collar weve come a long way looking for the graves of family who immigrated here during the french revolution many did are they your ancestors she looked into the priests calm pale eyes she thought of the merina who worshipped the dead no but its important we find them to find what is gone his muscles weary with age trembled with the simple movement of linking his hands many look few find youve come a long way his mind she thought as she struggled with impatience was as old as his body yes father a long way we think the family were looking for may be buried here he thought then accepted perhaps i can help you you have the names the lebrun family gerald lebrun lebrun the priests withered face closed in as he thought there are no lebrun in my parish whats he talking about doug muttered in her ear but whitney merely shook her head they immigrated here from france two hundred years ago they died here we must all face death in order to have everlasting life whitney gritted her teeth and tried again yes father but we have an interest in the lebruns an historical interest she decided thinking it wasnt actually a lie youve come a long way you need refreshment madame dubrock will fix tea he put his hand on whitneys arm as if to lead her down the path she started to refuse then felt his arm tremble that would be lovely father she braced herself against his weight whats going on were having tea whitney told doug and smiled at the priest try to remember where you are jesus exactly she helped the aging priest up the narrow path to the tiny rectory before she could reach for the door it was opened by a woman in a cotton housedress whose face sagged with wrinkles the smell of age was like old paper thin and dusty father madame dubrock took his other arm and helped him inside did you have a pleasant walk i brought travelers they must have tea of course of course the old woman led the priest down a dim little hall and into a cramped parlor a blackbound bible with yellowed pages was opened to the book of david candles burned low were set on each table and on an old upright piano that looked as though it had been dropped more than once there was a statue of the virgin chipped and faded and somehow lovely in its place by the window madame dubrock murmured and fussed with the priest as she settled him in a chair doug looked at the crucifix on the wall pitted with age stained with the blood of redemption he dragged a hand through his hair he always felt a bit uneasy in church and this was worse whitney we havent got time for this ssh madame dubrock she began please sit i will bring tea compassion and impatience warred as whitney looked back at the priest father youre young he sighed and worried his rosary i have said mass in the church of our lord for more years than you have lived but so few come again whitney was drawn to the pale eyes the pale voice numbers dont matter do they father she sat in the chair beside him one is enough he smiled closed his eyes and dozed poor old man she murmured and id like to live just as long doug put in sugar while were waiting to have tea remos making his merry way into town hes probably a little annoyed that we stole his jeep what was i supposed to do tell him to back off we have a hired gun at our backs he saw the look in her eyes when she flared at him the look that meant her heart was attached okay okay twinges of pity had been working on him as well and he didnt care for it we did our good deed and now hes having a nap lets do what we came for she crossed her arms over her chest and felt like a ghoul listen maybe there are records ledgers we could look through rather than she broke off and glanced toward the cemetery you know he rubbed his knuckles over her cheek why dont you stay here and ill have a look wanting to agree made her feel like a coward no were in this together if magdaline or gerald lebrun are out there well find them together there was a magdaline lebrun who died in childbirth and her daughter danielle who succumbed to fever madame dubrock shuffled back into the room with a tray of tea and hard biscuits yes whitney turned to doug and took his hand yes the old woman smiled as she saw doug watch her suspiciously i have many hours in the evening to myself its my hobby to read and study church records the church itself is three centuries old its withstood war and hurricane you remember reading of the lebruns im old when doug took the tray from her she gave a little sigh of relief but my memory is good she cast a look at the slumbering priest that too will go but she said it with a kind of pride or perhaps whitney thought a kind of faith many came here to escape the revolution many died i remember reading of the lebruns thank you madame whitney dug in her wallet and pulled out half of the bills she had left for your church she looked over at the priest and added more bills for his church in the name of the lebrun family madame dubrock took the money with a quiet dignity if god wills it youll find what you seek if you need refreshment come back to the rectory youll be welcomed thank you madame on impulse whitney stepped forward there are men looking for us she looked whitney straight in the eye patient yes my child theyre dangerous the priest shifted in his chair and looked at doug so was this man dangerous he thought but he felt at peace the priest nodded to whitney god protects he closed his eyes again and slept they never asked any questions whitney murmured as they walked back outside doug looked over his shoulder some people have all the answers they need he wasnt one of them lets find what we came for because of the undergrowth the vines and the age of the headstones it took them an hour to work their way through half the cemetery the sun rose high so that shadows were thin and short even with the distance whitney could smell the sea tired and discouraged she sat on the ground and watched doug work we should come back tomorrow and do the rest i can barely focus on the names at this point today he spoke half to himself as he bent over another grave it has to be today i can feel it all i can feel is a pain in the lower back were close i know it your palms get damp and theres this feeling in your gut that everythings just about to slide into place its like cracking a safe you dont even have to hear the last click to know it you just know it the sonofabitch is here he shoved his hands in his pockets and stretched his back ill find it if it takes the next ten years whitney looked over at him and with a sigh shifted to stand she propped one hand on a headstone for balance as her foot caught on a vine swearing she bent over to free herself feeling her heart jolt she looked down again and read the name on the stone she heard the last tumbler click its not going to take that long what its not going to take that long she grinned and the sheer brilliance of it made him straighten we found danielle she blinked back tears as she cleared the stone danielle lebrun she read poor child so far from home her mothers here dougs voice was soft without the excited lilt he slipped his hand into whitneys she died young shed have worn her hair powdered with feathers in it and her dresses would have come low on the shoulders and swept the floor whitney rested her head against his arm then she learned to plant a garden and keep her husbands secret but where is he doug crouched down again why isnt he buried beside her he should a thought occurred to her then and she spun away biting off an oath he killed himself he wouldnt have been buried here this is consecrated ground doug hes not in the cemetery he stared at her what suicide she dragged a hand through her hair he died in sin so he couldnt be buried in the church grounds she glanced around hopelessly i dont even know where to look they had to bury him somewhere he began to pace between the gravestones what did they usually do with the ones they wouldnt let in she frowned a bit and tried to think it would depend i suppose if the priest was compassionate id think hed be buried close by doug looked down theyre here he muttered and my palms are still sweating taking her hand he walked over to the low fence that bordered the cemetery we start there another hour passed while they walked and searched through the brush the first snake whitney saw nearly sent her back to the jeep but doug handed her a stick and no sympathy straightening her spine she stuck with it when doug tripped stumbled and cursed she paid no attention to him holy shit whitney lifted her stick ready to strike snake forget the snakes he grabbed her hand and pulled her down on the ground with him i found it the marker was small and plain nearly buried itself it read simply gerald lebrun whitney laid a hand on it wondering if thered been anyone to mourn for him and bingo doug tore a vine as thick as his thumb riddled with trumpetshaped flowers from another stone it read only marie marie she murmured it could be another suicide no he took whitneys shoulders so that they faced each other across the stones hed guarded the treasure just as hed promised he died still guarding it he must have buried it here before he wrote that last letter he might have written down a request to be buried in this spot they couldnt bury him in there with his family but there wasnt any reason not to give him a last wish all right it makes sense but her mouth was dry what now now im going to go steal a shovel doug no time for sensibilities now she swallowed again okay but make it fast you could hold your breath he gave her a quick kiss before he was up and gone whitney sat between the two stones her knees drawn up and her heart thudding were they really so close so close to the finish at last she looked down at the flat neglected plot of ground beneath her hand had gerald queens confident kept the treasure at his side for two centuries and if they found it whitney plucked the grass with her fingers for now shed only remember that if they found it dimitri hadnt shed be satisfied with that for the moment doug came back without rustling the grass whitney heard him only when he murmured her name she swore and scrambled forward on her knees do you have to do that id rather not advertise our little afternoon job he held a dented shorthandled shovel in his hand best i could do on short notice for a moment he just stared down at the dirt under his feet he wanted to savor the sensation of standing over the gateway to easy street whitney saw his thoughts in his eyes again she felt twin sensations of acceptance and disappointment then she put her hand over his on the shovel and gave him a long kiss good luck he began to dig for minute after minute there was no sound but the steady rhythm of metal cutting earth no breeze blew in from the sea so that sweat drained off his face like rain the heat and quiet pressed down on them both as the hole grew deeper each remembered the stages of the journey that had brought them this close a mad chase through the streets of manhattan a frantic leg race in dc a leap from a moving train and an endless hike over barren rolling hills the merina village cyndi lauper along the canal des pangalanes passion and caviar in a stolen jeep death and love both unexpected doug felt the tip of the shovel hit something solid the muffled sound echoed through the brush as his eyes met whitneys on their hands and knees they began to push the dirt aside with their fingers not daring to breathe they lifted it out oh god she said in a whisper its real it was no more than a foot long and not quite as wide the case itself was moldy with dirt and damp it was as danielle had described very plain even so whitney knew that the small chest would be worth a small fortune to a collector or a museum the centuries made gold out of brass dont break the lock whitney told him when doug started to pry it though impatient he took the extra minute to open it as smoothly as if hed held the key when he drew back the lid neither of them could do anything but stare she couldnt have said what shed been expecting half of the time shed looked on the entire venture as a whim even when shed caught dougs enthusiasm pieces of his dream shed never believed theyd find anything like this she saw the flash of diamonds the glint of gold breathless she dipped her hand into them the diamond necklace that dripped from her hand was as bright and cold and exquisite as moonlight in winter could it have been the one whitney wondered was there any chance at all that what she held in her hand had been the necklace used in treachery against marie antoinette in the last days before the revolution had she worn it even once in defiance watching how the stones turned ice and fire against her skin had greed and power taken over the young woman who loved pretty things or had she simply been oblivious to the suffering going on outside her palace walls those were questions for historians whitney thought though she could be certain that marie had inspired loyalty gerald had indeed guarded the jewels for his queen and his country doug held emeralds in his hands five tiers of them in a necklace so heavy it might have strained the neck hed seen it in the book the name a womans maria louise he wasnt sure but as whitney had once thought jewels meant more in three dimensions what glinted in his hand hadnt seen light for two centuries there was more enough for greed for passion and lust the little chest all but spilled over with gems and history gingerly whitney reached down and picked up the small miniature shed seen portraits of the queen consort many times but shed never held a masterpiece of art in her hand before marie antoinette frivolous imprudent and extravagant smiled back at her as though she were still in full reign the miniature was no more than six inches ovalshaped and framed in gold she couldnt see the artists name and the portrait was badly in need of treatment but she knew its value and the moral doug holy christ no matter how high hed allowed his dreams to swing hed never believed thered be such sweetness at the end he had fortune at his fingertips the ultimate success he held a perfect teardrop diamond in one hand and a bracelet winking with rubies in the other hed just won the game hardly realizing he did so he slipped the diamond into his pocket look at it whitney weve got the whole world right here the whole goddamn world god bless the queen laughing he dropped a string of diamonds and emeralds over her head doug look at this yeah what he was more interested in the glitters tumbling out of the box than a small dulled painting frames worth a few bucks he said idly as he dug out a heavy ornate necklace fashioned with sapphires as big as quarters its a portrait of marie its valuable its priceless oh yeah interested he gave the portrait his attention doug this miniatures two hundred years old no one alives seen it before no one even knows it exists so itll bring a good price dont you understand impatient she took it back from him it belongs in a museum this isnt something you take to a fence its art doug she held up the diamond necklace look at this its not just a bunch of pretty stones that have a high market value look at the craftsmanship the style its art its history if its the necklace of the diamond affair it could throw a whole new light on accepted theories its my way out he corrected and set the necklace back in the case doug these jewels belonged to a woman who lived two centuries ago two hundred years you cant take her necklace her bracelet to a pawnshop and have them cut it up its immoral lets talk about morals later doug annoyed he closed the lid on the box and stood look you want to give the painting to a museum maybe a couple of the glitters okay well talk about it i risked my life for this box and dammit yours too im not giving up the one chance i have to pull myself out and be somebody so people can gawk at stones in a museum she gave him a look he didnt understand as she rose to stand in front of him you are somebody she said softly it moved something in him but he shook his head not good enough sugar people like me need what we werent born with im tired of playing the game this takes me over the finish line doug look whatever happens to the stuff first weve got to get it out of here she started to argue further then subsided all right but we will discuss this all you want he gave her the charming smile shed learned never to trust what do you say we take the baby home with a shake of her head whitney returned the smile weve come this far maybe well get away with it they stood but when he turned to push through the brush she held back pulling blooms from vines she laid them on geralds grave you did all you could turning she followed doug to the jeep with another quick glance around doug settled the chest in the back and tossed a blanket over it okay now we find a hotel thats the best news ive had all day when he found one that looked stylish and expensive enough for his taste doug pulled up at the curb look you go check in im going to go see about getting us out of the country on the first plane in the morning what about our luggage in antananarivo well send for it where do you want to go paris she said instantly i have a feeling i wont be bored this time you got it now how about parting with a little of that cash so i can take care of things of course as if shed never denied him a cent whitney took out her wallet youd better take some plastic instead she decided and pulled out a credit card first class douglas if you please nothing else get the best room in the house sugar tonight we start living in style she smiled but leaned over the back seat and retrieved the blanketcovered chest along with her pack ill just take this along with me dont you trust me i wouldnt say that exactly hopping out she blew him a kiss in dirtsmeared slacks and a torn blouse she walked into the hotel like a reigning princess doug watched three men scramble to open the door for her class he thought again she reeked with it he remembered shed once asked him for a blue silk dress with a grin he pulled away from the curb he was going to bring her back a few surprises she approved of the room and told the bellboy so with a generous tip alone she uncovered the chest and opened it again shed never considered herself a conservationist an art buff or a prude looking down at the gems jewels and coins of another age she knew shed never be able to turn them into something so ordinary as cash people had died for what she held in her hand some had died for greed some for principle some for nothing more than timing if they were only jewels the deaths would mean nothing she thought of juan and of jacques no they were more much more than jewels what was here at her fingertips wasnt hers or dougs the trick would be in convincing him of it letting the lid close she walked into the bath and turned the water on full it brought back the memory of the little inn on the coast and jacques he was dead but perhaps when the miniature and the treasure were in their rightful place hed be remembered a small plaque with his name on it in a museum in new york yes it made her smile jacques would appreciate that she let the water run as she walked to the window to look at the view she liked seeing the bay spreading out and the busy little town below her shed like to walk along the boulevard and absorb the texture of the seaport ships men of ships there would be shops crowded with goods the sort a woman in her profession searched for a pity she couldnt go back to new york with a few crates of malagasy wares as her mind wandered a figure on the sidewalk caught her eye and made her strain forward a white panama hat but that was ridiculous she told herself lots of men wore panamas in the tropics it couldnt be yet as she looked she was almost certain it was the man shed seen before she waited breathlessly for the man to turn so that she could be sure when the hat disappeared into a doorway she let out a frustrated breath she was just jumpy how could anyone have followed the zigzagging trail theyd taken to diegosuarez doug better get back soon she thought she wanted to bathe change eat and hop a plane paris she thought and closed her eyes a week of doing nothing but relaxing making love and drinking champagne after what theyd been through it was no less than what they both deserved after paris she sighed and walked back to the bath that was another question she turned off the taps straightened and reached down to unbutton her blouse as she did her eyes met remos in the mirror over the sink ms macallister he smiled lightly touching the scar on his cheek its a pleasure chapter fourteen she thought about screaming fear bubbled in the back of her throat hot and bitter it closed in the pit of her stomach hard and cold but there was a look in remos eyes a calm waiting look that warned her hed be only too happy to silence her she didnt scream in the next instant she thought about running making a wild heroic dash past him and out the door there was always a possibility shed make it and a possibility she wouldnt she backed up her hand still poised at the top button of her blouse in the small bathroom her fast uneven breathing echoed back over her the sound of it made remo smile seeing this whitney struggled for control shed come so far worked so hard and now she was cornered her fingers closed over the porcelain of the sink she wouldnt whine that she promised herself and she wouldnt beg at the movement behind remo whitney shifted her gaze and looked into barnss idiotic amiable eyes she learned fear could be primitive mindless like the terror a mouse feels when a cat begins to playfully bat it with its paws instinct told her there was a great deal more danger in him than in the tall dark man who leveled a pistol at her there was a time for heroics a time for fear and a time for rolling the dice she forced her fingers to relax and prayed remo i presume you work fast and so did her mind beginning to rapidly tick off angles and escape routes doug had been gone no more than twenty minutes she was on her own hed hoped shed scream or try to run so that he would have a reason to put a few bruises on her his vanity still smarted from the scar on his cheek vanity aside remo feared dimitri too much to put a mark on her without provocation he knew dimitri liked women brought to him unmarred whatever condition they were in when he was done with them intimidation however was different he put the barrel of the gun under her chin so that it pressed into the soft vulnerable point of her throat at her quiver his smile spread lord he said briefly where is he she shrugged because shed never been so frightened in her life when she spoke her voice was deliberately even deliberately cool every drop of moisture in her mouth had dried up i killed him the lie came so easily so swiftly it nearly surprised her because it had and easy lies carried the ring of truth whitney went with it lifting a finger she nudged the barrel away from her throat remo stared at her his intellect rarely dipped below the surface to subtleties so that he saw the insolence in her eyes without seeing the fear beneath grabbing her arm he dragged her into the bedroom and shoved her roughly into a chair wheres lord whitney straightened in the chair then brushed at the already tattered sleeve of her blouse she couldnt let him notice her fingers were shaking it was going to take every ounce of guile at her disposal to pull it off really remo i expected a bit more style from you than from a secondrate thief with a jerk of his head remo signaled to barns grinning still he approached her with a small ugly revolver pretty he said and nearly drooled soft and pretty he likes to shoot people in places like kneecaps remo told her now wheres lord whitney forced herself to ignore the gun barns aimed at her left knee if she looked at it if she even thought about it shed have collapsed in a puddle of pleading i killed him she repeated do you have a cigarette i havent had one for days her tone was so casually regal remo was reaching for them before he realized it frustrated he aimed the gun at a point just between her eyes whitney felt the light rapid pounding begin there and spread im only going to ask nice once more wheres lord she gave a sigh that was short and annoyed ive just told you hes dead she knew barns was staring at her still lightly humming her stomach rolled once before she glanced critically at her nails i dont suppose you know where i can get a good manicure in this dump howd you kill him her heartbeat accelerated if he asked how he was close to believing her i shot him of course she smiled a bit vaguely and crossed her legs she saw remo jerk his head so that barns lowered his gun she didnt allow herself a sigh of relief it seemed the most foolproof way why why she blinked why what whyd you kill him i didnt need him anymore she said simply barns stepped forward and ran one pudgy hand down her hair he made a sound in his throat that mightve been approval she made the mistake of turning her head so that their eyes met what she saw in his made her blood ice over keeping still whitney fought not to show the fear only the revulsion is this your pet rodent remo she said mildly i certainly hope you know how to control him back off barns he stroked her hair down to her shoulder i just wanna touch back off she saw the look in barnss eyes when he turned to remo the amiability was gone the idiocy in them now was dark and vile she swallowed unsure whether hed obey or simply shoot remo where he stood if she had to deal with one of them she didnt want it to be barns gentlemen she said in a calm clear voice that had them both looking back at her if were going to be at this for very long id appreciate that cigarette its been a very tiring morning with his left hand remo reached in his pocket and offered her a cigarette whitney took it then holding it between her two fingers looked at him expectantly hed have shot her through the brain without a moments hesitation then again remo appreciated oldfashioned manners taking out his lighter he flicked it on for her with her gaze resting on his whitney smiled and blew out a stream of smoke thank you sure just how do you expect me to believe you wasted lord hes not a fool whitney sat back bringing the cigarette to her lips again there we have a difference of opinion remo lord was a firstclass fool its pitifully easy to take advantage of a man whose brains shall we say hang below the waist a bead of sweat ran down her shoulder blades it took all her effort not to fidget in the chair remo studied her her face was calm her hands steady either she had more guts than hed expected or she was telling the truth normally hed have appreciated someone tidying up for him but hed wanted to kill doug himself look babe youve been with lord willing you helped him all along naturally he had something i wanted she puffed delicately grateful that she didnt choke i helped him get out of the country even backed him financially she gave the cigarette a gentle tap in the ashtray beside her stalling wasnt possible she realized if doug came back while they were still there it would be all over for both of them i have to admit it was a bit of a kick for awhile even though douglas lacked style hes the kind of man a woman tires of easily if you know what i mean she smiled looking remo up and down through a mist of smoke in any case i saw no reason why i should be stuck with him or why i should share the treasure with him so you killed him she noticed he didnt say it with any shade of disgust or revulsion it was speculation she heard of course he became foolishly cocky after wed stolen your jeep it was a simple matter to persuade him to stop pull off the road a bit she fiddled idly with her top button and watched remos eyes lower to it i had the papers and the jeep i certainly didnt need him any more i shot him dumped him out in the bush and drove into town pretty careless of him to let you get the drop on him he was she trailed her fingertip down occupied he wasnt buying she thought and jerked her shoulders you can waste your time looking for him if you like however youre probably aware that i checked in alone and since you apparently knew douglas you might consider the fact that i have the treasure do you really think hed have trusted me with that she pointed one elegant finger toward the dresser remo moved over and tossed back the lid what he saw made his mouth water impressive isnt it whitney lightly tapped out her cigarette much too impressive to share with someone of lords caliber however she trailed off until remos gaze came back to her a man of a certain class and breeding would be quite different it was tempting her eyes were dark and promising he could almost feel the heat rise from the small treasure chest beneath his fingers but he remembered dimitri youre going to change your accommodations all right as if it didnt concern her in the least whitney rose she had to get them out and out quickly going with them was preferable to being shot in the kneecap or anywhere else remo picked up the treasure chest dimitri was going to be pleased he thought very very pleased he gave whitney a thin smile barns is going to walk you out to the car i wouldnt try anything unless youd like to have all the bones in your right hand broken a look at barnss grinning face brought on a shudder theres no need to be crude remo it didnt take doug long to arrange for the two oneway tickets to paris but the shopping expedition ate up more time it gave him a great deal of pleasure to buy whitney the filmy underwear even if it was her creditcard number that was stamped on the receipt he spent nearly an hour much to the saleswomans delight choosing a royal blue silk dress with a draping bodice and a sleek narrow skirt pleased he treated himself to a casually elegant suit it was precisely how he intended to live at least for a time casually and elegantly by the time he got back to the hotel he was loaded with boxes and whistling they were on their way by the next evening theyd be drinking champagne in maxims and making love in a room overlooking the seine no more sixpacks and roadside motels for doug lord first class whitney had said he was going to learn to live with it it surprised him to find the door not quite latched didnt whitney realize by now he wouldnt need a key for something as basic as a hotel lock hey lover ready to celebrate dumping the boxes on the bed he hefted the bottle of wine hed spent the equivalent of seventyfive dollars on as he walked across to the bath he began loosening the cork in the bottle water still hot it was cold and it was empty for a moment doug stood in the center of the room staring at the still clear water giving into pressure the cork blew out with a celebratory pop he barely noticed the overflow of champagne dampening his fingers his heart in his throat he dashed back into the bedroom her pack was there where shed tossed it on the floor but there was no small wooden box with speed and precision he searched the room the box and everything in it was gone so was whitney his first reaction was of fury to be doublecrossed by a woman with whiskey eyes and a cool smile was worse a hundred times worse than being doublecrossed by a bowlegged midget at least the midget had been in the business swearing he slammed the bottle down on the table women they were and had been his biggest problem since puberty when would he learn they smiled crooned batted their lashes and rolled you for every last dollar how could he have been such a jerk hed actually believed she had feelings for him the way shed looked when theyd made love the way shed stood by him fought by him hed actually let himself fall for her like a stone in a cool deep lake hed even made some halfbaked plans about the future and shed just walked out on him the first chance she got he looked down at her pack on the floor shed carried it on her back hiking miles laughing bitching teasing him and then without thinking doug reached down and picked it up inside were pieces of her the lacy underwear a compact a brush he could smell her no the denial rammed into him sharp and abrupt with it he tossed the pack against the wall she wouldnt have run out on him even if he were wrong about her feelings she just had too much class to renege on a bargain so if she hadnt run shed been taken he stood there holding her brush in his hand as the fear poured into him taken he realized hed rather have believed the doublecross hed rather have believed she was already on a plane heading to tahiti laughing at him dimitri the brush broke cleanly in two at the pressure of his hands dimitri had his woman doug threw the two pieces across the room he wasnt going to have her for long he left the room quickly and he was no longer whistling the house was magnificent but then whitney supposed she should have expected no less from a man of dimitris reputation on the outside it was elegant almost feminine white and clean with wroughtiron balconies that would provide a lovely view of the bay the grounds were spacious and well kept rich with the ornate tropical flowers of the region and shaded with palms she studied it with a sick creeping dread remo stopped the car at the end of the crushed white gravel drive her courage had begun to fail her but whitney fought to find it again a man who could acquire a place like this had brains brains could be dealt with it was barns with his black greedy eyes and eager grin who worried her well i must say this is preferable to the hotel with the air of someone preparing to go to a dinner party whitney alighted from the car she plucked a hibiscus and strolled to the front door twirling it under her nose at remos knock the door was opened by another darksuited man dimitri insisted on a neat businesslike appearance in his employees every one would wear a tie with their bluntnose when the man smiled he showed a badly chipped front tooth whitney had no idea hed acquired it when hed smashed through the window of godiva chocolatiers so you got her unlike remo he looked at the chipped tooth as an occupational hazard he had to admire a woman who could drive with such nerveless lunacy but he didnt feel the same tolerance toward doug wheres lord remo didnt even glance at him he only answered to one man keep an eye on her he ordered and went to report directly to dimitri because he carried the treasure he walked quickly with the air of a man in charge the last time hed reported in hed nearly crawled so whats the story barns the darksuited man cast a long look at whitney nicelooking lady he figured dimitri had some interesting plans for her you forget lords ears for the boss barnss giggle brought a chill to whitneys skin she killed him he said cheerfully oh yeah she caught the interested look then brushed back her hair thats right any way to get a drink in this place without waiting for an answer she walked down the wide white hall and into the first room it was obviously a formal parlor whoever had decorated it leaned toward the ornate whitney would have chosen something a great deal breezier the windows twice as tall as she were festooned in scarlet brocade as she strolled across the room she wondered if it would be possible for her to open them and escape doug would be back at the hotel by now she calculated as she ran her fingertip along an intricately carved drum table but she couldnt count on him to come charging in like the seventh cavalry whatever move she made she made on her own knowing both men were watching her every step she walked to a waterford decanter and poured her fingers were numb and damp a little shot of courage wouldnt hurt she decided especially since she didnt yet know what she was up against as if she had all the time in the world she sat in a highbacked queen anne chair and began to sip some very smooth vermouth her father had always said you could negotiate with a man who stocked a good bar whitney drank again and hoped he was right minutes passed she sat in the chair and drank trying to ignore the terror that built inside of her after all she reasoned if he was simply going to kill her hed have done so by now wouldnt he wasnt it more likely hed hold her for ransom it might not sit well with her to be exchanged for a few hundred thousand dollars but it was a far better fate than a bullet doug had spoken of torture as though it were dimitris hobby thumbscrews and chaucer she swallowed more vermouth knowing shed never keep her wits if she thought too deeply about the man who now had her life in his hands doug was safe at least for the moment whitney concentrated on that when remo came back she tensed all over muscle by muscle with deliberate care she lifted the glass to her lips again its terribly rude to keep a guest waiting more than ten minutes she said casually he touched the scar on his cheek she didnt miss the movement mr dimitri would like you to join him for lunch he thought youd like to bathe and change first a reprieve very considerate rising she set her glass aside however im afraid you rushed me away without my luggage i simply havent a thing to wear mr dimitris seen to that taking her arm a little too firmly for comfort remo led her into the hall and up the sweeping stairs to the second floor it wasnt just the hallway that smelled like a funeral parlor she realized but the entire house he pushed open the door you got an hour be ready he doesnt like to be kept waiting whitney stepped inside and heard the lock turn behind her she covered her face with her hands a moment because she couldnt stop the shaking a minute she told herself as she began to breathe deeply she only needed a minute she was alive that was the point to concentrate on slowly she lowered her hands and looked around dimitri wasnt stingy she decided the suite hed given her was as elegant as the outside of the house had promised the sitting room was wide and long with porcelain vases of fresh flowers in abundance the colors were feminine roses and pearly grays on the silk wallpaper picking up the tones in the oriental rug on the floor the daybed was a deeper duskier hue plumped with handworked pillows all in all she decided professionally a neat stylish job then she was at the windows wrenching them open one look told her it was hopeless the drop was nearly a hundred feet from the ornate little balcony thered be no nimble leaping out as thered been in the coastal inn closing the windows again whitney began to explore the suite for other possibilities the bedroom was perfectly lovely with a large polished chippendale bed and delicate china lamps the rosewood armoire was already open showing her a selection of clothes no redblooded woman would turn her nose up at she fingered the sheer ivory silk of a sleeve and turned away it would appear dimitri expected her to be in residence for some time she could take it as a good sign or she could worry about it glancing over whitney caught a look at herself in a cheval mirror she walked closer her face was pale her clothes streaked and rent her eyes she saw were frightened again disgusted she began to pull off her blouse dimitri wasnt going to see some tattered quivering female over lunch she determined if she could do nothing else at the moment she could take care of that whitney macallister knew how to dress for any occasion she checked every door leading to her suite and found them all firmly locked from the outside every window she opened led her to the realization that she was well and truly trapped for now because it was the next logical step whitney gave herself to the luxury of a bath in the deep marble tub scented generously with the oils dimitri had provided on the vanity was makeup from foundation to mascara all in the brand and shades she preferred so he was thorough whitney told herself as she made use of it the perfect host a bottle of amethyst crystal held her scent she brushed her freshly shampooed hair then drew it back from her face with two motherofpearl combs another gift from her host going to the closet she gave her choice of outfit all the care and deliberation a warrior might have given to his choice of armor in her position she considered it every bit as important she chose a mint green sundress with yards of skirt and no back giving it a bit of flare with a silk scarf wound and knotted at her waist this time when she looked in the fulllength mirror she gave a nod of satisfaction she was ready for anything when the knock sounded on the door of the sitting room she answered it boldly she gave remo the cool iceprincess look doug admired mr dimitris waiting without a word she swept by him her palms were damp but she resisted the urge to curl her hands into fists instead she ran her fingers lightly over the banister as she descended the stairs if she was walking toward her execution she thought at least she was walking toward it in style pressing her lips together only briefly she followed remo through the house and out onto a wide flowerbordered terrace ms macallister at last she wasnt certain what shed expected certainly after all the horror stories shed lived through and heard she expected someone fierce and cruel and larger than life the man who rose from the smokedglass and wicker table was pale and small and unimpressive he had a round mild face and a thinning thatch of dark hair swept back from it his skin was pale so pale it looked as though he never saw the sun she had a quick giddy flash that if she poked her finger into his cheek it would collapse like soft warm dough his eyes were nearly colorless a light watery blue under dark inoffensive brows she couldnt decide if he were forty or sixty or somewhere in between his mouth was thin his nose small and his round cheeks unless she missed her guess had been lightly tinted with blusher the white rather dapper suit he wore didnt quite disguise his paunch it mightve been tempting to pass him off as a foolish little man but she noticed the nine thinly glossed nails and the stub of his pinky against the chubby glossy appearance the deformity clashed and rattled he held his hand palm out in greeting so that she could see where the skin had grown thick and tough over the ridge the palm was as smooth as a young girls whatever his appearance it wouldnt do to forget that dimitri was as dangerous and shrewd as anything that slithered out from the swamp the breadth of his power might not have been apparent on the surface but he dismissed the lean rangy remo with no more than a look im so pleased to have you join me my dear theres nothing so depressing as lunching alone ive some lovely campari he lifted yet another piece of waterford can i persuade you to try some she opened her mouth to speak and nothing came out it was the glint of pleasure in his eyes that had her stepping forward id love it whitney swept up to the table the closer she came the more the fear built it was irrational she thought he looked like someones pompous little uncle but the fear built his eyes she realized never seemed to blink he just stared and stared and stared she had to concentrate on keeping her hand steady as she reached for the glass your house mr dimitri is quite a showpiece i take that as a high compliment from someone with your professional reputation i was fortunate to find it on short notice he sipped then dabbed at his mouth delicately with white linen the owners were gracious enough to give it over to me for a few weeks im rather fond of the gardens a pleasant respite in this sticky heat in a courtly gesture he walked over to hold her chair whitney had to repress a surge of panic and revulsion im sure you must be hungry after your journey she looked over her shoulder and forced herself to smile actually i dined quite well last evening again due to your hospitality mild curiosity crossed his face as he walked back to his own chair indeed in the jeep douglas and i acquired from your employees at his nod she continued there was a lovely bottle of wine and a very enjoyable meal im rather fond of beluga she saw the caviar black and shiny heaped on ice beside her whitney helped herself i see she wasnt certain if shed annoyed or amused him taking a bite she smiled again i must say your pantrys well stocked i hope youll continue to find my hospitality to your liking you must try the lobster bisque my dear let me serve you with a grace and an economy of movement she wouldnt have expected dimitri dipped a silver ladle into the soup tureen remo informs me youve disposed of our mr lord thank you it smells marvelous whitney took her time sipping at the soup douglas was becoming a bit of a bother it was a game she told herself and shed just begun to play the little shell she wore swung lightly on its chain as she reached for her glass she was playing to win im sure you understand indeed dimitri ate slowly and with delicacy mr lords been a bother to me for some time stealing the papers from under your nose she saw the white manicured fingers tighten on the soupspoon a nerve she thought he wouldnt take kindly to being made a fool of she resisted the urge to swallow and smiled instead douglas was clever in his own fashion she said easily a pity he was so crude i suppose one must concede his cleverness to a point dimitri agreed unless i blame my own staff for ineptitude perhaps both are true he acknowledged this with the slightest of nods then again he had you whitney i may call you whitney of course i admit i did help him i believe in watching how the cards fall very wise there were several times when she trailed off going back to her soup i dont like speaking ill of the dead mr dimitri but douglas was often rash and illogical however he was easily led he watched her eat admiring the fineboned hands the glow of healthy young skin against the green dress it would be a pity to mar it perhaps he could find certain uses for her he thought of her installed in his house in connecticut dignified and elegant over meals submissive and obedient in bed and young and roughly attractive wouldnt you agree oh yes she managed another smile he was an intriguing diversion for a few weeks on the long run i prefer a man with style rather than physicality some caviar mr dimitri yes as he accepted the dish from her he let his skin rub hers and felt her stiffen at the brush of his deformed hand the small show of weakness excited him he remembered the pleasure it brought him to watch a praying mantis capture a moth the way the lean intelligent insect drew the frantic prey closer waiting patiently while the struggles slowed weakened until at last it devoured the bright fragile wings sooner or later the young the weak and the delicate always submitted like the mantis dimitri had patience and style and cruelty i must say i find it difficult to believe a woman of your sensitivity could shoot a man the vegetables in this salad are quite fresh im sure youll enjoy it as he spoke he began to toss the lettuce in a large serving bowl perfect for a sultry afternoon she agreed sensitivity whitney continued studying the liquid in her glass becomes secondary to necessity dont you think mr dimitri after all i am a businesswoman and as i said douglas was becoming a bit of a bother i believe in opportunities she lifted her glass smiling over the rim i saw the opportunity to be rid of a nuisance and to have the papers i merely took them he was after all only a thief precisely he was beginning to admire her though he wasnt completely convinced her cool demeanor was fact there was no denying breeding born the illegitimate son of a religious fanatic and an itinerant musician dimitri had a deeprooted respect and envy of breeding over the years hed had to make do with the closest thing to it power so you took the papers and found the treasure yourself it was simple enough the papers made it clear have you seen them no again she saw his fingers tighten only a sample of them oh well theyve done the job now in any case whitney dipped into her salad i still havent seen all of them he said mildly his eyes on hers she thought fleetingly that they were tucked away again in the jeep with doug im afraid you never will she told him letting the satisfaction of the truth ease her nerves i destroyed them after id finished i dont care for loose ends wise and what did you plan to do with the treasure do whitney glanced up in surprise why enjoy it of course exactly he agreed pleased and now i have it and you she waited a beat meeting his eyes directly the salad nearly stuck in her throat when one plays one must accept the prospect of losing no matter how distasteful well said now im dependent on your hospitality you see things very clearly whitney that pleases me it also pleases me to have beauty within arms length the food rolled uncomfortably in her stomach she held out her glass waiting until hed filled it to within an inch of the rim i hope you wont think me rude if i ask for how long you intend to extend me your hospitality he topped off his own glass and toasted her not at all for as long as it pleases me knowing if she put anything else in her stomach it might not stay down she ran a fingertip around the rim of the glass it occurred to me that you might be considering demanding a ransom from my father please my dear he gave her a light smile touched with disapproval i dont consider such things proper luncheon conversation just a thought i must ask you not to worry about such things id much prefer you to simply relax and enjoy your stay i trust your rooms are adequate lovely she found she wanted to scream now much more than shed wanted to when shed turned and faced barns his pale eyes stayed steady and open like a fishs or a dead mans briefly she lowered her lashes i havent thanked you for the wardrobe which as it happens i was in desperate need of think nothing of it perhaps youd like a stroll through the gardens he rose coming over to draw back her chair afterward i imagine youd like a siesta the heat here in midafternoon is oppressive youre very considerate she laid her hand on his arm forcing her fingers not to curl youre my guest my dear a very welcome one a guest her smile was cool again her voice though she was amazed she accomplished it was ironic do you make it a habit to lock up your guests in their rooms mr dimitri i make it a habit he said lifting her fingers to his lips to lock up a treasure shall we walk whitney tossed her hair back shed find the way out smiling at him she promised herself shed find the way out if she didnt she still felt the cold brush of his lips on her skin shed be dead of course chapter fifteen so far so good it wasnt a very positive statement but it was the best whitney could do shed gotten through the first day as dimitris guest without any problems and without any bright ideas of how to check out in one piece hed been gracious courteous her slightest whim had been at her fingertips shed tested it by expressing a mild craving for chocolate soufflé it had been served to her at the end of a long extraordinary sevencourse meal though shed wracked her brain during the three hours shed been locked in her rooms that afternoon whitney had come up blank there was no breaking through the doors no jumping out the window and the phone in her sitting room was only good for inhouse calls she might have considered making a break for it during the afternoon stroll in the gardens even as shed been working out the details dimitri had plucked her a blush pink rosebud and confided in her how distressing it was for him to have to arrange for armed guards around the perimeter of the grounds security as he put it was the burden of the successful as theyd reached the edge of the garden hed casually pointed out one of his staff the wideshouldered man had worn a trim dark suit sported a natty moustache and carried a small deadly uzi whitney had decided shed prefer a more subtle means of escape than a wild dash across the wideopen grounds she tried to think of one during her afternoon confinement sooner or later her father would become concerned by her prolonged absence but it might take another month before that came to pass dimitri would want to leave the island at some point probably soon since he had his hands on the treasure whether she went with him or not and was afforded more opportunities for escape was dependent on his whim whitney didnt care for having her fate rest on the whim of a man who wore blusher and paid others to kill for him so she paced the suite through the afternoon thinking up and rejecting plans as basic as tying the sheets together and climbing out the window and as complicated as carving her way through the walls with a butter knife in the end she dressed in the sheer ivory silk that clung to every subtle curve and glittered with tiny seed pearls for the better part of two hours she faced dimitri across a long elegant mahogany table that gleamed dully under the light of two dozen candles from the escargot to the soufflé and dom perignon the meal was exquisite in every detail chopin floated quietly in the background while they spoke of literature and art there was no denying that dimitri was a connoisseur of such things and that he would have fit into the most exclusive club without a ripple before it was over theyd dissected a tennessee williams play discussed the intricacies of the french impressionists and debated the subtleties of the mikado as the soufflé melted in her mouth whitney found herself yearning for the sticky rice and fruit shed shared with doug one night in a cave while her conversation with dimitri ran smoothly she remembered all the arguments and sniping shed had with doug the silk lay cool on her shoulders shed have traded the fivehundreddollar dress in a heartbeat for the stiff cotton sack shed worn on the road to the coast under the circumstances with her life on the line it might have been difficult to say she was bored she was miserably you seem a bit distant this evening my dear oh whitney brought herself back its an excellent meal mr dimitri but the entertainment is perhaps a bit lax a young vital woman demands something more exciting with a benevolent smile he pressed a button at his side almost instantaneously a whitesuited oriental entered ms macallister and i will have coffee in the library its quite extensive he added as the oriental backed out of the room im pleased you share my affection for the written word she might have refused but the idea of seeing more of the house could lead to finding some route of escape it never hurt to have an edge she decided she smiled and nudged her dinner knife into the open evening bag shed placed by her plate its always a pleasure to spend the evening with a man who appreciates the finer things whitney rose clipping the bag shut she accepted his arm and told herself she would without compunction stick the knife into his heart at the first opportunity when a man travels as i do he began its often necessary to take certain things of import along the right wine the proper music a few volumes of literature he walked smoothly through the house smelling lightly of cologne the formal white dinner jacket fit without a wrinkle he was feeling benevolent tolerant too many weeks had passed since hed had a young beautiful woman to dine with he opened the tall double doors of the library and ushered her inside browse if you like my dear he told her indicating the two levels of books the room had terrace doors that was something she made note of immediately if there was any way to get out of her room during the night this might be the method of escape all shed have to do then would be to get past the guards and the guns one step at a time whitney reminded herself as she skimmed a fingertip over leatherbound volumes my father has a library like this she commented i always found it a cozy place to spend the evening cozier with coffee and brandy dimitri poured the brandy himself while the oriental entered with the silver service do give chan your knife my dear hes very particular about the washing up whitney turned to see dimitri watching her with a small smile and eyes that reminded her of a reptile flat cold and dangerously patient without a word she took out the knife and handed it over to the servant all the oaths that were on her tongue the temper tantrum she barely held back werent going to help her out of this one brandy dimitri asked when chan left them alone yes thank you as cool as he whitney crossed the room and held out her hand did you think to kill me with your dinner knife my dear she shrugged then downed brandy it rolled in her stomach then settled it was a thought he laughed a long rumbling sound that was indescribably unpleasant he was again thinking of the mantis and the struggles of the moth i admire you whitney i really do he touched his glass to hers swirled brandy and drank i imagine youd like to get a good look at the treasure again after all you hadnt much time for it today had you no remo was in quite a hurry my fault my dear truly my fault he touched a hand lightly to her shoulder i was impatient to meet you to make amends ill give you all the time youd like right now he walked to the shelves along the east wall and drew back a section of books whitney saw the safe without surprise it was a common enough camouflage she wondered only a moment how hed happened to learn of its presence from the owners then she tipped back her brandy again she was certain there was no aspect of the house they hadnt told him of before theyd given it over to him he made no attempt to hide the combination from her as he spun the knob damn sure of himself whitney decided as she memorized the sequence a man that sure of himself deserved a good kick in the ass ah the sound was like a sigh over the smell of rich food as he drew out the old box hed already had it cleaned so that the wood shone quite a collectors piece yes whitney swirled the brandy it was as smooth and warm as any shed ever tasted she wondered what good it would do to toss it in his face i thought the same thing myself he cradled it in his hands carefully almost hesitantly like a new father with an infant its difficult for me to imagine someone with such delicate hands digging in the ground even for this whitney smiled thinking what her delicate hands had been through over the last week i havent much aptitude for manual labor but it was necessary she turned her hand over studying it critically i will admit id planned on a manicure before remo issued your invitation this little ventures been death on my hands well arrange for one tomorrow in the meantime he set the chest down on the wide library table enjoy taking him at his word whitney moved over to the box and tossed back the lid the gems were no less impressive now than theyd been that morning reaching in she drew out the necklace of diamonds and sapphires doug had admired no gloated over she recalled with a half smile shed take her cue from that fabulous she breathed utterly fabulous one can grow so weary of neat little strands of pearls you hold approximately a quarter of a million dollars in your hand her lips curved a pleasant thought his heart beat a little faster as he watched her holding the jewels close as the queen might have done not too long before her humiliation and death such gems belong against a womans skin yes with a laugh she held them up against her the sapphires glowed like dark brilliant eyes diamonds shivered excitedly its lovely and undoubtedly expensive but this she dropped the strand back into the box and chose the manytiered diamond necklace this makes a statement how do you suppose marie managed to get it from the comtesse so you believe its the infamous necklace of the diamond affair shed pleased him again i prefer to whitney let the necklace drip through her fingers and catch the light it was as doug had once said of the sydney like holding heat and ice at the same time i like to believe she was clever enough to turn the tables on the people whod tried to use her she tried a ruby bracelet on for size considering it gerald lebrun lived like a pauper with a queens ransom under his floor odd dont you think loyaltys odd unless its enhanced by fear he took the necklace from her examining it for the first time she saw the greed without the polish his eyes glowed very much as barnss had when hed pointed a gun at her kneecap his tongue came out slowly to run over his lips when he spoke again his voice had the resonance the fervor of an evangelist the revolution itself a fascinating time of upheaval death retribution cant you feel it when you hold these in your hands blood despair lust power peasants and politicians overthrowing a centuriesold monarchy how he smiled at her with the diamonds gleaming in his hands and the fever burning in his eyes fear what more appropriate name than the reign of terror what more suitable spoils than a dead queens vanity he relished it whitney could see it in his eyes it wasnt simply the jewels but the blood on them he coveted she felt her fear die under waves of revulsion doug had been right she realized it was the winning that counted she hadnt lost yet a man like lord wouldve fenced all this for a fraction of its value peasant she lifted her snifter again a man like you would have different plans perceptive as well as beautiful hed married his second wife because her skin had been as pure as fresh cream hed gotten rid of her because her brain had been about the same consistency whitney was becoming more intriguing calmer he ran the necklace through his hands i plan to enjoy the treasure the cash value means little im a very rich man it wasnt said offhandedly but with relish being rich was as important as virility as intellect more he thought because money could cushion the lack of either collecting he skimmed a finger over the bracelet and onto her wrist things has become a hobby at times an obsessive one he could call it a hobby she thought hed killed time and time again for the box and its contents yet it meant no more to him than a handful of brightly colored rocks to a young boy she fought to keep the revulsion off her face and the accusation from her voice would you think me a poor sport if i told you i wish you hadnt managed this particular hobby quite so well sighing she ran a hand over the glittering jewels id grown rather fond of the idea of owning all this on the contrary i admire your honesty leaving her beside the chest dimitri walked over to pour the coffee and i understand you worked very hard for maries treasure yes i whitney broke off im curious mr dimitri just how did you learn of the treasure business cream my dear no thank you black fighting to hold back her impatience whitney crossed the room to the coffee service did lord tell you about whitaker asked her host whitney accepted the coffee then forced herself to sit only that hed acquired the papers and then decided to put them on the market whitaker was a bit of a fool but at times he was clever enough hed been at one time a business partner with harold r bennett you recognize the name of course she said it easily while her mind began to work frantically hadnt doug mentioned a general once yes thered been a general whod been negotiating with lady smythewright for the papers bennetts a retired fivestar general and quite a businessman hes had some dealings with my father professionally and on the golf course which almost amounts to the same thing ive always preferred chess to golf dimitri commented in the ivory silk she shimmered so much that she might have replaced the glass queen that was in shards now he remembered how well it had fit his hand so you know of general bennetts reputation hes well known as a patron of the arts and a collector of the old and unique a few years ago he led an expedition in the caribbean and discovered a sunken spanish galleon he recovered somewhere around five and a half million in artifacts coins and jewels what whitaker pretended to do bennett did and very successfully youre well informed i like that he added cream and two generous teaspoons of sugar to his own coffee bennett enjoys the hunt shall we say egypt new zealand the congo hes looked for and found the priceless according to whitaker he was in the first stages of working out a deal with lady smythewright for the papers shed inherited whitaker had his connections and a certain amount of charm where women were concerned he slipped the deal from under bennetts nose but unfortunately he was an amateur with a weak heart whitney remembered so you learned from him where the papers were kept and hired douglas to steal them acquire them dimitri corrected delicately whitaker refused even under duress to tell me the contents of all the documents but he did inform me that bennetts interest stemmed primarily from the cultural value of the treasure its history naturally the idea of acquiring a treasure that had belonged to marie antoinette whom i admired particularly for her opulence and ambition was irresistible naturally if you dont plan to sell the contents of the box mr dimitri what do you plan to do with it why have it whitney he smiled at her fondle it gaze upon it own it while dougs attitude had frustrated her at least she understood it hed seen the treasure as a means to an end dimitri saw it as a personal possession a dozen arguments sprang up in her mind she repressed them im sure marie would have approved as he considered this dimitri gazed toward the ceiling royalty was another of his fascinations she would have yes greed is looked on as one of the seven deadly sins but so few understand its basic pleasure he dabbed his mouth with a linen napkin before he rose i hope youll forgive me my dear im accustomed to retiring early he pressed a small button that was worked cleverly into the carving on the mantel perhaps youd like to choose a book before you go up please dont think you have to entertain me mr dimitri ill be quite happy on my own just browsing with another smile he patted her hand perhaps another time whitney im sure you need your rest after your experiences of the last few weeks there was a quiet knock at the door remo will show you to your room sleep well thank you she set down her coffee cup and rose but had taken no more than two steps when dimitris hand clamped over her wrist she looked down at the lightly polished nails and the stub the bracelet my dear his fingers pressed hard enough to rub against bone she didnt wince sorry she said easily holding her hand out dimitri unhooked the gold and rubies from her wrist youll join me for breakfast i hope of course whitney swept toward the door pausing as dimitri opened it she stood trapped between him and remo goodnight goodnight whitney she held to cool silence until the door of the sitting room locked behind her sonofabitch disgusted she took off the delicate italian slippers that had been provided for her and threw them at the wall trapped she thought locked up just as tidily as the treasure chest to be gazed upon fondled owned in a pigs eye she said aloud she wanted to weep and wail and beat her fists against the locked door instead she stripped off the ivory silk and left it in a heap before she marched into the bedroom shed find a way whitney promised herself shed find a way out and when she did dimitri would pay for every minute shed been his prisoner for a moment she rested her head against the armoire because the urge to weep was almost too strong to resist after shed controlled it whitney reached inside for a teal blue kimono she needed to think that was all she just needed to think the scent of flowers permeated the room air she decided and marched to the french doors that led to the tiny bedroom balcony with her teeth set she yanked open the doors it was going to rain she thought good the rain and wind might help clear her head resting her hands on the rail she leaned out looking toward the bay how had she gotten herself in this mess she demanded the answer was plain two words doug lord after all shed been minding her own business when hed barged into her life and embroiled her in treasure hunts killers and thieves at this moment instead of being trapped like rapunzel shed have been sitting in some nice smokechoked club watching people show off their clothes or their new hairstyles normal stuff she thought grimly now look at her locked in a house in madagascar with a smiling middleaged killer and his entourage in new york she had an entourage and no one would have dared turn a key on her doug lord she muttered aloud then looked down numbly as a hand clamped over hers on the rail whitney drew in her breath to scream when the head popped over yeah its me doug said between his teeth now help me over goddammit she forgot everything shed just been thinking about him and bent over to cover his face with kisses who said there wasnt any seventh cavalry look sugar i appreciate the welcome but im losing my grip give me a hand howd you find me she demanded as she reached down to help him over the rail i didnt think youd ever come there are guards out there with these nasty little machine guns my doorsre all locked from the outside and jesus if id remembered you talked so much i wouldnt have bothered he landed lightly on his feet douglas she wanted to cry again but held the tears back its so nice of you to drop in like this yeah he strolled through the french doors into the opulent bedroom well i wasnt sure you wanted any company especially after that cozy little dinner you had with dimitri were you watching ive been around turning he fingered the rich silk of her lapel he gave you this her eyes narrowed at the tone her chin tilted just what are you implying looks like a nice setup he wandered to her dresser and drew the top from a crystal decanter of scent all the comforts of home right i hate to state the obvious but youre an ass and whatre you he pushed the stopper back into the bottle with a snap walking around in fancy silk dresses he bought for you drinking champagne with him letting him put his hands on you his hands on me she said the words slowly letting them sink in doug gave her a look that skimmed from her bare legs to the milky skin of her throat you sure know how to smile at a man dont you sugar whats your cut each step measured whitney walked over reared back and slapped him as hard as she could for a long moment there was nothing but the sound of their breathing and the wind kicking up against the open windows youll get away with that once doug said softly as he ran the back of his hand over his cheek dont try it again im not a gentleman like your dimitri just get out whitney whispered get the hell out i dont need you there was an ache in him that far outdid the sting in his cheek dont you think i can see that you dont see anything ill tell you what i saw sugar i saw an empty hotel suite i saw that you and the box were gone and i saw you here nuzzling up to that bastard over a rack of lamb youd have rather found me tied to the bedpost with bamboo shoots under my nails she turned away sorry to disappoint you well why dont you tell me what the hells going on then why should i furious she brushed a tear away with the back of her hand damn she hated to cry worse she hated to cry for a man youve already made up your mind your very limited mind doug dragged a hand through his hair and wished he had a drink look ive been going crazy for hours it took me the better part of the afternoon to find this place then i had to get through the guards and one of them he didnt add was lying in the bushes with a slit throat when i get here i see you dressed like a princess smiling across the table at dimitri as though you were the best of friends what the hell was i supposed to do run around naked spit in his eye dammit my lifes on the line if i have to play the game until i find a way out then ill play you can call me a coward if you like but not a whore she turned back again her eyes dark wet and angry not a whore do you understand he felt as though hed just struck something small and soft and defenseless he hadnt been sure hed find her alive then when he had shed looked so cool so beautiful and worse so in control but shouldnt he know her by now i didnt mean that im sorry edgy he began to pace he plucked a rose from a vase and snapped the stem in half christ i dont know half of what im saying ive been going nuts ever since i walked into the hotel and you were gone i imagined all kinds of things and that i was going to be too late to stop any of them he looked dispassionately at the tiny drop of blood on his finger where a thorn had pierced the skin he had to take a deep breath and he had to say it quietly dammit whitney i care i really care about you i didnt know what id find when i got here she wiped at another tear and sniffed you were worried about me yeah he shrugged then tossed the mangled rose onto the floor there was no explaining to her even to himself the sick dread the guilt the grief hed lived with during those endless hours i didnt mean to jump all over you like that is that an apology yes dammit he spun back his face a study in frustration and fury you want me to crawl maybe she smiled and walked toward him maybe later jesus his hands werent quite steady when they reached for her face but his mouth was firm and a little desperate i didnt think id ever see you again i know she pressed against him wild with relief just hold me a minute after were out of here ill hold you as long as you want taking her shoulders he drew her away youve got to tell me what happened and what the setup is here she nodded then sank down on the edge of the bed why were her knees weak now when there was hope remo and that barns character came he saw the quick nervous swallow and cursed himself again they hurt you no you hadnt been gone very long id just run a bath why didnt they hold you there until i got back whitney lifted a foot and examined her toes because i told them id killed you his face for a brief instant was a study of incredulity what well it wasnt difficult to convince them that i was a great deal smarter than you and that id put a bullet in your brain so i could have the treasure to myself after all theydve done the same thing to each other at the first opportunity and i was convincing smarter than me dont be offended darling they bought it not particularly pleased he dipped his hands in his pockets they believed that a skinny female got the drop on me im a professional i hated to tarnish your reputation but it seemed like a good idea at the time dimitri bought it too apparently i opted to play the materialminded heartless woman with an eye on opportunity i believe hes quite charmed with me ill bet i wanted to spit in his eye she said so fiercely doug cocked a brow i still want the chance to i dont even think hes human he just slides from place to place leaving a slimy trail spouting off his love for the finer things he wants to hoarde the treasure like a little boy hoarding chocolate bars he wants to open the box look fondle and think of the screams of people as the guillotine falls he wants to relive the fear see the blood it means more to him that way all the lives he took to get it mean nothing to him her fingers closed over jacquess shell they mean absolutely nothing to him doug moved over to kneel in front of her were going to spit in his eye for the first time he closed his fingers over hers on the shell i promise do you know where hes stashed it the treasure a cold smile moved over her face oh yes he took great pleasure in showing it to me hes so damn sure of himself so sure hes got me pinned doug drew her to her feet lets go get it sugar it took him a little under two minutes to trip the lock with the door open only a crack he peered out to check for guards in the hall okay now we move fast and quiet whitney slipped her hand in his and stepped into the hall the house was silent apparently when dimitri retired everyone retired in darkness they moved down the staircase to the first floor the funeralparlor smell flowers and polish hung thick whitney used a gesture of the hand to show doug which way keeping close to the wall they made their way slowly toward the library dimitri hadnt bothered to lock the door doug was a little disappointed and a little wary that it was so easy they slipped inside rain began to patter against the windows whitney went directly to the shelves on the east wall and drew back the section of books its in here she whispered the combinations fiftytwo right thirtysix left how do you know the combination i saw him open it uneasy doug reached for the knob why the hell isnt he covering his tracks he muttered as he began to turn okay whats next another five to the left then twelve right she held her breath as doug drew down the handle the door of the safe opened without a sound come to poppa doug murmured as he drew out the box he checked its weight before he grinned at whitney he wanted to open it to take just one more look to gloat thered be other times lets get out of here sounds like an excellent idea tucking a hand through his arm she started toward the terrace doors shall we use these so we dont disturb our host it seems like the considerate thing to do as he reached for the knob the doors swung open facing them were three men guns glittering wet in the rain in the center remo grinned mr dimitri doesnt want you to leave until he buys you a drink yes indeed the library doors opened still in his white dinner jacket dimitri strolled through i cant have my guests going out in the rain do come back and sit down the amiable host he went to the bar and poured brandy my dear that colors superb on you doug felt the barrel of remos gun at the base of his spine i dont like to impose nonsense nonsense he swirled the brandy as he turned at his touch the room flooded with light whitney would have sworn at that moment his eyes had no color at all sit down the quiet order had all the charm of the hiss of a snake pressed by the barrel of the gun doug came forward the chest in one hand and whitneys palm in the other nothing like a brandy on a rainy night precisely graciously he passed two snifters to them whitney her name came out on a sigh as he gestured toward a chair you disappoint me i didnt give her much choice doug threw dimitri an arrogant look a woman like her worries about her skin i admire chivalry especially from so unlikely a source he tipped his glass at doug before he drank im afraid i was aware of whitneys unfortunate attachment to you all along my dear did you really think i believed youd shot our mr lord she shrugged and though her hands were damp on the snifter drank i suppose i have to work on my skill as a liar indeed you have very expressive eyes even in the glasses of thine eyes i see thy grieved heart he quoted from richard ii in his smooth poets voice however i did enjoy our evening together whitney brushed a hand over the short skirt of her robe im afraid i was a bit bored his lips curled back everyone in the room knew it would take only a word from him only a word and shed be dead instead he chose to chuckle women are such unstable creatures would you agree mr lord some show particularly good taste it amazes me that someone with miss macallisters inherent style would have an affection for someone of your class but he moved his shoulders romance has always been a mystery to me remo relieve mr lord of the box if you please and his weapons just set them on the table for now while his orders were carried out dimitri sipped his brandy and seemed to ponder great thoughts i took the risk that you would want to retrieve both miss macallister and the treasure after all this time after this very intriguing chess game weve been playing i must say im disappointed to have you checkmated with such ease id hoped for a little more flare at the end you want to send your boys away you and i could probably come up with something he laughed again ice clinking on ice im afraid my days of physical combat are over mr lord i prefer more subtle ways of settling disputes a knife in the back dimitri merely lifted a brow at whitneys question im forced to admit that one on one youd far outmatch me mr lord after all youre young and physically agile im afraid i require the handicap of my staff now he touched his finger to his lips what are we to do about this situation oh hes enjoying this whitney thought grimly hes like a spider merrily spinning a web to catch flies so he can suck the blood from them he wanted to see them sweat because there was no way out she slipped her hand into dougs and squeezed they wouldnt grovel and by god they wouldnt sweat as i see it mr lord your fate is really quite elemental in essence youve been a dead man for weeks its simply a matter of method doug gulped down brandy and grinned dont let me rush you no no ive been giving the matter a great deal of thought a great deal unfortunately i havent the facilities here to carry things out in the style i prefer but i believe remo has a strong desire to take care of the matter though he did fumble quite a bit on this project i feel the ultimate success deserves a reward dimitri drew out one of his rich black cigarettes ill give you mr lord remo he lit the cigarette and looked out through the fine mist of smoke kill him slowly doug felt the cool barrel of the gun below his left ear mind if i finish my brandy first by all means with a gracious nod dimitri turned his attention to whitney as to you my dear i might have preferred a few more days in your company id thought perhaps we could share some mutual pleasures however he tapped the cigarette in a clear crystal tray under the circumstances that would add complications one of my staff has admired you since i showed him your picture a case of love at first sight he smoothed the thinning hair back from his forehead barns take her with my blessing but do be tidy this time no doug leapt up from his chair in an instant his arms were clamped behind him and a gun was lodged against his throat hearing barnss giggle he struggled despite them shes worth more than that he said desperately her fatherd pay you a million two million to get her back dont be a fool dimitri give her to this little creep shes worth nothing to you not all of us think in terms of money mr lord dimitri said calmly theres a matter of principle at stake you see i believe as strongly in reward as i do in discipline his gaze flicked down to his mutilated hand yes just as strongly take him along remo hes creating quite a fuss keep your hands off me springing up whitney dashed the contents of her snifter in barnss face with fury carrying her she doubled up her fist and planted it squarely on his nose his squeak and the squirt of blood gave her momentary satisfaction doug took his cue from her and bracing himself against the man behind him reared back and smashed his foot under the chin of the man across from him they mightve been mowed down in that instant if dimitri hadnt signaled he enjoyed watching the doomed struggle calmly he took the derringer from his inside pocket and fired into the vaulted ceiling thatll do he told them as if speaking to obstreperous adolescents he watched tolerantly as doug gathered whitney to his side he was particularly fond of shakespeares tragedies that dealt with starcrossed lovers not only because of the beauty of words but because of their hopelessness im a reasonable man and a romantic at heart in order to give you a bit more time together miss macallister is welcome to go along while remo proceeds with the execution execution whitney spat at him with all the venom a desperate woman can gather murder dimitri doesnt have such a clean cool ring to it you delude yourself into believing youre cultured and suave do you think a silk dinner jacket can hide what you are and what youll never be youre nothing more than a crow dimitri a crow picking at carrion you dont even kill for yourself normally no his voice had frozen those of his men who had heard the tone before tensed in this case however perhaps i should make an exception he lowered the derringer the terrace doors burst open shattering glass put up your arms the order was authoritative delivered in english with a classy french accent doug didnt wait for the outcome but shoved whitney behind a chair he saw barns grab for his gun the grin was blown off his face the house is surrounded ten uniformed men trooped into the library rifles at the ready franco dimitri you are under arrest for murder conspiracy to commit murder kidnapping holy shit whitney murmured as the list lengthened it really is the cavalry yeah doug let out a breath of relief holding her warm beside him it was also the police he reflected he wouldnt exactly come out smelling like a rose himself he saw with a feeling of inevitability and disgust the man with the panama walk through the doors i shouldve smelled cop he muttered a man with a shock of white hair strode into the room with an air of impatience all right where is that girl doug saw whitneys eyes widen until they seemed to cover her whole face then with a bubbling giggle she sprang up from behind the chair daddy chapter sixteen it didnt take long for the malagasy police to clear out the room whitney watched the handcuffs being snapped onto dimitris wrist below a fat emerald cuff link whitney mr lord dimitris voice remained soft cultured calm a man in his position understood temporary setbacks but his eyes as his gaze passed over them were as flat as a goats im sure yes quite sure well see each other again well catch you on the eleven oclock news doug told him i owe you dimitri acknowledged with a nod i always pay my debts whitneys gaze met his briefly and she smiled once again her fingers trailed down to the shell around her neck for jacques she said softly i hope they find a hole dark enough for you then she buried her face against her fathers cleansmelling jacket im so glad to see you explanations but macallister held her fiercely for a moment lets have some whitney she drew away eyes laughing explain what he struggled with a grin and huffed instead nothing changes hows mother i hope you didnt tell her you were trailing after me shes fine she thinks im in rome working if id told her i was chasing our only daughter all over madagascar she wouldnt have been able to play bridge for days youre so clever she kissed him hard how did you know to chase me all over madagascar i believe youve met general bennett whitney turned and faced a tall rangy man with stern unsmiling eyes of course she offered her hand as though they were at a wellmannered cocktail party at the stevensons year before last how are you general oh i dont believe youve met douglas doug whitney signaled to him across the room where he was mumbling out a tangled statement to one of the malagasy officials grateful for the respite he went to her daddy general bennett this is douglas lord dougs the one who stole the papers general the smile turned a little sickly on dougs face nice to meet you you owe douglas quite a bit she told the general and poked in her fathers jacket for a cigarette owe the general blustered this thief secured the papers keeping them out of the hands of dimitri at the risk of his own life she added holding up the cigarette for a light doug obliged her deciding hed leave the explanations to her after all she sent him a wink as she blew out smoke you see it all started when dimitri hired doug to steal the papers of course doug knew right away that they were priceless and had to be kept out of the wrong hands she drew in smoke then waved the cigarette expressively he virtually took his life in his hands to secure them i cant tell you how many times he told me if we found the treasure what a priceless contribution to society it would be isnt that so doug well i hes so modest you really must take credit where credits due darling after all securing the treasure for general bennetts foundation nearly cost you your life it was nothing doug muttered he could see the rainbow beginning to fade nothing whitney shook her head general as a man of action youd appreciate just what doug went through to prevent dimitri from hoarding the treasure hoarding she repeated he intended to keep it to himself to wallow in it she added with a slanted look at doug when as we all will agree it belongs to society yes but before you express your gratitude general she interrupted id appreciate it if youd explain to me just how you arrived here we do owe you our lives flattered and confused the general began an explanation whitakers nephew terrified by his uncles fate had gone to the general confessing everything he knew which was considerable once the general had been alerted he hadnt hesitated the authorities had been on dimitris trail before whitney and doug had climbed off the plane at antananarivo dimitris trail had led to doug and dougs because of their escapades in new york and dc to whitney she had reason to be grateful to the evereager paparazzi for several grainy pictures in the tabloids her fathers secretary poured over after a brief session with uncle max in washington the general and macallister had hired a private detective the man in the panama hat had picked up their trail dogging them just as dimitri had when theyd jumped from the train heading toward tamatave both the general and macallister had been on a plane to madagascar the authorities there had been only too happy to cooperate in the capture of an international criminal fascinating whitney said when it looked like the generals monologue would go on until dawn simply fascinating i can see why you earned those five stars hooking her arm through his she smiled you saved my life general i hope youll give me the pleasure of showing you the treasure with a cocky smile over her shoulder she led him away macallister drew out a cigarette case and flipped it open offering it to doug nobody bullshits like whitney he said easily i dont believe youve met brickman he gestured to the man in the panama hes worked for me before one of the best hes said the same of you doug eyed the man in the panama each man recognized the other for what he was you were at the canal just behind remo brickman remembered the crocks and smiled my pleasure now macallister looked from one man to the other he hadnt succeeded in business without knowing what went on in mens minds why dont we get a drink and you can tell me what really happened doug flipped his lighter and studied macallisters face it was tanned and smooth a sure sign of wealth his voice had the ring of authority the eyes that looked back at him were dark as whiskey as amused as whitneys dougs lips tilted dimitris a pig but he stocks a good bar scotch it was nearly dawn when doug looked down on whitney she was curled naked under the thin sheet a slight smile touched her lips as though she were dreaming of the rush of lovemaking theyd shared after theyd returned to the hotel but her breathing was slow and even as she slept the sleep of the exhausted he wanted to touch her but he didnt hed thought of leaving her a note but he didnt he was who he was what he was a thief a nomad a loner for the second time in his life hed held the world in his hands and for the second time it had vanished it would be possible after a time to convince himself that hed come across that big break again the end of the rainbow just as it would be possible after a very long time to convince himself that he and whitney had had a fling fun and games nothing serious hed convince himself because those damn strings were tightening around him it was break them now or not at all he still had the ticket to paris and a check for five thousand the general had written to him after whitney had had the retired soldier bubbling with gratitude but hed seen the look in the eyes of the officials of the private detective who recognized a con and a thief when he saw one hed earned a reprieve but the next dark alley was just around the corner doug glanced at the pack and thought of her notebook he knew his tab came to more than the five thousand he had at his disposal going over he rummaged through her pack until he found the pad and pencil after the final total which caused him to lift a brow he scribbled a brief message iou sugar dropping both back in the pack he took a last look at her while she slept he slipped from the room like the thief he was silently and swiftly the moment she woke whitney knew he was gone it wasnt a matter of the bed being empty beside her another woman might have assumed hed gone out for coffee or a walk another woman might have called his name in a husky sleepy voice she knew he was gone it was in her nature to face things directly when there wasnt a choice whitney rose pulled back the blinds and began to pack because silence was unbearable she switched on the radio without bothering to fiddle with the dial she noticed the boxes tumbled on the floor determined to keep occupied she began to open them her fingers slid over the flimsy lingerie doug had picked out for her she gave a quick tilted smile at the receipt with her creditcard imprint because shed decided that cynicism would be her best defense whitney slipped into the pale blue teddy after all shed paid for it tossing the box aside she drew off the lid of the next the dress was rich rich blue the color she remembered of the butterflies shed seen and admired cynicism and all other defenses threatened to crumble swallowing tears she bundled the dress back into the box it wouldnt travel well she told herself and yanked a pair of wrinkled slacks out of her pack in a few hours shed be back in new york in her own milieu surrounded by her own friends doug lord would be a vague and expensive memory that was all dressed packed and utterly calm she went to check out and meet her father he was already in the lobby pacing impatient deals were cooking the icecream business was dogeatdog wheres your boyfriend he demanded daddy really whitney signed her bill with a flourish and a completely steady hand a woman doesnt have boyfriends she has lovers she smiled at the bellboy and followed him out to the car her father had waiting he huffed not entirely pleased with her terminology so where is he doug she gave her father an unconcerned look over her shoulder as she climbed into the back seat of the limo why i have no idea paris perhaps he had a ticket scowling macallister plopped back against the seat what the hells going on whitney i think i might spend a few days on long island when we get back i tell you all this travelings exhausting whitney he clamped a hand over hers using the tone hed used since she was two it had never been overly successful why did he leave she reached in her fathers pocket drew out his cigarette case and chose one staring straight ahead she tapped the cigarette on the dull gold lid because thats his style slipping out in the middle of the night without a sound without a word hes a thief you know so he told me last night while you were busy bullshitting bennett dammit whitney by the time he was finished my hair was standing on end it was worse than reading the report from the detective the two of you nearly got yourselves killed half a dozen times it concerned us a bit at the time too she murmured youd do my ulcer a world of good if youd marry that emptyheaded weakjawed carlyse sorry then id have one he studied the cigarette shed yet to light i got the impression you were attached to this young thief youd picked up attached the cigarette snapped in her fingers no it was strictly business tears welled up and spilled over but she continued to speak calmly i was bored and he provided entertainment entertainment expensive entertainment she added the bastards gone off owing me twelve thousand three hundred and fiftyeight dollars and fortyseven cents macallister took out his handkerchief and dried her cheeks nothing like losing a few thousand to bring on the waterworks he murmured often happens to me he didnt even say goodbye she whispered curling into her father she wept because there didnt seem to be anything else she could do new york in august can be vicious the heat can hang shimmer gloat and roll when a garbage strike coincided with a heat wave tempers became as ripe as the air even the more fortunate who could summon an airconditioned limo at the snap of a finger tended to turn surly after two weeks of ninetydegreeplus weather it was a time when anyone who could arrange it fled the city for the islands for the country for europe whitney had had her fill of traveling she stuck it out in manhattan when the majority of her friends and acquaintances jumped ship she turned down offers for a cruise on the aegean a week on the italian riviera and a monthlong honeymoon in the country of her choice she worked because it was an interesting way to ignore the heat she played because it was more productive than moping she considered taking a trip to the orient but just to be obstinate in september when everyone else trickled back to new york when shed returned from madagascar shed treated herself to a wild indulgent shopping spree half of what shed bought still hung unworn in her alreadycrowded closet shed hit the clubs every night for more than two weeks hopping from one to the next and tumbling into bed after sunrise when she lost interest in that she threw herself into her work with such vigor her friends began to mutter among themselves it was one thing for her to exhaust herself with rounds of parties quite another to do so during working hours whitney did what she did best she ignored them completely tad dont make a fool of yourself again i simply cant bear it her voice was careless but more sympathetic than cruel over the past few weeks hed nearly convinced her that he cared for her almost as much as his collection of silk ties whitney blond tailored and a little drunk he stood in the doorway of her apartment trying to figure the best way to ease himself inside she blocked him without effort wed make a good team it doesnt matter that my mother thinks youre flighty flighty whitney rolled her eyes at the term listen to your mother tad id make a perfectly dreadful wife now go back down so your driver can take you home you know you cant drink more than two martinis without losing your grip whitney he grabbed her kissing her with passion if not with style let me send charles home ill spend the night your mother would send out the national guard she reminded him slipping out of his arms now go home and sleep off that third martini youll feel more like yourself tomorrow you dont take me seriously i dont take me seriously she corrected and patted his cheek now run along and listen to your mother she closed the door in his face the old battleax letting out a long breath she crossed to the bar after an evening with tad she deserved a nightcap if she hadnt been so restless so whatever shed never have let him convince her that she needed an evening of opera and congenial company opera wasnt high on her list of enjoyments and tad had never been the most congenial companion she splashed a healthy dose of cognac into a glass make it two will you sugar her fingers tightened on the glass her heart lodged in her throat but she didnt flinch she didnt turn calmly whitney turned over a second glass and filled it still slipping through keyholes douglas she wore the dress hed bought her in diegosuarez hed pictured her in it a hundred times he didnt know this was the first time shed put it on and that shed done so in defiance nor did he know that because of it shed thought of him all evening out pretty late arent you she told herself she was strong enough to handle it after all shed had weeks to get over him one brow cocked she turned he was dressed in black and it suited him plain black tshirt snug black jeans the costume of his trade she mused as she held out the glass she thought his face looked leaner his eyes more intense then she tried not to think at all how was paris okay he took the glass and restrained the urge to touch her hand howve you been how do i look it was a direct challenge look at me she demanded take a good long look he did her hair flowed sleekly down one shoulder held back with a crescentshaped pin of diamonds her face was as he remembered pale cool elegant her eyes were dark and arrogant as she watched him over the rim of her glass you look terrific he muttered thank you so to what do i owe this unexpected pleasure hed practiced what he was going to say how he was going to say it two dozen times in the last week hed been in new york that long vacillating between going to her and staying away just thought id see how you were he mumbled into his glass how sweet look i know you must think i ran out on you to the tune of twelve thousand three hundred and fiftyeight dollars and fortyseven cents he made a sound that mightve been a laugh nothing changes did you come to make good on the iou you left me i came because i had to dammit it oh unmoved she tossed back her drink she restrained herself from tossing the glass against the wall as well do you have another venture in mind that requires some ready capital you want to get a few shots in go ahead with a snap he set his glass down she stared at him a moment then shook her head turning away she set down her own glass and rested her palms against the table for the first time since hed known her her shoulders slumped and her voice was weary no i dont want to get any shots in doug im a bit tired youve seen that im fine now why dont you leave the same way you came in whitney dont touch me she murmured before hed taken two steps toward her the quiet even voice didnt quite hide the trickle of desperation underneath he lifted his hands palms out then let them drop okay he wandered the room a moment trying to find his way back to his original plan of attack you know i had pretty good luck in paris cleaned out five rooms in the hotel de crillon congratulations i was on a roll probably couldve spent the next six months picking off tourists he hooked his thumbs in his pockets so why didnt you just wasnt any fun you got trouble when the fun goes out of your work you know she turned back telling herself it was cowardly not to face him i suppose so you came back to the states for a change of scene i came back because i couldnt stay away from you anymore her expression didnt change but he saw her link her fingers together in the first outward show of nerves hed ever observed in her oh she said simply it seems an odd thing to say i didnt kick you out of the hotel room in diegosuarez no his gaze traveled slowly over her face as if he needed to find something you didnt kick me out then why did you leave because if id stayed idve done then what i guess im going to do now steal my purse she asked with a flippant toss of her head ask you to marry me it was the first time perhaps the only time hed seen her mouth fall open and hang there she looked as though someone had just stomped on her toes hed hoped for a bit more emotional reaction i guess that charmed the shit out of you helping himself he took his glass back to the bar pretty funny idea a guy like me proposing to a woman like you i dont know maybe it was the air or something but i started getting some funny ideas in paris about setting up housekeeping settling in kids whitney managed to close her mouth you did like doug she decided another drink was in order youre talking marriage as in till death us do part and joint tax returns yeah i decided im traditional even down to this when he went for something he went for it completely the policy didnt always work but it was his policy he reached in his pocket and drew out a ring the brilliance of the diamond caught the light and exploded with it whitney made a conscious effort to keep her mouth from dropping open again where did you i didnt steal it he snapped feeling foolish he tossed it up and clamped it in his palm exactly he amended and managed a half smile the diamond came out of maries treasure i pocketed it i guess youd call it a reflex i thought about fencing it but opening his hand he stared down at it had it set in paris i see look i know you wanted the treasure to go to museums and most of it did it still hurt there was a hell of a writeup in the paris papers bennett foundation recovers tragic queens booty diamond necklace sparks new theories and so on he moved his shoulders trying not to think of all those pretty shiny stones i decided to settle for the one rock even though just a couple of those bangles couldve set me up for life shrugging again he held the ring up by its thin gold band if it itches your conscience ill take the damn rock out and ship it off to bennett dont be insulting in a deft move she snatched it out of his hand my engagement ring isnt going in any museum besides and she smiled at him fully i also believe there are pieces of history that should belong to the individual a handson sort of thing she gave him her cool liftedbrow look are you traditional enough to get down on one knee not even for you sugar he gripped her left wrist and taking the ring from her slipped it on the third finger the look he gave her was long and steady deal deal she agreed and laughing launched herself into his arms damn you douglas ive been miserable for two months oh yeah he found he liked the idea almost as much as he liked kissing her again i see you like the dress i bought you you have excellent taste behind his back she turned her hand so she could watch the light bounce from the ring married she repeated trying out the word you mentioned settling in does that mean you plan to retire ive been giving it some thought you know he nuzzled into her neck so he could draw in the scent that had haunted him in paris ive never seen your bedroom really ill have to give you the grand tour youre a bit young to retire she added drawing away from him what do you plan to do with your spare time well when im not making love to you i thought i might run a business a pawnshop he nipped at her lip a restaurant he corrected smartass of course she nodded liking the idea here in new york a good place to start he let her go to pick up his glass maybe the end of the rainbow had been closer than hed thought all along start with one here then maybe chicago san francisco thing is im going to need a backer she ran her tongue around her teeth naturally any ideas he shot her the charming untrustworthy grin id like to keep it in the family uncle jack come on whitney you know i can do it forty thousand no make it fifty and ill set up the slickest little restaurant on the west side fifty thousand she mused moving toward her desk its a good investment id write up the menu myself supervise the kitchen id whatre you doing that would come to sixtytwo thousand three hundred and fiftyeight dollars and fortyseven cents all told with a brisk nod she doubleunderlined the total at twelve and a half percent interest he scowled down at the figures interest twelve and a half percent a more than reasonable rate i know but im a softie look were getting married right absolutely a wife doesnt charge her husband interest for chrissake this one does she murmured as she continued jotting down numbers i can figure out the monthly payments in just a minute lets see over a period of fifteen years say he looked down at her elegant hands as she scrawled figures the diamond winked up at him sure what the hell now about collateral he bit back an oath then smothered a laugh how about our firstborn son interesting she tapped the pad against her palm yes i might agree to that but we dont have any children as yet he walked over and snatched the notebook from her hand after tossing it over his shoulder he grabbed her then lets take care of it sugar i need the loan whitney noticed with satisfaction that the pad had fallen faceup anything for free enterprise
