the golden gizmo by jim thompson copyright it was almost quitting time when toddy met the man with no chin and the talking dog almost three in the afternoon house to house goldbuyers cannot work much later than three nor much before ninethirty in the morning the old trinkets and jewelry they buy are usually stored away few housewives will interrupt their afterbreakfast or predinner chores to look them up toddy stopped at the end of the block and gave the house before him a swiftly thorough appraisal it was the last house in this neighborhood it stood almost fifty yards back from the street a shingle and stucco bungalow virtually hidden behind an untended foreground of sedge and cedar trees crouched at the end of the weedimpaled driveway was a garage or rather toddy guessed one end of a threecar garage an expensive latemodel car was in view and a highly developed sixth sense told toddy that the other stalls were similarly occupied hesitating wanting to quit work for the day toddy flipped open the lid of the small wooden box he carried and looked inside in the concealed bottom of the box were the indispensables of the goldbuying trade a set of jewelers scales and weights a jewelers loupe magnifying eyepiece a small triangularfaced file and a tiny bottle of one hundred percent pure nitric acid in the tray on top was a considerable quantity of goldfilled and plated slum mingled with the days purchases of actual gold the latter included almost an ounce of highkarat dental gold bridges crowns and fillings plus an approximate two ounces of jewelry most of it also of aboveaverage quality a man who buys three ounces of gold a day is making very good money if he buys at the right prices and toddy had bought right for an investment of twentytwo dollars he had acquired roughly eighty dollars worth of gold it had been a good day as good as the average at least he was under no financial pressure to work longer if he knocked off now just a little early he could miss that clamoring and hopeless chaos which is los angeles during rush hours he could be back in town inside an hour or less elaine always slept late of necessity if he got back to the hotel early enough he might be there before she started stirring around before she had a chance to raise any of that peculiarly hideous hell of which only she was capable toddy lighted a cigarette fretfully all but decided to begin the long trudge back to the bus stop still if he quit early today he would do it again it might become a habit with him complemented by the equally dangerous habit of starting to work late eventually he would be working no more than an hour a day and then the day would come when he would not work at all that would be the end brother the end for him and a much quicker and more unpleasant end for elaine for regardless of her vain and frequent boasting no one else but he would put up with her indefinitely with a shrug he ground out the cigarette beneath his heel and took a decisive step up the walk swearing silently he stopped again dammit it was almost three only ten minutes of and it was such a hell of a gloomy day smog had settled over the city like a sponge gray dank sunobscuring smog even if elaine was all right when she awakened the smog would start her off shed be depressed and blue and if he wasnt there not only that but he would be wasting his time at this particular house obviously wealthy people lived here despite the air of desolation and wealthy people even when they were inclined to dispose of their old gold usually knew its value too well to make the transaction profitable sharp goldbuyers have no contact with the law willingly the law as they well know takes a very dim view of their activities their licenses may be in order they may have done nothing provably illegal still a steady stream of complaints flows in their wake and the police become irritated the police reason that a man who persuades a housewife to sell him a hundreddollar watch for five possesses no very high moral tone he need get out of line very little rub them the wrong way in the slightest to be jailed for investigation and eventually floated out of town toddy had stayed clear of the police so far and he intended to keep right on doing so thered be no floater for him if he was ever picked up once they fingerprinted him theyd be passing him from city to city until he got train sick he couldnt remember all the places where he was wanted but he knew there were a great many but and he hated to admit it in this instance he was in little danger from the police unless he deliberately and flagrantly annoyed them if he had run out of cards the situation would have been different but he had not run out he was always careful to keep supplied his reluctant fingers found one now drew it from the breast pocket of his smart tweed coat mr toddmore kent special representative los angeles jewel watch co brokers in gold silver platinum the los angeles jewel watch co was a sidestreet watchrepair shop its owner was a beerloving bighearted little dutchman named milt vonderheim most wholesale buyers of precious metals give their doortodoor men the same kind of skinning that the latter deal out to their clients they downgrade your tenkarat gold to eight they weigh coin and sterling silver together they steal your platinum at a price merely twice as high as that of twentyfourkarat gold but tubby little milt with his beer breath and perpetual smile was the golden exception to the base rule of other buyers so a man needed his money every night was that a reason to rob him blind so he had no regular residence in the city and was at the mercy of one who did should you charge him a profit for not speaking to the police milt didnt think so milts prices were only a few cents lower than those of the us mint to whom he sold the stuff which toddy and a number of other young men sold to him milt paid five dollars a pennyweight one twentieth of a troy ounce for platinum if youd have a lean day he was very apt to upgrade your stuff pay you fourteenkarat prices say for ten nor was that all milt did fat shabby little milt edging deeper and deeper into poverty milt supplied these cards which were literally worth their weight in gold if a cop stopped you a cop wouldnt bother you when you showed that card unless he had to a transient goldbuyer was one thing a special representative of a longestablished local firm no matter how small was something else milt had started toddy out as a goldbuyer a year ago he had trained him stood by him through the perils that beset the trade he had trained other men too toddy knew most of those who now sold to him and he stood by them also but he did not treat them quite the same as he did toddy he was always inviting toddy back into his shop apartment for a beer or a chat he was always bragging of him that toddy he would boast to the other buyers from him you could well take a lesson regularity steadiness that iss the lesson vot toddy should give you while you boys are putting on your pants or drinking coffee toddy has already made fife dollars toddys lean face flushed a little as he remembered those boasts resolutely he brushed a bit of cigarette ash from his whipcord trousers made a slight adjustment on the collar of his tan sports shirt and turned his pebbledleather brogans up the walk to the house it was even farther away than it had appeared from the street and he had an uneasy feeling of being watched from the dark interior behind the rusted screen door but hell what was there to be nervy about he wasnt giving the police any trouble and they werent giving him any and what else was there besides a slammed door or a dog if he was starting to let things like that bother him he might as well do a high brody right now he and elaine together he stepped lightly across the porch splattered with green segments from the cedars and raised his hand to knock he jerked it back startled yes said a mans sharpsoft voice what is it you are selling something please the man must have been standing right in the door hidden by the rusted screen and the shadowed room inside toddy blinked his eyes trying to get the daylight out of them but he still couldnt see the guy all he knew about him was his voice a spanishsounding voice not at all sir said toddy with energetic joviality im not selling a thing a friend of yours suggested that i call on you if i can give you my card the screen opened and a bony hairtufted hand emerged deftly it plucked the card from his fingers and disappeared toddy shifted uncomfortably this was all wrong he knew the spiel was offkey here the gimmick was out of place he had learned to use the card as a dooropener to get em curious to force them outside or to get him in he had learned to mention a neighbor or better still a friend if they fell for it and why shouldnt some neighbor or friend have suggested a call it was all to the good if they got funny or sharp he could have the wrong house lie out of it some way you had to do those things toddy wished that he hadnt done them here he looked behind him down the long inviting walk he gave a slight hitch to his trousers and snuggled the box firmly under his arm hed give some excuse and beat it out of here or just beat it without saying anything after all he he the screen door swung open wide through it with stately but threatening grace stalked the biggest dog toddy had ever seen he did not realize just how big it was until a moment later he knew very little about dogs but he recognized this one as a doberman slowly it lowered its great pearshaped head to his feet and examined each in turn with awful deliberation the animal sniffed each leg it looked up at him thoughtfully appraising him silently it reared up on its hind legs the front paws came down on toddys shoulders the black muzzle almost rested against his nose toddy stared into the beasts eyes he stared unwinkingly afraid to move or speak he stopped breathing and was too fearstricken to know it the screen door closed slammed at last by its aged spring as from a great distance toddy heard the mans amused chuckle a seemingly unending chuckle then a sharp perrito spanish for little dog the dogs ears pricked to attention ssorree the dog said courteously ssss ssorree ddont mmention it toddy stammered a mistake i mmean the dog dropped back down to the porch and took up a position behind him the screen door opened again please to come in said the man i dont that ddog said toddy dammit was he dreaming this wont he will he hurt anyone on the contrary the man said and helplessly toddy stepped inside he kills quite painlessly todd kent had been born with a gizmo that the gi term for the unidentifiable was the way he had come to think of something that changed in value from day to day that was too whimsical in its influence to be bracketed as a gift talent aptitude or trait for most of the thirty years of his life the gizmo had pushed him into the smelly caverns where the easy money lay all his life and always without warning it had hustled him out through soulskinning nervesearing exits a runaway from a broken home todd had first hit the big dough when he was sixteen he had landed as a bellboy in a big hotel from that he advanced to bell captain and he was in the gizmo went to work before it was all over the job of bellboy in that hotel was priced at one thousand dollars a sum which the purchasers grimly went about recovering in various shady ways before it was all over when the beefs flowed over toddys young head and those of the minor executives he had fixed many of the bellboys were in jail and the hotel had a thoroughly bad name toddy was too young to prosecute on a jobselling rap but there was such a thing as a juvenile authority which could take charge of him until he was twentyone not at all pleased with this prospect he had a confidential talk with the hotels lawyers the result was that he left town but without his spanking new cadillac his diamond rings and the contents of his safety deposit box in a trackside jungle he watched an ancient and browbeaten bum toss dice from a rusted can the bum put the dice in the can shook them vigorously and threw a point then he reshook them rolled them again and there was his point not immediately it usually took several throws and not always but almost always often enough toddys gizmo swung into action yeah the flattered bum agreed it was quite a trick any hustler could throw hot dice from his hand but whod ever seen it done from a cup many big gambling houses insisted on cup shots particularly where there was heavy money down they were supposed to be hustlerproof no hed never got a chance to put the shot to work stumbled onto it too late for that but if a guy had the front the dough this was how it was done you held one die on your point you didnt put it inside the cup you palmed it and held it outside pressed against the cup in your shooting hand say you were shooting for phoebe little five you held onto three of it then you rolled letting the held die spin down at the exact moment the other shot came from the cup yeah sure maybe fever didnt make maybe the free die came out on four and youd crapped but youd lowered the odds against yourself see kid youd knocked hell out of em and how you could murder them big joints on come and field bets months later but this episode shall be cut short months later in the secluded parlor of a reno gambling house a lean taffyhaired young man sat watching a slowmotion picture of himself the picture had been shot apparently from a concealed camera above the crap table and it showed little but the movements of his hands but that was enough that was more than enough before the film was halfunwound toddy was drawing out his wallet his bank passbook and oh yes the keys to a spanking new cadillac he moved into the con games as naturally as a blonde moving into a mink coat he rode them through dallas houston oklahoma city st louis omaha cleveland new orleans memphis he rode them and was ridden to use a police term the gizmo was fickle and he was ridden rousted and floated since he shunned working with others he was confined to playing the small con the hype and the smack and the tat those however with the new twists he added to them were more than sufficient to provide him with a number of pleasant possessions not the least of which was a substantial equity in another cad then the gizmo becoming frivolous again it removed these belongings and added his biography to a volume compiled by the better business bureau it also left him wanted on seven raps in chicago his then base of operations that was the gizmo for you pushing you into clover one day booting you into a weedpatch the next the gizmo pushed him into the berlin black market and sixtythree grand in cash but naturally it didnt let him out of the army with it what it let him out of the army with was a sixmonths brig tan and a dishonorable discharge he wandered out to los angeles hating the gizmo determined to be rid of it but the gizmo was stubborn wash dishes drive a cab peddle brushes dont be foolish todd more use your head you can always see a turn if you look for it what about all these winos and bums the towns full of em and theyd sell you their right legs for a buck theyd sell you their blood the big labs pay twentyfive a pint for blood if you did the fronting sold for fifteen and bought for five toddy was in and out of the blood business fast he stayed only long enough to get a roll the scheme was entirely legal for the first time in his life he was playing something strictly legit and he couldnt take it if it was legal to nourish the desire to drink with a mans own blood then hed go back to his own side of the fence he was resting on his roll deliberating over his next move when the gizmo shoved elaine at him he hadnt had a real roll or even time to take a deep breath since then he couldnt make enough no matter what he made to do the thing that milt the gizmo having introduced them persuaded him he should do there was good money legit money in buying from dentists and other commercial users of gold toddy couldnt have the dough and elaine too somehow though he knew milt was right in so advising him he couldnt bring himself to boot her out on her tail so now now the gizmo had led him into this house into the money or and he had a sneaking hunch that this was going to be something fantastic even for the gizmo in the way of ors for the size of the house the affluence which it outwardly bespoke it this living room at least was badly even poorly furnished the few chairs the undersize divan the table all were of maple the cheapest thing on the market except for a throw rug or two the floor was bare toddy looked at the table where as a matter of habit he had placed his open box he saw now that there was another box on it a kind of oblong wooden tray a set of tongtype calipers partly shielded the contents but despite this and the deep gloom of the room toddy could see the outline of a heavy gold watch he had taken this in at a glance his gaze barely wavering from the man the guy was something to look at he was the kind of guy youd automatically keep your eyes on when he was around he had no chin it was as though nose and eyes and a wide thin mouth had been carved out of his neck either a thick black wig or a mopline bowl of natural hair topped the neck he stared from toddy to the card then back again he waited a faint look of puzzlement on his white chinless face he smiled suddenly and held the card out to toddy i can read nothing without my glasses he smiled and as usual i seem to have misplaced them you will explain your business please toddy retrieved the bit of pasteboard with a twinge of relief there was something screwy here it was just as well not to leave his or milts name behind him of course sir he said i that dog of yours took my breath away for a moment i didnt mean to just stand here taking up your time i am sure of it the man nodded suavely i am certain that you do not mean to do it now perhaps now that you have recovered your breath mr clinton toddy lied im with the california precious metals company youve probably seen our ads in the papers worlds largest buyers of scrap gold no i have seen no such ads thats entirely understandable toddy said weve discontinued them lately well it must have been more than a year ago in favor of the personal contact method we we he stopped talking hed seen plenty of pretty girls in his time many of them in a state which left nothing of their attributes to the imagination but this this was something else again this girl who had come through the doorway to what was apparently the kitchen she wore blue levis and a worn khaki shirt and a scuffed pair of sandals encased her feet and if she had on any makeup toddy couldnt spot it and yet despite those things she was out of this world she was mmmmhmmmm and wow and manohman toddy stared at her eyes narrowing the man spoke over his shoulder dolores he said and as she came forward he caught her by the bodice and pivoted her in front of toddy very nice eh his eyes pointed to her buttocks a little full perhaps like the breasts but should one quarrel with bounty is not the total effect pleasing could one accept less after the warm promise of the mouth the generous eyes the sable hair with scum said the girl in almost unaccented english filth she added tonelessly carrion obscenity vaya the man took a step toward her hija de perro i shall teach you manners he turned back on toddy breathing heavily eyes glinting now mr mr clinton is it i have allowed you to study my ward to the fullest perhaps you will confine your attention to me for a moment you said you were sent to me by a friend well im not sure she was a friend exactly but she a neighbor of yours right down the street here i i know none of my neighbors nor are they acquainted with me i well its this way said toddy and his gaze moved nervously from the man to the dog the big black animal had been lying down now he had risen to stand protectively in front of the man and there was a look about him which toddy did not like at all i buy gold said toddy flipping open the lid of his box i i yes and just what led you to believe i had any gold to sell well uh nothing i mean a great many people do have and i just assumed that uh you might the man stared at him unwinkingly the dog and the man the silence in the room became unbearable llook toddy stammered whats wrong anyway like i say im buying gold he picked up the watch on the table old outofdate stuff like this that was all he had a chance to say he was too startled by what followed to realize or remember that the watch was ten times heavier than it should have been cursing the man lurched forward and aimed a kick at toddy then the dog called toddy an unpleasant name the same name the man had called him cabrone it snapped bastard and then the dog howled insanely and leaped at the man for he had received the kick intended for toddy and in a decidedly tender place the watch slid from toddys nerveless fingers he slammed the lid of his box and dashed for the door in his last fleeting glimpse of the scene the dog was stalking the man and the man was kicking and shouting at him and in the doorway to the kitchen the girl clutched herself and rocked with hysterical uncontrollable laughter i said toddy grimly as he raced toward the wilshire line bus am going to call it a day the box seemed unusually heavy but he thought nothing of it late in the day like this it had the habit of seeming heavy like most people with a tendency to attract trouble toddy kent had a magnificent ability to shake it off hot water figuratively speaking affected him little more than the literal kind he forgot it as soon as the moment of burning was past this afternoon then he was not only troubled and worried but troubled and worried at being so sure hed had a bad scare but that had been more than an hour ago an hour in which hed ridden into town and had three stiff drinks why keep kicking the thing around what was there to feel blue about it was even kind of funny when you looked at it the right way irritated and baffled by himself toddy turned in at the twelvefoot front of the los angeles jewel watch co most of the shop was in darkness but the door was unlocked and a light burned at the rear milt was reading off a buyer one of the new ones and his brogue was as broad as the young mans face was red so yet more of it milt slapped aside his brilliant swivel lamp and jerked the jewelers loupe from his eyes did you look at dis my brilliant young friend did you feel of it heft it dis beeyootiful chunk of eighteenkarat brass why why sure i did mitt i you did not the little wholesaler proclaimed with mock sternness i refuse to let you so malign yourself better i have taught you better you would have known i viii tell you what you felt my friend vot you looked at it was dis beeyootiful young housewife was it not dot vas where you were feeling and looking a chuckle arose from the other buyers the young mans voice rose above it but its stamped mitt its got an eighteenkarat stamp right on it mitt threw up his hands wildly vot have i told you of such on modern stuff yess the karat stamp is good it means what it says but the old pieces bah nodding it means because dere vas no law to make it it means only dot you must have good eyes it means only dot you have a file in your box and a vial of acid and better you should use dem the young man nodded downcast and started to move away mitt beckoned spoke to him in a harsh stage whisper tell no vun but dis time i make it up myself next time his voice rose to a roar feel der gold and not der lady everyone laughed mitt the loudest of all then he saw toddy and hailed him ah now here ye have a real goldbuyer what has my toddy boy brought heh good it will be always a good day it is for hot toddy his voice was a little too hearty and he stood up as he spoke and jerked his head toward the curtained doorway to his apartment if these gentlemen will excuse us for a moment i would have a word with you in private sure said toddy sorry to hold you up boys he followed milt back through the drapes and the little jeweler whispered to him for a moment elaine again he cursed softly and raised his shoulders in a resigned shrug okay mitt ill come back later and check in you understand toddy there was not much i could do i could not get away at this hour for one thing and the money i was afraid i would not have so much as was required forget it said toddy youve done enough for me without having to take care of her jaw set he shouldered his way through the drapes again and strode out of the shop milt watched him through the door then sank heavily down into his worn swivel chair he took a long swig from an opened quart of beer and wiped his mouth distastefully he looked up into the shrewdsolemn circle of his buyers faces there he said sadly his dialect forgotten is one of the best boys i know brains he has and looks and deep down inside where it counts goodness and wasted all of it is thrown away on a on they nodded they all knew about elaine toddy didnt talk of course except to milt and milt wasnt a gossip either but they all knew elaine got around elaine was hot water circulating under its own power why dont he dump her milt it was a buyer named red you cant do anything with a dame like that i have asked myself that said milt absently yes i have even asked him and the answer he does not know perhaps there is none the answer is in her something that cannot be put into words she is vicious selfish totally irresponsible physically unattractive and yet there is something he spread his hands helplessly one by one the buyers drifted out but milt remained at his bench he was musing lost in thought as if it were yesterday he remembered that day a year ago the first time he had seen elaine and toddy kent it had been raining and toddys bare head was wet he had left elaine up at the front of the shop and come striding back to the cage by himself i have a watch here he said that belonged to my grandfather i dont suppose its worth much intrinsically but its very valuable to me as a keepsake give it a good goingover and dont spare any expense ill pick it up in a couple of days milt said he would he would be glad to he was considerably awed by the young mans manner oh yes said toddy and he slapped his pockets just put an extra five dollars on the bill will you or no youd better make it ten i lost my wallet a little while ago think it must have been out in beverly hills when i was leaving my bank he did it so smoothly that milts hand moved automatically toward the cash drawer then it stopped and he looked at the watch and at toddy and down the aisle at elaine it is a disagreeable day he said you and the lady your wife are both wet if you will step back here have her step back i have a small electric heater some other time toddy said imperiously pleasant just make it ten and and yes nodded milt my suggestion is good it is very very good come back sir you and your wife so they had come back warily and toddy had accepted a brandy in silence and while he was sipping it elaine drank three she saw milt watching her amazed and she grinned at him impudently he looked hastily away where he said did you lose your wallet at our hotel toddy laughed shortly we lost our baggage there too and our clothes not to mention not to mention anything ten dollars would do you no good it would get us dinner and breakfast toddy shrugged itd get us into some fleabag for the night tomorrow ill probably run into something not tomorrow you have already run into it now yeah yes nodded milt so i will give you ten dollars and you will visit me tomorrow morning by tomorrow night you will have the ten back and twenty twentyfive maybe fifty dollars besides oh sure said toddy sure i will surely you will said milt gravely and even if you are not sure you will be here in the morning you will be here because you are not sure is it not so toddy had looked blank for a moment then his eyes narrowed and he grinned youve got my numbei mister he said ill be here and if theres fifty dollars to be made ill make it they had gone out then taking mitts ten dollars with them and when milt looked around for the brandy bottle he found it gone too airedale aahrens had once broken a mans jaw for asking why hed been given the handle it was like asking a onearmed man why he is called wingie airedale had a long thick neck on a short stocky body his hair was a crisp brownishyellow and his eyes were large and liquid and brown he didnt speak when toddy entered the bail bond office he simply picked up a pencil and the telephone and dialed the police station after a moment he grunted airedale whats the score on mrs elaine kent toddy drew a chair up to the bondsmans desk and sat down elbows on his knees he studied the familiar abbreviations which airedale scrawled on a scratchpad dd drunk and disorderly assoff assaulting an officer rear resisting arrest it was quite a list even for elaine she had obviously been in unusually good form today airedale stopped writing for a moment then he wrote fourbits and cocked an eye at toddy toddy sighed made a loop with his thumb and forefinger airedale said oke and slammed up the receiver toddy counted fifty dollars onto the desk and the bondsman recounted them with thick stubby fingers he made a balling movement with his hand and the money vanished he discovered it tucked beneath toddys chin shook his head with enigmatic disapproval and dropped the bills into a drawer toddy grinned tiredly he didnt ask why the bond was not put up he knew it was up airedale was in the real estate business he sold lots he bought them too cheap ones that were plenty adequate for dumps hed hold on to them until he needed them and in the meantime a few hundred bucks slipped to his cousin in the city hall would miraculously produce an official assessment of the land at several times the purchase price and the value every once in a while somebody would wonder what had happened to all the forfeited bail where was the cash what did the city have to show for it the cash was in airedales pocket but hed give the city something to show for it all right he was no crook hed let the city have a nice thousanddollar lot for ten or twelve grand in forfeited bail airedale said how come theyre going after elaine they trying to roust you kid toddy shrugged you know how elaine is i do airedale nodded i thought maybe you didnt you workin full time as her chump or can i rent you out let me be your agent kid theys millions in it toddy chuckled wryly characters he thought ten thousand characters and no people maybe wed better talk about something else he suggested maybe we had airedale agreed promptly what do you hear from shakes boys these days still trying to chisel in on you still trying toddy said you dont think they mean business huh probably toddy shrugged where they slip up is in not thinking that we mean business too guys like me anyone tough enough to make it in the goldbuying game is plenty tough enough to hold on to what he makes im not going to let a bunch of punks like shakes tap me for protection if i scared that easy i wouldnt be in the racket so how come shakes so stupid he had a little luck he tapped a few sunday buyers oldage pensioners kids college boys people like that airedale nodded appreciatively he looked toward the door here she comes he said gods little gift to los angeles or why people move to frisco elaine didnt look bad for elaine she always looked mussed and sloppy and she looked no more than that now though she was grinning a delightful elfin heartwarming grin it was immediately apparent that she had heard airedales remark she made an obscene gesture with her forefinger you can kiss my ass you fatmouthed nosey sonofabitch you mean that one under your nose not me honey im strictly an undertheskirts guy the clean stuff yknow why you dirty bas knock it off toddy grabbed her by the elbow and dragged her toward the door that wasnt very funny airedale so whos joking said airedale he broke into a roar of laughter as they went out the legs of his chair banging against the floor with the rocking of his body he stopped at last wiped his eyes on the sleeve of his checkered shirt he looked thoughtfully into his cash drawer then firmly pushed it shut meanwhile riding toward the hotel in a taxi toddy was barely aware of the profane and obscene words which streamed softly steadily from elaines mouth it wasnt that he was used to such talk somehow he had never got used to it in the alwaysnew fascination of watching her face he simply lost track of what she was saying she had perfect control of her expressions in the space of seconds she could register sorrow elation bewilderment terror surprise one after the other and unless you knew her and sometimes even when you did you could not doubt that the pantomimed emotions were anything but genuine her expression now was one of angelic resignation gentle entreaty and her words were how about it you stingy bastard i want a bottle and by god im gonna get one toddy shook his head absently not really hearing her her leg slid under his and the heel of her tiny pump swung back against his crotch he swore and jerked away involuntarily he swung out and the back of his hand struck her in the face it wasnt a hard blow but it was a noisy one the cab stopped with a jerk the driver pushed his hard face over the glass partition what you tryin to pull there mac she toddy repressed a groan mind your own business like that huh the driver reached for the door maybe ill make this my business wait said elaine wait please its this way driver my husband just got out of jail and his nerves are all on edge she let her hands flutter descriptively he wanted something to drink and i didnt want him to have anything but i guess well maybe he does need it dammit snapped toddy i dont want any now you know you do honey elaine laid a sympathetic hand on his arm he really must driver he hardly ever strikes me unless hhes like this the cabbie grunted okay mac you got your own way give him some money sweetheart said elaine you go right ahead and have your whiskey and i wont say a word i tell you im not oh hell said toddy they had stopped in front of a liquor store of course elaine had timed this little frammis right to a t toddy literally threw a fivedollar bill at the driver and when the latter returned with a pint of whiskey he literally threw it and the change at toddy elaine beamed at both of them then she took the bottle with a prettily prim movement and placed it in her outsize purse the hotel where toddy and elaine lived was a twohundredroom fleabag a little to the north of los angeles northsouth dividing line coincidences excepted its only resemblance to a firstclass hotel was its rates it was the kind of place where the house dick worked on a commission and room clerks jumped the counter on tough guys during the war it had paid for itself several times over by renting rooms to couples who just wanted to clean up a little people lived there because they liked such places or because they would not be accepted in better ones toddys insistence on a secondfloor room had immediately identified him to the clerk as a hustler all the hot guys liked it low down down low you could sometimes smell a beef before it hit you you could sometimes get out ahead of it so toddy had paid an inflated rate to begin with and three days later when his primary reason for wanting a room near the street level became apparent the rent was boosted another ten a week the clerk was sympathetic about it insomuch as he was capable of sympathy he even declared that elaine was a mighty sweet little lady but the rent went up just the same he just had to do it get me kent the joints liable know what i mean now naturally the best little lady in the world is gonna cut it rough now and then but people aint got no sense of humor no more toss a jug on em from the second floor an honest to christ youd think they was killed toddy had paid the extra ten without protest and in return strong ironwire screens went over the windows and a hell of a lot of good they did an empty bottle couldnt be hurled through them but heavier objects could be and were so toddy rented a room on the alley the single window of which was protected pretty adequately by the fire escape of course you could get stuff past the fire escape if you tried hard enough from the standpoint of comfort it was by far the worst room toddy and elaine had lived in it was badly ventilated and poorly lit even in the coldest days of winter it was almost unbearably warm the virtually uninsulated stack of the hotels incinerator passed through one corner of the room and the heat from it was like an ovens once on one of her rampages elaine had loosened the clamp which held the square metal column to the wall and before toddy could get it back into place rejoin the loosened joints his face was scarlet from its blast he had complained about the thing to the management not asking its removal of course which was impossible but requesting that its dangerously loose condition be corrected the management had advised him that if the stack was loose so was his baggage there were no nails holding it to the floor and if he disliked his environment he could move the hell out the management was getting a bellyful of toddy and elaine kent on this particular evening toddy followed elaine down the long frayed red carpet of the hall past the smells of gin and incense the sounds of sickness sex and low revelry he unlocked the door of their room and stood aside for her to precede him he closed it set his goldbuyers box upon the writing table and sank into a chair elaine sat halfon halfoff the bed her back to its head she loosened the foil on the bottle with her teeth tossed the cap away and took a long gurgling drink how do you like them apples prince she crinkled her eyes at him prince spelled with a k what do you say we have another one she had another one and again lowered the bottle well lets have the sermon prince if you dont get started well be late for prayer meeting kid i i toddy broke off and rubbed his eyes where do you get the dough to do these things elaine who gives it to you try and find out everyones not as chinchy as you are im not stingy you know that id do anything in the world to help you really help you who the hell wants your help wherever you get the money whoever gives it to you theyre not your friends theyre the worst enemies you could have cant you see that kid cant you see that some day youre going to get into something that you cant get out of that neither i nor anyone else can get you out of youve got intelligence you he broke off scowling for a moment he wanted nothing but to get his hands on her to to and then his scowl faded and the nearmurderous impulse passed and despite himself he chuckled elaine had drawn her face down into a ridiculous mask of solemnity it was impossible not to laugh at her okay so its no use he sighed and lighted a cigarette go on and get yourself cleaned up ill check in with milt and well have dinner when i get back who the hells dirty who wants dinner you are said toddy rising you do now get in that bathroom and get busy elaine scrambled off the bed and ran to the bathroom door she paused before it clutching the knob in one hand the bottle in the other eyes twinkling venomously she screamed the bloodchilling spinetingling shrieks piled one upon the other rose to a crescendo of terror and pain then they ended abruptly as she slammed and locked the door above the noise of the shower he heard her spitefully amused laughter trembling a little he crossed to the phone and waited it began to ring he lifted it and spoke dully into the transmitter all right well stop yeah yeah i know okay you dont hear anything now do you well all right he slammed up the receiver hesitated glowering he lighted another cigarette took a deep consoling puff and flipped open the lid of his box he blinked what the hell he thought how the hell lets see id just picked the thing up and yeah the lid of the box was open and then chinless tried to kick me and the dog cut loose and very slowly his hand dipped down and lifted out the watch the watch from the house of the talking dog he noticed its weight this time it sagged in the hand that held it if he had any ability at all to estimate weights and he had a great deal this thing weighed a full pound of course most of that weight would be in the works he knew even on the thick oldfashioned jobs like this the maximum weights on cases seldom ran over thirty pennyweight one and a half ounces the case on a modern watch with its thin movement would weigh little more than half that much he took the loupe from his box and carried the watch over to the dresser snapping on a lamp he made a small scratch in the case with his nail loupe in eye he studied the nowmagnified indentation he whistled softly twentyfour karat twentyfour karat the stuff was practically never used in jewelry never except perhaps in insignia and tiny plated areas it was too soft not to mention its cost so toddy lowered the watch and stood striking it absently against the palm of his hand there was a tiny plip ping sound and the movement face and crystal flew off flew off in one piece toddy stared at them at it looked from it to the case he took it in one hand and it in the other and balanced them the movement was little larger than a dime with the things it was affixed to the crystal and face it weighed a weak five pennyweight the case then the case weighed almost a full pound there shouldnt be much more than a pound of pure gold in all of los angeles county outside of government vaults of course and yet here was a pound of the stuff in his hand he snapped the two sections of the watch back together a tremor of excitement in his fingers a slow grin lining his tanned jaw in a quiet recess of his mind the gizmo was awakening it was kicking back the covers and reaching under the bed for its bulging kit of angles so hed picked up the watch by accident so it didnt belong to him so what maybe the chinless guy would like to claim title to it maybe hed like to explain what he was doing with well call it by its right name a pound of twentyfourkarat fine bullion of course chinless didnt look like a guy whod make many explanations he didnt look like a nice guy at all to tangle with still he wouldnt be stupid enough to raise a stink over this or would he toddy wasnt sure but then hed never been a surething player this was worth gambling on he was sure of that the movement was worthless as a timekeeper it wouldnt run more than a few hours before it gave up the ghost it served only to disguise the true nature of the watch and no one would take such pains go to such expense with only one watch there would be other yes and other items besides watches articles that weighed many times the amount their appearance indicated if a man could move in on a setup like that toddy paused in his scheming listening to the chatter of the bathroom shower the light of excitement dulled in his fine gray eyes what was the use what good would it do no matter what he made it would all go the same way down the bottomless ratholes which elaine burrowed endlessly box under his arm he closed the door of the room and walked down the long hall to the stairs he went out through the side entrance of the lobby reconnoitered its smogbound environs with a glance as deceptively casual as it was automatic he strolled up to the corner and stood leaning against a lamppost ostensibly he was waiting for the traffic signal to change actually he was waiting for the man who had been lurking in the shadows of the entrance a small man with a sunken chest and a snapbrimmed gray hat that was almost as wide as his shoulders one of shakes boys a shiv artist named donald the man approached he sidled up to the opposite side of the post and spoke from the corner of his mouth lets have it kent shake aint waitin no longer cows ass said toddy with the inflection of hows that im not tellin you again the next time i see you youll have your balls in that box instead of gold why donald said toddy how would i close the lid donald didnt answer him donald couldnt toddys arm had curled around the post around his head and his nose was flat and getting flatter against the rusty iron he mumbled awwfguho and managed to free the thin steel knife from its hip sheath toddys arm tightened and he dropped the knife into the gutter now said toddy get this clear once and for all im not paying any protection not one goddam penny dont try for it again if you do well just dont he released the little shiv artist with a contemptuous twirl he crossed the street and vanished into the darkness without looking back milts shop was dark of course but the door was unlocked for a man in the gold racket milts faith in human nature was astonishing toddy made his way down the dark aisle with practiced ease pushed through the wicket which adjoined the jewelers cage and shoved aside the drapes milt wasnt in the living room but an excited clamor from the kitchen told toddy where he was toddy set his box upon the oldfashioned library table and went on back to the rear room as usual the swarthy and sullen italian who delivered milts beer was late and as usual milt was reading him off he followed the man to the back door gesticulating complaining with humorous querulousness have you no sense of the importance of things is there no way i can appeal to you suppose i had run out what then loafer that means nothing to you eh that i should be left here without so much as a swallow the roar of the delivery truck shut off his protest muttering face pink with outrage he faced toddy i ask you my friend what should i do with such a dummox what would you do in my case just what you do toddy chuckled you wouldnt know what to do if you didnt have that guy to fight with every night anyway ill bet youve got your refrigerator full of beer but the principle involved the fact that i exercise a certain foresight does not affect the principle okay said toddy i think ill drink a bottle of this warm if you dont mind on a night like this i stop huh toddy jerked his hand away from the beer case never said milt with mock severity never in my house will such a sacrilege be permitted warm beer ugh aside from the shock to the senses there is no telling what the physical results might be but i like i will do nothing to nourish such an unnatural appetite come i will get us some that is only mildly cold milt took two bottles from the bottom of the overflowing refrigerator and carried them into the living room they took chairs on opposite sides of the table toasted each other silently and then went to work at grading and weighing the gold this checkingin time was virtually the only time of day when the scales were in use simply by hefting it any good goldbuyer can tell what an article weighs within a margin of a few grains his clients cant of course they have only the vaguest idea as to the weight of the things they sell they live in a world of ounces and pounds and they remain there if the buyer has his way he wont use his scales unless he has to in dealing with milt a wholesale buyer the scales were naturally necessary estimated weights correct within a few grains were not good enough a grain is only onefourhundredand eighth of a troy ounce but multiplied by several dozen purchases it might cost the wholesaler his weeks profit as for the grading that went swiftly the quality of gold is determined by its brightness and it was seldom that either milt or toddy lingered over an article toddy took the bills which milt gave him and stuffed them into his wallet a good day yes but if he could turn that watch that pound of twentyfourkarat bullion now hidden in the back of his dresser drawer if there was some way of tapping the source of that watch there is said milt something troubling you my friend oh no toddy shook his head just daydreaming tell me something will you milt if i can yes where would how much scrap gold like this would it take to make a pound of twentyfour karat well milt hesitated your question is a little vague scrap of what quality ten fourteen eighteen karat say it was all fourteen well that is easily estimated fourteen karat is sixty per cent pure roughly it would take not quite two pounds of fourteen to refine into one pound of twentyfour toddy whistled where would you get that much gold milt i would not so much gold why it is more than two or three of my boys would take in in a week and if i did buy it i would not refine it into twentyfour why should i it would gain me nothing the mint would pay me no more for a pound of twentyfour karat than it would for two pounds or whatever the exact figure is of fourteen suppose you didnt sell it to the mint but where else would i ohh said mitt now wait a minute toddy held up a hand grinning dont leap all over me yet im just thinking out loud such thoughts i do not like but look milt why couldnt a guy do this pure gold is staked at thirtyfive dollars an ounce in this country abroad its selling for anywhere from seventyfive to a hundred and fifty depending on how shaky a nations currency is so why couldnt you refine scrap into twentyfour have it made up into jewelry trick stuff you know yes said milt i see exactly what you are driving at the jewelry could be worn into mexico for a few dollars for a task so safe wearers could be readily secured and from mexico there would be little difficulty in getting the gold abroad yes i know i see well it is not well and you know it there are severe penalties for removing gold from this country even to be in possession of bullion is a federal offense but the profit milt my god think yes said mitt sternly the profit my god my god is right how many such profitable enterprises have you undertaken in the past what was your profit from them heh shall i refresh your memory my ohsofoolish toddy oh now said toddy coloring a little theres no need to bring those things up anyway this is an entirely different deal now you have your feelings hurt milt nodded you have given me your confidence and now i remind you of things you would rather forget good i shall continue to hurt your feelings i shall continue to remind you of the unpleasant conclusions of your past escapades better to do that than see you repeat your errors but toddy caught himself oh well he said what are we arguing about i told you i was just thinking out loud and i told you it was not good to entertain such thoughts why should you dwell on them at not too great a risk you are making very good money you are not known to the police here without some deliberate bit of foolishness you are assured of an excellent income and more important your freedom if on the other hand you i know said toddy a trifle impatiently you do not know you place too great a store by the fact that you have not been fingerprinted by the police of this the city of angels you are forgetting the brief but telling physical description of you which is on file at the license bureau you are forgetting the bureaus reason for having such data the fact that goldbuyers are always suspect that it may be necessary to lay hands on them at a moments notice you see you are safe only as long as you commit no overt act once you do the fingerprinting and the discovery of your record will follow as a matter of course toddy took a long slow drink of his beer yeah he said slowly i know but tell me one thing milt just to satisfy my curiosity then ill shut up if i must say that you did i know you dont say that you did want to buy enough scrap of all kinds every week to refine into six or eight pounds of twentyfour karat enough to take care of the kind of overhead youd be bound to have and still make enough of a killing to pay you for the risk how would you go about it for me it would be impossible as i told you some of the larger refineries might buy that much gold but theyre checked arent they if their shipments to the mint started falling off they are checked yes there is a check even on such relatively unimportant wholesale buyers as i huh toddy frowned how about this then why couldnt you spread your buying through a group of wholesalers take a pound or less of scrap from each one because you could not pay them enough for the risk they were taking and the secret of your enterprise would be dangerously spread with your buying so there is my answer toddy it is an impossibility it cannot be done but it i mean yes said milt nothing okay im convinced toddy grinned how about another beer uncomfortably conscious of milts curious and troubled gaze toddy left shortly after he had finished the beer but he was by no means free of the tantalizing reflections which the watch had inspired they expanded and multiplied in his mind as he strode back through the hazy streets dammit that gold was being bought regardless of what mitt said and this was entirely different from anything he had ever touched hed have to be careful certainly hed have to do some tall scheming but just because hed had a few bad breaks in the past there wasnt any reason to toddy was almost running when he reached the hotel he ignored the elevator and raced up the steps he went swiftly down the hall he shouldnt have left elaine alone he shouldnt have left the watch in the room his hand trembled on the doorknob he turned it and went in the room was dark he found the light switch and turned it on she lay sprawled backwards on the bed naked sheets tumbled with her strugglings damp from her bath eyes glazed and bloodshot pushing whitely enormously from the contorted face veins empurpled and distended one of the stockings was tied around her throat knotted and reknotted there and her stiffening fingers still clawed at it the other stocking had been stuffed into her mouth the toe of it chewed wet from gagging edged out through the open frothcovered oval of her lips toddy swayed how could i know something i read she was always asking for trouble he closed his eyes and opened them again he put a hand out toward her toward that hideously soggy fragment of stocking hastily he jerked the hand back the room had been ransacked of course every drawer in the dresser had been jerked out and dumped upon the floor toddys eyes moved from the disarray to the window he went to it and flung up the shade there was a man down there near the foot of the fire escape he was a small man with a hat almost as wide as his shoulders one of his feet had slipped through the steps and he was struggling frantically to free it toddy had been sitting on his roll when he met elaine ives hed built up his wardrobe had several grand in his kick and was driving a cadillac rented alas while he tried to hit upon a line toddy liked nice things he liked to live in good places he found that it paid off in the swank apartment hotel where he resided he was believed to be the scion of a texas oil millionaire no one would have thought of associating the tanned exquisitely tailored young man with anything offcolor he was sitting in the bar of his hotel the day he met elaine apparently she had followed him in from the street although he had not seen her the first he saw of her was when she slid onto the stool next to his and looked up at him with that funny opentoothed smile order yet darling she said i believe ill have a double rye water on the side he looked at the bartender who was giving elaine a doubtful but chilly eye that sounds good enough for me he said two double ryes water on the side in the few seemingly casual glances he gave her while she drank that drink and three others he checked off her points and added them up to zero she was scrawny her clothes except for her hat she was always careful with her hats looked like they had been thrown on her the widespaced teeth gave her mouth an almost ugly look when she crinkled her face as she did incessantly talking laughing smiling she looked astonishingly like a monkey yet dammit and yet there was something about her that got him something warm and golden that reached out and enveloped him and drew him closer and closer yet never close enough something that even infected the bartender making him solicitous with napkins and ice and matches held for cigarettes that held him there wanting to do things that were paid for by the doing toddy glanced at his watch and slid off the stool getting late he remarked think wed better be getting on to dinner dont you no said elaine promptly crinkling her face at him not hungry gonna stay right here jus me an you an nice bartender the bartender beamed foolishly and frowned at toddy toddy gave him an appraising stare i think he said the nice bartender is in danger of losing his nice license which is worth a nice twentyfive thousand for a nice place like this it isnt considered nice it seems to provide liquor to obviously intoxicated people not toxtoxshiconshtipated ver reglar but now the bartender had become even more urgent than toddy and elaine was holding herself in a little she wasnt ready to open all the stops toddy got her out of there and into the cadillac and she passed out immediately he opened her purse looking for something that would give him her address its sole contents aside from compact and lipstick was a waddedup letter he read it with a growing feeling of gladness of course hed been sure from the beginning that she wasnt peddling another bgirl but he was glad to see the letter nonetheless any girl might blow her top if something like this happened to her having a studio contract canceled before she ever started to work hell he might have gone out hitting up strangers himself now with the letter in his hand he saw why he had felt that he had known her he had seen her several years before in a picture it had been a lousy picture but one player a harried scatterwitted clerk in a dime store had almost saved it she had only to fan the straggling hair from her eyes or hitch the skirt about her scrawny hips to set the audience to howling they roared with laughter laughter that was with her not at her laughter with tears in it toddy drove her around until she awakened and then he drove to a drivein and fed her tomato soup and coffee she took these attentions matteroffactly trustingly either not wanting to ask questions or not needing to he took her to her home a court apartment in north hollywood he went in with her steered her through the disarray of dropped clothes and empty bottles and overturned ashtrays to a daybed she collapsed on it and was instantly asleep again toddy stared at her perplexed wondering what to do feeling a strange obligation to take care of her the court door opened unceremoniously and a woman stepped in she had a bust on her like a cemetery angel and her face looked just about as stony but even she looked at elaine and spoke with a note of regret so this was mr ives the brother elaine had insisted would arrive and just when she was beginning to believe there wasnt any brother well she knew how perturbed he must be she was fond of elaine herself and and such a great talent mr ives but it just couldnt go on any longer she simply could not put up with it so if mr ives would find her another place immediately absolutely no later than tomorrow and since hed want to get started early the back rent six weeks it was toddy paid it he stayed the night there sprawled out on two chairs in the morning he helped elaine pack or rather he packed stopping frequently to hold her over the toilet while she retched and washing her face afterward he found and paid for another apartment he put her to bed not until then when she was looking up at him from the pillows a bottle of whiskey on the reading stand just as medicine did she seem to take any note of what he had done sit down here she said patting the bed and he sat down and maybe youd better hold my hand she said and he held it now she said her face crinkling into a frown what am i going to do about you do toddy grinned now you know what i mean she said severely im broke im not working and i dont know when i will be i guess i should ask you to sleep with me but ive never done anything like that and anyway it probably wouldnt be much fun for you would it i mean im so skinny id probably stick you with a bone yyes nodded toddy he had the goddamnedest feeling that he was going to bawl maybe i could wash some clothes for you said elaine thats an awfully pretty suit you have on i could wash it real nice for you and hang it out the window and it would that be worth fifty cents toddy shook his head he couldnt speak well her voice was humble a quarter then ddont said toddy oh for christs sake toddy hadnt cried since the night he ran away from home hed halfkilled his stepfather with a twobyfour bashed him over the head as he came into the barn hed tried to make it look like an accident like one of the rafters had broken but he was shaking with fear with that and the bitter coldness of the night hed huddled down in a corner of the boxcar and sometime during the night a tramp had crawled into the car also observing the proprieties of the road the tramp had gone into a corner that corner to relieve himself and toddy had been soaked along with his thin parcel of sandwiches the stuff had frozen on him hed cried then for the last time up to now he was down on his knees at the side of the bed and her arms clutched him in an awkward foolishly sweet embrace and she was talking to him like a child as one child to another and there had never been another moment like this in the history of man and woman they cried together two lost children who found comfort and warmth in each other and then they started to laugh for somehow in the extravagant and puppyish outpouring of her caresses she had hooked the armhole of her nightgown around his neck while she shrilled gleefully that he was tickling her and while her small breast pounded his face with merriment he lifted and stood her on the bed then since there was no other way he slid off the other shoulder strap and drew the gown off her body lowering his head with it he shucked out of it and turned around she was still standing upright examining herself in the wall mirror she twisted her neck and gazed at her childish buttocks she faced the mirror and bowed her back and legs she raised one leg in the air and looked she turned around frowning and nodded to him feel no here honey thats where you do it isnt it toddy felt not bad he said gravely not bad at all not too skinny by no means elaine beamed and put her legs back together pivoting arms stiff at her sides she did a pratfall on the bed when she stopped bouncing she lay back and looked at him well she said puzzledly i mean after all hadnt we better get started thus the story of the meeting of toddy and elaine funnysad bittersweet it put a lump in your throat at least it put one in the throat of toddy who lived it then they flew to yuma that night and were married and the lump moved up from his throat to his head literally they were in their hotel room and elaine was teasing for just one lul old bottle just a lul one honey all her charm was turned on she pantomimed her tremendous thirst staggered about the room hand shielding her eyes a desert wanderer in search of an oasis then she broke into an insanely funny dance of joy as the oasis was discovered right there on the dresser in the form of his wallet laughing tenderly toddy moved in front of her huhuh baby no more tonight elaine picked up the empty bottle and hit him over the head with it you stupid sonofabitch she said how long you think i can keep up this clowning shakes headquarters were in a walkup dump on south main a buggy tottering firetrap tenanted by diseasesofmen doctors a massage parlor and companies with uniformly small offices and big names the sign on his smudged windows read easiest loans in town it was true in the same sense say that death solves all problems is true without cosigners collateral or even a job in the usual meaning of the word you could borrow from one to a maximum of ten dollars from shake and you could and usually did take the rest of your lifetime to pay it back shake liked to get along with people he liked to live and let live he said so himself if you objected to these lenient arrangements things were still made easy for you there was a swift and simple alternative shakes pachucos his young mexican toughs would pay you a visit they would drop around to your onechair barber shop or your shoeshine stand or the corner where you hustled papers and kick the holy hell out of you theyd lay you so flat you could crawl under doors shake pointed to the expense of these kickings as justification for his whimsical methods of compounding interest when toddy pushed donald into the office ahead of him shake and two of the pachucos were in the back room theyd been splitting a halfgallon of fourbit wine while they stamped phony serial numbers into an equally phony batch of irish sweepstakes tickets their minds were a little muggy and they were jammed around a littered table before they could snap together toddy had dutchwalked donald inside and kicked the door shut they got to their feet then they advanced a step in a threecornered halfcircle but toddy jerked his head toward the windows and the movement stopped abruptly come on he invited grimly i wont do a damn thing but toss this bastard out on his skull nnow ttoddy nervous phlegm burbled in shakes throat now toddy he whined is this a way to act bustin into a office after business hours he was a swollen dropsical giant with an ague probably syphilisinspired which kept his puffed flesh in faint almost constant oscillation ive got something to say said toddy if you dont want those punks to hear it youd better send em out well now shake made a flabbily deprecating motion i dont know about that were settin here having a nice little party ramon an juan an me just settin here minding our own business and then you come along an all right said toddy i gave you a chance i went up to my room tonight and wait send em out shake oh shake looked doubtfully at the little shiv artist you been up to somethin bad donald send em out donald gasped teetering painfully in toddys grip do like he says shake well how far you want em to go toddy how good can they hear shake hesitated then waved his hand all the way down boys clear down in front the pachucos left duck tail haircuts gleaming heelplates clicking on the ancient marble when toddy heard the outer door close he released donald with a shove all right strip goddammit i done tole you i take em off donald shakes pig eyes gleamed with interest as he sank into a chair sullenly donald shed his clothes until he stood naked before them youre awful dirty donald shake clucked his tongue reproachfully he have a chance to ditch it anywheres toddy could he of tossed it away no toddy admitted he couldnt how big was it donald maybe you better bend over an toddy chuckled unwillingly and donald spewed out outraged obscenities all right then shake said you just get them clothes back on before you catch cold and toddy maybe you better toddy nodded slowly here it is he began donald hit me up for protection again tonight and i gave him a brushoff one that hed remember then but that was just business toddy just because a mans ambitious and wants to expand it dont prove it proves youre stupid enough to try anything jesus toddy shook his head in wondering disgust trying to shake down a goldbuyer a bunch of cheap hoods like you why the hell dont you work out on mickey cohen shake looked embarrassed well now he mumbled maybe it wasnt real smart but smart snarled donald you see what the sonofabitch done to my nose i met donald on the way to milts shop i went on down to the shop and checked in then i went back to my room i couldnt have been gone more than thirty or thirtyfive minutes at the outside when i went in i found the room turned upside down i found donald heading down the fire escape and i found my wife on the bed strangled with her own stockings sssstrangled yyou mean hhe i didnt donald snapped fearfully dammit shake why for would i do a thing like that wwhy for was you in toddys room i well i spill it donald edged toward the corner of the room keeping a cautious eye on toddy i jjust went up there to wait for him kind of surprise him you know yeah i was i was just goin to cut him up a little when he came back shake sighed with relief you see toddy donald wouldnt of killed her donald aint that kind of boy he was just goin to cut you up a little uhhuh and elaine jumps him so he gives her the business youre a goddam liar now you know better than that toddy said shake you been around too long to think a thing like that in the first place he aint a killer in the second place hes a shiv man why for would he screw around with stockings when he had a shiv it aint his his modus operandi toddy supplied silently it was true the operation method of a criminal almost never changes the police would have a hell of a time if it did still donald had had the opportunity hed been caught at the scene of the murder you think im im immortal or somethin donald demanded with genuine indignation you think im a pervert you think i killed the black dahlia i think youre a very sweet little boy said toddy the whole trouble is people just dont understand you like me for example howd you know it was safe to go into my room howd you know my wife wasnt in there alive i could look under the door an see it was dark i knocked an didnt get no answer so i went in the door was unlocked im tellin ya how long was this after you left me well fifteentwenty minutes maybe just long enough to work your nerve up huh how long had you been there when i came in it couldnt have been much more than ten minutes it wasnt donald scowled peevishly look why dont you cut out the third degree an let me tell you okay keep it straight i knocked on the door said donald i knocked an waited a minute i thought i heard someone movin around kind of a rustlin sound and i almost took a powder but i didnt hear it no more then after the first time so i figured it must be the window shade flappin or something like that i opened the door just a crack an slid in go on i donald wiped sweat from his face i stood there by the door hugging the wall and waiting an an i dont know i begin to get kind of a funny feeling like someone was staring at the back of my neck well you know how it is in that room you cant really see into it up there by the door you cant see the bed or nothing hardly until you get past the bathroom not with the lights off anyways i know that said toddy impatiently well i got this feeling so so i slide down along the wall until im out of that little areaway i came even with the bed and my eyes are gettin kind of used to the dark an i can see a little i can see theys someone on the bed i i jesus i cant even think what im doin all i can think of is lightin a cigarette i mean i dont really think of it i do it without thinkin and then the match flares up an i see everything i see whats happened an then i hear you at the door an i try to beat it down the fire escape an toddy nodded absently donald was in the clear hed been pretty sure right from the beginning but under the circumstances thered been nothing to do but grab him donald stepped to the table poured out a water glass of sherry and killed it at a gulp shake stroked his chins and stared interestedly at toddy if you was so sure donald killed your wife he said why didnt you just call the cops thats what cops is for to arrest criminals so thats it said toddy i often wondered you know what i think yes i think you killed her yourself you either bumped her off before you left the room or or i went up the fire escape and did it then beat it down and came up the front way toddys tone was light satirical but there was a heavy feeling around his heart something seemed to struggle there to fight up toward the hidden recesses of his mind sure thats what the cops will think thats what ill say after they work me over a few days shake shook his head with a complete lack of sympathy they sure swing a mean hose in this town you wouldnt believe what it does to a mans kidneys i had a pachuco workin for me you remember him donald pedro you remember how he went around after the cops had him all bent together like a horseshoe had to take off his collar to pee think of that said toddy me an donald has got a duty to do toddy the only thing is how long should we take to do it now if we was real busy say we had some money to count huhuh huhuh in spades too bad shake stared at the telephone that certainly is too bad aint it donald oh its not too bad yet said toddy lets see now it would take your pachucos a couple of minutes to get up here thats not much but i dont think you and donald can take much i really dont think you can shake of course if youd like to find out he spread his hands beaming at them mirthlessly shake drew the back of his hands across his mouth so youll sit here the rest of your life he burbled all right said toddy say that i walk out of here and you use the phone i know every bigtime con man in the country and con men stick together id make bond eventually id be around to see you you wouldnt enjoy that shake i tell you from the bottom of my heart you wouldnt he stared at them a moment longer white teeth bared eyes gray and cold then he broke the tension with an easy goodnatured laugh now why dont we stop the clowning he said you boys know im all right i know youre all right were all a little upset but were all big men we can forgive and forget and do business together donalds narrow shoulders straightened unconsciously shake emitted a ponderous wheeze now thats good sense he declared mighty good uh what kind of business did you have in mind toddy elaine was murdered for a watch there was just one guy who knew i had it the man that killed her hes got rid of the watch by now hell also have an airtight alibi so im stuck all i can do is skip town this watch did it belong to this guy in the first place no toddy lied it belonged to an old lady i fasttalked her out of it god shake i wish you and donald could have seen the pile of stuff that woman had brooches rings necklaces a good fourteenfifteen grand worth or i dont know lead from platinum an you just clipped her for the watch a twothousanddollar watch i couldnt bite her any harder without raising a chatter and of course i didnt dare go back for another try sure uhhuh shake bobbed his jowls understandingly how come you hadnt turned the watch toddy too hot milt wouldnt

a deal you just give us this old ladys address an well see that you get your cut toddy smiled at him now whats wrong with that shake demanded well cut him in for a full half wont we donald well its been nice said toddy rising ill drop you a card from mexico city now wait a minute ill wait five minutes said toddy if i dont have two hundred bucks by that time im on my way two hundred two hundred for almost a hundred times two hundred toddys eyes flickered i wont say itll be a cinch shes about the crankiest orneriest old bitch i ever tangled with she lives all alone see doesnt have anyone she

have three or four big persian cats i dont know whether theyd give you any trouble or not i could handle em said donald grimly i could handle the dame i aint seen no dame or cats yet that im afraid of toddy gave him an admiring look shake still hesitated how do i know you aint lying to us because youve got brains said toddy elaine was murdered murders arent done for peanuts it all adds up donald sees it youre as smart as donald arent you yeah but but the words shake searched for would not come to him but two hundred two hundred as of the present moment said toddy glancing at his watch i just thought of another party i can go to wholl give me two hundred shake scrambled hastily from his chair its a deal for two hundred toddy sat in a quiet booth in the bar sipping a scotch and soda while he studied the classified ads in the evening paper he was not content with what he had done no revenge could be adequate for the brutal and hideous death elaine had suffered he had however done all he could for the time being at least it would have to do he had felt for a long time that shake and donald needed a lesson their threats tonight had done nothing to ameliorate that impression now they would get that lesson one they might not live to profit by and elaines murderer the chinless man the old lady they expected to rob would get one thered be enough ruckus raised perhaps to bring in the cops it was too bad that chinless wouldnt know hed been paid off that toddy had got back at him but nothing was ever perfect hed settled two urgent accounts hed got a nice piece of scat money hed done all that he could and no man can do more he took out his billfold and under cover of the newspaper inventoried its contents three three hundred and twentyseven dollars all together not very good not when you had to buy some kind of car out of it and he would have to buy one he had no way of knowing when elaines body would be discovered he did know that the bus plane and railway terminals would be watched as soon as it was they might be looking for him already he couldnt take any chances he slid out of the booth sauntered past the bar stools and out to the walk it was quite dark now and the dark and the smog condensed the glare of neon signs to a blinding intensity still he saw he had to see and he did although nothing in his manner indicated the fact he strolled straight to the curb his attention seemingly fixed on the large wire trash basket which stood there he dropped the newspaper into it and stared absently at the large black convertible it was no more than ten feet away parked in the street with the motor idling the back seat was empty the girl was at the wheel the talking dog sat hunkered at her side his front paws on the door with an effort toddy suppressed a shudder he saw now that he hadnt really taken a good look at the dog that afternoon the damned thing wasnt as big as hed thought it was bigger and his imagination hadnt been playing tricks on him it did talk the girl beckoned to toddy come she called softly the dogs jaws waggled they yawned open cm he said cm cm cm toddy looked over them and through them he turned casually and stood staring into the bar no way out there the place had a kitchen a busy one and the rear exit lay beyond it up the street down pawnshops a dime store a butcher shop all closed now he heard the softly spoken command in spanish he heard the scratch of the dogs claws as it leaped in one swift motion toddy stooped grabbed the base of the basket and lofted it behind him either his luck or his aim was good there was a surprised yelp the rattling scrape of wire but toddy heard it from a distance he rounded the corner and raced down the gloomy side street it was not good this way but no way was good he was entering a semislum section the area of flyblown beaneries boardedup buildings flophouses and wine bars which lies adjacent to the union station no cab would stop for him here so now he ran now for the first time he knew the real terror of running to run without a goal to be hunted by the upper world and his own to run hopelessly endlessly because there was nothing to do but run sweat was pouring from him by the time he reached the end of the street and just as he reached its end he saw a huge black form a shadow whip around its head the dog on his trail behind him the girl circling the block to head him off that was the way it would be hed have to get in someplace fast in and out throw them off keep running the dusty windows of a deserted pool hall stared back at him blankly next a barber shop also dark next a burlesque house across the grimy front cardboard cutouts of bosomy women purpleeyed pinkhaired women in flesh tights and sagging net brassieres sprawled beneath them and gazing lewdly upward the cutout of a man puttynosed baggytrousered derbyhatted names in red and white paint bingo brannigan chiffon lafleur fanchon rose colette casitas and everywhere on streamers and onesheets and cardboard easels the legend big girl show dont do it some more yessir the beeg show is just starting a cane rattled and drummed against the display yessir intoned the slopechested skeleton in the linen jacket step right in sir he coughed as he took toddys tenspot but there was no surprise in it he had always coughed he could not be surprised yessir he was repeating the instructions before toddy had finished them split with the cashier havent seen you close the door exit tough the skeleton coughed over the stage toddy went in anyway it was too late to turn back he moved past the halfcurtains of the foyer and stood staring down the long steep aisle not that he wanted one but there didnt seem to be an empty seat in the joint it was packed twin swaths of heads terrazos of grays and blacks and baldpinks stretched from the rear of the house to the orchestra pit in the pit there was only a piano player banging out his own version of the sugar roll blues it must have been his own no one else would have had it toddys nose crinkled at the stench a compound of the aromas of puke sweat urine and a patented perfume disinfectant all the burly houses used that same disinfectant it was the product of a company which by an odd coincidence also manufactured stink bombs it was the only thing that would cover up the odor of a stink bomb he went slowly down the aisle ears strained for sounds of the danger behind him eyes fixed on the stage three chorus girls were on it the shows entire line apparently they were stooped over buttocks to the audience wiggling and jerking in dreary rhythm to the jangling chords of the piano as toddy advanced the women straightened and moved off the stage each giving her rear a final twitch as she disappeared into the wings a man in baggy pants and a red undershirt came out in his exaggerated anxiety to peer after the girls he stumbled he appeared to stumble his derby flipped off turned once in the air then dropped neatly over his long putty nose laughter swelled from the audience and there was a burst of hand clapping the comic removed the derby and spat into it he pulled the baggy pants away from his stomach and went through the motion of emptying the hat into them keep our city clean he explained more laughter clapping stamping feet mi mi mi chortled the comic tapping his chest and coughing with your kind indulgence i shall now sing that touching old love song a heartrending melody entitled if a hen lays a cracked egg will the chicken be nutty laughter a chord from the piano toddy swung a foot to the pit rail and stepped across to the stage the comic stared he grasped toddys hand and wrung it warmly dont tell me sir dont tell me mr addison simms of seattle isnt it no laughter it was over their heads beneath the grease paint the painted grin the comic scowled why mr simms he said aloud simpering twisting we cant do that not with all these people watching howling laughter this was right up the audiences alley the scowl disappeared the comedian released toddys hand and flung both arms around him head cuddled against toddys chest he called coyly to the audience isnt he darling dont you just lahve big men you wont hurt me will you mr simms above the whistling roar of the crowd toddy heard another sound in the back of the house a brief flash of light marked the opening of the door a shouted distant curse the stifled scream of a woman toddy tried to jerk free and was held more tightly than ever keeiss me you brute take me in yoah ahms and oof toddy gave him another one in the guts for luck then a stiffarm in the face the comedian stumbled backwards stumbling waving his arms he skidded across the top of the piano and fell into the audience over his shoulder toddy got a glimpse of people rising in their seats milling into the aisle he did not wait to see more he darted into the wings ducked a kick from a brawny man in an undershirt and gave a blinding backhanded slap in return a chorus girl tried to conk him with a wine bottle he caught her upraised arm and whirled her around he sent her sprawling into another girl a big blonde with a pair of scissors the third girl whizzed a jar of grease paint at him then fled screaming onto the stage the exit was locked he had to give it two spinerattling kicks before the latch snapped he stumbled out into the night wedged a loaded trash barrel against the door that wouldnt hold long and ran on again he came out of the alley onto another side street and this was more hopeless than the first one no lights shone several of the buildings were in the process of being razed the others were boarded up he started down it at a trot panting nervous sweat pouring into his eyes he ran wearily and then his head turned in an unbelieving stare and he staggered into a doorway there was a double swinging door with small glass ports on either side through the ports drifted a dim almost indiscernible glow he went in he was looking up a long dimly lit stairway a very long stairway what had once been the second floor was now boarded off except for the former secondfloor landing the stairs rose straight to the third floor gratefully he saw that the swinging doors were bracketed for a bar not only that but the bar was there a stout piece of twobyfour leaning against the wall he picked it up and slid it into the brackets he put a foot on the steps the boards gave slightly under his tread and somewhere in the dimness above him a bell tinkled he hesitated then went on a man was standing at the head of the stairs he had a crew haircut and a mouthful of gum and a pair of pants that rose to his armpits he also had a sawedoff baseball bat he twiddled it at his side as he stared at toddy with incurious eyes yeah mac uh i want to see mable said toddy mable huh sure shes here agnes and becky too the man chuckled he waited then jerked his head impatiently you cant jump em on the stairs mac thats the only way they wont do it but they wont do it that way toddy ascended to the landing he reached for his wallet and the man moved his hand in a negative gesture just pay the gal mac now les see doors perhaps a dozen of them extended the length of the hallway doorways with halfdoors summer doors attached to the outer casing the man nodded pointed to a patch of light ruthies free go right on down mac he gave toddys elbow a cordial push then his arm tightened on it in a viselike grip what the hells that racket racket said toddy you heard me you bar that door down there why the hell would i do that wait a minute said toddy i had to boot a wino out of the doorway to get in he must have come back again the man cursed them winos and the goddam cops wont do a thing about them he headed down the stairs scowling twirling the sawedoff bat toddy moved away from the stairwell there was no window at either end of the hall there was nothing to indicate which of the rooms opened on the fire escape thered be one surely even in a whorehouse but hed have to hunt for it come on gizmo he thought be good to me he rapped once then entered the room the man had indicated he hooked the summer door behind him he grinned pleasantly as he closed and locked the other door hi ruthie he said howve you been how you honey she made a pretense of recognizing him aint seen you in a long time she might have been twentyfive or ten years older depending on how long shed been at it redhaired piled together pretty good she wore sheer silk stockings highheeled black pumps and a black nylon brassiere that was all she wore she was sitting on the edge of the bed shaving her calves you mind waitin a second honey i kinda hate to stop an start all over again let me help you said toddy promptly he took the razor from her hand and pushed her gently back on the bed he said sorry kid and snapped his free fist against the point of her chin her eyes closed and her arms went limp her feet slipped from the mattress and he caught and lowered them to the floor stepping to the window he ducked under the shade and looked out wrong room the fire escape opened on the next one he might but no it was too far he could barely see the damned thing trying to jump that far in the dark would be suicide ducking back into the room he stepped to the tall japanese screen and moved it aside there was a low door behind it a door blocked by a small bureau toddy almost laughed aloud at the sight of it a bureau joint for gods sake hed thought that gimmick had gone out with dardanella probably it had too this one probably wasnt used any more but it might still be working in this little frammis one of the oldest you were persuaded to leave your clothes on the bureau you see honey no one can touch em the door swings in this way and the bureaus in front of it you can see for yourself honey toddy pulled out the top drawer and laid it on the bed reaching into the opening he found the doorknob would the dodge work from this side that was the question if it didnt the knob turned slowly there was a quiet click then a little above the level of the bureau the mortised panels of the door parted and the upper half swung toward him the head of a brass bedstead blocked the doorway on the other side the man in it stared stupidly through the rails at toddy he was a young man but he had a thick platinum blond beard or so it seemed then he raised his head bewilderedly and toddy saw that the hair spread out on the pillow beneath him was a womans ffor gosh sake the man gasped indignantly what kind of a whorehouse is toddys hand shot out he caught the guy by the back of the head and jerked it between the bedrails the man grunted the platinum hair stirred frantically on the pillow to an accompaniment of smothered groans toddy gave the bed a push it slid forward a few inches and he entered the room he stepped out the window and stared down the fire escape he took two steps a third the fourth was into space except for his grip on the handrail he would have plunged into the alley he drew himself back stood hugging the metal breathlessly should have expected this he thought buildings probably been condemned for years now he looked upward no telling what was up there but it was the only way to go all hell was breaking loose as he started up again doors were slamming women screaming men cursing there was the thunder of overturning furniture of heavy objects swung wickedly and with it all of course the fearsome threatening snarl of the talking dog suddenly arms shot out of the window and clutched at toddys feet he kicked blindly and heard a yell of pain he raced up the remaining steps to the roof stepping over the parapet his hand dislodged a brick and he flung it downward heard it shatter on the steel landing he pushed mightily with his foot and a whole section of the wall went tumbling down that he thought would give them something to think about slowly picking his way in the darkness he started across the roof there was no way out on either of the side streets he had been on that meant hed have to try for something on the parallel thoroughfare up at this end naturally as far as he could get from the burly house he bumped painfully into a chimney stumbled over an abandoned tar pot he paused to flex his agonized toes and shake the sweat from his eyes unknotting his tie he stuffed it into the pocket of his coat and swung the coat over his arm he was almost to the street now and the majority of the buildings should be occupied at any moment he should be coming to a rooftrap or a skylight where ooof glass shattered under his feet there was a flash of light he tried to throw himself backward and knew sickeningly that it was too late he shot downward with a groaning wirish whree something caught his body in a sagging embrace it hugged then shoved him away upward he landed on his side unhurt but badly shaken he opened his eyes cautiously he was lying on the floor beside a metal cot a cot which obviously would never be slept in again down this side of the room and along the other were rows of other cots at one end of the room easily identifiable despite the halfpartitions around them were shower stalls and a line of toilets a flophouse toddy thought then he noticed the multitudinous chromos on the walls god is love jesus saves the lord is my shepherd and he amended the opinion a mission flophouse heb he got up and brushed the glass from his clothes picking up his coat he crossed to the other side of the room and looked out a window the stale air and the almost complete absence of light told him what he could not see an air shaft hed have to go out through the door at the end of the room and if he knew his missions thered be plenty of people to pass pondering drearily desperately a hope born of utter hopelessness entered and teased at his mind maybe chinless hadnt got to elaine maybe he didnt want to get toddy he might not have missed the watch he might uh just want to talk to him oh hell why kid himself still the idea wasnt completely crazy was it elaines murder had taken careful timing a complete disregard for danger on the part of the murderer anyone as ruthless and resourceful as that would not waste time with dogs not if they wanted to bump you chinless must have missed the watch hed missed it and he was holding off on killing him toddy until he got it back he but wait a minute if chinless had got to elaine he already had the watch why else would he have killed is this right brother said a severe voice is this how we live in gods way the man wore that look of puffed elation which seems to be the trademark of dogooders an expression born of a conscious constipation of goodness of great deeds and wondrous wisdom held painfully in check a resigned look a martyred look a determinedly sad look a perpetual bitterness at the worlds unawareness of their worth at the fact that men born of clay take no joy in excrement regardless of its purveyor the man had a thick sturdy body a bull neck a size six and five eighths head he gripped toddys arm and marched him swiftly toward the door dont do this again brother he warned the physical man must be provided for yes we recognize the fact but before that comes our duty to god toddy made sounds of acquiescence this guy obviously wasnt used to having his authority questioned they went down a short flight of stairs which opened abruptly into a small sweatandurinescented auditorium tight rows of wooden camp chairs were packed with the usual crowd of mission stiffs birds who were too low lazy or incapacitated to get their grub and flop by other means the man shoved toddy into a chair in the front row gave him a menacing glare and stepped to the rostrum i apologize for this slight delay brethren he said with no trace of apology for your sakes i hope there will be no more you are not entitled to the comfortable beds and nourishing food which you find here they are gifts something given you out of gods mercy and goodness remember that and conduct yourselves accordingly we will rise now and praise him from whom all blessings flow he nodded to the woman on the platform and her hands struck the keys of the upright piano everyone rose and began to sing there was a comedian immediately behind toddy he liked the melody to the hymn apparently but not the lyrics and he improvised his own instead of praise him from whom all blessings flow he sang something about raisin skins and holy joe the next song was onward christian soldiers which the comedian turned into a panegyric on rocks and boulders the padding in his opinion of mission mattresses toward the end of the hymn the preacher cocked his head to one side and sharply extended his hand the pianist stopped playing the bums lapsed into silence someone here he said staring hard at toddy someone thinks he is pretty funny if he persists if he commits any further disturbance i am going to take stern measures with him let him be warned toddy stared intently at the song book there was a heavy silence and then another song was struck up nearer my god to thee the comedian behaved himself this time but some guy in the back of the house was sure giving out with the corn he was gargling the words he seemed to be trying to sing and swallow hot mush at the same time the preacher looked at toddy he stood on tiptoe and stared out over the congregation they went on singing fearfully afraid to stop and the corny guy seemed to edge closer toddy stole a glance up from his book the preachers mouth had dropped open he was no longer singing but his hand continued to move through the air unconsciously waving time to the hymn then at last the owner of the preposterous voice came into toddys view he sat down at his side on the floor and laid his great pearshaped head against toddys hip having thus established proprietorship he faced the rostrum opened his great jaws to their widest and sang nrrahhhh meodd teeeee he was best on the high notes and he knew it he held them far beyond their nominal worth disregarding the faltering guidance of the piano and the bums fearinspired determination to forge ahead with the song nrrahhh teee he howled neeerroww teeee there was a crash as the preacher hurled his hymnal to the floor purple with rage he pointed a quivering finger at toddy get that animal out of here get him out instantly hes not mine said toddy dont lie to me you sneaked him in here tonight thats why you were skulking upstairs of course hes yours anyone can see hes yours now get him out toddy gave up he had to the guy would be blowing the whistle on him in a minute he turned and started for the door the dog hesitated obviously torn between desire and training then with a surly ineverhaveanyfun look he followed toddy paused on the sidewalk and put on his coat the dog nudged him brusquely in the buttocks he walked toward the curb and the front door of the convertible swung open toddy climbed in heard the dog thump into the back seat and leaned back wearily what the hells it all about he demanded what do you want with me you will know very soon the girl said and she would say no more than that up until he met and married elaine ives toddys world despite its superficially complex appearance was remarkably uncomplicated sound and practical motives guided every action whims if you were unfortunate to have them were kept to yourself given a certain situation you could safely depend upon certain actions and reactions you might get killed for the change in your pocket you would never get hurt however simply because someone felt like dishing it out thus on his wedding night as he pushed himself up from the floor and slowly massaged his aching head he couldnt accept the thing that had been done to him he couldnt see it for what it was shed been playing putting on a show for him obviously shed just carried the act a little too far she couldnt have meant what shed said what shed done she just couldnt have gosh honey he said with a rueful smile lets not play so rough huh now what kind of whiskey would you like im sorry ttoddy i she choked and tears filled her eyes forget it he said youve just had a little more excitement than you can take i should have seen it i shouldnt have made you beg for a drink after all youve been through that was the way the incident ended it was the way a dozen similar ones ended during the next few months he gave in and with each giving in her charm became thinner the pretense of affection a leaner shadow why bother with charm with pretending something she was incapable of feeling it was easier and more to her taste simply to raise hell still toddy couldnt understand he refused to understand shed married him why had she done that unless she loved him he wouldnt accept the contemptuous explanation she gave that marriage even to a chump like him was better than working she couldnt mean that how could she when hed done nothing to hurt her and was willing to do anything he could to help her the fact that shed make such a statement was proof that she was seriously ill and so toddy took her to a couple of psychiatrists the first had offices in his own building on wilshire boulevard and he charged fifty dollars for a thirtyminute consultation he allowed toddy to spend one hundred and fifty with him before curtly advising him to spend no more your wife is not an alcoholic mr kent he said in alcoholic circles she is what is known as to speak plainly a gutter drunk a degenerate she could stop drinking any time she chose to she does not choose to she is too selfish in a way you are fortunate she might have had a penchant for murder if she had she would probably pursue it as relentlessly as this will to drink the opinion of the second psychiatrist coincided pretty largely with that of the first but he was longer in arriving at it he spent much more time talking to toddy than to elaine usually detaining him for an hour or so after each consultation toddy didnt mind the guy was obviously a square shooter and interesting to talk to toddy he said quietly one afternoon the last afternoon they talked together why do you stick with hei anyway ive told you shes no good im sure you must know its the truth why continue a relationship that can only end in one way i dont know that shes no good said toddy i know that she needs help that im the only person she doesnt need help shes been helped too much she got along most of her life without you and she can get along very well without you for the rest of it the elaines of this world have a peculiar talent for survival put it this way then said toddy i married her for better or for worse im not going to pull out and no im not going to let her just because things dont break quite the way i think they should the psychiatrist nodded seriously now were getting somewhere he said were approaching your real reason at last lets examine it and see how it stands up your parents were divorced and your mother remarried from then on until you ran away you lived in hell the experience gave you an undying hatred of divorce you made up your mind that youd never do what your parents had done all right i can understand that attitude but he pointed with his pipestem its ridiculous to maintain it in this present case youre married to a virtual maniac you havent any children now stop living with the past and use that intelligence i know you have i toddy shook his head what did you mean doc when you said the marriage elaines and mine could only end in one way i dont think ill tell you i think it would make a greater impression if you told yourself how do i go about doing that well lets start back with the time you ran away from home your reason for leaving as i remember was that one of the barn rafters had broken and struck your stepfather you were afraid you might be held responsible for the accident so you ran away well said toddy it was an accident said the psychiatrist and yet you had a package of sandwiches a lunch all prepared you were able to get away just in time to catch the evening freight out of town that toddy is just about the most opportune accident i ever heard of toddy looked blank for a moment then he grinned and so on down the line the psychiatrist sighed youre easy to get along with youll suffer a great deal before you act if youd been treated fairly by your stepfather or the county attorney or that gambling house proprietor in reno or the detective in fort worth or but that isnt important its not what im talking about what are you talking about you must know toddy the fact that you cant admit the things youve done even to yourself at heart youre what youd call a square john youre peaceful you dont ask much but to be left alone and leave others alone thats your basic pattern and life hasnt let you follow that pattern youve been forced into one situation after another where your strong sense of justice has impelled you to acts which were hateful to you get away from elaine toddy get away and stay away before you kill her the chinless man chuckled softly and massaged his hands i present my proposition a little too fast eh it was not what you expected i must apologize incidentally for the manner in which you were induced to return here it seemed necessary it was important that i talk to you and i felt you might not respond to a simple request to call he waited beaming apparently for toddy to make some polite disclaimer toddy didnt for the moment at least he was incapable of saying or doing anything as you can see chinless continued i mean you no harm quite the contrary in fact despite the perhaps regrettable preliminaries of our meeting i mean to benefit you and of course to benefit myself i would like to have you believe that mr kent that i hold nothing but the friendliest feelings toward you he paused again his beady black eyes fixed on toddys well said toddy and his head moved in a vague halfnod good said the man promptly now we will go into the matter in detail take up details in their proper order first of all my name is alvarado i am known by that name you of course are todd or toddy kent also known as t jameson kent toddmore kent kent todd and various other aliases as you can see i took the liberty of looking into your record after your visit here this afternoon it interested me very much it is largely why i have prevailed upon you to make this second visit i toddy swallowed i see as you have probably observed alvarado went on leaning forward earnestly extralegal careers seldom attract the type of men which their successful pursuit demands a willingness to flout oftenfoolish laws yes that characteristic is so common as to be unnoteworthy but much more than that is required such men as yourself are indeed rare i do not flatter you mr kent when i say that some episodes in your past reflect positive genius toddy nodded again his tense nerves relaxing a little you find the dog disturbing mr kent you need not he is a working dog quite harmless actually unless ordered to be otherwise i was just wondering said toddy how you found out so much about me so fast nothing could have been simpler a description of you and a generous retainer naturally to one of the better private detectives a brief check at the city license bureau then a few cautious longdistance calls here and there by the way mr kent alvarado chuckled i should not show myself around chicago if i were you i dont intend to said toddy now about this proposition of yours youd better not tell me about it i dont think i can take it but i do not understand the police are looking for me or they will be before long my wife was murdered tonight strangled in our room at the hotel murdered alvarado frowned strangled in your hotel room what time was this mr kent early this evening between sixthirty and seven approximately toddy forced a smile to tell the truth i thought you did it i why did you think that whoever killed her took the watch since it was your watch and you were the only one who knew i had it i naturally thought youd done it alvarado stared at him in dead silence the frown on his fishpale face deepening then unaccountably the beady eyes twinkled and he laughed with genuine amusement the watch was taken eh that is very funny ha ha you are very amusing mr kent like me you have a sense of humor i am glad to know it but now wait a minute toddy protested i i understand ha ha i understand very well perhaps for the moment however we had better continue with our business but you as i was about to explain alvarado said firmly my original motive in having you investigated was precautionary i wished to discover whether you were of the type to take the watch with all it would reveal to the knowing to the police happily i found you were not you have every reason to avoid contact with the police that is right is it not yes but toddy gave up he couldnt see why alvarado thought the murder so funny but since he did that was that for the moment he wasnt in a position to question the chinless man right now he was on the receiving end of the questions yes he said thats right i cant go to the police as i so ascertained alvarado nodded and having done so i invited you here for some time mr kent a change in the personnel of this organization of one of the personnel has been strongly indicated in fact i have recommended such a change but since no substitute for the incumbent was available the recommendation did not carry much weight in you i think i have found that longneeded replacement you say you recommended the change toddy asked yes my superiors are not in this country and it is necessary to consult them on such matters within reasonable bounds however they will act on my recommendations i dont know said toddy casually i cant see any big money in running gold across the border not for the individual runner that was not what i had in mind well you know im not a goldsmith i know i see said toddy whos your present supplier really mr kent alvarado laughed but i do not condemn your curiosity it would be a splendid thing to know would it not thats the spot youre planning for me alvarado shrugged for large rewards mr kent one must expect to take certain chances your history indicates a willingness to do so up to a point toddy qualified theres one thing i dont understand how can you get enough scrap gold to keep this racket running another secret you will understand when it is necessary for you to i toddy spread his hands helplessly i just dont see much point in discussing it mr alvarado it sounds like a good proposition one id jump at ordinarily but i cant take it now no no my wife was murdered tonight im the logical suspect i cant show myself anywhere if i could id be hunting down the murderer alvarado started to smile again ah yes your wife the watch perhaps you had better give me the watch now mr kent dammit toddy snapped i just got through telling you that you want to keep it of course alvarado nodded understandingly you would be unintelligent if you did not try to i do not blame you in the least but it is impossible but i havent it is a sort of pattern a template you see without it our work here would be seriously delayed so alvarados eyes glinted fire the watch mr kent toddy got to his feet carefully holding his arms out from his sides the dog rose also turning an inquiring eye toward the chinless man go ahead and search me said toddy hoarsely i cant give you something i havent got since you are willing to be searched you obviously do not have it with you you will please tell me immediately where it is i told you i dont know it was stolen he moved back a step as alvarado rose good god do you think id make up a yarn like that i thought youd killed her thats why i tried to get away from the girl i what you thought mr kent was that i was a fool i am afraid you still think so did you dispose of it to that loan shark you visited that petty racketeer or to that watch shop where you sell your gold carefully now i can discover the truth of your answer quickly enough ive told you the truth said toddy simply i cant tell you anything more alvarados hand dipped into the inside pocket of his coat and emerged with a snubnosed automatic he held it pointing squarely at toddys stomach this is embarrassing he sighed as well as vastly annoying before telling me that your wife had been murdered you should have made sure that i could not prove the contrary prove now you will accompany me to the hotel and extricate the watch from wherever you have hidden it the hell i will toddy shook his head really mr kent alvarado grimaced you must know you are being preposterous i know im not going to walk into a roomful of cops snapped toddy not if i had a dozen popguns like that pointing at me the talking dog whined softly and looked up at them then padded away unnoticed in the tension of the moment ever so little the chinless mans eyes wavered he moved back a step or two until he was no longer standing on the rug he stamped his foot on the floor a door opened and clicked shut there was a gasp and then the girl swept into the room alvarado you promised me that silence the word cracked like a whip i have not broken that promise yet i would much prefer not to tell me where did you pick up mr kents trail tonight why i i the girl looked at toddy didnt he tell you answer me quickly truthfully and in complete detail i picked him up him and the other man i told you of about three blocks from the hotel they were going south on spring street as i told you i had to circle a number of blocks driving up and down before alvarados hand jerked sidewise the gun barrel whipped across the girls breasts and back again you were listening at the door eh you would remove mr kent from the difficult position in which his stupidity has placed him i will give you one more chance why was it when you were given mr kents address you were forced to pick him up several blocks away because he got away from me yes i it was as i told you he was leaving the hotel when i first saw him that was at about six oclock i followed him from there to the watch shop then back again in my haste to park i passed through a red light a police officer saw me he insisted on giving me a lecture then on trying to arrange a later meeting a rosy flush spread under the creamcolored skin and her eyes lowered for a moment i do not know exactly how long it was before i got away perhaps twenty minutes perhaps a total time of thirtyminutes elapsed before i parked the car and got up to mr kents room go on you knocked on the door you tried it and found it unlocked see i save you the repetition of tiresome details i went in mr kent was not there but the room was in great disarray eh you were shocked by its condition the girl shook her head no she said dully there was no disarray the room was in quite good order now wait a minute toddy exclaimed i left that room just quiet mr kent you will have ample opportunity to talk in a moment i shall even assist you alvarado grinned at him fiercely then nodded to the girl you say the room was in reasonably good order dolores surely you are overlooking one very important item only a few minutes before or so he tells me the body of mr kents wife was in that room brutally murdered strangled with her own stockings killed and robbed of the watch which mr kent had hidden in a dresser drawer you recollect it now eh you remember this shocking sight now that i have refreshed your memory the body of mr kents wife was in the room yes answer me poised at the front door the doberman turned his great head and stared at them thoughtfully then he bellied down at the threshold moved his muzzle back and forth across the lintel a quiet waiting purr ebbed up from deep in his throat well we are waiting dolores the girl hesitated a moment longer her lip caught between her small white teeth then she looked up she spoke staring straight into toddys eyes no she said there was no body airedale aahrens let the telephone jangle for a full minute while he lay cursing bitterly then he kicked back the bedcovers snapped on the reading lamp and literally hurled himself across the room george he howled into the wall telephone how many times do i gotta tell you i oh he said after a minute well okay george send him up unlatching the door he slid his feet into house slippers and shuffled out to the kitchenette he poured himself a glass of milk from the refrigerator and carried it back into the other room the door opened and city councilman julius klobb came in look he said this elaine ives kent youve got to have her in court in the morning i do huh airedale took a sip of milk who says so yes you do and i say so and you know why i say it shell have to do her time naturally part of it anyway until the heat goes off heat said airedale sourly nine grand he takes off of me last year and still we got heat maybe i ought to fix through a beat cop or one of them guys that cleans out the washroom maybe they could earn their money councilman klobb spread his hands thats not being reasonable airedale he said reproachfully the lids been off now for well over eighteen months almost two years now without the slightest kind of rumble i cant help it if we have an opposition party and they squeeze out from under once in a while frankly i wouldnt have it any other way and i know you wouldnt its what makes america great competition unceasing struggle airedale groaned unceasing horseshit put it away will you save it for the fourth of july youll have her there if it has to be her we couldnt throw em another chump of course not twentythree arrests in a year and shes never laid out a day shes the one theyll tie into you know whatll happen when they do good god man do i have to draw you a picture he didnt have to of course airedale had known what to expect from the moment elaines name had been mentioned in many cities bail is set to approximate the fine for a misdemeanor and its forfeiture automatically closes the case usually however often in those places where the practice is most thoroughly entrenched there are periods when it becomes inoperative bail then gives the lawbreaker his freedom only until court is held and if he fails to appear he is considered a fugitive this as airedale well knew must not be allowed to happen in elaines case obviously the political opposition intended to use her as a broom in a thoroughly unpleasant housecleaning this woman theyd say theyd shout has forfeited almost two thousand dollars in bonds where is that money what is there to show for it what besides a parcel of land which has already been obligated for twenty times its appraised value airedale shook his head ruefully to stave off an investigation elaine would have to face court on charges which under adverse circumstances could total up to months in jail and or several thousand dollars in fines shed be sore as hell which didnt trouble airedale in the least toddy would be sore and that did trouble him toddy had laid his money on the line now he wouldnt get anything for it airedale would return the dough he had paid of course but that wouldnt help much once a rap was squared it was supposed to stay squared how about this he said cant we get our paper back and put up the cash in its place would i be here if we could klobb demanded cant you see they planned this so we wouldnt have time to squeeze out airedale nodded for elaine to face court was bad but the alternative was indescribably worse to face it himself okay i dont like it but okay shell be there good councilman klobb stood up better get her on the phone right now hadnt you get her on the phone mocked airedale yessir thats all i need to do just tell her to go down and turn herself in but klobb frowned oh i see do you see that door said airedale klobb saw it rather hastily he put it to use airedale began to dress some fifteen minutes later he stepped out of a cab at toddys hotel and went inside he was acquainted with the room clerk he was acquainted with practically everyone in a certain stratum of the citys society the clerk winked amiably and extended a hand across the counter hows it goin boy who you looking for might be you you pretty thing said airedale but ill settle for toddy kent kent im not sure that hes regis oh said the clerk glancing at the bill in his hand yeah we got him want me to give him a buzz not now is his key in his box that dont mean nothing people here carry their keys mostly he should be in though him and the missus both i aint seen em go out airedale deliberated he had a deputy sheriffs commission but he was reluctant to use it it was always much better particularly when you were dealing with a friend to have someone else do the strongarm work wheres old lardass the demon house dick up with some broad probably no there he is the clerk pointed in stuffing his gut airedale glanced toward the coffee shop okay ill drag him out about three minutes after you see us catch the elevator you ring hell out of kents phone airedale got hold of kennedy the house detective and together they went upstairs they stopped at toddys door almost immediately the phone began to ring it rang steadily for what must have been a full two minutes there was no other sound either then or after it had stopped airedale raised his fist and pounded he stood aside and nodded to kennedy the house dick gripped the doorknob with one hand with the other he poised a peculiarly notched key before the keyhole he slowly turned the knob and pushed gently he dropped the key back into his pocket drew out a shotweighted blackjack and abruptly flung the door open okay he growled come out of it then after a moments wait he went in and airedale followed him they looked in the bathroom the closet and under the bed panting from the unaccustomed activity and his recent meal kennedy dropped into a chair and fanned his face with his hat well he said they aint here no kidding said airedale airedale went to the window and looked out he looked down at the oncewhite enameled sill at the streaked outline of a heelprint kennedy said she gave ol toddy a little more than he would take tonight boy you could hear her yelling a block away yeah im tellin you airedale it sounded like he was killin her if id had my way hed of gone ahead and done it so what did you do gave him a ring shed already shut up by then though and there wasnt another peep after that airedale stared in unwinking silence and the house detective shifted uncomfortably guess they must of gone out he remarked averting his eyes from the bondsmans liquid brown gaze must of absently scratching his nose airedale started for the window again and his protruding elbow struck against the stack of the incinerator he leaped back with a profane yell kennedy roared and pounded his knee oh jjesus he laughed you should of seen yourself airedale what the hell is this airedale demanded a hotel or a crematory what you got a goddam furnace goin for in weather like this panting shaking with laughter the house detective explained the nature of the stack airedale made a closer examination of it he kicked it he removed a wisp of hair from the clamp he measured the stack with his eye and knew unwillingly that it was quite large enough to hold a womans body strolling back toward his hotel he considered the smog through doggish eyes reflecting unsentimentally that elaine was doubtless part of it by now that would be like her to remain a nuisance even in death certainly it had been like her to get herself killed at such a completely inopportune time when she failed to show in the morning the cops would come after her theyd do a little investigating a little talking here and there and the dragnet would go out for toddy there was an allnight drugstore on the next cornet airedale went in entered a telephone booth and closed the door firmly behind him he consulted a small black notebook and creased a number therein with his thumbnail fumbling for a coin he checked over the contemplated project for possible pitfalls fingerprints no theyd gotten her prints on her first arrest and they hadnt bothered with them since pictures no they already had her mug too the newspapers and the police and as long as she showed up in court a woman of about the same age and size and coloring yeah it could be done all right hundreds of women were in the los angeles courts every week elaine would draw the interest of papers and police only if she didnt show up airedale dropped a slug into the coin box and dialed a number billie he stared out through the door glass airedale hows it goin yeah well its slow all over they tell me howd you like a cinch for a while oh a buck no ill make it a buck and a half sure dont you understand english a hundred and a half a week well ill have to talk it over with you personally i dont like to kick it around on the phone expenses sure you get em billie girl board and room absolutely free toddy stared at the girl stonily that reluctance of hers the way shed seemingly made alvarado drag the story out of her had been very well done hed almost believed for a moment that she was on his side and now shed lied it had to be a lie either that or it was about time to wake up it was time to give himself a pinch put on his clothes and go out for coffee with the body there in the room the murder made sense it put a frame on him like a mack truck without the body it was just plain damned screwy it was nuts with a plus sign well mr kent alvarado grinned satirically toddy shook his head ive said all ive got to say i see dolores you will remain here you mr kent in front of me and through that door i think you will be interested to see our basement wait the girls voice was a sharp whisper perrito alvarado the dog alvarado looked his gaze moved sufficiently from toddy to take in the front door he asked a soft question in spanish hombres perrito si hombres eyes shining with excitement the dog took a few prancing steps toward him his jaws waggled with the effort to articulate bueno perro said alvarado stand the dog became a statue a waisthigh ebony menace pointed motionlessly toward the door the lights dolores alvarado moved behind toddy jabbed and held the gun against his back the lights went off dead silence settled over the room it was like that for minutes absolute silence except for the restrained whisper of their breathing then distantly from outside and overhead came a soft ping that the cutting of the telephone wire ended the silence having removed their sole danger or so they thought the prowlers were actually noisy there was a scraping of feet against wood a noisy thud footsteps clattered across the porch a whining scratching sound marked the slashing of the screen the door shivered the knob turned and out of the darkness came a profane expression of pleased surprise feet scuffled the door clicked shut again the lights went on shake and donald stood side by side on the threshold their eyes blinked against the light then they ceased to blink grew wider and wider in their greenishwhite faces j jjjjjjj said donald shakes pudding head wobbled helplessly oscillating he sagged back against the door alvarados icy voice snapped him ludicrously erect take three steps forward now lock your arms behind you dolores he jerked his head the girl went in back of the two men she searched them with contemptuous efficiency donald of course was equipped with his long thinhandled knife from shakes hip pocket she withdrew a mans sock weighted and knotted together at the top she was about to toss it to the floor when alvarado held out his hand if you please he hefted the sock grinning at the two thugs as he moved slightly away from toddy the chicken claws eh the sock loaded with broken glass to what do i owe this honor gentlemen it that dont really hurt mister shake blurted foolishly wwe wouldnt i am familiar with its possibilities i wonder if you would still maintain it doesnt hurt if i should swing it vigorously against your crotch shake turned a shade greener donald pointed an angrily indignant finger at toddy hes the guy you ought to do it to mister he got us to come here did he indeed just ast him if he didnt told us they was an old lady livin here all by herself an old crippled dame with a pile of jewelry thats just what he done sir shake chorused righteously got us to give him two hundred dollars for tippin us off alvarado glanced quizzically at toddy toddy shrugged i see you nodding at donald is that what you were discussing with him earlier this evening it aint all we was discussing donald eyed toddy venomously what we was really discussing was murder we thats how we happened to make the deal with him he killed his wife and he needed the money to blow town on oh now alvarado laughed murder his wife i find that hard to believe doubtless he only told you that as a means of obtaining your money i tell ya he killed her anyways donald qualified reluctantly she got killed she was layin on the bed right there in his hotel room alvarado made a sound of disbelief he invited you up to pay your respects i suppose at what time was this right around sixthirty an no he didnt invite me up there i sneaked up while he was out see i was gonna cut him up when he came back he babbled on eagerly anxious to make the evidence against toddy as damning as possible shake tried to interrupt him once he seemed to sense that there was much more here than met the eye a cold word from alvarado however and shake was reduced to flabby quaking silence donald concluded the recital with a vicious leer at toddy slowly the chinless man turned to the girl well i told you what i saw there is nothing more i can say so sighed alvarado we are confronted with two contradictory truths apparently contradictory i should say i wonder but we must not bother these gentlemen with out petty problems they are obviously men of large affairs we must speed them on their way with of course some small memento of their visit he moved smiling toward the two you would like to leave it that way gentlemen after all breaking and entering is a very serious crime they nodded vigorously alvarados smile vanished i will do you a favor turn around bbut i withdraw the favor he swung the sock once twice he dropped it and grabbed the dog by the collar the blood scent arouses him gentlemen i advise you to run very fast they stared at him stupidly dazed not grasping his meaning the blows had reddened their faces there was no other sign of their impact then it came the blood it spurted out from ten thousand pinpoint fountains formed into hideous redthreaded masks the dog snarled and lunged quickly snapped alvarado and there was no doubting the urgency of his voice shake and donald came alive simultaneously they hurled themselves at the door and wedged there clawing and cursing hysterically they broke free they stumbled and fell down the steps the sound of their frantically pounding footsteps receded and vanished into the night alvarado closed the door and stood with his back to it he smiled at toddy as he delivered a firmly admonitory kick in the dogs ribs i seem to owe you an apology mr kent i wonder if you will be generous enough to forgive and forget if in short you are still of a mind to accept the offer i made you earlier toddys brow wrinkled maybe but what about my wife regardless of whats happened to the body my wifes absence is going to be noticed its just a matter of time until the police will be looking for me i cant show myself i dont see how you can afford to be tied up with me i am planning mr kent to absolve you of the murder naturally you would be of no use to me otherwise youre planning toddy said but how why how i cannot yet tell you as to the why i have a double reason not only do i wish to have you associated with me but i think it highly possible that the murderer may be my enemy as well as yours alvarado held up his hand please for the present there is little more that i can tell you and you have not accepted my offer or have you all right toddy made up his mind its my only chance youve got yourself a boy good now who knew that you had the watch you did of course and dolores but who else you told your wife about it naturally no neither her nor anyone else you are positive of that did you say anything to anyone which might even by a remote chance lead them to suspect that you had the watch no i toddy paused doubtfully did you or not this is easily as important to you as it is to me mr kent i talked to the man i sell gold to toddy gave him a brief summary of his conversation with milt it couldnt have meant anything to him anyway my wife was killed at just about the time i was talking to him then he is of no interest to us it is as i thought yes alvarado nodded absently yes it must be so but sit down mr kent would you like some coffee fine so would i dolores toddy sat down and lighted a cigarette alvarado waited until the kitchen door had closed before he spoke i will tell you something he said quietly and please do not ask me to elaborate at this time i place no great confidence in dolores do not trust her too far i dont trust anyone very far said toddy excellent she is an attractive girl and not i am afraid above using her attractions but to get back to the matter at hand when you discovered your wife dead and this man donald fleeing down the fire escape did you begin your pursuit of him immediately of course you made no search of the room i told toddy interrupted himself with a startled curse hells bells the guy could have been there for all i know yes he could still have been there when dolores looked in but do not blame yourself too much mr kent you acted quite normally the kitchen door opened and dolores came in with the coffee none thank you alvarado waved aside the cup the girl extended pour mr kents and then bring me my hat after that you may retire i would prefer to remain up dolores said it will be bad for your health to do so very bad you will be amazed at the promptness with which the damage will manifest itself she gave him a sullen baffled glare but she turned and went out alvarado snapped his fingers at the dog i will take perrito with me mr kent you will doubtless be able to rest better if you are alone toddy said thanks and poured more coffee in his cup as man and dog left the house setting the enameled pot back on the serving table he lighted another cigarette he heard the car pull out of the driveway he took a sip of the coffee and let his eyes droop shut actually he supposed there wasnt much use in thinking he couldnt be guided by it except to a very limited degree until elaines murder was cleared up it was strictly the chinless mans show elaine he held the word in his mind turned it over and around stubbornly dully terrified he refused to recognize the emotion which the name conjured hatred relief now that she was dead nonsense he could have got a divorce he could have let her get one as shed wanted to of late he might feel that she was better off dead but that didnt mean and wasnt he doing everything he could to track down her murderer wasnt that proof that proof of how he really felt he was doing everything he could to lay hands on the guy who killed her that was his only reason for stringing along with alvarado of course the latters offer was unusually attractive the kind of thing hed been looking for only one setup could be prettier to find out who the present supplier was hed be loaded stooped down with dough he wasnt supposed to have mr kent dolores was kneeling beside him the silken fullness of her breast pressing against his arm the blue vnecked nightgown cast seductive shadows along the creamy planes of her flesh the coffee you have been doped you must leave here at once toddy was a happy awakener it was the one characteristic which had maddened elaine more than any of his others shaking with a hangover sick at her stomach she would look at him in the morning and profanely demand what the hell there was to grin about so he looked at dolores now smiling not for her but himself and then awareness came to him and with it the chronic suspicion and hardness which life had engendered in him but the smile still lingered deceptively trusting and innocent hows that he asked what do you mean the coffees doped you saw he did not drink of it now you must go why you are in great danger i cannot tell you more than that sure said toddy sure ill go just as soon as you tell me how to dope black coffee ive heard of almost everything but ive never heard of that there ought to be a fortune in it bbut i i her mouth closed helplessly over the words which had seemed so adequate a moment ago he looked like a different man now the mold remained the same but the contents had undergone a fearsomely rapid change the soft crinkles of his smile had assumed the rigid hardness of ice well all right she said coloring i lied about the coffee but his hand closed suddenly over her arm with a movement too swift to analyze she was twirled up and around and smacked down upon his knees you dont mind he said i like to look at people when i talk to them always look at people when you talk to them and you wont have to wear false teeth i let me she tried to fling herself forward and his right foot swung with casual expertness she fell back into the hollow of his knees her feet swept from under her she balanced there foolishly fury slowly surrendering to a growing fear a little bony arent they he nodded you said i was in danger im willing to be convinced what danger it the danger is not from alvarado well then that is all i will say oh now toddy drawled we cant leave it there we just cant do that you havent got a twin sister have you a twin i do not understand uhhuh some girl that looked just like you chased me all over hell tonight hunted me down with a dog the size of a shetland pony i had my legs run off i damned near got killed two or three times and after the dog had caught me and herded me into her car she brought me out here the last place in the world i wanted to go i tried to bribe her i tried to argue with her it was no soap right on down the line and after all that she turns pal on me shes my bosom no offense honey friend im supposed to please if youll give me a chance youve got it i had to bring you here i could not let you escape alvarado would have accepted no excuse why didnt you take it on the lam why dont you now if you really dont like the game alvarados not in any position to make much trouble and neither are you youd be evenstephen he waited eyebrows raised watching the shivering rise and fall of her breast there were tears in her eyes she looked pathetically sweet and helpless and baffled like a child who has had its hands slapped in the act of presenting a gift im still here he said harshly lets have it you she snapped her eyes suddenly tearless you are so full of your own image that you can see nothing else are you blind have you forgotten that i tried to protect you tonight i could have received much more than a blow to make my story conform with yours i uhhuh after it wouldnt do any good after youd already told him another one did you ever get worked over by the cops honey its pretty cute youre in a soundproof room see youre buried where no one can get to you youre not even booked maybe theres not a thing you can do but take it the slaps the hose the kidney kicks and youve had more than you can take hours ago and then the door slams open and a nice fatherly guy comes in and he gives these guys hell they cant do that to you he wont stand for it hes going to get em all fired cute why youll fall on his neck if you havent been through the routine before oh said dolores softly you think that yes you would have to think that you could not be expected to think otherwise bingo gin and blackjack toddy said lets see if we cant agree on something else i had better go there is nothing i can say to you how many times were you in my room tonight how why once and the room was in order yes it was in order and i did not move the body why in the world should i and you can believe that or disbelieve it and and i hate you sit still toddy grabbed her arm and drew her back i havent got much more to say but i want to be sure you hear it my wife was a tramp they dont come any lower but i didnt want her dead i particularly didnt want her dead that way no one deserves to die like that alone gagged and strangled in a sleazy room in a thirdclass hotel if i live long enough ill get my hands on the party that did it when i do surely you cannot think that think it toddy shook his head i dont even think that youre trying to steer me away from my one chance to find the murderer i dont even think that i might find myself in trouble if i picked you up on that steer if i tried to leave i dont think a thing all i know is that hells been popping ever since i came to this house this afternoon and youve been right in the middle of the fireworks i dont think a thing but i dont not think anything either thats the way it is and as long as it is that way heres a tip for you dont toss that pretty little butt toward me again if you do ill kick it for a field goal he put a period to the words with a knee jerk it sent her stumbling to her feet and she wobbled awkwardly for a moment startled furious fighting to regain her balance you she flung over her shoulder and the door banged shut on the word she was none too soon if it wasnt an act for alvarado had returned a car was pulling into the driveway toddy wondered what line you took in a case like this if it was the chinless mans way of testing him there was only one thing to do tell him about it it wouldnt hurt the girl it would hurt him toddy if he didnt if on the other hand she had given him a warning or a threat the chinless man should still be told he and chinless were riding the same boat temporarily what hurt one was very apt to hurt the other so he had every reason to speak of this the girls attempt to make him leave but he couldnt quite make up his mind to do it he still hadnt when a moment later alvarado and the dog came in the dog came directly to toddy and hunkered down in front of him with the air of one nagged by a worrisome problem he gazed studiously into toddys face nrrrah he said nrrrah tee obviously the song both haunted and tantalized him he could neither forget it nor recall the melody toddy grinned despite or perhaps because of his own serious situation it was a relief to encounter something in this house so wholly undevious and understandable he was humming the refrain of the hymn when a curt command from alvarado interrupted lugubriously the dog moved away chinless dropped into a chair rubbing his hands he was feeling very pleased with himself chinless was his sharks grin stretched from ear to ear you have had some rest ah yes i can see you have i see he took an exaggerated sniff of the air that you have not been alone either the girl lost no time in approaching you maybe toddy couldnt smell any perfume and he didnt think alvarado could it wouldnt mean anything anyway since shed been in the room all evening maybe he said casually she could have been in while i was asleep alvarado chuckled i understand it has been years since such matters interested me but i understand well she is an attractive girl you have lost your wife just said toddy just a few hours ago my apologies my remarks were entirely out of order all right said toddy in rejoicing one is apt to become tactless and i have reason to rejoice mr kent we both do the police may not be on your trail yet but they soon will be there is no question about it toddy stared at him incredulously thats supposed to be good is it oh very good it wait please i shall be glad to explain i could not seriously doubt your story tonight not after it had been confirmed by two men who obviously hated you but my believing was not enough my principles would demand more than that so i got more much more than i expected he chuckled gleefully again then hurried on at toddys frown i registered for a room at the hotel in the same wing yours is in it was my intention to persuade the bellboy to let me look into yours perhaps on the pretext that i smelled smoke coming from it i had no way of knowing what i would find if anything but i felt certain that get on with it toddy broke in impatiently you did get in what did you find but i did not get in such was not necessary the door was open and there were men inside detectives beyond a doubt i could only see one of them and i could overhear only a snatch of their conversation but that was sufficient they were looking for your wife patently they had been informed of her disappearance but toddy frowned that means the body is gone yes it is very strange murmured alvarado lowering one eyelid in a wink very very strange who would have a motive for removing the body not the murderer certainly to do so would conflict with his reason for committing the murder so youre forgetting just one thing said toddy i didnt know the body was missing i thought it was still there in my room did you mr kent yes snapped toddy and then he shrugged and lowered his voice let it ride lets have the rest of it good alvarado nodded sagely the point is a delicate one and there is really no point in discussing it what matters is that your wife was killed and i know the identity of her murderer please he held up his hand we can have no great amount of time to act you had best let me explain in my own way when i first missed the watch this afternoon i notified our goldsupplier immediately i did so reluctantly as i have indicated the man is no friend of mine i detest him in fact and the feeling is reciprocated under the circumstances however i had no choice he has many contacts in the gold trade you might try to dispose of the watch such a potentially disastrous attempt had to be stopped at all costs i dont see you will mr kent not only is this man my enemy but he has long been anxious to withdraw from this organization he will not say so of course he is afraid to he knows that when we are willing to dispense with a mans services we also dispense with him permanently as long as our organization was functioning and unless we chose otherwise he would have to remain part of it so this afternoon today he saw his opportunity we presented it to him you and i by killing your wife he would force you into summary action against me to establish your own innocence inevitably the facts of our organization would be brought to light it would be impossible for us to operate if ever for a very long time that is why your wife was killed mr kent so that this man might avenge himself upon me and free himself of an association which has become distasteful to him toddy frowned dubiously i dont know he said slowly it seems to me like he had his own neck out pretty far not in his opinion like many persons who confess to cleverness he is inclined to overlook the fact that others may be shrewd also he felt certain no doubt that i would never see through his plan only you and they know who he is is that right that is correct alvarado smiled sympathetically you have a right to know also and you shall very shortly i must lay the matter before my superiors and wait for their instructions but that is a mere formality the man will pay for his crime there is not the slightest doubt about it how well the chinless man pursed his lips i imagine he will become consciencestricken mr kent remorse will compel him to confess to the murder in writing of course after which he will commit suicide he grinned mirthlessly toddy hesitated i still dont see he said i dont see why your people would go to such trouble to soak the guy my wife meant nothing to them he tried to get you but you were trying to get him too hes never said he wanted to pull out of the racket and i will tell you why alvarado interrupted our work is sponsored by my government it is a poor government financially speaking and an unpopular one a ragged pariah among the commonwealth of nations it must have gold to survive it can get gold in this way lately there have been indications that it might be able to secure loans from this country there is much sentiment against them here but there is some cause for hope can you imagine what would become of that hope if i an agent of this already unpopular power was charged with murder with specifically the murder of a woman and an american citizen yes toddy nodded i can you americans are a peculiar people mr kent you are undisturbed by what amounts to mass murder but let one of you be killed a woman in particular and your entire nation is one voice demanding vengeance that is why this man will be severely and promptly punished for actually jeopardizing the security of my government for his own purposes can you prove that he did i shall be able to within the next twentyfour hours i hope and please do not ask me how i cannot tell you in the meantime id better hide out yes it may not be necessary but we can take no chances we do not know what the police have been told it is dangerously futile to guess tijuana will be safe i have contacts there with a muttered word of apology alvarado took a bus timetable from his pocket and held it up to his eyes he studied it squinting for a moment then fitted a pair of steelrimmed spectacles to his nose and peered at it again abruptly he thrust it toward toddy will you examine this abominable thing the fine print even with glasses i cannot read it toddy repressed a smile the print wasnt particularly fine sure he said what are we looking for i thought it would be best to depart from one of the suburban stations if you will select one i will drive you there i would take you all the way to mexico but to do so i am afraid might endanger both of us toddys finger traced down the columns of print and paused how about long beach that should do i think when does the next southbound bus leave from there two oclock toddy glanced at his wristwatch about an hour from now then we had better be going on the way i will tell you what you must do when you reach tijuana alvarado rose and reached for his hat you have money i believe good come perrito bathed shaved and wearing the freshly pressed clothes and the new shirt the bellboy had brought up toddy sat on the bed of his san diego hotel room and poured out the last of his breakfast pot of coffee the bus had arrived at six oclock it was now almost eight except for elaines death and his own precarious position he would have felt pretty good he actually felt pretty good despite those things he had a sensation of being at peace with himself of being able to relax after a lifetime of tension he was not tired he felt invigorated in fact yet there was a strong desire to sit here and rest just rest and nothing else and he knew that the quicker he got out of this town the better off hed be san diegos unique semitropical climate was not the only thing it was noted for nor its great aircraft plants nor navy and marines bases among the denizens of the world to which toddy belonged it was also known as a swell place to steer clear of its vagrancy laws were the harshest in the country to be without visible means of support a surprisingly elastic category in the hands of local cops and judges was a major crime in the same month here a vagrant an unemployed wanderer and a woman who had murdered her illegitimate baby were given identical prison sentences despite the earliness of the hour a crowd of holidayers was already waiting for the bus to the mexican border toddy hesitated thought for a moment of making the seventeenmile trip in a cab thered been nothing about elaines death in the morning papers apparently there was no alarm out for him still he took his place in the waiting line he couldnt be sure it was best to stick with a crowd he stood up throughout the thirtyminute ride to the border the bus unloaded there on the american side and he made himself one with the mass which crowded through the customs station he had no trouble in crossing the international boundary the busy united states guard barely glanced at him as he asked his nationality and birthplace the mexican customs officers did not bother to do even that much they simply stood aside as he and the others filed past toddy climbed into a mexican taxicab jolted over a long narrow bridge and a minute or two later stepped out on tijuanas main thoroughfare he strolled leisurely down it a wide dirty street bordered by one and twostory buildings which were tenanted mainly by bars restaurants and curio shops it was a bullfight day and the town was unusually crowded americans jammed the narrow sidewalks and swarmed in and out of the business establishments most signs were in english toddy walked to the end of the street to the turn which leads off to the oceanside resort of rosarita then he crossed to the other side and walked slowly back near the center of town he turned off onto a side street and strolled along for a few doors he passed a curio shop lingeringly then paused and went back he entered the shop was stocked to the point of overflowing racks of beadwork leather goods and trinkets jammed the aisles it was almost impossible to squeeze past them once past it would be impossible to be seen from the street a fat mexican woman was seated on a campstool just inside the door she beamed at toddy yess please nice wallet nice bol of perfume for lady what have you got in the way of gold jewelry toddy asked something good and heavy nada such things you could not take across the border so we do not sell how bout nice belt nice silver ring oh i guess not said toddy not interested in anything but gold real gold you look around the woman beamed placing her campstool in front of the door i get nice breath of air you may find something more nice than gold toddy nodded indifferently and squeezed his way back through the racks a few feet and the display suddenly ended and a mexican man sat on a stool against the wall reading a copy of la prensa he wore an openneck sports shirt sharply creased tan trousers and very pointed very shiny black shoes he was no more than five feet tall when he stood up smiling ducking his glossy black head in greeting mr kent please very happy to meet you he opened a door waved toddy ahead of him and closed and locked it again a courteous hand on toddys elbow he guided him down a short areaway and into a small smelly room there was an oilstove cluttered with pots and pans a paintpeeled lopsided icebox a rumpled graylooking bed toddy sat down at an oilclothcovered table smeared and specked with the remains of past repasts his nostrils twitched automatically the ventilation is bad eh the mexican showed gleaming white teeth but how would you the windows must be sealed the disorder is essential think of the comment if one in this country should live in comfort and decency yeah said toddy uncomfortably i see what you mean the mexican moved back toward the icebox it is nice to meet one so understanding he murmured you will have bol of beer yess nice cold bol of beer toddy shook his head he hoped he wouldnt have to be holed up long in this joint i guess not a little early in the day for no said the mexican you will have no beer there was not the slightest change in his humbly ironic voice there was no warning sound or shadow but in that last split second when escape was too late toddy knew what was coming he could feel the gizmos swift change from gold to brass the blow lifted him from his chair he collapsed on the table and the table collapsed under him there was a muted crash as they struck the floor but he did not hear it tubby little milt vonderheim was not dutch but german his right name was max von der veer he was an illegal resident of the united states the only son of a good but impoverished hessian family he had been expelled from school for theft another theft landed him in prison for a year and caused his father to disown him milt learned the watchmaking trade in prison he was by no means interested in it but useful work of some kind was mandatory and it appeared the easiest of the jobs available he was not sufficiently skilled at the time of his release to follow the trade he was not particularly skilled at anything for that matter and after an unsuccessful attempt at burglary which almost resulted in his rearrest he became a waiter in a beerhall he fitted in well there he was lazy and clumsy but this very clumsiness coupled with what seemed to be a beaming unquenchable good humor made him an attraction that waiter max ach snarling his fingers in the stein handles stumbling over the feet he is too fat to see a clown ja you should hear him when he tries to sing since he could do nothing else milt put up with the gibing and jokes he beamed and exaggerated his clumsiness and made a fool of himself generally inwardly however he seethed he had never been goodnatured he was sensitive about his appearance he could have toasted every one of the beerhall customers over a slow fire and enjoyed doing it then one day the leader of a troupe of vaudevillians noticed milt and was impressed by what he saw this awkward youngster could be valuable he was a natural for lowcomedy situations he didnt have to pretend he was a born stooge and butt milt joined the troupe eventually early in he came to america with it that was the end of the goodnatured business that was the end of being the clumsy and lovable little brother of his fellow vaudevillians coldeyed and unsmiling milt let it be known that he despised and hated them all one more innocent joke one more pat on his ridiculously potted belly and there would be trouble the funny business was strictly for the stage from now on milt got away with it for four months during which he extorted three raises in pay by the time he deliberately forced his dismissal he had acquired a sizable sum of money and no small knowledge of the country its language and customs he got himself fired in san francisco five days and five hundred dollars later he had a new name and a number of sworn documents proving his american citizenship his parents these documents revealed had been the proprietors of a san francisco restaurant he had been privately tutored by a dutch schoolmaster parents restaurant schoolmaster and the original records of his birth had been destroyed in the great fire and earthquake milts english was not good but what of that many legal residents of the country talked a poorer brand for that matter many legal residents of the country had no legal way of proving their right to be here except by the very method milt used americans it seemed were not as exacting as germans and milt easily found employment as a watchmaker he pursued it just long enough to discover that his employers streak of larceny while latent was virtually as broad as his own at milts suggestion for which he took half the profits the store owner filed hundreds of suits against merchant seamen for articles allegedly bought from him since the defendants had shipped out and were unaware of the notices of suit brought in obscure legal papers judgment was automatic later he opened his own small sidestreet watchrepair shop until a certain day in he thought he was doomed to remain there barely making a living a foolishly cheerfullooking fat man who could not acquire the wherewithal and was rapidly losing the nerve for the gigantic swindles he dreamed of one of these last was inspired by his own history perhaps there were many persons who had entered and remained in the united states under the same circumstances as his if one had the means to ferret them out ironically he was pondering this very scheme on that day in when looking up from his workbench he discovered that others had thought of it also thought of it and acted upon it being milt he was not naturally at all discomfited by the discovery his words and his expression were actually contemptuous do not tell me please he narrowed his eyes in mock thoughtfulness ah yes i remember now madrid was it not alvarado and his animales there was considerable debate i remember as to which was which and you i recall you well also said the chinless man a human swine there would have been a novelty unfortunately my pobres perros rebelled at the thought but enough listen to me carefully herr von der veer and do not interrupt he spoke rapidly for ten minutes ending with a sharpsoft well that was a statement rather than a question milt took a drink from a brandy bottle before replying let me see if i understand he said you have aligned your cause unofficially with that of the reich where my father is now resident and unless i accommodate you in this matter certain unpleasant things will happen to him he might possibly find himself in prison that is right regrettably yes fine said milt beat him well while he is there starve him also if you can he has such a great fat stomach i doubt that it is possible milt smiled pleasantly the chinless man blanched monster he stammered then recovered himself but there is something else herr max you are in this country illegally a word to any number of people said milt truthfully will swear that i was born here but why do we dispute senor alvarado that sofoolish man who leads your equally preposterous government silence may be moved by motives of idealism you may be also i am not so stupid i want money if you want this thing done you will pay for it it is as simple as that and no simpler thus milt who like everyone else in the jewelry trade had begun dabbling in gold when the price went to thirtyfive dollars an ounce thus funnylooking little milt became a largescale buyer for the nazi government his first move was to build up a group of housetohouse buyers who worked out of his shop their purchases less perhaps an undetectable third went directly and regularly to the mint where he built up and still had a reputation as a man above suspicion his next move was to rent numerous postoffice boxes under different names small boxes such as individuals rent under those names he inserted small newspaper ads in as many different sections of the country there are thousands of such advertisers little men often with little knowledge of a highly exacting business because they are little they feel obliged to place money ahead of good will they grade and weigh close the doubts which always arise are decided in their own favor because they lack the necessary training and wit and despite their petty and pitiful efforts to do the opposite they make disastrous buys it is then obligatory or so they feel to be still sharper to make up for their losses the end result of all this is that the little men acquire a bad or at best uneven reputation they buy less and less gold usually in a few months or a few years they are out of business it would be a physical impossibility to check on all these small mail buyers and the federal authorities see no need to do so before gold can be diverted into the black market it must first be acquired and the little men just dont buy it not a fraction of the quantity needed to pay them for the risk that is of course none of them bought it but milts little men gold poured in on the little men they bought pounds of it every day milt had expected to get out of the gold traffic when the nazis had become unable to buy but the chinless man gave no sign of ceasing operations and milt was far too wise to express a desire to quit angrily he realized that in effect he was jeopardizing his liberty and perhaps his life for nothing he could never spend his wealth in the united states he would never be allowed to leave the united states to spend it he was getting old unless he withdrew from the ring soon it would be too late the things money bought would have become meaningless mixed with his anger was a kind of apathy a dread dead feeling that whatever he did mattered little even if he could get away well what then how would a man of his age occupy himself in a strange new country alone completely alone with no one to care whether he lived or died he had been unable to deposit his money in a bank and afraid to place it in a safe deposit box such might attract attention and what if he should have to leave town in a hurry so unobtrusively he had had a small but excellent safe sunk into the floor beneath his workbench it could be cracked of course as the best of safes can be but what knobknocker or juice worker or torch artist would suspect that milt had anything worth getting none did the idea was laughable milt used to laugh smile a little sadly to himself as late at night sometimes he examined the stacks upon stacks of largedenomination bills so much money for what so he had gone on reasonlessly because there was nothing else to do and fate in time had brought toddy and elaine kent to him elaine there was someone like himself a woman who thought as he did with someone like her with her and the money life would at last be what it should and why not have her it was only a question of ridding her of her fool husband and if she kept on drinking making trouble and if that was not enough if toddy would not leave her or permit her to leave night after night milt had brooded over the matter cursing thinking in circles guzzling quart after quart of beer and finally toddy had stumbled upon the house of the talking dog and from then on thinking almost ceased to be necessary every piece of the puzzle had fallen into place at the touch of milts stubby fingers true there had been one slight hitch a hairraising moment when all seemed lost but that was past now nothing remained but the payoff there was no longer danger or very little things had not worked out quite as he had planned but still they had worked out the phone rang milt answered it casually then grinned with malicious pleasure yes i did that senor something you should have done yourself why because he was dangerous a menace to us at least that was my honest opinion i have not acted out of venom as our superiors will most certainly feel that you have eh oh you are mistaken mein herr you have but to consult your morning paper the news the others did not see fit to carry the item and if that is not enough for you if you demand stronger proof milts voice dropped to a wicked caress pay me a visit a chilling icy weight enveloped toddys head he tried to move away from it but couldnt it kept moving with him from far away in a dim fogmuted world came the sound of voices a man and a woman talking or a woman and two men the voices came closer some of them then lapsed into silence something squeezed his left wrist released it and regrasped his right arm the arm moved upward and a probe dug painfully at the flesh then fire flooded his veins and his heart gave a great bound and toddy bounded with it eyes closed he bounded staggered to his feet and the icy weight clattered from his head then he was pressed back prone on the bed and he opened his eyes a dark neatly dressed man was staring down at him thoughtfully slapping a hypodermic needle against the palm of his hand also gazing down at him her dark eyes anxious was the girl dolores its all right toddy she gave him a tremulous smile toddy stared at her unwinking remembrance returning then swung his eyes toward the man with the needle you a doctor yes senor whats going on here what happened i have given you an injection of nicotinic acid to strengthen the heart lie still for another half hour and keep in place the ice pack you will be all right i asked you what happened the doctor smiled faintly shrugged and spoke rapidly in spanish to dolores toddys eyes drooped shut for a moment and when he reopened them he was alone with dolores well he said well you should not talk toddy she sat down on a chair at the bedside and laid a hand on his forehead there is little i can explain and toddy rolled his head from beneath her hand that guy tried to kill me to knock you unconscious you were to be disposed of later at night why i cannot tell you there is much i do not understand you know all right why did alvarado want me killed alvarado did not want you killed no then why if he had said the girl you would be dead toddy frowned then grunted as a stab of pain shot through his head yeah he said but try not to think for a few minutes rest and i will make you some coffee and then if you feel able we can leave leave rest said dolores firmly toddy rested more willingly than he pretended to it was almost reluctantly that some fifteen or twenty minutes later he sat up to accept the coffee dolores prepared she gave him a lighted cigarette and he puffed and drank alternately his head still throbbed with pain but he felt alert again so he said setting down the cup alvarado doesnt want me dead obviously not he knew this was going to happen i think i think he must have what did he stand to gain by it i cannot say i mean i dont know no no snapped the girl but her voice immediately became soft again believe me toddy i dont know but you will soon find out alvarado himself will tell you alvarado will toddy started what do you mean that is why i am here to take you to him he is in san diego toddy fumbled for and found his cigarettes he lighted one staring at dolores over the flame of the match he didnt know whether to laugh or bop her how stupid he wondered did they think he was whats alvarado doing in san diego again i do not know but after this pasting i got im still supposed to see him so i told you what if i refuse to go with you what happens then what happens the girl shrugged tiredly nothing happens you are free to go your own way you may leave here now if you feel able toddy shook his head incredulously you say that like you mean it i do you will not be harmed of course she added your situation will not be exactly pleasant you have little money you are a fugitive you are in a foreign country but im alive there is no use said dolores in arguing i was not ordered to persuade you only to ask you she stood up walked to the battered dresser and picked up a flowered scarf draping it over her black hair she knotted it under her chin and took a step toward the areaway goodbye toddy kent now wait a minute yes i didnt say i wouldnt go said toddy i just oh hell he wobbled a little as he lurched to his feet and she moved swiftly to him he caught her by the shoulders his hands sinking into the soft flesh with unconscious firmness look he hesitated give me the lowdown what had i better do i am here to take you to alvarado but should i suppose i said no that you should remain in mexico are you telling me that suppose i did so advise you dolores continued looking at him steadily and you decided to do the opposite and repeated my advice to alvarado why would i do that you have no reason to trust me in fact you have made it very plain that you do not trust me why shouldnt you tell alvarado particularly if it appeared that by doing so you would help yourself toddy reddened uncomfortably and released his grip the girl stepped away from him i guess he said i cant blame you for thinking that no but youre wrong if id wanted to get you in trouble i could have told alvarado about well my warning to you last night perhaps you did after you left the house toddy gave up she was dead right about one thing he didnt trust her even though something had impelled him to for a minute perhaps she didnt know what alvarado wanted or perhaps she did hed never take her word for it regardless of the situation whatever she advised him to do hed be inclined to do the opposite wheres my coat he said shortly lets get out of here you are going with me i dont know maybe a drink will help me to make up my mind they went out the same way toddy had come in squeezing past the crowded racks of trinkets and curios the little man who had slugged toddy was nowhere in view the fat woman was still seated near the doorway on her campstool nice bol of perfume for lady she beamed nice wallet for genleman toddy started to scowl but something about her expression of bland goodnatured innocence made his lips tug upward he gave her a cynical wink and followed dolores out the door it seemed like days had passed since he had arrived in tijuana that morning but the clock in the bar indicated the hour as five minutes of two seated in a rear booth toddy drank a double tequila sunrise and ordered another he took a sip of it and looked across the table at the girl well he said ive made up my mind i see im not going with you ill lay low here for a few days then ill beat it back across the border and toddy broke off abruptly and again raised his glass over its rim he saw the faint gleam of amusement in dolores eyes on second thought she said you will head south into mexico that is right maybe said toddy maybe not i understand it is best to keep your plans to yourself now i must be going she slid toward the edge of the booth hesitated as though on the point of saying something then stood up toddy got up awkwardly also on an impulse as her lips framed a mechanical goodbye he held out his hand im sorry about last night he said i dont know where you fit into this deal but i think youre playing it as square as you can thank you she did not touch his hand and i think you also are as as square as you can be now i would like to tell you something something for your own good im waiting wash your face it is dirty she was gone then her body very erect her high heels clicking uncompromisingly across the wooden floor toddy stared after her until he saw the bartender watching him then he shook his head vaguely ran a hand over his jaw and headed for the mens restroom it was at the rear end of the room a partitionedoff enclosure inadequately ventilated by a small high window opening on the alley a typical tijuana bar gents room there was a long yellowish urinal and two cabinet toilets flushed by oldfashioned water chambers placed near the ceiling adjacent to the two chippedenamel sinks was a wooden table supporting a sparse assortment of toilet articles and an elaborate display of pornographic booklets postal cards prophylactics and rubber goods yessir mister the young mexican attendant came briskly to attention you in right place mister we got just what you what i want said toddy is some soap and he helped himself from the table he turned on both water taps scrubbed his hands then lathered them again and scoured vigorously at his face he rinsed off the soap and doused his head eyes squinted he turned away from the sink and accepted the towel that was thrust into his hands thanks pal he dried his face and opened his eyes dont mention it burbied shake and keep your hands out o your pockets gritted donald toddy did not need the last bit of advice one swift glance at the hideously scratched mugs of the pair told him they would kill him on the slightest pretext kill him and worry about the outcome later fury had made them brave shake was holding a blackjack upswung ready to strike donald had the mexican attendant backed against the wall the point of his knife pressing against his throat the door of the restroom was barred just dont try nothin murmured shake jus dont try nothin at all you get past us which you aint goin to do i got two of my pachucos outside someonell be coming back here toddys voice sounded strange in his ears you cant keep that door barred i cn keep it barred long enough turn around you tailed me down here what does it look like turn around the blackjack came down sickeningly on toddys shoulder he turned shake slapped his pockets expertly located his wallet and extricated it with a satisfied grunt there was a moments silence another grunt and another command to turn around toddy turned what you doin here shake demanded whats the deal deal donald ripped out a curse let him have it shake we cant wait here all day no ones tryin to bust in shake pointed out his eyes fixed on toddy i asked you what the deal was toddy licked his lips wordlessly helplessly the blackjack began to descend wait it was the mexican attendant i will tell you senores his teeth gleamed at toddy in a warm placating smile a grin of apology i am sorry senor but it is best to tell them these gentlemen mean business donald nodded venomously you aint just woofin hombre spill it but you must know gentlemen what else would it be but but but what white stuff said toddy taking the mexican off the limb as my friend says what else could it be donald sneered shake gave toddy a look of mock sanctimoniousness i might of knowed it he said a man thatll murder his own sweet little wife an play mean tricks on people that trust him wont stop at nothin dope tsk tsk you smugglin it across the border not at all said toddy i use it to powder my nose he fell back from the blow of the blackjack and shake advanced on him okay he wheezed be smart be good an smart its gonna cost you enough where you got the stuff hid i toddys eyes flicked around the room settled momentarily on one of the elevated water chambers and moved back to shake ive got it cached out in the country a few miles the hell you have donald began but shake interrupted him you give yourself away toddy youre losin your grip get up there an get it up where you better move okay sighed toddy you win with shake at his heels he stepped into the first of the toilet enclosures and gripped the top of its two partitions he gave a jump swung himself upward and got a knee over one of the partitions grasping the pipe which ran from the flush chamber to the toilet he pulled himself up until he stood straddling the enclosure donald issued a curt command and the mexican hastened to lie down in the adjacent booth then the little shiv artist crowded in next to shake holding his knife by the blade dont try nothing he warned i cant reach you but the knife can yeah said toddy i know he gripped the ends of the heavy porcelain lid of the water chamber grunting he moved it free and edged backward have to help me with this he panted its now wait a wheezed shake and donalds knife flashed with the swift action of his hand but he was too late they couldnt stop what toddy had started they couldnt get out of the way heavy said toddy and he hurled the heavy lid downward with all his might it caught shake full in his fat upturned face one end swinging sickeningly against the bridge of donalds nose they sprawled backwards out of the enclosure and toddy scrambled down hastily from his perch he need not have hurried the mexican attendant apparently had exactly anticipated his actions now he was on his feet administering one of the most thorough expert yet dispassionate kickings that toddy had ever seen it was a demonstration that would have been envied even by shakes pachucos not a kick was wasted each of the two men received two kicks in the guts by way of obtaining temporary silence each received a kick in the temple by way of making the silence more or less permanent each received three kicks in the face as a lasting memento of the kicking bien said the mexican smiling pleasantly at toddy i think that is enough eh then he bent over the motionless thugs stuffed their wallets and toddys inside his shirt and picked up the knife and blackjack i have been put to much trouble he beamed you do not mind the small present that money said toddy is all i have so you want it very much senor i guess not said toddy not that much how do i get out of here the table senor drag it over to the window you will excuse me if i do not help it is an easy drop to the alley toddy nodded dragged the table to the window and stepped up on it deliberately destroying as much of the display as he could it is all right senor the mexican laughed softly everything is paid for yeah toddy grinned unwillingly what happens to these characters and their pachucos people come back here the mexican explained but no one go out so soon very soon my father will be alarmed your father the bartender senor he will summon my brother the waiter who will call my two cousins officers of the police never mind toddy hoisted himself into the window i know the rest your uncle the judge will give them ninety days in jail right but no senor the mexicans voice trailed after toddy as he dropped into the alley he will give them at least six months toddy plodded down the alley to the street lighted the last of his cigarettes and threw the package away he thrust a hand into his pocket drew it out with his sole remaining funds sixteen cents three nickels and a penny not enough to a hand closed gently but firmly over his elbow a blueuniformed cop looked down at the coins and up into his face you are broke senor a vagrant certainly not toddy made his voice icy im a san diego businessman just down here for a little holiday i think not senor businessmen do not take leak in alley but i didnt toddy caught himself for vagrancy or leak said the cop the fine is ten dollars you may pay me i just give me your name and address said toddy ill have to send it to you lets go said the cop brusquely in the manner of cops the world over toddy started to protest the officer immediately released his grip unholstered a sixshooter and leveled it at toddys stomach we do not like vagrants here senor even as you do not like them in your country a ver long time ago i visit your country i am a wetback yes but no one care the lettuce must be harvest and i work very cheap then i complain i do not get my wages an i am sick from the food cagada dung and everyone care ver much i am illegal immigrant i am vagrant i go to jail for long time it is good word vagrant i learn it in your country now move anda the gun pointing at his back toddy preceded the cop down the side street across the main thoroughfare and so on down another side street tourists and sightseers stared after him curiously haughtily grinning mexican shopkeepers gazed languidly from their doorways the dark eyes venomous or amused at the plight of the gringo toddy walked on and on his jaw set his eyes fixed on the walk immediately in front of him he knew something of mexican jails by reliable hearsay when you got in down here brother you were in the length of sentence didnt mean a thing they took weeks and months sometimes a year to get around to sentencing you they just locked you up and left you and and shake and donald toddys step faltered and the cops gun prodded him there wasnt a chance that he could persuade the two thugs to play quiet theyd squeal their heads off about elaines death and the supposed dope racket and somewhere a horn was honking insistently then a car door slammed and dolores called un momento the cop grunted a command to halt and swept off his cap si senorita he said a servicio de he didnt get a chance to finish the sentence or any of the several others he started after three minutes of dolores rapid spanish he was reduced to complete silence answering her torrent of reprimand only with feeble shrugs and apologetic gestures at last she snapped open her purse and uttered a contemptuous cuanto how much the cop hesitated then drew himself erect por nada he said and walked swiftly away toddy said whew and then thanks the girl nodded indifferently i must go now you are going with me toddy said he was shake and his boys were trailing me i i know i saw them enter the bar that is why i waited it didnt occur to you said toddy to do anything besides wait to call the police for example or to intervene personally youre right said toddy lets go as they neared the international border dolores took a pair of sunglasses and a checkered motoring cap from the glove compartment and handed them to him toddy put them on glanced swiftly at himself in the rearview mirror the disguise was a good one for a quick change even if his mug was out on a pickup circular he should be able to get past the border guards he did get past them after a harrowing five minutes in which the car was given a perfunctory but thorough examination he had to get out and unlock the trunk compartment on the spur of the moment since he had neglected to do so sooner he had to invent a spurious name birthplace and occupation he was sweating when the car swung out of the inspection station and onto the road to san diego as they sped past san ysidro he removed the cap and glasses mopped at his face and forehead i am sorry said dolores so softly that he almost failed to hear her she was looking straight ahead her eyes intent on the road sorry said toddy vaguely you are right to be angry with me to be suspicious what else could you be except for me you would not have been involved in this affair well toddy thought shed called the turn there but what he said mildly was forget it i was asking for it a guy like me wouldnt feel right if he wasnt in trouble wouldnt he toddy looked at her looked quickly away again she couldnt mean what she seemed to not with elaine murdered and himself the principal suspect that and everything else that was hanging over him of course she wouldnt be any angel herself but but he couldnt think the thing through it was a hell of a poor time to try to i dont know he said shortly probably not i see her voice was flat i toddy hesitated maybe it would depend on a lot of things the house was in the mission hills section of san diego located on a pieshaped wedge of land overlooking the bay on one side a street dropped down to old town on the other side another road wound downward toward pacific highway in the front a multiple intersection separated the house from its nearest neighbor by a block there were no houses in the rear of course only a steep bluff toddy sat in the front room a room as sparsely furnished as the one in chinless los angeles dwelling he had been sitting there alone for some fifteen minutes as soon as he and the girl had arrived alvarado had spoken rapidly to her in spanish too rapidly for toddys casual understanding of the language and she had gone down the hallway toward the rear of the house alvarado had followed her after politely excusing himself and closed the door and dimly a moment later toddy had heard another door close since then there had been silence almost it seemed to toddy once that he heard a faint outcry a moment later he had thought he heard the dog bark thought he wasnt sure he strained his ears held his breath listening but the sounds were not repeated toddy waited with increasing uneasiness in the far corner of the room was a desk littered with papers when he and dolores had arrived alvarado had been working there and something about the sight had given toddy an inexplicable feeling of danger he wanted to get a better look at those papers he wondered whether he dared risk the few steps across the room and a quick glance or two he decided to try it rising cautiously an eye on the hall door he tiptoed across the floor and looked swiftly down at the desk the papers were covered with rows of neatly written figures interspersed occasionally with what appeared to be abbreviations of certain words they were meaningless meaningless mr kent said alvarado unless you have the code book he came in smiling closing the door behind him and crossed to the desk he picked up a small black book that had been lying face down and riffled its pages of fine closely printed type this is it regrettably it is much too complex to explain in the brief time we have better skip it then said toddy matching the others irony and as he resumed his seat on the other side of the room alvarado chuckled amiably a man after my own heart he declared sitting back down at the desk i cannot tell you how disappointed i am that we shall not work together for the time being at least no toddy crossed his legs the air was heavy with perfume alvarado apparently had doused himself with it no unfortunately but we will come to that in a moment i have had you visit me so that i might explain explain everything that may be explained you are entitled to know and as i say i hope we may work together eventually i did not wish you to be left with an unfavorable opinion of me go on said toddy after i dispatched you to tijuana i communicated the fact to our supplier of gold the man i suspected of killing your wife he reacting as i believed he would ordered you murdered to be slugged and disposed of permanently as soon as it was expedient as soon as the first half of the order was carried out i intervened i had the proof i wanted proof toddy frowned i dont get it but it is so simple he killed your wife i was certain merely as a means of disposing of you he hoped to involve you and through you me in a crime which would break up our syndicate and release him from duties which have long been onerous to him now you understand no said toddy i dont but it is huhuh toddy shook his head up to a point ill buy it he killed elaine i thought youd done it if i played the cards he gave me id have either gone after you myself or hollered to the cops but i didnt do that you and i squared our beef he didnt have a thing to gain by getting rid of me in tijuana hmmm alvarado drummed absently on the desk i see your point it was stupid of me not to think of it of course he added smoothly i was not completely sure of this mans motive there was a strong possibility that he might have been motivated by revenge remember me said toddy im supposed to be the bright boy so stop kidding me this guy tried to get me killed ill go along with that and when he did he proved that hed killed my wife why ill tell you because he was sure that given a little time id be able to dope out who he was you were sure i would too and until you got your orders from abroad you had to protect his identity you had to pin the rap on him good before i did too much thinking really mr kent thats the way it was thats the way it has to be now why beat around the bush about it alvarado stared at him thoughtfully a quizzical frown on his pale sharks face then gradually the frown disappeared and he nodded very well mr kent i suppose there really is no longer need for secrecy the man you mention has served us well in the opinion of my superiors he is now closing out his affairs and will soon be out of this country possibly probably we will find use for him elsewhere but that is no concern of yours lone before you can discover his identity and confirm it he will be beyond your reach amazement choked toddy for a moment he could hardly credit himself with hearing the words that alvarado had spoken before he could find his voice the chinless man was speaking again i can well understand your confusion mr kent i share it but there is nothing i can do about it our entire hypothesis was wrong this man we suspected did not kill your wife youre lying toddy snapped murder or no murder this guy is valuable to your bosses theyre going to protect him at all costs thats the whole story isnt it it is not my bosses as you call them do not act so whimsically the man was able to prove irrefutably that he did not kill your wife as an unfortunate result our superiors retain their original high regard for him while i for the moment at least have been made to appear a clumsy and vindictive fool youre forgetting your lines toddy said grimly a minute ago you were saying that i was speaking in theoretical terms like you i was speeding down a trail of theory and i am at a loss when the trail disappears my getting slugged wasnt any theory be grateful you were not killed and dwell no more on the matter nothing good will come of it hands shaking toddy lighted a cigarette after an angry puff or two he ground it out beneath his foot alvarado nodded sympathetically you are annoyed i am withholding information which you feel is vital to you does it occur to you that i might easily be annoyed with you for much the same reason im not holding back anything knowingly no and i am not doing so willingly i dont said toddy get you you yourself had the best opportunity to kill your wife you had ample motive also you are not the type to kill with premeditation but i can readily imagine your doing so in a moment of temporary insanity and since such a crime is inconsistent with your nature your conscious mind would refuse to admit it all this is conjecture of course i know nothing i want to know nothing toddy laughed shortly tell me why i was slugged maybe ill sign a confession then you invite the obvious retort mr kent tell me how you disposed of your wifes body and i will tell you why you were slugged toddy stared at him helplessly you dont believe that he said you know i didnt kill her maybe this guy the supplier didnt do it either but he didnt then whats it all about what are you trying to steer me away from alvarado shook his head turning back to his desk he opened the code book so that is the way it is he murmured you will excuse me if i work while we talk toddy started to speak his hand started to knife out in a gesture of angry exasperation the gesture was unfinished he remained silent staring trying not to stare that code book was in unusually fine print and yet chinless was studying it without difficulty and without his glasses he couldnt be shouldnt be but he was what the hell could it mean why had he claimed that his eyes were bad right from the moment of their first meeting why had he pretended that he couldnt read milts card what reason was there now said alvarado let us leave theory to the theorists and take up practical matters as i indicated we are ceasing activities in this country indefinitely but we hope to resume them when that time comes we can find a profitable place for you suppose i dont want it that is up to you we have no fear of your talking all right said toddy im listening there is a pullman train leaving here tonight what you call a through train i have reserved you a stateroom it will not be necessary for you to leave that stateroom until you arrive in new york you will be given a thousand dollars in addition to your passage that should maintain you in some degree of comfort until i get in touch with you how will you do that a detail we will work it out before you leave does the idea generally please you it doesnt look like i have much choice said toddy i want to know why youre jumping the country though im hot enough without getting any hotter you will not be i at this point am the sole recipient of the heat the informer in our midst has chosen to make no mention of you to the authorities informer who is he that need not concern you alvarado turned a page of the code book and ran a pencil down the column of symbols this informer is one of our unwilling operatives we were able to obtain his alvarado slurred the pronoun cooperation through a brother a political prisoner in one of my countrys excellent labor camps it was necessary for the brother to die our confederate discovered the fact through a relative he made the very serious mistake of confronting me and charging bad faith toddy nodded absently he was staring at the code book at alvarado something warned him to look away but he couldnt i see he said you knew hed turn stool pigeon he already had grimaced alvarado though i was unaware of it until yesterday i had assumed that his tirade against me was immediately subsequent to the news of his brothers death then through a slip of the tongue he revealed that he had known of it for a month he had known of it but said nothing continued the regular course of his affairs until his sense of outrage overcame his discretion obviously he had done so for only one reason you followed me mr kent toddy didnt speak alvarado looked up from the desk i am boring you perhaps what toddy started the answer had come to him at last at the very moment of alvarados question a beautifully simple yet almost incredible answer i dont quite get it he said with forced casualness this guy has squealed why havent the feds moved in on you because they hope to trap the man who supplies our gold he is to meet me here or so i advised our informer tomorrow night the efficient tmen will not come near the place nor do anything else to arouse my suspicions until then toddy nodded absently his mind still working on the riddle of alvarados bad eyesight lets see he thought lets take it from the beginning i gave him that frammis about a friend sending me to him and then i gave him the card he let me into the house then well i didnt have much to say for a minute or two and he began to freeze up a little asked me my business said he couldnt read the card he must have but toddy started slightly why of course chinless had thought hed been sent there to the house when he discovered the truth that their meeting was sheer accident he had pretended that the chinless man looked down at the code book he looked up quickly and his gaze met and held toddys a frown of regret spread over his dead white face well said toddy it is not well said alvarado and his hand dipped into his pocket and came out with the automatic you have an expressive face like our informer dolores it tells too much toddy forced an irritated laugh what the hells the matter with you anyway what have i done now it is not so much what you have done it is what you surely would do now that you know i am sorry i personally am sorry you cannot do it but i have my orders the man must be protected i still dont know please alvarado gestured fretfully you know and i know you know in a little while a few weeks it would not have mattered the man would have vanished you i believe would have grown more philosophical about the matter now about murder toddy dropped his mask of bewilderment why would i stand still for a murder that this guy committed he did not commit one at least he did not kill your wife but all right said toddy he didnt i did is that good enough not nearly mr kent you are certain that he did kill her you would act accordingly there would be much talk many secrets would be aired it would not do youre forgetting something said toddy im in no position to make trouble for anyone you mean alvarado corrected you are in no position to make trouble for yourself and i am sure you would not you and i both know that the position of this man is a precarious one he is as we noted in an earlier conversation a sitting duck you would pick him off mr kent even though you did not believe he was the murderer of your wife toddys eyes fell and his shoulders drooped he leaned forward a little disconsolately his wrists resting on his knees do not try it mr kent you wont shoot said toddy someone might hear it someone might alvarado nodded but i will shoot if necessary i want to ask a question quickly then and lean back i know this man didnt kill elaine he was with me at the time but he had her killed didnt he he did not it was the last thing he would have wanted put it this way he knew the watch was in our room he sent someone to get it elaine put up a fight and the guy killed her alvarado shook his head this man with more money than he can spend would go to such lengths for a watch and that is two questions you have asked all right then toddy persisted shed found out something about him she tried to work some blackmail and she did not interrupted alvarado let me repeat he did not want your wife dead and now stand up all right toddy got carefully to his feet what about giving the departing guest a drink of course alvarado did not hesitate for so much as an instant the cellarette is there and the carafe is heavy it would be futile to attempt to throw it i dont intend to said toddy honestly and instead of the large drink which you doubtless desire take two very small ones not enough to be explicit to have any effect if thrown toddy sidled along the lounge to the corner cellarette his eyes watchful apprehensive he turned his back on the chinless man and picked up the carafe toddy tipped the carafe and slopped a fraction of an ounce of brandy into a highball glass he raised it holding his breath but chinless apparently was also holding his either that or he hadnt moved he was still standing by the desk toddy lowered the glass his thumb pressing with restrained firmness toward the lip it gave against the pressure a little more and it would break but would it break as it had to and when it had to there wouldnt be time to turn the blow would have to be on its way down if it wasnt alvarado would shoot hed have to and he would toddy set the glass down again rattling the carafe against it as he poured his second drink he heard it then an almost imperceptible squeak of the floor all but masked by the sound of the glassware he lifted the glass pressing steadily harder suddenly there was no resistance to his thumb and he heard the swift uprush of air and he thrust the broken glass up and back dropping into a crouch in the same split second the glass exploded in his hand his whole arm went numb there was a wild curse of pain and the clatter of metal against wood he whirled awkward in his crouch and threw himself at the gun alvarado kicked him solidly in the solar plexus he sprawled paralyzed and alvarado kicked him again he lay fighting for breath every nerve screaming with shock alvarado picked up the gun cursing frightfully as it slipped in his grasp he shifted it to his left hand he advanced on toddy his right hand scarlet dripping with blood it is bad eh mr kent but do not worry about it i will bind it up in a minute a very few minutes actually i am grateful for what you did what was a painful duty now becomes a pleasure he grasped toddys ankle with the lacerated hand grimaced painfully and dragged him toward the hall door do not resist me mr kent make no overt move if it should mean my instant death i would not hesitate toddy didnt try anything he couldnt it was still a desperate struggle to get his breath now alvarado opened the door tugged him through it panting and kicked it shut again now alvarado regrasped his ankle backed and dragged him down the hallway his eyes glinted insanely he was incoherent with fury now you will see mr kent you will be one of the dogs pobre perritos twin yes the one the obliging gentleman from the crematory did not see dolores was to have served but it will be all right the added weight is excusable it is the practice the gentleman tells me to enclose the pets belongings the bed the eating and drinking receptacles so many things and such big dogs he opened a second door tugged furiously and slammed it shut and toddy knew at last the reason for the chinless mans perfume the air was heavy with the odor of chloroform the room with its tightly closed windows swam with its sickeningsweet stench alvarado released his ankle and toddy tried to sit up he fell back groaning and his head banged against the wall he lay there not quite prone staring dully at the two long pine boxes on the floor alvarado chuckled he had wiped his sweating face and now it and his hand were both scarlet he was smeared with blood his face was a hideous bloodsmeared mask the mask crinkled in a mirthless grin and he picked up a hammer from one of the boxes he hefted it in his hand gazing steadily at toddy inching a little toward him and then he burst into another laugh do not worry mr kent there is nothing to worry about yet i would first have you observe something he inserted the claw of the hammer between one of the boxes and its lid he pried downward moved the hammer reinserted the claw and pried again you do not understand eh he panted so much effort so much more thanks to you why not simply since i am leaving leave the bodies here it is this way he wiped smeared his face again there is always the chance of some flaw in planning the possibility of apprehension and murder is regarded much more seriously than smuggling but even without that without error or misfortune there would be great unpleasantness your squeamish countrymen would be outraged your newspapers vocal in the end my government might be faced with demands for my person he laid down the hammer and tugged at the lid with his hand wincing he looked carefully at toddy he nodded satisfied with what he saw and dropped the gun into his pocket he grasped the lid with both hands pulled and swung it open on its hinges now he said and started to stoop no he shook his head she must lie on the bottom otherwise picking up the hammer he turned to the other box and began unsealing its lid the gun remained in his pocket but the fact meant nothing to toddy he was breathing more easily but he still felt paralyzed evidence alvarado was murmuring but there will be none not a particle only ashes scattered to the winds strong suspicions yes but no evidence nothing to act upon the lid swung free alvarado lifted out the girl held her for a moment then shrugged and tossed her to the bed still alive like the dog doubtless it does not matter i will prepare another sponge and it has several hours to work he started to turn then catching toddys eye he nodded solemnly you are right of course they weigh little but the weight already is overmuch they will have to come off he jerked off her shoes and dropped them to the floor then the stockings he grasped the dress at its throat and ripped it off with one furious tug the brassiere then and then he glanced down critically at the nude undulant figure and grinned spitefully at toddy tempting he said you are incapacitated unfortunately but there is no reason why i you could enjoy that mr kent you would derive pleasure from mine yyou toddy rasped bastard i shall kick you some more alvarado promised as for dolores she shall lie with the dog poor perrito he deserved it eh mr kent it is small recompense for the death which expedience forces me to inflict if he were smaller if he could not talk i might have going down on his knees he looked regretfully at the dog he got an arm under it stroked the head absently with his bleeding hand pobre perrito he murmured i am sorry a shudder ran through the dogs body his tongue lolled out touched alvarados hand it moved against the hand licking cruel murmured alvarado you are nearly dead and i let you revive i let in the air i kill you twice he got up abruptly brushing at his eyes and turned to the bed he lifted the girl and lowered her roughly into the box from which he had taken her now he said bending over the dog again it will soon be over this time he put both arms under the great black body and grunting stood erect with it the animals eyes slitted open the huge jaws gaped lazily alvarado bent his head his scarlet face the dogs jaws snapped shut on it the blood scent like a dream a nightmare a scene at the los angeles house came back to toddy shake and donald their faces spouting blood and alvarado holding the lunging dog alvarado was bent over staggering his fists flailed against the dog and his muffled smothered shrieks emerged as a horrible humming hmmmm mmmmmm mmmmmm toddy yelled he got to his hands and knees and lurched forward tried to grasp the dog by a leg how this had come about didnt matter now he only knew that it had to be stopped there was a roar in the room and toddy dropped to his stomach alvarado had got out his gun but he couldnt aim it he was pivoting in a slow paincrazed waltz doubled over the automatic sweeping the walls and the dog waltzed with him eyes closed jaws clamped its hind claws rattling and scratching against the floor suddenly alvarados right arm shot straight out from his body the dog moved they moved together and the gun swerved it steadied pointing at the girl toddy could never say how he did it he could never recall doing it but somehow he was on his feet his hands gripping a bony scarlet wrist he threw his weight forward and there was a long staccato roar that and the shattering of glass as the windowpane behind a drawn curtain was blown into bits then somewhere in the not too distant distance a motor raced and an automobile horn tooted angrily toddy staggered backward and sat down on the bed alvarado and the dog lay on the floor motionless one paw rested against alvarados shoulder and alvarados left hand lay on the dogs black hide the dog had released his hold at last what the jaws had clung to was no longer there toddy bent forward suddenly and retched his dizziness disappeared and he could think again hed have to get out of here he gripped the edge of the bedstead and pulled himself upright those shots had made a hell of a racket it sounded like they might have grazed a car it might take the cops a little while to discover their source but when they did well they wouldnt find him here alvarado had dough on him plenty of it and the keys to the convertible were in the switch by the time the cops got a line on him hed be through tijuana heading for one of the fishing villages below rosarita beach from there for a price he could get passage to central america of course hed be on the run for the rest of his life hed always have elaines murder hanging over him that couldnt be helped when you couldnt fight you had to run he got up eyes averted he was bending over alvarados body starting to search for the money that must be there when something made him pause he straightened shrugged irritatedly and stooped again he stood up again cursing he picked up the girl and laid her on the bed his tanned face flushed he pulled one side of the spread over her that was all he could do he wasnt any doctor anyway shed be all right she he pressed his thumb and forefinger against her wrist at first there seemed to be no pulse then he felt it faint stuttering strengthening for a few beats then fading again his voice trailed off into silence angry desperate someone might not be there not soon enough they might but they might not she was right on the edge a little longer and she might be over it he dropped her hand almost flung it from him and raced into the front room his shoes grated against the broken glass as he snatched up the brandy carafe he let it slide from his fingers fall gurgling to the floor he knew better than that after all the talks hed had with elaines doctors alcohol wasnt a stimulant but a depressant an anesthetic taken on top of the chloroform it would mean certain death running to the kitchen he yanked open the cupboard doors no ammonia nothing that would act as a restorative he glanced at the stove a coffee pot stood on the back burner it was half full as soon as the coffee began to simmer he grabbed the pot and a cup and hurried back to the bedroom he got down on his knees at the bedside filled a cup and set the pot on the floor and raised the girls head her head wobbled and coffee ran from her lips down over her chin and neck he put an arm around her under her left arm and rested her head on his shoulder he poured more coffee in the cup this time she swallowed some of the liquid but a shuddering strangled gasp made him suddenly jerk the cup away too fast hed given it to her too fast shed smother drown actually if he wasnt careful he waited a minute an hour it seemed like and again placed the cup to her lips mentally he measured out a spoonful and waited until her throat moved swallowed he gave her another spoonful then waited and another swallow slowly a little color was returning to her face maybe it would be all right now if he he felt her pulse sighing he refilled the cup he had almost finished doling it out to her a spoonful at a time when her heart began to pound he could feel it against his hand skipping a little still a little irregular but going stronger with every beat he started to remove his hand but her arm had tightened against her side her eyelids fluttered drowsily and opened youre all he began you all right toddy yeah sure he said somehow shamed now look ive got to beat it alvarados dead the copsll be here any minute i they do not know about theyll find out toddy didnt know why he was arguing he didnt know why the hell he didnt just beat it anyway theres plenty without that im wanted in half a dozen half a dozen her arm had gone around his neck her other arm held his hand against her breast the beat of her heart was very firm now firm and fast i tell you ive got to her lips shut off the words she sank back against the pillows drawing him with her faintly then louder and louder a police siren moaned and whined toddy didnt hear it in the early afternoon of his third day in jail he sat in semiisolation in a corner of the bullpen mulling over his situation he knew he was being held at the instance of the federal authorities which meant that since a murder charge would take precedence over others elaines death hadnt been discovered that seemed impossible alvarado himself had seen detectives in his and elaines hotel room but the fact remained he wasntcouldnt be wanted for murder yet he also knew that milt vonderheim was the smuggling rings goldsupplier and more than likely the man who had had elaine killed why the last he didnt know but the first was indisputable it was no wonder that milt had wanted him disposed of quickly since toddys original visit to the house of the talking dog he had held most of the clues to the little jewelers real identity he had presented milts card that day and mentioned being sent by a friend and alvarado not knowing what might be in the air had admitted him he had discovered almost immediately of course that toddy knew nothing of milts illegal activities that he had simply stumbled onto the house but alvarado had been prepared for that eventuality his eyes were bad he hadnt been able to read the card in other words toddys entry had not been obtained through milt it was a shrewd subterfuge but it had one great weakness it could only be explained if explanation became necessary on one basis milt was the rings key man the goldsupplier since he was operating in the open and was confined to his shop he could handle no other end of the racket toddys fingers strayed absently to the shirt pocket of his jail khakis and came away empty no cigarettes no dough and hed hardly been able to touch the jail chow except for the coffee the lack of comforts however troubled him much less than the reason for the lack hed never been able to do time he couldnt now and he was going to have to do a lot unless theyd have his record by now theyd know where he was wanted and for how much sixty days ninety a hundred and ten six months a year and a and elaine why think about those other raps when they were certain to pin a murder on him he tried to accept that fact and salvage what he could from it hed killed her say but not with premeditation shed slugged him with a bottle and hed blanked out and killed her not intentionally in a fit of temper that was manslaughter second degree manslaughter if he had the right lawyer if he was lucky hed get off with five years he thought about that those five years he thought about dolores then thrust her firmly out of his mind jail was hard enough to take without thinking about her knowing that shed come into his life too late that never again never again all day long an oval of men circled the bullpen moving around and around in silent restlessness when one man dropped out another took his place in the oval its composition changed a hundred times and yet it itself never changed kent the oval stopped moving every eye was on the door todd kent front and center toddy got up dusted off the seat of his trousers and pushed his way through the other prisoners clint mckinley bureau chief of investigation for the treasury department was a stocky mildlooking man with thin red hair and a soft amiable voice he wasnt a great deal older than toddy and in his first brief sizing up toddy decided that he wasnt too sharp a character he wasnt long in revising that opinion mckinley seated him in a chair in front of his desk tossed him a package of cigarettes and even held a match for him then he folded his hands leaned his elbows on the desk stared straight at toddy and began to talk about dolores or as he called her miss chavez we have a lot of admiration for her he said she did the right thing at great personal risk and without hope of reward were going to do the right thing by her shes in this country on a students visa were going to pave the way for her to become a citizen were going to do everything else thats in our power to do that can be quite a lot toddy nodded im glad for her shes a nice girl now we come to you said mckinley weve gone into your record pretty thoroughly we find it remarkable youve preyed on your fellow citizens with one kind of racket or another ever since you went into circulation you get a chance in the army to redeem yourself and you throw it away you sell out you help to tear down the prestige of the flag you swore allegiance to youve never been any good youve never done a single unselfish honest deed in your whole life the soft amiable voice ceased to speak toddy pushed himself up from his chair thanks for the sermon he said i dont think ill stay for the singing sit down kent huhuh you people cant make a charge stick against me youve had no right to hold me this long we can see that youre held by other authorities hop to it then whats the hurry said mckinley it always gets me to see a man throw himself away maybe i said a little too much if i did ill apologize toddy sat back down he had intended to from the beginning it had simply seemed bad psychologically to let mckinley crack the whip too hard as a matter of fact mckinley continued i think my statement was a little sweeping if you hadnt tried to help miss chavez there in san diego you might have escaped thats something in your favor of course you may have had some selfish motive for staying but try real hard said toddy youll think of one dont coax me mckinleys eyes glinted you want to get along with me or not kent if you dont just say so ive got something better to do with my time than argue with twobit con men toddy swallowed harshly and got a grip on himself hed been kidding himself about that psychology business a little anyway he was losing his temper he was letting a cop get his goat youre trying to do a job he said but youre going about it the wrong way youre not softening me up youre getting nowhere fast now why dont you drop it and start all over again who supplied the gold to this outfit kent i dont know youve got a good idea maybe lets have it then come on spit it out no said toddy you want a deal huh all right you play square with me and ill do what i can for you that said toddy isnt my idea of a deal ill give you one more chance kent i dont believe you know anything anyway but im willing to give you a chance turn it down and youll be touring jails for the next three years toddy grinned derisively three years hell mckinley misunderstood the grin he jabbed a button on his desk and the deputy jailer came back in take him out of here said mckinley lock him up and throw the key away we wont want him anymore the jailer took toddys elbow toddy got up and they started for the door he was sick inside hed played his cards the only way he could but they just hadnt been good enough now it was all over kent the jailer paused gave toddy a nudge toddy didnt turn around he didnt say anything he was afraid to this is your last chance kent you go through that door and youll never get another one toddy hesitated shrugged he took a step toward the door and his hand closed over the knob he turned it behind him he heard mckinleys amiable unwilling chuckle all right come on back ill talk to kent a little longer chief the jailer went out the door toddy the palms of his hands damp went back to his chair all right said mckinley calmly as though the scene just past had never taken place you were saying i was going about my job the wrong way could be ive been in this work for fifteen years but i learn something new every day now tell me where you think i was wrong you want something definite from me said toddy you havent offered anything definite in return we cant actually promise anything except to use our influence thats good enough for me call it settled then well try to wipe the slate clean mckinley smiled you havent committed any murders anywhere have you i dont think we could square those toddy shook his head no murders good said mckinley now lets see what weve got you were buying gold you accidentally accidentally on purpose maybe picked up a valuable watch a chunk of bullion at alvarados house he checked on you found out you were hot and offered you a job if you turned it down he threatened to mckinley broke off and made a deprecating gesture maybe he said miss chavez doesnt have her facts straight maybe youd better do the talking she has them straight said toddy why did you go to tijuana kent alvarado told me to i toddy coughed i was to go there and wait for him he didnt say why cough a little longer mckinley suggested maybe you can think of a better one no said toddy i think wed better let that one stand theres something in the rules about impeaching your own witnesses if i did take a little gold across the border its just as well that you have no knowledge of it mmmm drawled mckinley you dont know why he wanted you to go there you werent in any position to ask questions so you went and you got slugged and if alvarado hadnt intervened youd have been killed thats right its this way said toddy after it was all over alvarado told me why hed wanted me to go to tijuana he had it in for the goldsupplier he was trying to wash him up so alvarado let him know i was going to this place in tijuana hoping that hed try to kill me he paused conscious of the pitfall he was approaching how to tell a plausible story without mentioning elaine did you ever try telling the truth said mckinley the complete truth you might enjoy it i am trying to toddy frowned earnestly but its a pretty mixedup deal its hard to explain something when you dont completely understand it yourself you see alvarado wanted to get this guy but he got orders to leave him alone so he had to back up he wouldnt tell me anything i had to guess why i was slugged you knew who the goldsupplier was in other words he thought i did or could find out it was the only reason he could have for wanting to kill me mckinley ran a stubby hand through his thin red hair he sighed stood up and turned to the window he stared down into the street hands thrust into his pants pockets teetering back and forth on his heels it doesnt figure he said to the window it doesnt because youre holding out something i dont know why but im reasonably sure of one thing you know who the goldsupplier is i think i know you thought in the beginning then you found out something alvarado did or said something you saw there in the san diego house tipped you off mckinley sat down again and placed his elbows back on the desk knowing and proving are two different things suppose i gave you his name and address you go there you dont find anything he wont talk thats our problem is that a promise regardless of whether my tip works out youll get me that clean slate oh well now mckinley spread his hands you cant expect me to do that you might give us any old name and address and and yeah said mckinley mmmhmmm he squirmed in his chair looking down at some papers on his desk fumbling with them absently abruptly he looked up its milt vonderheim dont lie ive got the proof toddy laughed after a moment mckinley grinned its a good thing you didnt tell me it was vonderheim id have known you were trying to throw a curve under me id pick a better goat than milt toddy said everyone knows that we know i dont care about everyone how would you go about landing this man kent nothings been in the papers about alvarado or nothing yet i dont know how long we can keep it quiet ill need a few things a gun some money a car ill need a few days ive got to see some people why to make sure said toddy evenly that you dont have a tail on me at the first sign of one the whole deals off why if youre on the square toddy explained he was plausible earnest the soul of sincerity if mckinley wouldnt believe this he thought he wouldnt believe anything thats the way ill handle it he concluded hell have a lot of dough ill go through the motions of taking it highjacking him then ill put him in the car and head for the country someplace supposedly where i can bump him off and hide his body that part i dont get why would you want to bump him off because thats the way id have to feel about him when a mans killed toddy caught himself when a mans tried to kill you you want to get back at him hell talk hell spill everything he knows in attempting to get off the hook yeah maybe said mckinley but ive got to be left alone no tails nothing that might possibly lead him to think i was working with you you see that dont you its got to look like im giving you the doublecross otherwise he wont talk and youll never find out how he manages to get pounds of gold every week you wont be able to prove that he has got it and if you cant prove that but suppose said mckinley suppose you are giving us the doublecross toddy shrugged and leaned back in his chair mckinley sat blinking staring at him id be crazy to do it he said at last i give you a car and a gun and a clear field with a man thats loaded with dough i give a guy like you a setup like that it doesnt make sense any way you look at it he pressed a button on his desk and stood up toddy stood up also it was all over there was no use arguing only fifteen years in this game and ive gone crazy said mckinley chief take this man back to jail and dress him out ill send over an order for his release he said one other thing as toddy headed for the door something that made toddy very glad his back was turned well spring your wife too kent as soon as you pull this off after visiting a barber shop toddy went to a pawnshop where he purchased a secondhand suitcase a drugstore a haberdashery and a newsstand which sold back issues then he checked in at a hotel with deliberate slowness he unpacked the suitcase the clean shirts socks and underwear the toilet articles cigarettes and bottle of whiskey he knew what the backissue newspapers would tell him he had seen an evening paper headline bail racket probe looms but without that he would have known miracles didnt happen elaine couldnt be in jail still he didnt really know until he read the papers he spread them out at last a drink in his hand and read the foolishly unreasonable hope collapsed only two of the papers carried the story one gave it a paragraph the other two the latter paper also carried her picture a small blurred shot taken several years ago the former character actress had surrendered at a suburban jail shed worn sunglasses and was apparently suffering from a severe cold somebody was filling in for elaine toddy sighed and poured himself another drink it was about as hed figured it he ordered dinner and put in a call to airedale the bondsman arrived just as the waiter was departing his derby hat was pulled low over his eyes and his doggish face was long with anxiety his first act was to step to the window and draw the shade cant you smell that stuff man he rasped thats gas its driftin all the way down from that little room in sacramento toddy poured a glass of milk handed it to him and gestured to the bed airedale sat down heavily fanning himself with the derby whered you go he said and why aint you still goin save it said toddy taking a bite of steak now tell me what happened me i tell you what happened they cracked down on your connections you had to produce elaine take it from there i go to your hotel and get ahold of lardass we go up to your room we cant raise no one so we break in you aint there elaine aint there period comma said toddy howd the room look i mean was it torn up you ought to know no airedale added hastily it wasnt there werent any cops around no detectives just me and the house dick but what time were you there eleventhirty maybe twelve oh said toddy i get it you were there when when airedale nodded when elaine was going up in smoke jesus toddy did you have to draw a picture of it couldnt you have done it outside somewheres youre up there raising hell everyone in the joint hears her screamin and then that doesnt mean anything she was always doing that she wont anymore said airedale i honest to gawd dont get it toddy getting rid of the corpus delicti wont make you nothing not with that incinerator stack running right through your room toddy abruptly pushed aside his steak and poured a cup of coffee i didnt kill her airedale lets get that straight i didnt kill her am i a cop said airedale i dont care what you did i aint even seen you i aint even telling you to get away from here as far and as fast as you can before they put the arm on you there hasnt been any rumble yet there will be airedale assured him grimly its building up right now that little hustler the ringer thats standing in for elaine dont like jail so toddy shrugged shes in up to her ears it would be easier for her if she liked it she dont like it airedale repeated because shes on the dope shes a heroin mainliner toddy gulped but why in the hell did she why do they do anything when theyre hitting the h growled airedale she spent so much time in the hay she was starting to moo but she still couldnt pay for her habit so she stands in for elaine and then she gives me the bad news im over a barrel see ive got to take care of her i got to put in a fix and see that she gets the stuff either that or im out of business shell squawk that she aint elaine airedale paused to light a cigar he took a disconsolate puff or two and sat staring at the glowing tip well ive had a doctor in every day cold shots yknow but that cant go on moren a few more trips even if no one wised up and i was getting those shots for a buck instead of a hundred id have to break it off i wouldnt play ive got my own kind of crookedness it dont drive people crazy it dont kill em he paused again and gave toddy an apologetic glance not he said that some of em dont need killin its just a manner of speaking skip it said toddy will she keep quiet as long as she gets the stuff why not she aint a bad kid she doesnt want to cause any trouble shes beginning to see that i cant keep her fixed and she aint kickin shell just go out on her own again she wont be able to do that theyll stick her on a conspiracy charge huhuh airedale wagged his head shell get out shell get all the stuff she wants youve read them papers well that little gals worth her weight in white stuff to certain parties the bondsman stubbed out his cigar sighed and reached inside the pocket of his coat he brought out a railroad timetable and proceeded to scan it after a moment he looked up what do you think about florida this time of year im not going anywhere said toddy not yet anyway i am said airedale i like my fireworks on the fourth of july heres hoping itll be safe to come back by then he waited as though expecting some comment but toddy only nodded naturally airedale would have to get out of town the scandal would die down eventually be superseded by other and livelier scandals meanwhile los angeles would be made extremely uncomfortable for the bondsman and his various political connections airedale rose looked into the crown of his derby and emitted a bark of pleasure well look at that he said pulling forth a roll of bills and just when youd changed your mind about leaving thanks toddy pushed back the roll it isnt that ive got money so what else do you need nothing you can help me with i can help you a little said airedale i can tell you to forget it if youre figuring on copping a plea juries dont like these cases where the body is disposed of it shows bad faith see what i mean you try to cover the crime up and then maybe when you see you cant get away with it you ask for a break they give you one up here but yeah said toddy dully i suppose youre right airedale slammed on his derby and started to turn away i dont get it he snarled what are you hanging around for why aint you on your way i want to find out who killed elaine brother said airedale that does it if i run said toddy ive got to keep running a few hundred or a few grand wont be enough ive got to be squared for life youve got something good lined up huh said airedale why didnt you say so in the first place what never mind can you pull it off by yourself its the only way i can do it but ill need more time airedale a couple of days anyway i really wanted three but two said airedale id figured on twentyfour hours enough time for me to clear out but ill fix the gal for two ill pay for that much she may not get the stuff if im not here but oh hell i guess itll be all right they shook hands and airedale left a drink in his hand toddy sat down on the bed and mulled over the situation some of his normal fatalism began to assert itself he grinned philosophically he undressed and climbed into bed lying back with his eyes open he stared up into the darkness mckinley had promised not to have him tailed it wouldnt be necessary placed at strategic points a mere handful of men with the license number and description of a car could follow its movements even in a city as large as los angeles so there was only one thing to do rather two things change the license change the description milt would be stubborn hed do nothing unless he was made to so hed be made to thered be no spotcheck no tails no tmen to interfere at ninethirty the next morning toddy finished a leisurely breakfast in his room and called mckinley the bureau chief sounded annoyed as he told toddy where to pick up the car you havent seen miss chavez he asked seen her why the hell would i i dont even know where good said mckinley in a milder tone shes been after us to find out what happened to you wanted to see you in jail wanted to send you a note i finally told her wed turned you loose and youd left town thats thats fine said toddy yeah youve got a job to do kent youve got a wife and miss chavez is as straight as they come and im not youre not agreed mckinley you took the words right out of my mouth he hung up the phone toddy slammed up his receiver and finished dressing he was irritated by the conversation but more than that worried dolores knew about elaines death shed be wondering why after holding him toddy three days mckinley had suddenly freed him shed be sure that instead of merely leaving town as mckinley had told her he had hed try to leave the country shed know that hed need plenty of money to leave on and that he could only get it in one way as long as he was in jail her deal with the government was safe they wouldnt care when the news of the murder broke whether shed known about it or not but if he skipped the country and committed another crime in the process of skipping no toddy shook his head that wasnt like her she wouldnt be concerned for herself but him shed want to help him and that in a way was as bad as the other he couldnt tell her anything this had to be a oneman show toddy took a final glance around the room left it and headed for the elevator the car was parked a few blocks away he almost laughed aloud when he saw it it was a mediumpriced sedan exactly like thousands of others of the same make to a casual observer but toddy was not observing casually and neither would the tmen theyd hardly need to look at the license plates the gray paint job the white sidewall tires and the redglass reflector buttons by which the plates were held would be sufficient identification theyd be able to spot him two blocks away he slid under the wheel and opened the dashboard compartment the keys and the gun were there and he checked it quickly the gun was loaded everything was as it should be he drove north and east winding back and forth through a maze of side streets avoiding anything in the nature of an arterial thoroughfare he didnt think mckinley would have his spot check set up so soon but he might and there wasnt any hurry he had the whole day to kill the houses he passed grew shabbier fewer and farther apart many of them stood empty most of the streets were unpaved it was one of those borderline ambiguous areas common to most cities an area surrendered to industry but not yet made part of it toddy pulled onto a brickpaved street and rounded a corner on the opposite side of the street was an abandoned warehouse on the right the side he was on was an automobile salvage yard its high board fence set back to allow room for the dingy filling station at the front a fourwheel truck trailer all its tires missing stood between the street and the closedin grease rack toddy drove into the inside lane of the station he spoke a few words to a coldeyed man in greasy coveralls and a skullcap made of an old hat the man leaned against the gas pump he looked up and down the street said okay mac and jerked his head toddy drove into the greasing tunnel then as the rear wall slid up into the yard beyond the job took two men three hours when it was over toddy himself if he had not watched the transformation would not have believed it was the same car a chromium grille disguised the radiator the white sidewalls were replaced with plain tires a sunshade sheltered the windshield the roof and fenders of the car were dark blue the rest of the body a glossy black the red reflector buttons were gone of course as were the original license plates the plate holders with the substitute plates had been moved to a new position toddy paid over one hundred and fifty dollars adding a fivedollar tip for each of the workmen that left him with a little less than ten dollars but that was more than enough for what he had to do he wouldnt be paying his hotel bill he wouldnt be going back to pay it he took one of the main streets back toward town stopping once at a restaurantbar where he passed the better part of two hours and again at a drugstore where he bought faintly tinted sunglasses the glasses were disguise enough not really necessary for that matter theyd be looking for a car not a man it was dusk when toddy reached the citys business section and a light drizzling rain was beginning to fall driving slowly toddy turned north up spring street milt wouldnt be buying gold now moreover he wouldnt be receiving his nightly visit from the driver of the beer truck he wouldnt because there would be no more scrap gold to go out in the empty bottles toddy swore suddenly and stepped on the gas almost immediately he slowed down again so what what difference did it make if he passed by the hotel the one where he and elaine had lived they didnt know anything or want to know anything all they were interested in was the rent which was paid through tomorrow he parked on main street and sat in the growing darkness smoking listening to the patter of rain on the roof for a panicstricken moment he wondered whether milt had already skipped then grinned and shook his head milt would see no need to hurry hed move cautiously safely taking his time so that was all right he wished he had nothing to worry about but that it was seven oclock by the time he had finished his third cigarette he tossed the butt out the window transferred the gun from the dash compartment to his pocket and started the car he drove up main a block swung over to the next street drove back three blocks on a dark side street he turned right and cut the motor he coasted to a stop a few doors above the entrance to the los angeles watch jewelry co brokers in precious metals luckily he waited a moment before reaching for the door of the car for milt hadnt stopped buying gold doubtless he felt that it was too soon that he had to go through the motions a little longer or perhaps he was waiting for a weekend to beat it at any rate the door of the shop opened suddenly and a raincoated figure carrying the familiar square box dashed toward main street a few minutes later two other buyers came out together and trotted toward main crouched low in the seat hidden by the rainwashed windows toddy waited ten minutes more but no one else emerged from the shop and he decided no one was likely to it was too late he slid over on the seat and rolled down the window he looked swiftly up and down the street then he rolled up the window opened the door and got out he walked close to the building fronts pausing as he passed the one next to milts shop he could see in from there see a scene so familiar so associated with warmth and friendliness that what he was about to do seemed suddenly fantastic and hateful milt seated back in his cage the bright work light lifting him out of the shadows draping him in a kind of golden aura milt how could he but he had and his friendliness his faked friendship only made matters worse toddy reconnoitered the street quickly strode to the door and stepped inside he was halfway down the long dark aisle before milt could look up toddy iss it you for days i have been worrying about about yeah said toddy ill bet you have he moved swiftly through the wicket of the cage and brought a hand down on the gooseneck of the lamp it flattened against the workbench casting its light upon the floor no one looking in from the street would see anything milt had started to rise but toddy shoved him back in his chair he seated himself facing the little jeweler thats right he nodded grimly thats a gun if you dont think ill use it give me a little trouble but i do not understand trouble have ever i he broke off staring into toddys cold set face and abruptly his mask of bewildered innocence vanished stupid toddy oh so stupid at last he awakens get it out said toddy every goddamned nickel and dont ask me what ask mitt shrugged i am not given to foolish chatter as for it i have anticipated you it is already out he started to reach beneath the workbench then paused abruptly arm halfextended toddy nodded go ahead just dont try anything he took the heavy briefcase that mitt drew out laid it on the bench and slipped the catch he shook it slightly his eyes swerving from the jeweler to the bench there was one packet of scat money fives tens and twenties the rest of the horde was in thousanddollar bills dough too hot for the dumbest burglar to touch milt couldnt spend it in this country abroad thered be no trouble violation of income tax laws was not an extraditable offense your visit was most inopportune sighed mitt a few hours more and i would have been gone youre still going youre going out to venice with me out to the beach were going to have a nice long talk we can do that here we are alone on this street no one will come in someone will tomorrow but oh said milt still is it necessary toddy you have the money by tomorrow you can be very far away in any case my hands are tied i dare not complain toddy jerked his head ill be a lot farther away the day after tomorrow and youd talk all right everyone thats had anything to do with me will get a goingover ive been in jail and yes i know then you probably know how i got myself sprung you know i cant keep my bargain unless i dig up the guy that killed elaine which you cannot do said mitt not he added that you have any intention of keeping your bargain another perhaps almost any other man but not you he grinned faintly his hands clasped over his fat stomach you do not want to keep your bargain with the government agents you cannot keep it a confession you may extract from me but it will be worthless i can prove that i did not kill elaine or cause her to be killed maybe toddy studied the bland chubby face maybe he repeated but im taking you with me anyway no one knows how you worked this setup here im going to find out just in case i ever get back to this country if you come clean with me i may just tie you up and dump you somewhere some place where youll be found in a few days otherwise he gestured significantly with the gun milt laughed openly yes you were thinking of the dunes doubtless oh excellent it will be a wonderful place to leave a body or should i say two two toddy frowned what the hell are you talking about bodies said milt yours and miss chavez toddys chair grated against the floor damn you if youve hurt that behind him the curtains rustled faintly something cold and hard pushed through them pressed into the back of his neck milt nodded to him solemnly that is right toddy sit still sit very very still yes and i think i shall just take your gun miss chavez he glanced at the clock should be here at any moment your hotel your former hotel i should say was kind enough to refer her to me i suggested that she return here tonight when you in your hour of dire emergency would most certainly come to me for aid so so the front door opened and clicked softly shut she has come she came down the aisle hesitantly at first then with quick firm steps as she saw the two men in the dim glow of the lamp toddy i am so glad i i do not scream said milt do not move he thrust himself up from his chair moved around toddy and out through the wicket toddy waited helplessly his hands carefully held out from his sides this was the one thing he hadnt foreseen the fact that mitt might have a confederate who the hell could it be he wondered and why had milt behaved as he had what had he hoped to gain by appearing defenseless letting toddy talk toddy didnt know and there was no time now to think about it the person behind him came through the drapes and the gun barrel dug viciously into his neck he got up slowly he looked into dolores pale strained face and tried to grin reassuringly he heard milts chuckle as he pushed her forward through the wicket he turned around hiya prince said elaine through a blinding downpour of rain the car moved cautiously steadily westward toddy drove bent over the wheel staring through the windshield dolores was at his side milt and elaine in the rear seat it was almost an hour before the city proper was left behind them and silently except for the humming of the tires and the wet lash of the windshield wipers they went rolling down olympic boulevard it ran in practically a straight line to the ocean there was almost no traffic on it now toddy eased up on the gas a little more hed outsmarted himself this time in outwitting mckinley hed handed milt a setup now there was nothing to do but stall postpone the inevitable as long as possible the air was thick with the odor of elaines cigarettes and whiskey she coughed choked and a fine spray showered toddys neck milt cleared his throat apologetically perhaps liebling it might be well to what said elaine you trying to tell me when to take a drink milt hesitated toddy felt a faint surge of hope if she and milt should start fighting if shed only throw one of those wild tantrums of hers but she didnt moreover toddy knew she wasnt going to if you put it that way milt said coldly yes rather i am telling you when not to drink and i am telling you that now there is too much at stake later it will be all right i would be the last to interfere there was a moment of silence then all right honey elaine said meekly you just tell lil elaine what to do and thats what shell do good said milt complacently we must give our toddy no advantage hein whatever you say honey he is a very intelligent man milt went on he tells me in substance how much time the police have given him he informs me indirectly that there is no one following his movements finally by a reverse process he makes excellent suggestions for disposing of himself do you wonder that i fear him this intellectual giant elaines giggle tapered off to a troubled note yeah but honey i dont consider milt continued enjoyably everything he is told yet nothing he sees he knows that alvarado has told the anonymous goldsupplier of the theft of the watch he knows his wife detests him and he is thoroughly familiar with her talents as an actress but does he draw any conclusions from these things not at all he is baffled by her strange death and the subsequent disappearance of her body it does not occur to him that she had simulated death that she followed him down the fire escape taking the watch with her dolores halfturned in the seat and her eyes flashed he is not stupid he trusted you it is easy to of stupidity said milt you are hardly a competent judge you who revealed his release from jail to a stranger now if you wish to take full advantage of your remaining minutes of consciousness you will turn around you are too cowardly i turn around said toddy softly she called the turn on you milt i trusted you on top of that you had a lot of luck if i hadnt chased off after donald id have found out that elaine was pulling a fake there was no element of luck milt said i telephoned elaine when you left the shop there was ample time to locate the watch and prepare for your arrival but if id examined elaine if you had well it would be a prank and later we should have tried again but we i knew you would not do that so many predicaments has your stupidity placed you in and always you react in the same manner you place no faith in the wisdom or mercy of constituted authority you make no study of the factors behind your contretemps tricks you have not brains tricks and legs so where tricks are futile you run toddy grunted youre a funny guy milt very funny oh there is no doubt about it everyone has always said so there is only one person who did not me cooed elaine snuggling against him i knew better right from the beginning so you did milt nodded benignly so now i think you should have another drink a very small one ahead and to the right blurred lights pushed up through the shrouds of rain santa monica it wouldnt be long now a car came towards them foglights burning moving rapidly toddys hand tightened on the wheel sideswipe it huhuh milt had nothing to lose an accident any sign of trouble would only make him kill more quickly toddy forced a short ugly laugh elaine lowered the bottle squinted suspiciously in the darkness something funny prince toddy shrugged goddammit i asked you if quiet my treasure milt drew her back against his shoulder and yes i think i will take charge of the liquor he is trying to disturb you drink makes the task easy but all right honey theres one thing i dont understand said toddy why was the room straightened up before elaine skipped out on the night of her supposed death merely a precautionary measure the police might have been notified if the condition of the room happened to be observed i felt sure you would hold alvarado responsible i wished to make sure you had no interference that part of your plan didnt work out very well did it it worked out well enough said milt as your present situation proves but you were laughing a moment ago i was just thinking toddy laughed again wondering about you and elaine how long itll be before she turns on you when you least expect it because she turned as you put it on you but there is no similarity between the two cases you could give her nothing i can she never needed you she needs me you tried to hold her against her will i would never do that if parting becomes necessary it will be arranged amicably we will share and share alike and each will go his own way thats sound logic said toddy but youre not dealing with a logical person elaine gets her fun out of not getting along its the only entertainment aside from drinking that shes capable of shes a degenerate milt shes liable to go in for killing as hard as she does drinking i wouldnt believe the doctors when something hit him a painful blow on the head the car swerved he swung it straight again at a sharp command from milt in the rearview mirror he saw the jeweler turn hand raised toward elaine dummkopf he snapped i have a notion to then he smiled and his voice went suddenly gentle it seems we both have the temper it is not a time to give way to it im sorry honey he just made me so damned sore but now you see through his tricks eh you see where they might lead to uhhuh elaine sighed youre so smart darling you see right through people he doesnt see through you said toddy if he did hed take that gun away from you hed know what youre thinking that all of that dough would be better than half elaine made a mocking sound with her lips milt chuckled fatly it is useless toddy in the regrettable absence of attraction there would still be the factor of need it was i who planned this and there will be yet more planning thinking to be done even an elaine as elemental as the one you portray would not destroy something necessary to survival anyway said elaine i dont want the old gun i wouldnt know how to use it you take it honey mitt pushed it back at her but you must know it is imperative look i will show you again the safety here then only a firm short pull on the trigger very short unless you wish to empty it it is automatic as i told you previously his own gun was in his lap for the moment and toddy knew another surge of hope he couldnt of course do anything himself but elaine but elaine didnt milt picked up his gun again toddy turned the car off olympic and onto ocean avenue they reached pico street and he turned again less than a mile ahead was the ocean no more questions toddy nothing else you would like to inquire about nothing after all the opportunity will not arise again no it wont said toddy look milt yes let miss chavez go she wont i will not go said dolores calmly you will not agreed milt i am sorry it is a terrible penalty to pay for allying oneself with an imbecile he rolled down the window of the car and peered out and the rain sounds mingled with the roar of the ocean the breakers rolling in and out from shore toddy made the last turn you made one mistake mitt theres one thing you didnt count on interesting murmured milt but not i am afraid true this is the place you had in mind i believe yes you will stop then and turn off your lights toddy stopped the lights went off there was a moment of silence the nearabsolute silence which precedes action before milt could break it toddy spoke this was his last chance his and dolores and he knew it was wasted no chance at all even before he started to speak what he had to say was incredible his strained hollow voice made it preposterous really toddy milt sounded almost embarrassed you do not expect us to believe that no said toddy i dont expect you to believe me but it is true only stupidity i charged you with milt pointed out not insanity you did not know elaine was alive you were sure you would be accused of her murder willing though you might be to pass up a fortune and i sincerely suspect such a willingness you would not dare abide by your bargain in this case you had no choice but to run i was tired of running i knew i hadnt killed her i was going to fight the case without money with all the evidence against you with a long record of criminality and if by some fluke of justice you cleared yourself what then you have no trade but to prey upon others you i could get one the words the tone seemed ridiculously childish we waste time said milt you would have me believe you pursued one futility to achieve another you risking your liberty perhaps your life by keeping a bargain you placing your faith at last in the courts you toddy kent doing these things for a socalled good name a job perhaps miss chavez it would not have been perhaps said dolores even so milt shrugged i know him too well and he knows himself too well he does not fit the part now i think let elaine think toddy persisted doggedly you cant pull out you want to get her in as deep as you are dont let him do it elaine theres a tape recorder in the car i elaine milt interrupted is not required to think and of course there is a recorder how else could you obtain the evidence you were supposed to get i do not deny the existence of a bargain only that you had no intention of keeping it i did intend to keep it i know it looks like i didnt but i had to make it look that way i was supposed to meet them here i called them just before i went to your shop elaine tonight said milt you were to meet them there tonight or tomorrow night or perhaps even the next you are transparent toddy your government men would have given you two days without surveillance as quickly as they would give you two hours never would they have agreed to such an arrangement they didnt agree to it but they had to take it id already ducked out on em it was either play it my way or nonsense you insult my intelligence now wait a minute said elaine worriedly let me it is not necessary said milt i have already thought of everything you were to meet them here eh bah where are they then toddy licked dry lips helplessly it was no use the evidence was all against him he couldnt make them believe something that was incredible to himself i dont know he said almost indifferently its a big beach maybe they dont recognize the car i dont know where they are but milts curt bored laugh cut him off they would not recognize the car certainly you would see to that and we both know where they are anywhere but here now enough but milt honey elaine began enough snapped milt must i explain everything twice why do you think i played with him there in the shop found out exactly where he wished to go because it would be safe it would be the last place his whilom friends would expect to find him all right honey i was just we will proceed and please the bottle will remain here dolores was shoved over in the seat squeezed against toddy elaine pushed past her and got out she stood back in the sand a few feet covering the door as toddy and the girl emerged milt came out last grunting from the exertion blinking his eyes against the rain now he panted we will just he gestured with the gun elaine spoke apologetically milt baby are you sure really sure that i have said so it is all finished now we have only to he saw then heard the childishly delighted laugh mischievous filled with the viciousness it could not recognize signaling triumph in a game without rules it seemed to paralyze him the gun hung loose in his fingers liebling he gasped darling there is so much why there was a brief stuttering blast wwhy milt said and crumpled to the sand and he said no more and heard no more elaine snatched up his gun and leveled it quickly huhuh prince you gave me an idea but i get ideas too lil elaines dead lil elaines in the clear this is your gun and you shot him and he shot you and her and elaine toddys voice shook for your own sake dont the government men are bound to be near here they probably missed us in the rain but those shots are sure to d dont make me laugh prince ddont rnmake me laugh she began to rock with laughter it pealed out shrill delighted infectious and suddenly toddy was laughing with her laughing and ridding himself of something the last fragile frazzled tie llike she was shrieking like milt said prince you ddont fit the part that was the way he would always remember her the monkey face twisted with merriment the scrawny raindrenched figure rocking in the abrupt pitiless glow of floodlights laughing as the guns of the tmen began to chatter so he would always remember her but it was like remembering another person someone he had never known the gizmo the golden deceptive brassfilled gizmo was gone at last the end
