 the gods of the mountain by lord dunsany scene the east the first act outside a city wall three beggars are seated upon the ground oogno these days are bad for beggary thahn they are bad ulf some evil has befallen the rich ones of this city they take no joy any longer in benevolence but are become sour and miserly at heart alas for them i sometimes sigh for them when i think of this oogno alas for them a miserly heart must be a sore affliction thahn a sore affliction indeed and bad for our calling oogno they have been thus for many months what thing has befallen them thahn some evil thing ulf there has been a comet come near to the earth of late and the earth has been parched and sultry so that the gods are drowsy and all those things that are divine in man such as benevolence drunkenness extravagance and song have faded and died and have not been replenished by the gods oogno it has indeed been sultry thahn i have seen the comet o nights ulf the gods are drowsy oogno if they awake not soon and make this city worthy again of our order i for one shall forsake the calling and buy a shop and sit at ease in the shade and barter for gain thahn you will keep a shop enter agmar and slag agmar though poorly dressed is tall imperious and older than ulf slag follows behind him agmar is this a beggar who speaks oogno yes master a poor beggar agmar how long has the calling of beggary existed oogno since the building of the first city master agmar and when has a beggar ever followed a trade when has he ever haggled and bartered and sat in a shop oogno why he has never done so agmar are you he that shall be first to forsake the calling oogno times are bad for the calling here thahn they are bad agmar so you would forsake the calling oogno the city is unworthy of our calling the gods are drowsy and all that is divine in man is dead to third beggar are not the gods drowsy ulf they are drowsy in their mountains away at marma the seven green idols are drowsy who is this that rebukes us thahn are you some great merchant master perhaps you will help a poor man that is starving slag my master a merchant no no he is no merchant my master is no merchant oogno i perceive that he is some lord in disguise the gods have woken and sent him to save us slag no no you do not know my master you do not know him thahn is he the soldans self that has come to rebuke us agmar i am a beggar and an old beggar slag there is none like my master no traveller has met with cunning like to his not even those that come from aethiopia ulf we make you welcome to our town upon which an evil has fallen the days being bad for beggary agmar let none who has known the mystery of roads or has felt the wind arising new in the morning or who has called forth out of the souls of men divine benevolence ever speak any more of any trade or of the miserable gains of shops and the trading men oogno i but spoke hastily the times being bad agmar i will put right the times slag there is nothing that my master cannot do agmar be silent and attend to me i do not know this city i have travelled from far having somewhat exhausted the city of ackara slag my master was three times knocked down and injured by carriages there once he was killed and seven times he was beaten and robbed and every time he was generously compensated he had nine diseases many of them mortal agmar be silent slag have you any thieves among the calling here ulf we have a few that we call thieves here master but they would scarcely seem thieves to you they are not good thieves agmar i shall need the best thief you have enter two citizens richly clad illanaun and oorander illanaun therefore we will send galleons to ardaspes oorander right to ardaspes through the silver gates agmar transfers the thick handle of his long staff to his left armpit he droops on to it and it supports his weight he is upright no longer his right arm hangs limp and useless he hobbles up to the citizens imploring alms illanaun i am sorry i cannot help you there have been too many beggars here and we must decline alms for the good of the town agmar i have come from far illanaun presently returns and gives agmar a coin exit illanaun agmar erect again walks back to the others agmar we shall need fine raiment let the thief start at once let it rather be green raiment beggar i will go and fetch the thief ulf we will dress ourselves as lords and impose upon the city oogno yes yes we will say we are ambassadors from a far land ulf and there will be good eating slag but you do not know my master now that you have suggested that we go as lords he will make a better suggestion he will suggest that we should go as kings ulf beggars as kings slag ay you do not know my master ulf what do you bid us do agmar you shall first come by the fine raiment in the manner i have mentioned ulf and what then master agmar why we shall go as gods beggars as gods agmar as gods know you the land through which i have lately come in my wanderings marma where the gods are carved from green stone in the mountains they sit all seven of them against the hills they sit there motionless and travellers worship them ulf yes yes we know those gods they are much reverenced here but they are drowsy and send us nothing beautiful agmar they are of green jade they sit crosslegged with their right elbows resting on their left hands the right forefinger pointed upward we will come into the city disguised from the direction of marma and we will claim to be these gods we must be seven as they are and when we sit we must sit crosslegged as they do with the right hand uplifted ulf this is a bad city in which to fall into the hands of oppressors for the judges lack amiability here as the merchants lack benevolence ever since the gods forgot them agmar in our ancient calling a man may sit at one street corner for fifty years doing the one thing and yet a day may come when it is well for him to rise up and do another thing while the timorous man starves ulf also it were not well to anger the gods agmar is not all life a beggary to the gods do they not see all men always begging of them and asking alms with incense and bells and subtle devices oogno yes all men indeed are beggars before the gods agmar does not the mighty soldan often sit by the agate altar in his royal temple as we sit at a street corner or by a palace gate ulf it is even so agmar then will the gods be glad when we follow the holy calling with new devices and with subtlety as they are glad when the priests sing a new song ulf yet i have a fear agmar go you into the city before us and let there be a prophecy there which saith that the gods who are carven from green rock in the mountain shall one day arise in marma and come here in the guise of men slag yes master shall i make the prophecy myself or shall it be found in some old document agmar let someone have seen it once in some rare document let it be spoken of in the market place slag it shall be spoken of master oogno this is our thief agmar ah he is a quick thief thief i could only procure you three green raiments master the city is not now well supplied with them moreover it is a very suspicious city and without shame for the baseness of its suspicions slag this is not thieving thief i could do no more master i have not practised thieving all my life agmar you have got something it may serve our purpose how long have you been thieving thief i first stole when i was ten slag when he was ten agmar we must tear them up and divide them amongst the seven bring me another beggar slag when my master was ten he had already to slip by night out of two cities oogno out of two cities slag in his native city they do not now know what became of the golden cup that stood in the lunar temple agmar yes into seven pieces ulf we will each wear a piece of it over our rags oogno yes yes we shall look fine agmar that is not the way we shall disguise ourselves oogno not cover our rags agmar no no the first who looked closely would say these are only beggars they have disguised themselves ulf what shall we do agmar each of the seven shall wear a piece of the green raiment underneath his rags and peradventure here and there a little shall show through and men shall say these seven have disguised themselves as beggars but we know not what they be slag hear my wise master oogno he is a beggar ulf he is an old beggar the second act the metropolitan hall of the city of kongros citizens etc enter the seven beggars with green silk under their rags oorander who are you and whence come you agmar who may say what we are or whence we come oorander what are these beggars and why do they come here agmar who said to you that we were beggars oorander why do these men come here agmar who said to you that we were men illanaun now by the moon agmar my sister illanaun what agmar my little sister slag our little sister the moon she comes to us at evenings away in the mountains of marma she trips over the mountains when she is young when she is young and slender she comes and dances before us and when she is old and unshapely she hobbles away from the hills agmar yet is she young again and forever nimble with youth yet she comes dancing back the years are not able to curb her nor to bring gray hairs to her brethren oorander this is not wonted illanaun it is not in accordance with custom akmos prophecy hath not thought it slag she comes to us new and nimble remembering olden loves oorander it were well that prophets should come and speak to us illanaun this hath not been in the past let prophets come let prophets speak to us of future things the beggars seat themselves upon the floor in the attitude of the seven gods of marma citizen i heard men speak today in the market place they speak of a prophecy read somewhere of old it says the seven gods shall come from marma in the guise of men illanaun is this a true prophecy oorander it is all the prophecy we have man without prophecy is like a sailor going by night over uncharted seas he knows not where are the rocks nor where the havens to the man on watch all things are black and the stars guide him not for he knows not what they are illanaun should we not investigate this prophecy oorander let us accept it it is as the small uncertain light of a lantern carried as it may be by a drunkard but along the shore of some haven let us be guided akmos it may be that they are but benevolent gods agmar there is no benevolence greater than our benevolence illanaun then we need do little they portend no danger to us agmar there is no anger greater than our anger oorander let us make sacrifices to them if they be gods akmos we humbly worship you if ye be gods illanaun you are mightier than all men and hold high rank among other gods and are lords of this our city and have the thunder as your plaything and the whirlwind and the eclipse and all the destinies of human tribes if ye be gods agmar let the pestilence not fall at once on this city as it had indeed designed to let not the earthquake swallow it all immediately up amid the howls of the thunder let not infuriated armies overwhelm those that escape if we be gods populace if we be gods oorander come let us sacrifice illanaun bring lambs akmos quick quick slag this god is a very divine god thahn he is no common god mlan indeed he has made us citizen he will not punish us master none of the gods will punish us we will make a sacrifice a good sacrifice another we will sacrifice a lamb that the priests have blessed first citizen master you are not wroth with us slag who may say what cloudy dooms are rolling up in the mind of the eldest of the gods he is not common god like us once a shepherd went by him in the mountains and doubted he sent a doom after that shepherd citizen master we have not doubted slag and the doom found him on the hills at evening second citizen it shall be a good sacrifice master reenter with a dead lamb and fruits they offer the lamb on an altar where there is fire and fruits before the altar thahn that leg is not being cooked at all illanaun it is strange that gods should be thus anxious about the cooking of a leg of lamb oorander it is strange certainly illanaun almost i had said that it was a man that spoke then oorander stroking his beard and regarding the second beggar strange strange certainly agmar is it then strange that the gods love roasted flesh for this purpose they keep the lightning when the lightning flickers about the limbs of men there comes to the gods of marma a pleasant smell even a smell of roasting sometimes the gods being pacific are pleased to have roasted instead the flesh of lamb it is all one to the gods let the roasting stop oorander no no gods of the mountains others no no oorander quick let us offer flesh to them if they eat all is well they offer it the beggars eat all but agmar who watches illanaun one who was ignorant one who did not know had almost said that they ate like hungry men others hush akmos yet they look as though they had not had a meal like this for a long time oorander they have a hungry look agmar i have not eaten since the world was very new and the flesh of men was tenderer than now these younger gods have learned the habit of eating from the lions oorander o oldest of divinities partake partake agmar it is not fitting that such as i should eat none eat but beasts and men and the younger gods the sun and the moon and the nimble lightning and i we may kill and we may madden but we do not eat akmos if he but eat of our offering he cannot overwhelm us all oh ancient deity partake partake agmar enough let it be enough that these have condescended to this bestial and human habit illanaun and yet he is not unlike a beggar whom i saw not so long since oorander but beggars eat illanaun now i never knew a beggar yet who would refuse a bowl of woldery wine akmos this is no beggar illanaun nevertheless let us offer him a bowl of woldery wine akmos you do wrong to doubt him illanaun i do but wish to prove his divinity i will fetch the woldery wine akmos he will not drink yet if he does then he will not overwhelm us let us offer him the wine first beggar it is woldery wine second beggar it is woldery third beggar a goblet of woldery wine fourth beggar o blessed day mlan o happy times slag o my wise master illanaun takes the goblet all the beggars stretch out their hands including agmar illanaun gives it to agmar agmar takes it solemnly and very carefully pours it out on the ground first beggar he has spilt it second beggar he has spilt it agmar it is a fitting libation our anger is somewhat appeased another beggar but it was woldery akmos master i am childless and i agmar trouble us not now it is the hour at which the gods are accustomed to speak to the gods in the language of the gods and if man heard us he would guess the futility of his destiny which were not well for man begone begone one lingers master agmar begone exeunt agmar takes up a piece of meat and begins to eat it the beggars rise and stretch themselves they laugh but agmar eats hungrily oogno ah now we have come into our own thahn now we have alms slag master my wise master ulf these are the good days the good days and yet i have a fear slag what do you fear there is nothing to fear no man is as wise as my master ulf i fear the gods whom we pretend to be slag the gods agmar come hither slag slag yes master agmar watch in the doorway while i eat slag goes to the doorway sit in the attitude of a god warn me if any of the citizens approach slag sits in the doorway in the attitude of a god back to the audience oogno but master shall we not have woldery wine agmar we shall have all things if only we are wise at first for a little thahn master do any suspect us agmar we must be very wise thahn but if we are not wise master agmar why then death may come to us thahn o master agmar slowly all stir uneasily except slag who sits motionless in the doorway oogno do they believe us master slag someone comes agmar we shall soon know now one master i want the god that does not eat agmar i am he one master my child was bitten in the throat by a deathadder at noon spare him master he still breathes but slowly agmar is he indeed your child one he is surely my child master agmar was it your wont to thwart him at his play while he was strong and well one i never thwarted him master agmar whose child is death one death is the child of the gods agmar do you that never thwarted your child in his play ask this of the gods one master agmar weep not for all the houses that men have builded are the playfields of this child of the gods oogno is this indeed a man agmar a man a man and until just now a hungry one the third act same room a few days have elapsed seven thrones shaped like mountaincrags stand along the back of the stage on these the beggars are lounging the thief is absent mlan never had beggars such a time oogno ah the fruits and tender lamb thahn the woldery wine slag it was better to see my masters wise devices than to have fruit and lamb and woldery wine mlan ah when they spied on him to see if he would eat when they went away oogno when they questioned him concerning the gods and man thahn when they asked him why the gods permitted cancer slag ah my wise master mlan how well his scheme has succeeded oogno how far away is hunger thahn it is even like to one of last years dreams the trouble of a brief night long ago oogno ho ho ho to see them pray to us agmar when we were beggars did we not speak as beggars did we not whine as they was not our mien beggarly oogno we were the pride of our calling agmar then now that we are gods let us be as gods and not mock our worshippers ulf i think that the gods do mock their worshippers agmar the gods have never mocked us we are above all pinnacles that we have ever gazed at in dreams ulf i think that when man is high then most of all are the gods wont to mock him thief master i have been with those that know all and see all i have been with the thieves master they know me for one of the craft but they do not know me as being one of us agmar well well thief there is danger master there is great danger agmar you mean that they suspect we are men thief that they have long done master i mean that they will know it then we are lost agmar then they do not know it thief they do not know it yet but they will know it and we are lost agmar when will they know it thief three days ago they suspected us agmar more than you think suspected us but have any dared to say so thief no master agmar then forget your fears my thief thief two men went on dromedaries three days ago to see if the gods were still at marma agmar they went to marma thief yes three days ago oogno we are lost agmar they went three days ago thief yes on dromedaries agmar then they should be back today oogno we are lost thahn we are lost thief they must have seen the green jade idols sitting against the mountains they will say the gods are still at marma and we shall be burnt slag my master will yet devise a plan agmar slip away to some high place and look toward the desert and see how long we have to devise a plan slag my master will find a plan oogno he has taken us into a trap thahn his wisdom is our doom slag he will find a wise plan yet thief it is too late agmar it is too late thief the dromedary men are here oogno we are lost agmar be quiet i must think they all sit still citizens enter and prostrate themselves agmar sits deep in thought illanaun two holy pilgrims have gone to your sacred shrines wherein you were wont to sit before you left the mountains they return even now agmar they left us here and went to find the gods a fish once took a journey into a far country to find the sea illanaun most reverend deity their piety is so great that they have gone to worship even your shrines agmar i know these men that have great piety such men have often prayed to me before but their prayers are not acceptable they little love the gods their only care is their piety i know these pious ones they will say that the seven gods were still at marma they will lie and say that we were still at marma so shall they seem more pious than you all pretending that they alone have seen the gods fools shall believe them and share in their damnation oorander hush you anger the gods illanaun i am not sure who i anger oorander it may be they are the gods illanaun where are these men from marma citizen here are the dromedary men they are coming now illanaun the holy pilgrims from your shrine are come to worship you agmar the men are doubters how the gods hate the word doubt ever contaminated virtue let them be cast into prison and not besmirch your purity let them not enter here illanaun but oh most reverend deity from the mountain we also doubt most reverend deity agmar you have chosen you have chosen and yet it is not too late repent and cast these men into prison and it may not be too late the gods have never wept and yet when they think upon damnation and the dooms that are withering a myriad bones

plan my master you have a plan agmar not yet slag illanaun these are the men that went to the shrines at marma oorander were the gods of the mountain seated still at marma or were they not there

idols of green jade were still seated there oogno we are saved now thahn ay we are saved agmar we are saved but i know not how oogno never had beggars such a time thief i will go out and watch ulf yet i have a fear oogno a fear why we are saved ulf last night i dreamed oogno what was your dream ulf it was nothing i dreamed that i was thirsty and one gave me woldery wine yet there was a fear in my dream thahn when i drink woldery i am afraid of nothing thief they are making a pleasant banquet ready for us they are killing lambs and girls are there with fruits and there is to be much woldery

before agmar and abases his forehead man master we implore you the people beseech you agmar and the beggars in the attitude of the gods sit silent man master it is terrible the beggars maintain silence it is terrible when you wander in the evening it is terrible on the edge of the desert in the evening children die when they see you agmar in the desert when did you see us man last night master you were terrible last night you were terrible in the gloaming when your hands were stretched out and groping you were feeling for the city agmar last night do you say man you were terrible in the gloaming agmar you yourself saw us man yes master you were terrible children too saw you and they died agmar you say you saw us man yes master not as you are now but otherwise we implore you master not to wander at evening you are terrible in the gloaming you are agmar you say we appeared not as we now are how did we appear to you man otherwise master otherwise agmar but how did we appear to you man you were all green master all green in the gloaming all of rock again as you used to be in the mountains master we can bear to see you in flesh like men but when we see rock walking it is terrible it is terrible agmar that is how we appeared to you man yes master rock should not walk when children see it they do not understand rock should not walk in the evening agmar there have been doubters of late are they satisfied man master they are terrified spare us master agmar it is wrong to doubt go and be faithful slag what have they seen master agmar they have seen their own fears dancing in the desert they have seen something green after the light was gone and some child has told them a tale that it was us i do not know what they have seen what should they have seen ulf something was coming this way from the desert he said slag what should come from the desert agmar they are a foolish people ulf that mans white face has seen some frightful thing agmar it is only we that have frightened them and their fears have made them foolish enter an attendant with a torch or lantern which he places in a receptacle exit thahn now we shall see the faces of the girls when they come to the banquet mlan never had beggars such a time agmar hark they are coming i hear footsteps thahn the dancing girls they are coming thief there is no sound of flutes they said they would come with music oogno what heavy boots they have they sound like feet of stone thahn i do not like to hear their heavy tread those that would dance to us must be light of foot agmar i shall not smile at them if they are not airy mlan they are coming very slowly they should come nimbly to us ulf i have a fear an old fear and a boding we have done ill in the sight of the seven gods beggars we were and

a doomed city for my fear has seen calamity and has known an evil thing slag master agmar come come they listen no one speaks the stony boots come on enter in single file through door in right of back a procession of seven green men even hands and faces are green they wear greenstone sandals they walk with knees extremely wide apart as having sat crosslegged for centuries their right arms and right forefingers point upward right elbows resting on right hands they stoop grotesquely halfway to the footlights they left wheel they pass in front of the seven beggars now in terrified attitudes and six of them sit down in the attitude described with their backs to the audience the leader stands still stooping oogno the gods of the mountain agmar be still they are dazzled by the light they may not see us the leading green thing points his finger at the lantern the flame turns green when the six are seated the leader points one by one at each of the seven beggars shooting out his forefinger at them as he does this each beggar in his turn gathers himself back on to his throne and crosses his legs his right arm goes stiffly upward with forefinger erect and a staring look of horror comes into his eyes in this attitude the beggars sit motionless while a green light falls upon their faces the gods go out presently enter the citizens some with victuals and fruit one touches a beggars arm and then anothers citizen they are cold they have turned to stone one we have doubted them we have doubted them they have turned to stone because we have doubted them another they were the true gods all they were the true gods
