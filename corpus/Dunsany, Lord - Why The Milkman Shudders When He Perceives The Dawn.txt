 why the milkman shudders when he perceives the dawn by lord dunsany in the hall of the ancient company of milkmen round the great fireplace at the end when the winter logs are burning and all the craft are assembled they tell today as their grandfathers told before them why the milkman shudders when he perceives the dawn when dawn comes creeping over the edges of hills peers through the treetrunks making wonderful shadows touches the tops of tall columns of smoke going up from awakening cottages in the valleys and breaks all golden over kentish fields when going on tiptoe thence it comes to the walls of london and slips all shyly up those gloomy streets the milkman perceives it and shudders a man may be a milkmans working apprentice may know what borax is and how to mix it yet not for that is the story told to him there are five men alone that tell that story five men appointed by the master of the company by whom each place is filled as it falls vacant and if you do not hear it from one of them you hear the story from no one and so can never know why the milkman shudders when he perceives the dawn it is the way of one of these five men greybeards all and milkmen from infancy to rub his hands by the fire when the great logs burn and to settle himself more easily in his chair perhaps to sip some drink far other than milk then to look round to see that none are there to whom it would not be fitting the tale should be told and looking from face to face and seeing none but the men of the ancient company and questioning mutely the rest of the five with his eyes if some of the five be there and receiving their permission to cough and to tell the tale and a great hush falls in the hall of the ancient company and something about the shape of the roof and the rafters makes the tale resonant all down the hall so that the youngest hears it far away from the fire and knows and dreams of the day when perhaps he will tell himself why the milkman shudders when he perceives the dawn not as one tells some casual fact is it told nor is it commented on from man to man but it is told by that great fire only and when the occasion and the stillness of the room and the merit of the wine and the profit of all seem to warrant it in the opinion of the five deputed men then does one of them tell it as i have said not heralded by any master of ceremonies but as though it arose out of the warmth of the fire before which his knotted hands would chance to be not a thing learned by rote but told differently by each teller and differently according to his mood yet never has one of them dared to alter its salient points there is none so base among the company of milkmen the company of powderers for the face know of this story and have envied it the worthy company of chinbarbers and the company of whiskerers but none have heard it in the milkmens hall through whose wall no rumour of the secret goes and though they have invented tales of their own antiquity mocks them this mellow story was ripe with honourable years when milkmen wore beaver hats its origin was still mysterious when smocks were the vogue men asked one another when stuarts were on the throne and only the ancient company knew the answer why the milkman shudders when he perceives the dawn it is all for envy of this tales reputation that the company of powderers for the face have invented the tale that they too tell of an evening why the dog barks when he hears the step of the baker and because probably all men know that tale the company of the powderers for the face have dared to consider it famous yet it lacks mystery and is not ancient is not fortified with classical allusion has no secret lore is common to all who care for an idle tale and shares with the wars of the elves the calfbutchers tale and the story of the unicorn and the rose which is the tale of the company of horsedrivers their obvious inferiority but unlike all these tales so new to time and many another that the last two centuries tell the tale that the milkmen tell ripples wisely on so full of quotation from the profoundest writers so full of recondite allusion so deeply tinged with all the wisdom of man and instructive with the experience of all times that they that hear it in the milkmens hall as they interpret allusion after allusion and trace obscure quotation lose idle curiosity and forget to question why the milkman shudders when he perceives the dawn you also o my reader give not yourself up to curiosity consider of how many it is the bane would you to gratify this tear away the mystery from the milkmens hall and wrong the ancient company of milkmen would they if all the world knew it and it became a common thing to tell that tale any more that they have told for the last four hundred years rather a silence would settle upon their hall and a universal regret for the ancient tale and the ancient winter evenings and though curiosity were a proper consideration yet even then this is not the proper place nor this the proper occasion for the tale for the proper place is only the milkmens hall and the proper occasion only when logs burn well and when wine has been deeply drunken then when the candles were burning well in long rows down to the dimness down to the darkness and mystery that lie at the end of the hall then were you one of the company and were i one of the five would i rise from my seat by the fireside and tell you with all the embellishments that it has gleaned from the ages that story that is the heirloom of the milkmen and the long candles would burn lower and lower and gutter and gutter away till they liquefied in their sockets and draughts would blow from the shadowy end of the hall stronger and stronger till the shadows came after them and still i would hold you with that treasured story not by any wit of mine but all for the sake of its glamour and the times out of which it came one by one the candles would flare and die and when all were gone by the light of ominous sparks when each milkmans face looks fearful to his fellow you would know as now you cannot why the milkman shudders when he perceives the dawn
