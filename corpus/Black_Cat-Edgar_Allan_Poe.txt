 you are not going to believe this story but it is a true story as true as i sit here writing it as true as i will die in the morning yes this story ends with my end with my death tomorrow i have always been a kind and loving person everyone will tell you this they will also tell you that i have always loved animals more than anything when i was a little boy my family always had many different animals round the house as i grew up i spent most of my time with them giving them their food and cleaning them i married when i was very young and i was happy to find that my wife loved all of our animal friends as much as i did she bought us the most beautiful animals we had all sorts of birds gold fish a fine dog and a cat the cat was a very large and beautiful animal he was black black all over and very intelligent he was so intelligent that my wife often laughed about what some people believe some people believe that all black cats are evil enemies in a cats body pluto this was the cats name was my favourite it was always i who gave him his food and he followed me everywhere i often had to stop him from following me through the streets for years he and i lived happily together the best of friends but during those years i was slowly changing it was that evil enemy of man called drink who was changing me i was not the kind loving person people knew before i grew more and more selfish i was often suddenly angry about unimportant things i began to use bad language most of all with my wife i even hit her sometimes and by that time of course i was often doing horrible things to our animals i hit all of them but never pluto but my illness was getting worse oh yes drink is an illness soon i began to hurt my dear pluto too i remember that night very well i came home late full of drink again i could not understand why pluto was not pleased to see me the cat was staying away from me my pluto did not want to come near me i caught him and picked him up holding him strongly he was afraid of me and bit my hand suddenly i was not myself any more someone else was in my body someone evil and mad with drink i took my knife from my pocket held the poor animal by his neck and cut out one of his eyes the next morning my mind was full of pain and horror when i woke up i was deeply sorry i could not understand how i could do such an evil thing but drink soon helped me to forget slowly the cat got better soon he felt no more pain there was now only an ugly dry hole where the eye once was he began to go round the house as usual again he never came near me now of course and he ran away when i went too close i knew he didnt love me anymore at first i was sad then slowly i started to feel angry and i did another terrible thing i had to do it i could not stop myself i did it with a terrible sadness in my heart because i knew it was evil and that was why i did it yes i did it because i knew it was evil what did i do i caught the cat and hung him by his neck from a tree until he was dead that night i woke up suddenly my bed was on fire i heard people outside shouting fire fire our house was burning i my wife and our servant were lucky to escape we stood and watched as the house burned down to the ground there was nothing left of the building the next morning all the walls fell down during the night except one a wall in the middle of the house i realized why this wall did not burn because there was new plaster on it the plaster was still quite wet i was surprised to see a crowd of people next to the wall they were talking and seemed to be quite excited i went closer and looked over their shoulders i saw a black shape in the new white plaster it was the shape of large cat hanging by its neck i looked at the shape with complete horror several minutes passed before i could think clearly again i knew i had to try to think clearly i had to know why it was there i remembered hanging the cat in the garden of the house next door during the fire the garden was full of people probably someone cut the dead cat from the tree and threw it through the window to try and wake me the falling walls pressed the animals body into the fresh plaster the cat burned completely leaving the black shape in the new plaster yes i was sure that was what happened but i could not forget that black shape for months i even saw it in my dreams i began to feel sad about losing the animal so i began to look for another one i looked mostly in the poor parts of our town where i went drinking i searched for another black cat of the same size and type as pluto one night as i sat in a dark and dirty drinkinghouse i noticed a black object on top of a cupboard near some bottles of wine i was surprised when i saw it i looked at those bottles a few minutes ago i thought and i am sure that object was not there before i got up and went to see what it was i put my hand up touched it and found that it was a black cat a very large one as large as pluto he looked like pluto too in every way but one pluto did not have a white hair anywhere on his body this cat had a large white shape on his front he got up when i touched him and pressed the side of his head against my hand several times he liked me this was the animal i was looking for he continued to be very friendly and later when i left he followed me into the street he came all the way home with me we now had another house and came inside he immediately jumped up on to the most comfortable chair and went to sleep he stayed with us of course he loved both of us and very soon he became my wifes favourite animal but as the weeks passed i began to dislike the animal more and more i do not know why but i hated the way he loved me soon i began to hate him but i was never unkind to him yes i was very careful about that i kept away from him because i remembered what i did to my poor pluto i also hated the animal because he only had one eye i noticed this the morning after he came home with me of course this only made my dear wife love him more but the more i hated the cat the more he seemed to love me he followed me everywhere getting under my feet all the time when i sat down he always sat under my chair often he tried to jump up on my knees i wanted to murder him when he did this but i did not i stopped myself because i remembered pluto but also because i was afraid of the animal how can i explain this fear it was not really a fear of something evil but then how else can i possibly describe it slowly this strange fear grew into horror yes horror if i tell you why you will not believe me you will think i am mad several times my wife took the cat and showed me the white shape on his chest she said the shape was slowly changing for a long time i did not believe her but slowly after many weeks i began to see that she was right the shape was changing its sides were becoming straighter and straighter it was beginning to look more and more like an object after a few more weeks i saw what the shape was it was impossible not to see there on his front was the shape of an object i am almost too afraid to name it there on the cats front was the shape of that terrible machine of pain and death the gallows it was that terrible machine of pain and death yes the gallows i no longer knew the meaning of happiness or rest during the day the animal never left me at night he woke me up nearly every hour i remember waking from terrible dreams and feeling him sitting next to my face his heavy body pressing down on my heart i was now a very different man there was not the smallest piece of good left in me i now had only evil thoughts the darkest and the most evil thoughts i hated everyone and everything my dear wife too one day she came down into the cellar with me to cut some wood we were now too poor to have a servant of course the cat followed me down the stairs and nearly made me fall this made me so angry that i took the axe and tried to cut the animal in two but as i brought the axe down my wife stopped my arm with her hand this made me even more angry and i pulled her hand away from my wrist lifted the tool again brought it down hard and buried it in the top of her head i had to hide the body i knew i could not take it out of the house the neighbours noticed everything i thought of cutting it into pieces and burning it i thought of burying it in the floor of the cellar i thought of throwing it into the river at the end of the garden i thought of putting it into a wooden box and taking it out of the house that way in the end i decided to hide the body in one of the walls of the cellar it was quite an old building near the river so the walls of the cellar were quite wet and the plaster was soft there was new plaster on one of the walls and i knew that underneath it the wall was not very strong i also knew that this wall was very thick i could hide the body in the middle of it it was not difficult i took off some plaster took out a few stones and made a hole in the earth that filled the middle of the wall i put my wife there put back the stones made some new plaster and put it on the wall then i cleaned the floor and looked carefully round everything looked just as it did before nobody would ever know next i went upstairs to kill the cat the animal was bringing me bad luck i had to kill it i searched everywhere but i could not find him i was sure it was because of my wifes murder he was too clever to come near me now i waited all evening but i did not see the evil animal he did not come back during the night either and so for the first time in a long time i slept well when i woke up the next morning i was surprised to see that the cat still was not there two three days passed and there was still no cat i cannot tell you how happy i began to feel i felt so much better without the cat yes it was he who brought me all my unhappiness and now without him i began to feel like a free man again it was wonderful no more cat never again several people came and asked about my wife but i answered their questions easily then on the fourth day the police came i was not worried when they searched the house they asked me to come with them as they searched they looked everywhere several times then they went down into the cellar i went down with them of course i was not a bit afraid i walked calmly up and down watching them search they found nothing of course and soon they were ready to go i was so happy that i could not stop talking as they went up the stairs i did not really know what i was saying good day to you all dear sirs i said yes this is a wellbuilt old house isnt it yes a very wellbuilt old house these walls are you going gentlemen these walls are strong arent they i knocked hard on the part of the wall where my wife was a voice came from inside the wall in answer to my knock it was a cry like a childs quickly it grew into a long scream of pain and horror i saw the policemen standing on the stairs with their mouths open suddenly they all ran down in a great hurry and began breaking down the wall it fell quickly and there was my wife standing inside there she was with dried blood all over her head looking at them and there was the cat standing on her head his red mouth wide open in a scream and his one gold eye shining like fire the clever animal my wife was dead because of him and now his evil voice was sending me to the gallows the end
