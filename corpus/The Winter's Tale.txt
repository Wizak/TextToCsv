that he did stay camillo at the good queens entreaty leontes at the queens bet good should be pertinent but so it is it is not was this taken by any understanding pate but thine for thy conceit is soaking will draw in more than the common blocks not noted ist but of the finer natures by some severals of headpiece extraordinary lower messes perchance are to this business purblind say camillo business my lord i think most understand bohemia stays here longer leontes ha camillo stays here longer leontes ay but why camillo to satisfy your highness and the entreaties of our most gracious mistress leontes satisfy th entreaties of your mistress satisfy let that suffice i have trusted thee camillo with all the nearest things to my heart as well my chambercouncils wherein priestlike thou hast cleansd my bosom i from thee departed thy penitent reformd but we have been deceivd in thy integrity deceivd in that which seems so camillo be it forbid my lord leontes to bide upont thou art not honest or if thou inclinst that way thou art a coward which hoxes honesty behind restraining from course requird or else thou must be counted a servant grafted in my serious trust and therein negligent or else a fool that seest a game playd home the rich stake drawn and takst it all for jest camillo my gracious lord i may be negligent foolish and fearful in every one of these no man is free but that his negligence his folly fear among the infinite doings of the world sometime puts forth in your affairs my lord if ever i were wilfulnegligent it was my folly if industriously i playd the fool it was my negligence not weighing well the end if ever fearful to do a thing where i the issue doubted whereof the execution did cry out against the nonperformance twas a fear which oft affects the wisest these my lord are such allowd infirmities that honesty is never free of but beseech your grace be plainer with me let me know my trespass by its own visage if i then deny it tis none of mine leontes have not you seen camillo but thats past doubt you have or your eyeglass is thicker than a cuckolds horn or heard for to a vision so apparent rumour cannot be mute or thought for cogitation resides not in that man that does not think it my wife is slippery if thou wilt confess or else be impudently negative to have nor eyes nor ears nor thought then say my wifes a hobbyhorse deserves a name as rank as any flaxwench that puts to before her trothplight sayt and justifyt camillo i would not be a standerby to hear my sovereign mistress clouded so without my present vengeance taken shrew my heart you never spoke what did become you less than this which to reiterate were sin as deep as that though true leontes is whispering nothing is leaning cheek to cheek is meeting noses kissing with inside lip stopping the career of laughter with a sigh a note infallible of breaking honesty horsing foot on foot skulking in corners wishing clocks more swift hours minutes noon midnight and all eyes blind with the pin and web but theirs theirs only that would unseen be wicked is this nothing why then the world and all thats int is nothing the covering sky is nothing bohemia nothing my is nothing nor nothing have these nothings if this be nothing camillo good my lord be curd of this diseasd opinion and betimes for tis most dangerous leontes say it be tis true camillo no no my lord leontes it is you lie you lie i say thou liest camillo and i hate thee pronounce thee a gross lout a mindless slave or else a hovering temporizer that canst with thine eyes at once see good and evil inclining to them both were my wifes liver infected as her life she would not live the running of one glass camillo who does infect her leontes why he that wears her like her medal hanging about his neck bohemia who if i had servants true about me that bare eyes to see alike mine honour as their profits their own particular thrifts they would do that which should undo more doing ay and thou his cupbearer whom i from meaner form have benchd and reard to worship who mayst see plainly as heaven sees earth and earth sees heaven how i am galled mightst bespice a cup to give mine enemy a lasting wink which draught to me were cordial camillo sir my lord i could do this and that with no rash potion but with a lingring dram that should not work maliciously like poison but i cannot believe this crack to be in my dread mistress so sovereignly being honourable i have lovd thee leontes make that thy question and go rot dost think i am so muddy so unsettled to appoint myself in this vexation sully the purity and whiteness of my sheets which to preserve is sleep which being spotted is goads thorns nettles tails of wasps give scandal to the blood o the prince my son who i do think is mine and love as mine without ripe moving tot would i do this could man so blench camillo i must believe you sir i do and will fetch off bohemia fort provided that when hes removd your highness will take again your queen as yours at first even for your sons sake and thereby for sealing the injury of tongues in courts and kingdoms known and allied to yours leontes thou dost advise me even so as i mine own course have set down ill give no blemish to her honour none camillo my lord go then and with a countenance as clear as friendship wears at feasts keep with bohemia and with your queen i am his cupbearer if from me he have wholesome beverage account me not your servant leontes this is all dot and thou hast the onehalf of my heart dot not thou splittst thine own camillo ill dot my lord leontes i will seem friendly as thou hast advisd me exit camillo o miserable lady but for me what case stand i in i must be the poisoner of good polixenes and my ground to dot is the obedience to a master one who in rebellion with himself will have all that are his so too to do this deed promotion follows if i could find example of thousands that had struck anointed kings and flourishd after id not dot but since nor brass nor stone nor parchment bears not one let villainy itself forsweart i must forsake the court to dot or no is certain to me a breakneck happy star reign now here comes bohemia enter polixenes polixenes this is strange methinks my favour here begins to warp not speak goodday camillo camillo hail most royal sir polixenes what is the news i the court camillo none rare my lord polixenes the king hath on him such a countenance as he had lost some province and a region lovd as he loves himself even now i met him with customary compliment when he wafting his eyes to the contrary and falling a lip of much contempt speeds from me so leaves me to consider what is breeding that changes thus his manners camillo i dare not know my lord polixenes how dare not do not do you know and dare not be intelligent to me tis thereabouts for to yourself what you do know you must and cannot say you dare not good camillo your changd complexions are to me a mirror which shows me mine changd too for i must be a party in this alteration finding myself thus alterd witht camillo there is a sickness which puts some of us in distemper but i cannot name the disease and it is caught of you that yet are well polixenes how caught of me make me not sighted like the basilisk i have lookd on thousands who have sped the better by my regard but killd none so camillo as you are certainly a gentleman thereto clerklike experiencd which no less adorns our gentry than our parents noble names in whose success we are gentle i beseech you if you know aught which does behove my knowledge thereof to be informd imprisont not in ignorant concealment camillo i may not answer polixenes a sickness caught of me and yet i well i must be answerd dost thou hear camillo i conjure thee by all the parts of man which honour does acknowledge whereof the least is not this suit of mine that thou declare what incidency thou dost guess of harm is creeping toward me how far off how near which way to be prevented if to be if not how best to bear it camillo sir i will tell you since i am chargd in honour and by him that i think honourable therefore mark my counsel which must be evn as swiftly followd as i mean to utter it or both yourself and me cry lost and so goodnight polixenes on good camillo camillo i am appointed him to murder you polixenes by whom camillo camillo by the king polixenes for what camillo he thinks nay with all confidence he swears as he had seent or been an instrument to vice you tot that you have touchd his queen forbiddenly polixenes o then my best blood turn to an infected jelly and my name be yokd with his that did betray the best turn then my freshest reputation to a savour that may strike the dullest nostril where i arrive and my approach be shunnd nay hated too worse than the greatst infection that eer was heard or read camillo swear his thought over by each particular star in heaven and by all their influences you may as well forbid the sea for to obey the moon as or by oath remove or counsel shake the fabric of his folly whose foundation is pild upon his faith and will continue the standing of his body polixenes how should this grow camillo i know not but i am sure tis safer to avoid whats grown than question how tis born if therefore you dare trust my honesty that lies enclosd in this trunk which you shall bear along impawnd away tonight your followers i will whisper to the business and will by twos and threes at several posterns clear them o the city for myself ill put my fortunes to your service which are here by this discovery lost be not uncertain for by the honour of my parents i have utterd truth which if you seek to prove i dare not stand by nor shall you be safer than one condemnd by the kings own mouth thereon his execution sworn polixenes i do believe thee i saw his heart in his face give me thy hand be pilot to me and thy places shall still neighbour mine my ships are ready and my people did expect my hence departure two days ago this jealousy is for a precious creature as shes rare must it be great and as his persons mighty must it be violent and as he does conceive he is dishonourd by a man which ever professd to him why his revenges must in that be made more bitter fear oershades me good expedition be my friend and comfort the gracious queen part of this theme but nothing of his

being so blest there may be in the cup a spider steepd and one may drink depart and yet partake no venom for his knowledge is not infected but if one present the abhorrd ingredient to his eye make known how he hath drunk he cracks his gorge his sides with violent hefts i have drunk and seen the spider camillo was his help in this his pander there is a plot against my life my crown alls true that is mistrusted that false villain whom i employd was preemployd by him he has discoverd my design and i remain a pinchd thing yea a very trick for them to play at will how came the posterns so

my lords look on her mark her well be but about to say she is a goodly lady and the justice of your hearts will thereto add tis pity shes not honest honourable praise her but for this her withoutdoor form which on my faith deserves high speech and straight the shrug the hum or ha these petty brands that calumny doth use o i am out that mercy does for calumny will sear virtue itself these shrugs these hums and has when you have said shes goodly come between ere you can say shes honest but be it known from him that has most cause to grieve it should be shes an adultress hermione should a villain say so the most replenishd villain in the world he were as much more villain you my lord do but mistake leontes you have mistook my lady polixenes for leontes o thou thing which ill not call a creature of thy place lest barbarism making me the precedent should a like language use to all degrees and mannerly distinguishment leave out betwixt the prince and beggar i have said shes an adultress i have said with whom more shes a traitor and camillo is a federary with her and one that knows what she should shame to know herself but with her most vile principal that shes a bedswerver even as bad as those that vulgars give boldest titles ay and privy to this their late escape hermione no by my life privy to none of this how will this grieve you when you shall come to clearer knowledge that you thus have publishd me gentle my lord you scarce can right me throughly then to say you did mistake leontes no if i mistake in those foundations which i build upon the centre is not big enough to bear a schoolboys top away with her to prison he who shall speak for her is afar off guilty but that he speaks hermione theres some ill planet reigns i must be patient till the heavens look with an aspct more favourable good my lords i am not prone to weeping as our sex commonly are the want of which vain dew perchance shall dry your pities but i have that honourable grief lodgd here which burns worse than tears drown beseech you all my lords with thoughts so qualified as your charities shall best instruct you measure me and so the kings will be performd leontes to the guard shall i be heard hermione who ist that goes with me beseech your highness my women may be with me for you see my plight requires it do not weep good fools there is no cause when you shall know your

antigonus if it be so we need no grave to bury honesty theres not a grain of it the face to sweeten of the whole dungy earth leontes what lack i credit first lord i had rather you did lack than i my lord upon this ground and more it would content me to have her honour true than your suspicion be blamd fort how you might leontes why what need we commune with you of this but rather follow our

yourselves we need no more of your advice the matter the loss the gain the ordring ont is all properly ours antigonus and i wish my liege you had only in your silent judgment tried it without more overture leontes how could that be either thou art most ignorant by age or thou wert born a fool camillos flight added to their familiarity which was as gross as ever touchd conjecture that lackd sight only nought for approbation but only seeing all other circumstances made up to th deed doth push on this proceeding yet for a greater confirmation for in an act of this importance twere most piteous to be wild i have despatchd in post to sacred delphos to apollos temple cleomenes and dion whom you know of stuffd sufficiency now from the oracle they will bring all whose spiritual counsel had shall stop or spur me have i done well first lord well done my lord leontes though i am satisfied and need no more than what i know yet shall the oracle give rest to the minds of others such as he whose ignorant credulity will not come up to th truth so have we thought it good from our free person she should be confind lest that the treachery of the two fled hence be left her to perform come

become a lady like me with a love even such so and no other as yourself commanded which not to have done i think had been in me both disobedience and ingratitude to you and toward your friend whose love had spoke ever since it could speak from an infant freely that it was yours now for conspiracy i know not how it tastes though it be dishd for me to try how all i know of it is that camillo was an honest man and why he left your court the gods themselves wotting no more than i are ignorant leontes you knew of his departure as you know what you have undertaen to do in s absence hermione sir

that title and what shame else belongs tot to him will i present them there may be matter in it exit act v scene i sicilia a room in the palace of leontes enter leontes cleomenes dion paulina and others cleomenes sir you have done enough and have performd a saintlike sorrow no fault could you make which you have not redeemd indeed paid down more penitence than done trespass at the last do as the heavens have done forget your evil with them forgive yourself leontes whilst i remember her and her virtues i cannot forget my blemishes in them and so still think of the wrong i did myself which was so much that heirless it hath made my kingdom and destroyd the sweetst companion that eer man bred his hopes out of paulina true too true my lord if one by one you wedded all the world or from the all that are took something good to make a perfect woman she you killd would be unparalleld leontes i think so killd she i killd i did so but thou strikst me sorely to say i did it is as bitter upon thy tongue as in my thought now good now say so but seldom cleomenes not at all good lady you might have spoken a thousand things that would have done the time more benefit and gracd your kindness better paulina you are one of those would have him wed again dion if you would not so you pity not the state nor the remembrance of his most sovereign name consider little what dangers by his highness fail of issue may drop upon his kingdom and devour incertain lookerson what were more holy than to rejoice the former queen is well what holier than for royaltys repair for present comfort and for future good to bless the bed of majesty again with a sweet fellow tot paulina there is none worthy respecting her thats gone besides the gods will have fulfilld their secret purposes for has not the divine apollo said ist not the tenour of his oracle that king leontes shall not have an heir till his lost child be found which that it shall is all as monstrous to our human reason as my antigonus to break his grave and come again to me who on my life did perish with the infant tis your counsel my lord should to the heavens be contrary oppose against their wills to leontes care not for issue the crown will find an heir great alexander left his to the worthiest so his successor was like to be the best leontes good paulina who hast the memory of hermione i know in honour o that ever i had squard me to thy counsel then even now i might have lookd upon my queens full eyes have taken treasure from her lips paulina and left them more rich for what they yielded leontes thou speakst truth no more such wives therefore no wife one worse and better usd would make her sainted spirit again possess her corpse and on this stage where we offend her now appear soulvexed and begin why to me paulina had she such power she had just cause leontes she had and would incense me to murder her i married paulina i should so were i the ghost that walkd id bid you mark her eye and tell me for what dull part int you chose her then id shriek that even your ears should rift to hear me and the words that followd should be remember mine leontes stars stars and all eyes else dead coals fear thou no wife ill have no wife paulina paulina will you swear never to marry but by my free leave leontes never paulina so be blessd my spirit paulina then good my lords bear witness to his oath cleomenes you tempt him overmuch paulina unless another as like hermione as is her picture affront his eye cleomenes good madam paulina i have done yet if my lord will marry if you will sir no remedy but you will give me the office to choose you a queen she shall not be so young as was your former but she shall be such as walkd your first queens ghost it should take joy to see her in your arms leontes my true paulina we shall not marry till thou biddst us paulina that shall be when your first queens again in breath never till then enter a gentleman gentleman one that gives out himself prince florizel son of polixenes with his princess she the fairest i have yet beheld desires access to your high presence leontes what with him he comes not like to his fathers greatness his approach so out of circumstance and sudden tells us tis not a visitation framd but forcd by need and accident what train gentleman but few and those but mean leontes his princess say you with him gentleman ay the most peerless piece of earth i think that eer the sun shone bright on paulina o hermione as every present time doth boast itself above a better gone so must thy grave give way to whats seen now sir you yourself have said and writ so but your writing now is colder than that theme she had not been nor was not to be equalld thus your verse flowd with her beauty once tis shrewdly ebbd to say you have seen a better gentleman pardon madam the one i have almost forgot your pardon the other when she has obtaind your eye will have your tongue too this is a creature would she begin a sect might quench the zeal of all professors else make proselytes of who she but bid follow paulina how not women gentleman women will love her that she is a woman more worth than any man men that she is the rarest of all women leontes go cleomenes yourself assisted with your honourd friends bring them to our embracement exeunt cleomenes lords and gent still tis strange he thus should steal upon us paulina had our prince jewel of children seen this hour he had paird well with this lord there was not full a month between their births leontes prythee no more cease thou knowst he dies to me again when talkd of sure when i shall see this gentleman thy speeches will bring me to consider that which may unfurnish me of reason they are come reenter cleomenes with florizel perdita and attendants your mother was most true to wedlock prince for she did print your royal father off conceiving you were i but twentyone your fathers image is so hit in you his very air that i should call you brother as i did him and speak of something wildly by us performd before most dearly welcome and your fair princess goddess o alas i lost a couple that twixt heaven and earth might thus have stood begetting wonder as you gracious couple do and then i lost all mine own folly the society amity too of your brave father whom though bearing misery i desire my life once more to look on him florizel by his command have i here touchd sicilia and from him give you all greetings that a king at friend can send his brother and but infirmity which waits upon worn times hath something seizd his wishd ability he had himself the lands and waters twixt your throne and his measurd to look upon you whom he loves he bade me say so more than all the sceptres and those that bear them living leontes o my brother good gentleman the wrongs i have done thee stir afresh within me and these thy offices so rarely kind are as interpreters of my behindhand slackness welcome hither as is the spring to the earth and hath he too exposd this paragon to the fearful usage at least ungentle of the dreadful neptune to greet a man not worth her pains much less the adventure of her person florizel good my lord she came from libya leontes where the warlike smalus that noble honourd lord is feard and lovd florizel most royal sir from thence from him whose daughter his tears proclaimd his parting with her thence a prosperous southwind friendly

sir but my arrival and my wifes in safety here where we are leontes the blessd gods purge all infection from our air whilst you do climate here you have a holy father a graceful gentleman against whose person so sacred as it is i have done sin for which the heavens taking angry note have left me issueless and your fathers blessd as he from heaven merits it with you worthy his goodness what might i have been might i a son and daughter now have lookd on such goodly things as you enter a lord lord most noble sir that which i shall report will bear no credit were not the proof so nigh please you great sir bohemia greets you from himself by me desires you to attach his son who has his dignity and duty both cast off fled from his father from his hopes and with a shepherds daughter leontes wheres bohemia speak lord here in your city i now came from him i speak amazedly and it becomes my marvel and my message to your court whiles he was hastning in the chase it seems of this fair couple meets he on the way the father of this seeming lady and her brother having both their country quitted with this young prince florizel camillo has betrayd me whose honour and whose honesty till now endurd all weathers lord layt so to his charge hes with the king your father leontes who camillo lord camillo sir i spake with him who now has these poor men in question never saw i wretches so quake they kneel they kiss the earth forswear themselves as often as they speak bohemia stops his ears and threatens them with divers deaths in death perdita o my poor father the heaven sets spies upon us will not have our contract celebrated leontes you are married florizel we are not sir nor are we like to be the stars i see will kiss the valleys first the odds for high and lows alike leontes my lord is this the daughter of a king florizel she is when once she is my wife leontes that once i see by your good fathers speed will come on very slowly i am sorry most sorry you have broken from his liking where you were tied in duty and as sorry your choice is not so rich in worth as beauty that you might well enjoy her florizel dear look up though fortune visible an enemy should chase us with my father power no jot hath she to change our loves beseech you sir remember since you owd no more to time than i do now with thought of such affections step forth mine advocate at your request my father will grant precious things as trifles leontes would he do so id beg your precious mistress which he counts but a trifle paulina sir my liege your eye hath too much youth int not a month fore your queen died she was more worth such gazes than what you look on now leontes i thought of her even in these looks i made to florizel but your petition is yet unanswerd i will to your father your honour not oerthrown by your desires i am friend to them and you upon which errand i now go toward him therefore follow me and mark what way i make come good my lord exeunt scene ii the same before the palace enter autolycus and a gentleman autolycus beseech you sir were you present at this relation first gentleman i was by at the opening of the fardel heard the old shepherd deliver the manner how he found it whereupon after a little amazedness we were all commanded out of the chamber only this methought i heard the shepherd say he found the child autolycus i would most gladly know the issue of it first gentleman i make a broken delivery of the business but the changes i perceived in the king and camillo were very notes of admiration they seemd almost with staring on one another to tear the cases of their eyes there was speech in their dumbness language in their very gesture they looked as they had heard of a world ransomed or one destroyed a notable passion of wonder appeared in them but the wisest beholder that knew no more but seeing could not say if the importance were joy or sorrow but in the extremity of the one it must needs be here comes a gentleman that happily knows more enter a gentleman the news rogero second gentleman nothing but bonfires the oracle is fulfilled the kings daughter is found such a deal of wonder is broken out within this hour that balladmakers cannot be able to express it here comes the lady paulinas steward he can deliver you more enter a third gentleman how goes it now sir this news which is called true is so like an old tale that the verity of it is in strong suspicion has the king found his heir third gentleman most true if ever truth were pregnant by circumstance that which you hear youll swear you see there is such unity in the proofs the mantle of queen hermione her jewel about the neck of it the letters of antigonus found with it which they know to be his character the majesty of the creature in resemblance of the mother the affection of nobleness which nature shows above her breeding and many other evidences proclaim her with all certainty to be the kings daughter did you see the meeting of the two kings second gentleman no third gentleman then you have lost a sight which was to be seen cannot be spoken of there might you have beheld one joy crown another so and in such manner that it seemed sorrow wept to take leave of them for their joy waded in tears there was casting up of eyes holding up of hands with countenance of such distraction that they were to be known by garment not by favour our king being ready to leap out of himself for joy of his found daughter as if that joy were now become a loss cries o thy mother thy mother then asks bohemia forgiveness then embraces his soninlaw then again worries he his daughter with clipping her now he thanks the old shepherd which stands by like a weatherbitten conduit of many kings reigns i never heard of such another encounter which lames report to follow it and undoes description to do it second gentleman what pray you became of antigonus that carried hence the child third gentleman like an old tale still which will have matter to rehearse though credit be asleep and not an ear open he was torn to pieces with a bear this avouches the shepherds son who has not only his innocence which seems much to justify him but a handkerchief and rings of his that paulina knows first gentleman what became of his bark and his followers third gentleman wrecked the same instant of their masters death and in the view of the shepherd so that all the instruments which aided to expose the child were even then lost when it was found but o the noble combat that twixt joy and sorrow was fought in paulina she had one eye declined for the loss of her husband another elevated that the oracle was fulfilled she lifted the princess from the earth and so locks her in embracing as if she would pin her to her heart that she might no more be in danger of losing first gentleman the dignity of this act was worth the audience of kings and princes for by such was it acted third gentleman one of the prettiest touches of all and that which angled for mine eyes caught the water though not the fish was when at the relation of the queens death with the manner how she came to it bravely confessed and lamented by the king how attentivenes wounded his daughter till from one sign of dolour to another she did with an alas i would fain say bleed tears for i am sure my heart wept blood who was most marble there changed colour some swooned all sorrowed if all the world could have seen it the woe had been universal first gentleman are they returned to the court third gentleman no the princess hearing of her mothers statue which is in the keeping of paulina a piece many years in doing and now newly performed by that rare italian master julio romano who had he himself eternity and could put breath into his work would beguile nature of her custom so perfectly he is her ape he so near to hermione hath done hermione that they say one would speak to her and stand in hope of answer thither with all greediness of affection are they gone and there they intend to sup second gentleman i thought she had some great matter there in hand for she hath privately twice or thrice a day ever since the death of hermione visited that removed house shall we thither and with our company piece the rejoicing first gentleman who would be thence that has the benefit of access every wink of an eye some new grace will be born our absence makes us unthrifty to our knowledge lets along exeunt gentlemen autolycus now had i not the dash of my former life in me would preferment drop on my head i brought the old man and his son aboard the prince told him i heard them talk of a fardel and i know not what but he at that time overfond of the shepherds daughter so he then took her to be who began to be much seasick and himself little better extremity of weather continuing this mystery remained undiscoverd but tis all one to me for had i been the finderout of this secret it would not have relishd among my other discredits here come those i have done good to against my will and already appearing in the blossoms of their fortune enter shepherd and clown shepherd come boy i am past more children but thy sons and daughters will be all gentlemen born clown you are well met sir you denied to fight with me this other day because i was no gentleman born see you these clothes say you see them not and think me still no gentleman born you were best say these robes are not gentlemen born give me the lie do and try whether i am not now a gentleman born autolycus i know you are now sir a gentleman born clown ay and have been so any time these four hours shepherd and so have i boy clown so you have but i was a gentleman born before my father for the kings son took me by the hand and called me brother and then the two kings called my father brother and then the prince my brother and the princess my sister called my father father and so we wept and there was the first gentlemanlike tears that ever we shed shepherd we may live son to shed many more clown ay or else twere hard luck being in so preposterous estate as we are autolycus i humbly beseech you sir to pardon me all the faults i have committed to your worship and to give me your good report to the prince my master shepherd prythee son do for we must be gentle now we are gentlemen clown thou wilt amend thy life autolycus ay an it like your good worship clown give me thy hand i will swear to the prince thou art as honest a true fellow as any is in bohemia shepherd you may say it but not swear it clown not swear it now i am a gentleman let boors and franklins say

and that thou wilt not be drunk but i know thou art no tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt be drunk but ill swear it and i would thou wouldst be a tall fellow of thy hands autolycus i will prove so sir to my power clown ay by any means prove a tall fellow if i do not wonder how thou darest venture to be drunk not being a tall fellow trust me not hark the kings and the princes our kindred are going to see the queens picture come follow us well be thy good masters exeunt scene iii the same a room in paulinas house enter leontes polixenes florizel perdita camillo paulina lords

honour you with trouble but we came to see the statue of our queen your gallery have we passd through not without much content in many singularities but we saw not that which my daughter came to look upon the statue of her mother paulina as she livd peerless so her dead likeness i do well believe excels whatever yet you lookd upon or hand of man hath done therefore i keep it lonely apart but here it is prepare to see the life as lively mockd as ever still sleep mockd death behold and say tis well paulina undraws a curtain and discovers hermione standing as a statue i like your silence it the
