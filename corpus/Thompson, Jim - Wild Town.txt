wild town by jim thompson copyright originally the place had been one of those oldtime cattle towns the kind you see throughout west and far west texas just another wide place in a dusty road a sunbaked huddle of falsefronted buildings with sheetiron awnings extending out to the curb then a guy with a haywire drilling rig had moved in a wildcatter and he optioned a lot of leases on his guarantee to drill and then he predicated the leases for high interest loans and what with one thing and another stealing begging kiting checks angling dry hole money from the big companies who wanted to see the area tested he managed to sink a well the well blew in for three thousand barrels of highgrade paraffinbase oil a day overnight the town bulged like a woman eight months gone with triplets a makedo type of woman say a tohellwithhowilook type for the demand for shelter was immediate and building materials were hard to come by out here in the shortgrass middle of nowhere not only that but it just isnt smart to put much money into boomtown property booms have a way of firzling out a lake of oil can go dry the same as any other kind of lake so practically all the new structures were temporary built as cheaply as possible and as quickly as possible shacks of wallboard and twobyfours roughplanked unfinished and unpainted sheds houses and these predominated in the makeshift jungle that were half frame and half canvas tenthouses they were called or more commonly raghouses and gnawed at by sulphur and saltspray they had the look of rags they stretched out across the prairie in every direction squatting and winding through the forest of derricks shabby dingy creaking with the everpresent wind senile while still in their nonage a city of rags spouting paradoxically on the very crest of great riches that was the general order of things the outstanding exception to it was the fourteenstory hanlon hotel built named after and owned in fee simple by the wildcatter who had brought in the discovery well most people regarded it as proof that all wildcatters are crazy their insanity increasing in proportion to their success they pointed to the fact that hanlon had been blasted out of his drilling rig by the first wild gush of oil and that the subsequent sixtyfoot fall had doubtless been as injurious to his brain as it was to his body they may have been right at that mike hanlon guessed that they might be sometimes when his head got to hurting but just as hed always been a hellforleather guy not giving a good goddamn for what he didnt give one now his wildcatting days were over death had claimed his legs and it was creeping slowly but implacably upward still hed wanted to stay near the oil his oil the oil that all the damned fools had said wasnt there and he wanted to live right for a change in something besides a crummy fleabag or cothouse so he built the hotel simply because he wanted to and because his money was certain to outlast his ability to want for the same reason he acquired a goodlooking wife marrying a gal who applied for a hostess job that she was something less than virginal he was sure male or female none but the sinners sought jobs in a ragtown hotel and joyce to give her name had probably wiggled further on her back than he had traveled on foot but what of it anyway shrugged mike hanlon he himself had slept with practically everything that couldnt outrun him such activities were denied him now by virtue of his accident but he saw not a reason in the world why she should share his deprivation just so long as she was decent about it careful it was okay with him just so long as she didnt cause talk make him look like a damned fool that was all he asked or expected of her that and of course looking pretty and being nice to him chewing the fat with him you know cracking a jug with him when he got the blues wheeling him around the hotel now and then so that he could see how much the goddamned thieves his employees were stealing from him mike was very much opposed to thieves and fortunately for them hed caught none redhanded yet having been a clever thief himself he knew the very serious danger they represented to men of property but getting back to joyce he expected little of her and asked less not even that she should occupy the same suite that he did and on a nottoodistant someday she would inherit everything he owned so he was sure that their arrangement would work out fine why wouldnt it he asked himself why shouldnt she be satisfied there was no reason that he could think of she was riding a good horse and she should have been content to stick with it for the distance but gradually he became aware that she wasnt not that she was guilty of any overt acts there was nothing he could put his finger on still he knew he had a hunch about her and with good reason he trusted his hunches he tried easing up on his already few demands that wasnt the answer he became more demanding clamping down hard in the dough department instinct his hunch told him that he still wasnt scoring he couldnt get at it somehow the impatience or sheer orneriness or whatever it was that was prodding her toward murder and no he simply couldnt kick her out or rather he couldnt do it without giving her a fiftyfifty split of his wealth their marriage contract so stipulated and the contract couldnt be broken if he divorced her fiftyfifty if she divorced him or otherwise separated herself from his place of domicile she was to receive nothing the dollar and other valuable considerations already paid over to be considered a full and equal half of the said mike hanlons estate well of course mike wasnt even about to buy his way off of the spot hed never done it before and he sure as hell wasnt going to begin at his age anyway anyway he thought bitterly she probably wouldnt go for half split she struck him as a wholehog player that little lady if he offered her less gave her reason to believe that she was going to get less she might drop the drill on him immediately so he rocked along worrying and wondering getting as jumpy as a bit on granite finally he made a hypothetical exposure of his problem to the chief deputy sheriff who practically speaking was the sheriff and all law in the county as well the interview was something less than reassuring the chief was west texas old family a guy named lou ford for a man who was almost perpetually smiling he was undoubtedly the most aggravating disconcerting sonofabitch of all the sonsofbitches hanlon had known well lets see now he drawled you say this fellows wife is out to get him but shes never done nothing against him so far and hes got no proof that she plans to so the question is what can he do about it i got the straight of it mr hanlon thats right ford frowned shrugged and shook his head with smiling helplessness let me ask you one mr hanlon if a bitch wolf can couple with a dog and a half in a day and a half how long does it take her to come in heat on a rainy morning huh whaat hanlon roared why you goddamned snooty bastard i wait come back here just as soon as i borry a gun ford promised on his way to the door dont never carry one myself a gun but but or maybe youd like to take back that bastard sure wish you would dont seem quite right somehow shootin a fella in a wheelchair there was a wistful note in his voice sudden death in his eyes he looked at hanlon smiling his gentle smile and an icy chifi ran up the wildcatters spine grudgingly he made an apology tacking on an insult at its end should have known you wouldnt do anything too damned busy taking graft aw mister hanlon the chief deputy appeared shocked you mean you dont think im honest mister hanlon think hell i know youre the bagman for that whole stinking courthouse crowd wouldnt surprise me a damned bit if you and her were in this deal together aw heck gosh all fishhooks gee willikers drawled ford and here weall thought we had you fooled you wont get away with it by god ill show you ill call in the texas rangers about what mister hanlon what are you goin to tell em well well dammit i told you i didnt hear nothing but a riddle myself didnt hear no complaint or nothing to make a complaint out of so all right dammit i cant make one she hasnt actually done anything to complain about but but there must be something he scowled at the deputy his voice trailing away helplessly ford shook his head in a grotesque mockery of sadness now it sure seems like there ought to be somethin to do dont it he said yes sir it sure does and thats a fact too bad im so dadblamed dumb get out said hanlon hoarsely you sure you want me to you wouldnt just like to laze around and swap riddles i said to get out well maybe i better lou ford nodded agreeably got a gambling house i aint shook down yet today he left rocking in his highheeled boots hanlon guessed that hed really made a mess of things that ford was a grafter he was positive but it had been stupid to say so these west texans were a breed apart prideful easily offended steadfast friends and the bitterest of enemies they were at once blunt and delicate of speech they had their own code of ethics their own standards of what was right and wrong unbendingly intolerant of some transgressions they blandly overlooked others that were nominally worse only recently for example a man had received a twoyear prison sentence for beating a horse in the same week a case of burglary was dismissed against a man who had broken into a liquor store he was broke you see and he had a godawful hangover that which as everyone knew there is nothing worse so he had broken into the store to get a drink because he really needed a drink you know and maybe it was kind of the wrong thing to do kind of against the law maybe but a fella that really needs a drink aint rightly responsible for what he does yea hanlon thought drearily i really botched things with ford i should have been extranice to him asked how he was feeling asked what he thought about the weather complimented him on everything i could think of bragged up him and his stinking ancestors clear back to the days of the spaniards if id done that if i hadnt hedged with him if id come right out in the open to begin with it wouldnt have made a damned bit of difference hanlon decided ford had been down on him before the interview all the regular preboom residents of the community were down on him theyd been swell to him when he first came here the most likable openhanded people hed ever known but then hed had to start cutting corners stretching the truth making promises that he didnt keep and hell they shouldnt have got sore about it they should have understood that it was just business and that every man has to look out for himself in a business deal but they didnt understand they didnt and they would have no part of apologies or explanations as far as they were concerned he didnt exist he was just a something that was beneath notice or contempt the stuckup stiffnecked highfaluting hanlon snatched up the whiskey decanter and shakily poured himself a huge drink he threw it down and poured another and gradually he began to calm a man cant stay in an uproar all the time he can worry just so much and then he has to stop a few days later joyce ushered a man named mckenna into his suite he was somewhere in his late thirties burly surlyfaced he had the kind of eyes that always look like theyve been crying he was applying for the job of house detective how about references hanlon asked whats your background what about your references mckenna said what did you do before you latched on to all this hanlon laughed sourly look kind of pale wouldnt have been cooped up somewhere would you you want a straight answer you better ask a straight question mckenna said roughly sure ive been in the pen five years for killing a boob and before that i did six months in jail for beating up my wife and before that i served two years in an army stockade for taking a shot at a general and well to hell with it and you too im not making any apologies or asking any favors so you can take your twobit job and easy said hanlon take it easy mckenna it was a trick of course no bona fide applicant for a job would be so brutally frank and deliberately unpleasant still the house dicks job was open and it would have to be filled and the next applicant what about him how could one be sure that he was simply after a job and not a life and and here was a hell of a note hanlon liked the guy yeah he actually liked this wifebeater and brigbird this man who had killed once and was doubtless all primed to kill again i dont mean to pry mr mckenna he said politely but where is your wife now i dont know immediately there was a subtle change in mckennas manner im no longer married to her sir well thats good i mean the house detective lives in here hes subject to call at all times and it doesnt work out very well for a married man but mckenna looked at him with a mixture of hope and suspicion you mean i get the job what else any reason why you shouldnt get it hanlon said and he laughed quietly to himself at himself as only a man can laugh when there is nothing else to do mckennas first name was david but he had been called bugs for practically as far back as he could remember it fitted the awkward lummox of a kid who though only ten years old was almost as big as his fifthgrade teacher it fitted the actions of the frightened child the selfdoubting insecure youth and the introverted defensively offensive man he seemed to have a positive knack for doing the right thing at the wrong time for distrusting his friends and trusting his enemies for being ridiculously uncompromising over the trifling and seemingly indifferent to the nominally vital the guy was just nuts people said as bugsy as they came he couldnt take a joke he didnt want to be friendly hed climb a tree to make trouble when he could stand on the ground and have peace thats what they said about him the man he eventually became and it was reasonably descriptive of that scowling sullen shorttempered man only his eyes belied the description angrily bewildered eyes eyes that seemed wet with unshed tears as perhaps they were when he finished his fiveyear prison stretch and he served every minute of it thanks to the outraged and insulted parole board bugs mckenna drifted into dallas he got a job as night dishwasher in a greasy spoon he spent most of his daytime hours in the public library it was a good way of keeping out of trouble he thought moreover it didnt cost anything and there was nothing that he would rather do well though there was a furtive look about him in the opinion of the librarian also as she pointed out to the police he couldnt possibly have any interest in the books he selected kafka schopenhauer addison and steele now really officers the cops asked bugs a few questions bugs responded with a wholly impossible suggestion involving their nightsticks and a certain part of their anatomy skip the details bugs got a rough roust out of dallas leaving town with new knots on his head and fresh bruises to his spirit walking through the outskirts of fort worth he saw a little girl fall offher tricycle he picked her up and dusted her off he hunkered down in front of her joking with her tenderly getting her to smile and a patrol car drifted into the curb bugs spent two weeks in the fort worth jail at weatherford the next town west he was jugged for three days in mineral wells he drew another three days of investigation he was spitting blood when he emerged from it but it hadnt softened him a bit his last words to the cop who escorted him to the city limits were of a type to curl the hair on a brass monkey still he knew he couldnt take much more not without a little rest anyway he had to get the hell away from the cities the heavily settled areas and do it fast or hed damned well be dead so he left the highways and took to the freights he stuck with them moving inconspicuously from freight to freight moving steadily westward and eventually he arrived at the place called ragtown that was about as far west as a man could go as anything but a jack rabbit or a tarantula would have reason for going thirty minutes after his arrival he was in jail it was partly his own fault he admitted reluctantly just a little his own fault having dropped off the freight he was in the station restroom washing up when a leatheryfaced middleaged man walked in a silver badge was clipped to his checked shirt he wore a gunbelt and an ivoryhandled fortyfive as he started to bend over the drinking fountain bugs turned from the sink and faced him he stared at the man his eyes hard and hateful leatherface straightened slowly a puzzledpolite frown building up on his face yeah stranger he said something on your mind what do you mean whats on my mind bugs said im not stupid you saw me drop off that freight youve got me tagged for a bum so all right lets drop the dumb act and get on with the business im david mckenna alias bugs mckenna last permanent address texas state penitentiary recent addresses dallas city jail fort worth city jail weatherford city jail mineral wells city now looky the man made a baffled gesture i mean what the hell come on come off of it i suppose you just followed me in here to get a drink huh the man started to nod then his squinted gray eyes turned frosty and his voice dropped to a chilling purr lookin for trouble eh he said the words coldedged but soft just aint happy without it well i always like to oblige the gun whipped up from his hip bugs hesitated nervous oddly ashamed wondering why it was that he always had to be in such a hell of a hurry with the mouth look he mumbled iive been catching it pretty rough i didnt mean to you look the hammer of the gun clicked look real good now you want to move or do you want me to move you bugs moved the jail was in the basement of the ancient brick courthouse the ventilation and the light were bad but the bunks were clean and the chow brought in from one of the towns restaurants was really first class each prisoner got three good meals a day as opposed to the twiceaday slop in most jails he was also given a sack of makings or if he preferred a plug of chewing bugs supposed there was a gimmick somewhere in the deal probably youd have pay off with a road gang at twelve hours a day but such according to the other prisoners no local talent all floaters like himself was not the case these folks are different out here an oilfield worker explained they throw you in jail they figure they got to look after you they might shoot a guy but they wont starve him to death what about the rough stuff working you over until you clean the slate for them uhuh you aint done nothin they wont try to pin it on you you wont get roughed unless you cut up rough yourself at least the man added carefully theyve always played fair with me this is my fifth time in for drunk and disorderly and the boys have treated me real nice every time but theres more to the story weel no not exactly not as far as the treatment of the prisoners is concerned but the way this town is run he shook his head i got an idea that theres at least one of these laws the chief deputy lou ford thatd just about as soon kill you as look at you the place is wide open see gambling houses bootleg joints honkytonks and some very bad babies runnin em but they dont give any backtalk to ford he rides herd on em as easy as i can ride a walking beam hes the chief deputy you say what about the sheriff sick and old hardly ever see him except at election time so fords the man and i do mean the man hes got the town and the county right in his pocket and it dont do nothing without his sayso the funny part about it is he dont look tough at all young goodlooking always smiling but a good gunhand huh uhuh the only law here that doesnt wear a gun but well the man spread his hands helplessly i dont know how he does it i mean i couldnt explain youd have to see him in action yourself bugs had been jailed early in the morning the following afternoon the turnkey took him out of the bullpen and up the stairs to the street floor he assumed he was being taken into court instead the turnkey handed him a tendollar bill and gestured him toward the door thats from lou ford he explained wants to see you and he figured you might want to spruce up first but well what about the charges against me aint any lou had em dropped hell be out to his house when youre ready anyone can tell you where it is now wait a minute bugs bristled what does he want to see me about what if i dont want to see him easy to find out for yourself mister if you do see him or if you dont bugs got a shave and a haircut he bought a white shirt and a tie and had his worn suit sponged and pressed boomtown prices being what they are that took practically all of the ten he used the remainder for a shoeshine and a package of cigarettes and headed for lou fords house there were two old residential sections one was the traditional wrongsideofthetracks settlement of the mexicans and white trash the other was up the hill from and overlooking the town a few blocks of treelined streets and roomy twostoried houses except for color difference they were usually light blue white or brown the houses were almost identical a comfortable combination of colonial and spanishmoorish architecture each had a long porch extending across the front despite the areas always uncertain water supply each had a deep shrub and treeshaded lawn fords house was on the corner a new cadillac convertible stood in the driveway mckenna stepped up on the porch and knocked on the door there was no answer he punched the doorbell discovering that it was out of order he knocked again stooping he studied the agedulled brass plate affixed to the door dr amos ford enter the doctor was lous father bugs had learned an improvident kindly man he had died several years before leaving nothing to his son but this house heavily mortgaged at that obviously the sign no longer meant what it said for visitors to enter that is it had been left on the door out of sentiment or shiftlessness on the other hand well there it was wasnt it and why shouldnt a stranger in town take it at its face value what was he supposed to do stand out here and beat the skin off his knuckles hed been told ordered to see ford now this sign told him to enter bugs did so he was standing in a narrow foyer quite dark since the doors to the rooms on either side were closed the only light streamed down from the stairway from an open door apparently right at the head of the stairs muted sounds also drifted down the stairs scuffling the creak of bed springs a mans sardonically soothing drawl and a womans quiet quickly furious voice aw now amy you know i i know you thats what i know lou ford but she dont mean a thing to me amy honest its just business youre a liar what kind of business well go on im listening but i done told you honey its pretty confidential somethin i cant talk about now whynt you just leave it at that and there was an outraged sob the sharp craack of a hardswung palm meeting flesh then the girl came rushing out of the room weeping in blind anger clutching a handful of undergarments highlighted by the glare from the door she began putting on her panties she got them on hopping from foot to foot then she slumped her shoulders dropping her breasts into the cups of her brassiere that was all that bugs saw all that he allowed himself to see he got quietly back out to the porch blushing deeply shamed and embarrassed by what he had seen he was like that oddly modest excruciatingly oldfashioned one might say although he could not regard such things as a matter of fashion he had killed he had worked in shabby disifiusioning jobs he had been penned up with degenerates for years that had been his environment violence foulness and filth and yet in all his life he had looked on no more than three naked women and of the three one had been his wife he wished the third had not been this girl he wished with a kind of gnawing hunger that he had not seen her in her nakedness and he wished longed to see her again to cherish her treat her with love and respect because yes by god she deserved it no matter what shed done regardless of how things looked hed noticed more than her nakedness and offhand he would have said she was not much different than hundreds hed seen just a small wellrounded young woman with a goodfeatured face and sandy brown hair pulled back in a bun but than he had gone on looking and suddenly he had almost gasped at what he saw you know how it is a threehundred dollar suit doesnt knock your eye out a ming vase doesnt shriek for attention but the ultimate beauty the perfection is there and youll always see it if you look long enough see it and recognize it regardless of whether youve ever seen it before even if youve caught so much crap in your eyes that youre halfblind in one and cant see out of the other bugs must have been standing on the porch for ten minutes kind of dazed and dopey lost in his own sad thoughts when he heard the back door close that snapped him out of it recalled him to the gray facts of what he was and why he was here and he knocked again hastily and loudly ford responded almost immediately with a hail of right with you a moment later there was the clicktap of boots in the hallway and he opened the door mckenna im lou ford come on in an set bugs followed him down the foyer and into what apparently had been the doctors onetime office ford looked as out of place among the rows of glassdoored bookcases as a man could look he was about thirty the chief deputy he wore a pinkishtan shirt with a black clipon bowtie and blue serge pants the cuffs of the trousers were tucked carelessly into the tops of his boots in bugs book he stacked up about the same in appearance as any county clown his black glossy hair was combed in a straightback pompadour his higharched brows gave his face a droll impish look a long thin cigar was clamped between his white even teeth he waved bugs to one of the comfortable leather chairs then sat himself down behind the desk he said politely like a drink well how about a cigar then and then when bugs shook his head now thats right youre a cigarette smoker arent you he said it very carelessly a man seemingly making conversation but bugs was sure that he wasnt he was saying that he had seen the two cigarette butts which bugs had flipped onto the sidewalk just got here did you he went on subdued amusement in his voice sure hope i didnt keep you waitin nothing i hate worse than a fella that keeps another fella waitin on him how about crooked cops said mckenna how do you feel about them well which kind you mean the jailbird kind the kind that aint smart enough to stay out of the pen ford grinned at him narroweyed made a little checkback on you mckenna you got quite a record theres nothing about grafting in it well now dont you feel bad about it ford said soothingly a man cant do everything and you damned sure done just about everything else look bugs snarled what do you how do you like our fair city mckenna reglar little jool of the prairie aint it a city of homes churches and people howd you like to be one with our upstandin godfearing citizenry them homely souls that aint no more interested in a dollar than i am in my right leg bugs laughed in spite of himself he remembered reluctantly that however he might feel about ford he was indebted to him the deputy joined in his laughter now thats better he said you got no use for me maybe i got none for you maybe and maybe wed both feel different if we could see the other fellows side but i reckon that would kind of put us out of step with the world and it aint really necessary we can still do business together what kind of business theres a big hotel here in town you saw it i guess they need a house dick pretty good payin job and you get your meals and room along with it i think i can land it for you me i could land a house dicks job in a place like that you aint listening ford said reprovingly i said i could land it for you owners wife is a good friend of mine sorry i cant say the same for him bugs hesitated chewing his lip his head jerked in a curt negative i guess not i guess id better not i cant get into any more trouble i cant know what i mean and if i was sneaked over on some guy pushed down his throat you wont be wont be no deception atall fact is if i got him figured right hell hire you because you have got a sorry record he aint been exactly no angel himself see and hell think a guy that comes clean with him must be on the level but i wouldnt be is that it thats where you come in do i ford examined the tip of his cigar you know what confucius say mckenna man with bare ass always have big mouth theres another one i like better bugs said many men drown in their own dung but few die shouting for a doctor hey now ford seemed honestly delighted thats all right but about this hotel job i aint askin you to be anything but on the level aint askin you to be dont want you to be the most way you can help me is just to do what you should do yes i said so this is a rough town and its a big place and it gets a lot of people that aint exactly panty waists a good tough house dick and i know you aint no coward whatever else you been can save trouble for me well bugs hesitated troubledly it sounds all right and ford by god it has to be if i got into just one more jam sure ford cut in soothingly you just cant do it a fella in your spot has to do everything he can to keep out of trouble because he aint got too many chances left and you think i can handle the job a guy that that acts like i do i dont mean i dont act all right get me bugs added hastily i give just as good as i get but i wont take any guff from anyone and i dont give a hoot in hell who they are either and i wont go around with a big possum grin on my face yeah sure i understand ford nodded you aint going to do no getting along with no one its up to them to get along with you thats not what i said what i said was that bugs scowled then his face twisted into a sheepish grin i guess it did sound that way he said mildly i guess thats probably the way it is or been ford corrected you live like a man should for a while get yourself some reason for livin and youll feel a lot different well he got up from the desk guess were all set huh let me run up and get my hat and coat and well be on our way he left bugs got up and paced nervously around the room as attractive as this setup seemed in some ways he was worried about it suspicious of ford fords clownish mannerisms were too exaggerated no more than a mask for a coldly calculating and supersharp mind he wouldnt go to these lengths simply to place an efficient house detective in the hanlon hotel still bugs thought how could he be so sure he didnt think like an ordinary man any more hed reached the point where he was suspicious of everyone ford was on the take of course but you found graft just about everywhere and aside from that and his treatment of the girl amy bugs frowned remembering firmly he removed her from his calculations about ford maybe she was asking for that kind of treatment but she wasnt she couldnt be at any rate she was none of his business bugs paused in front of the old fieldstone fireplace studying the several pictures which stood propped on the mantel there was one of a young boy ford obviously standing beside a collie dog there was one of a spadebearded bespectacled man and another of an exoticlooking proudeyed brunette in a highnecked shirtwaist there was the remaining picture had toppled over bugs picked it up and stared into the face of the girl amy her lips were parted slightly her eyes looked straight into his smiling dancing with happy expectancy pleased with herself and him and delighted that life had brought two such nice people together and from right behind him ford coughed bugs jumped he dropped the picture back to the mantel hope you dont mind he mumbled i was just uh aw now sure not ford drawled you dont see a dawg like that very often he was the first and last dawg i ever had just seemed like i couldnt never find another one to measure up to him after he passed on i see uh those are your parents yep finelooking woman aint she traced her ancestry clear back to the conkeestadors lets see now ford waggled his cigar thoughtfully i guess it was right after that dawg picture was taken that she run off with a cattle buyer bugs didnt know what to say to that nor to the deputys next statement that his mother was one helluva smart woman didnt try to do what she wasnt made to but he felt that ford had said a great deal to him now that little gal there ford went on thats my feeansay amy standish teaches school here in town probably do a lot better some place else but shes lived here all her life and her family before her for god knows how long so it looks like im stuck with her yourre stuck bugs turned on him id say you were damned lucky well now i guess you would ford nodded just seem her in that old picture but shes got fat as a hawg since it was taken fat why youre reddening bugs choked off the sentence ford looked at him innocently yeah you was sayin mckenna nothing are we going to stand here talking all day or are we going to see about that job just as soon as i make a phone call ford said want to do me a little favor while youre waitin theres a sign out there on the door keep forgettin to take it down an if youll get a screwdriver out of the do it yourself bugs grunted ill wait for you in the car he slammed out of the house and climbed into the convertible a couple of minutes later ford joined him he had a fresh cigar in his mouth he was wearing a coat that matched his blue serge trousers and a tan ranchstyle hat couldnt reach mrs hanlon at the hotel he announced as he headed the car toward town have to look around a little for her all right bugs said now i been thinkin got an idea i better fix you up with a gun for your job dont figure youll have any call to use it but sometimes the best way of not needin one is to have it yeah bugs said what about yourself oh well me now ford paused to turn the car into the curb thats a different situation me im never around any action never run into nothing where a gun might be necessary he had parked at the end of the old towns main street the beginning of the boom towns chief thoroughfare they walked to the end of it then crossed in the deep reddish dust and started back up the plank sidewalk on the other side mammoth sixteenwheeled trucks lumbered down the street toward the oilfields the smell of whitecorn whiskey drifted from doorways there was an incessant tinkling of jukeboxes a clangclinking of slot machines the rattleandsmack of dice and the whirrandclick of roulette wheels the noise rose and fell a chorus that faded with the passing of one doorway and picked up in perfect tempo and tune at the next there were no women none at least who appeared to be anything but women so ford apparently did draw the line somewhere the men were young notsoyoung but never old most of them wore hats spattered with drillmud and the rattlesnake insurance of laced eighteeninch boots ford paused at each establishment and glanced inside near the end of the second block he looked over the swinging doors of a gambling house and gave bugs a nod of satisfaction in here he said taking a pair of black kid gloves from his pocket he began putting them on smoothing them over his tapering delicatelooking fingers a man came hurrying through the swinging doors a burly pastyfaced man with a slit for a mouth and eyes that were like tiny black buttons well lou he smirked nervously saw you lookin inside nothing wrong is there ford didnt answer him he didnt look up from pulling on his gloves lou be reasonable huh keed there was desperation in the guys voice i didnt know she was in there i swear i didnt i just this moment came back from eatin and i told those jerks i got working for me a thousand times not to let her bugs didnt see the blow or rather two blows that ford delivered they were so unexpected and executed so swiftly that he saw little more than their results the man bent double suddenly gasping for breath ropish food spouting from his mouth the man spinning ludicrously spinstaggering off of the curb and collapsing in the street ford brushed his gloves one against the palm of the other he went through the twin swinging doors and immediately two chairs crashed out through the windows bugs blinked and shook his head customers were stampeding out the doorway but he lunged through them and past them to the inside again he could hardly believe what he saw ford was strolling toward the rear of the room leaving a shambles of broken furniture and fixtures behind him adding to it with every step he took he moved unhurriedly effortlessly he was completely unruffled and the cigar was stifi in his teeth and yet he gave the impression of raging barely controllable fury it came from the very deliberation of his movements perhaps a feeling that he was building up relishing and prolonging the savagery forestalling the cataclysmic climax that would end his game a couple of the joints employees rushed him one from each side ford rocked them with two simultaneous backhands whipped his arms around their necks and crashed their heads together and he hardly seemed to break stride he was moving on before they hit the floor tipping his hat politely to a woman who stood pressed against the rear wall she was the last customer in the place the only remaining person aside from bugs and ford an ashblonde she had a kind of washedout but interesting prettiness full high breasts and a waist approximately half the circumference of her hips now that was a hell of a thing to do she said angrily honestly lou ford i icould just absolutely murder you told you to keep out of these joints ford said told em to keep you out and just who are you to order me around where do you get off at telling me what to do with my own money but it aint your own ford said gently might not be none of your own either if you got hardpressed and had to start grabbin no sir sure might not be and thats a fact the woman looked at him sulkily well she said well anyway you didnt need to act like this no ford shrugged well maybe not but look i want you to meet a fella mrs hanlon mr mckenna her eyes swept bugs contemptuously taking in the worn clothes the rundown shoes the tired haggard face then she reddened for far from flinching she found bugs looking her over in exactly the same way adding her up point by point and arriving at an obviously unflattering total well she said unconsciously sucking in her breath and then she smiled suddenly and extended her hand im very glad to meet you mr mr mckenna is it yeah thats right mrs mrs hanlon he grinned at her insolently but joyce hanlon refused to be offended she moved in on him clinging to his hand until her breasts were almost against his body she looked up at him through silky eyelashes spoke in the voice of a plaintive child im sorry dont be mad hmmm pretty please pretty please with sugar on it bugs had no defense for that kind of stuff he turned six different colors at once mumbled desperately that ssure he wasnt angry and he hoped she wasnt and he was sorry too and and so on until he was sure he must sound like the worlds biggest horses ass at last ford rescued him with the suggestion that they get out of the place go somewhere they could talk they went to one of the oldtown restaurants with joyce holding to bugss arm and strangely it didnt fluster him much now when she sat down in the booth opposite him and ford he missed the pressure on his biceps the intimate secretive probing of her fingers a waitress brought coffee ford brought up the subject of the house dicks job stating bugss qualifications along with a casual mention of his criminal record plenty husky and gutsy been a bigcity dick an like you can see hes a real friendly fella to boot shouldnt ought to matter much that hes done a few things that wasnt exactly legal it shouldnt joyce looked at him doubtfully i mean well no it shouldnt it certainly wouldnt matter to me i know but she stared frowning into fords eyes seeking some clue to his reasoning the deputy looked back at her blandly well it wont matter to mister hanlon then he said peoples all alike the way i figger all kind of brothers under the skin oh lou you corny soandso but seriously aint never been nothin but serious im one of these pagleeatchee fellas serious as all hell behind a mask of laughter so you just do like i say take bugs mr mckenna here right to the head man sos he dont get lost or strayed in the applicationblank stage and mister hanlonll sign him up as fast as foxhair i dont think so the mere fact that i want him hired will be enough to get him turned down im perfectly willing to do it bugs she used the nickname easily slanting a smile at him but i know how mike is bugs nodded uncomfortably he started to say that they could forget the whole thing as far as he was concerned he didnt want to be pushed off on anyone but ford was already talking seems to me you dont know how he is he said or what he is hardheaded longshot player cant run his own game hell tackle the other fellas try to take the play away from him thats your husband honey and i dont figger hell step out of character with bugs mmm yes i see what you mean she took a thoughtful sip of her coffee and pushed the cup aside i think youre right lou now do i mention that i met bugs through you or its up to you but it dont make much difference hed probably think it even if you didnt tell him and dont you know it trust him not to give anyone the benefit of the doubt well doubts is cheap these days ford said goin at the same rate as their benefits which was nothingminus the last i heard he slid out of the booth and stood up guess i better run along now that were all squared away some fellas i know are leavin town and i want to give em a sendoff have fun joyce smiled and flirted a hand at him ill let you know how everything comes out and thanks bugs said gruffly thanks a lot what for aint done nothin to call for thanks ford declared no sir i sure aint and thats a fact most of the hanlon employees worked the more or less standard longday shortday of the hotel world a shift came on duty at seven in the morning quit at noon returned at six and remained until eleven the following day this shift would work a shortday from noon until six with the opposite shift catching the doublewatch long day the exceptions to this routine were night workers certain professional and maintenance personnel employees of the storeroom and laundry bugs mckenna and mr olin westbrook the executive manager bugs was on call at all times but there was rarely any need for him during the day he had been called only once during the month of his employment so in practice he was a night worker mr olin westbrook on the other hand not only was supposed to be available at all hours of the day but invariably had to be oh perhaps he could retire to a checkedout room for an hour or so freshen up with a shower or catch a few winks of sleep but these brief periods were more tantalizing than satisfying he couldnt really rest and relax if someone didnt buzz him and someone usually did he would be expecting them to and the expectation coupled with the worry over what might be going on during his absence kept him on nerve ends westbrook was a hotel man of the old school of the days when it was a pleasure to stop at a hotel instead of an adventure into indifferent food and accommodations insolently or ignorantly administered now at the hanlon he tried to do too much with too pitifully little the job might be killing him but he had to have it he was in his late fifties and for the last ten years he had been fired from every job he held so it was this job or nothing at eleven oclock at night he was in his mezzaninefloor office reauditing the hotels books for the last three months it was the third time he had been through them and the result had been the same each time there was a broad fixed smile on his face a frozen grimace in his mind deliberately overlaid with protective dullness was terror cold sober westbrook had many of the reactions of a man who is dead drunk the direst personal catastrophe had no meaning for him he could be face to face with a fact yet remain completely withdrawn from it he had been that way for years god how many years only when the alcoholic content of his blood was at a certain level could he think and act as he should at last he pushed aside the papers and took a pint bottle from his desk it was about a third full it was the last of three pints with which he had started the day westbrook drank half of it at a swallow and lighted a cigarette after a few puffs on the cigarette he drank the remainder warmth came back into his small paunchy body his fixed foolish smile gave way to a scowl of concentration well he thought and then i dont know but youve got to its your tail if you dont you hired dudley did it over the old mans objections you said that he was a hell of a good auditor and youd vouch for him personally and now that the sonofabitch has done this i know i know all that dammit but i still dont know perhaps if i had another drink and of course ill close out the watch before i take it get the night shift under way mr westbrook stood up resolutely ignoring a small and despairing voice of warning rolling down his sleeves he ref astened the links of the french cuffs and rebuttoned his fawncolored vest he put on a black broadcloth coat carefully adjusting the white linen handkerchief in its breast pocket then after swiftly examining his fingernails and flicking a speck of dust from one shoe he stepped out onto the mezzanine rosalie vara the mezz maid was dusting furniture a few feet away from him studying her from the rear westbrook again complimented himself for assigning her to her present duties she would have got herself raped if he hadnt any girl who looked like she did who could easily have passed for white and yet admitted to being a negro was obviously too stupid to look after herself all that was necessary was opportunity which on the job he had given her was practically nonexistent westbrook let his eyes linger on her a moment longer his ultracynical mind again considering the possibility that instead of being stupid she might be very very smart considering it and again rejecting it she couldnt be working a gimmick he knew every trick and dodge in the book and if there was any way that a gal could pull a swif tie by admitting that she was a negro well there just wasnt she was simply dumb that was all too damned dullwitted to tell a lie so hed put her in a job where no one could take advantage of her of course she was upstairs occasionally it was unavoidable since all the day maids knocked off at eleven oclock and there were a few rooms like bugs mckennas which had to be put in order before the morning shift came on for ninetyfive per cent of the time however she worked as she was working now out in the open away from the danger of private bedrooms and locked doors westbrook took a final look at the girls delicately rounded bottom a look of unconscious yearning then he turned away conscientiously and descended the curving staircase to the lobby he walked with his head tilted slightly upward as though about to sniff the air for some evil smell his pale puffy face was as selfassuredly haughty as that of a purebred pekingese to which it bore some slight resemblance people were tempted to smile at their first glimpse of westbrook but the very briefest contact with the little man was sufficient to still the temptation westbrook had begun his career as a page boy working his way upward he had become not only highly efficient but exceedingly tough a man who could cope with the hurlyburly hotel world at every level and on its own terms the staircase terminated in the lobby near the three front elevators two of the cars were out of service as they should have been at this hour the third was being manned by a member of the day crew which it definitely should not have been westbrook glanced up the lobby to the frontoffice desks he moved toward them ominously the youngish night clerk leslie eaton was in the cashiers cage chaffing with him his back turned to the lobby was the dayshift bell captain neither he nor the clerk noted westbrooks approach they were suddenly made aware of it by a bellowed inquiry as to what the hell was going on the captain jumped and whirled westbrook let out another bellow you working this shift now well are you too stupid to talk what about you eaton you were doing plenty of yapping a minute ago i i im sorry sir the clerk stammered i mmean been getting a lot of kicks on you not answering your phones chasing all over the house instead of staying where you belong i know i know westbrook made a chopping motion with his hand you have a little auditing to do have to check up on the coffeeshop and the valet and so on but thats no reason to be gone from the desk for thirty or forty minutes at a time im not i mean eaton corrected himself im not aware that i have been absent for more than a few minutes he was a rosycheeked young man addicted to collegecut clothes westbrook looked at him distastefully advised him that he was aware of it now and turned back to the captain well he demanded wheres the night bellboy whats that day man doing on the elevator were both working over the captain shrugged sullenly night boys havent shown up yet why not dont know look mr westbrook the captain protested what are you jumping on me for those birds arent on my shift and arent you tickled to death that they arent westbrook jeered got you buffaloed havent they bet theyre in the lockerroom right now and you havent got the guts to run em up the arrival of a guest ended his harangue the captain scurried away gratefully to take the mans baggage westbrook left the lobby and started down the back stairs the door to the bellboys lockerroom was partially open pausing in the dimly lit corridor westbrook looked through the aperture like many boys in the hotel world ted and ed gusick respectively the night bellboy and elevator operator were boys in name only ted was about forty ed perhaps a year or so older they had prematurely graying hair and pinkish massagedlooking faces they were wellbuilt but slender narrowwaisted flatstomached wiry and strong born of the same mother they may or may not have had the same father even she was unable to say amoral vicious treacherous and dishonest they bore the hard polish of men who have spent a lifetime squeezing out of tight places they were fighting standing almost toe to toe while they slugged each other a veteran of a thousand such lockerroom brawls westbrook watched them with a feeling of nostalgia every blow was intended to cripple anything went except hitting the other man in the face boys didnt fight that way anymore westbrook was thinking they didnt fight period they came whining to the management with their disputes always as in every difficulty they wanted someone to do something for them they were incompetent indifferent completely lacking in pride in their work too good to do the job they were paid to do well westbrook sighed shook his head and pulled himself back from the happy past then setting his face in a ferocious scowl he dashed into the lockerroom managing by a miracle of footwork to give both boys a solid kick before they could elude him up he roared pointing dramatically to the ceiling up on the gdamn floor whats the matter with you anyway you know what time it is what dyou mean keeping a watch waiting sorry sir said ed sorry mr westbrook said ted and they edged warily toward the door westbrook advanced on them one hard little fist drawn back what were you fighting about huh hah answer me you friggers or ill ted said they had been fighting about nothing ed said they had no excuse these replies were exactly the right ones in westbrooks opinion in the old days boys often fought out of sheer high spirits and they made no excuses if caught nevertheless as a matter of discipline and because they expected it he took a vicious swing at the brothers cursing them roundly as they fled out the door and up the stairs now those were real boys he thought as he left the lockerroom youd never catch boys like that whining or complaining they knew how to wait on a guest to get their own way with a man and do itso ingratiatingly that he was glad to pay for the privilege in the last twenty years they had worked with westbrook in perhaps a dozen different hotels shrewd and suave knowing hotels from subbasement to roof garden they could probably have managed one as well as he but they remained bellboys by choice they were good at hopping bells and it left them free of onerous responsibilities also unless westbrook missed his guess they made more money than he did ordinarily neither of the brothers would have accepted employment as an elevator operator one of them had done so in this case because only the night bellboys job was open and they insisted on working together at the time he had hired them westbrook had promised to give them day jobs on bells as soon as they became available but they had later advised him not to bother that they were completely satisfied with things as they were westbrook correctly suspected that their preference for the night shift was largely due to the scanty supervision thereon certainly they would be able to run circles around that goofy clerk leslie eaton but no one had caught them in any forbidden activities as yet and until someone did catch them or at least came forth with a valid complaint well that was that westbrook shrugged they were good boys the dopey dullness of sobriety was creeping back over him he was passing out on his feet and there was still that allimportant matter of dudley to settle westbrook hurried out the back door fighting to keep the telltale smirk from his face when he returned some twenty minutes later he was once again brisk and alert and there were two halfpints of whiskey in his pockets and another half in his stomach he entered the unattended service elevator and switched on the light he shot upward the control pushed all the way over arriving seconds later at the twelfth floor it was a perfect stop with the car exactly level with the landing westbrook rewarded himself with a couple of short ones adding another halfpint of whiskey to his interior content he tossed the empty bottle into the incinerator chute turning away from it he suddenly staggered wildly and flailed the air with his arms the fit was gone almost as soon as it came he had moved in an insane blur for a moment and then it was all over but westbrook knew that it signaled the crossing of an invisible line from now on the booze would be working against him sweeping him finally into the dark and disastrous void which he had penetrated so often in the past westbrook shivered slightly remembering those occasions he remembered the agony that had followed them the terrible sickness and the equally terrible shame and embarrassment he couldnt go through it again god he couldnt do it he could not must not take another drink tonight except of course one very small one just enough to see him through this dudley matter he took it he recorked the bottle then slowly uncorked it and took another one seemingly there were no ill effects he did feel a rising anger but that was natural enough goddammit how long could a man go on catching the dirty end of the stick without getting fed up he never got any rest he never had a minute to call his own work by god that was all he ever got work and more work and then still more work and what did he have to work with hah a bunch of bumbling bastardly lunatics and was it appreciated hah did he ever get a goddamned word of thanks hah shit no westbrook snapped suddenly out of his selfpitying reverie wondering if he had spoken aloud he decided that he hadnt that he didnt give a damn if he had and that he wasnt the kind of a man who went around talking to himself the first decision was entirely correct the last almost he became hatefully insulting and murderously angry when his alcoholic tolerance was exceeded but he had to be literally saturated before he appeared drunk in the usual sense the fact was at once his curse and his blessing he drank the remainder of his whiskey then with his shoulders hunched pugiistically his eyes squinted to pinpoints and his face flushed with righteous indignation he stamped down the corridor he was in a wing of the building one of its two wings bugs mckennas room was a few steps away facing the court as did the rooms of all employees who slept in westbrook strode up to the door he drew his fist back hesitated held it poised for a matter of seconds and then he pounded bugs had been awakened by the ringing of the telephone it was his usual eleven pm wakeup call and he and the operator exchanged the usual amenities with that out of the way she advised him that yes he had had one call mrs hanlon she said you could give her a ring whenever you waked up oh bugs said well thanks yes sir shall i get her for you now sir bugs didnt like the tone of her voice the subtle note of amusement so he said no ill tell you when i want you to call her and slammed up the receiver he took a shower toweling his big body he decided that he was jumping at shadows again acting like a touchy kid instead of a man he was wrong about the telephone operator or if he wasnt if she was a little tickled about mrs hanlons almost nightly calls what of it it was nothing to get sore about he should have let her have her little joke and pretended not to notice got to watch that stuff he murmured aloud youve been getting along swell so dont start slipping he shaved he dressed standing in front of the doorlength mirror and unconsciously contentedly he began to hum he looked like a different man these days more important he felt like one he was still unsure of himself still inclined to jump down peoples throats for little or no cause but not nearly to the extent he had used to be all the old ugly impulses were vanishing or becoming atrophied withering in these strange new feelings of security an environment which asked no more than he could decently give the hanlon had no interests whatsoever in its guests morals its concern was not so much with what they did but how they did it as long as they were circumspect they could do anything they chose to within reason it was only when they became rowdy or otherwise acted to the hotels disadvantage that mckenna was called in it wasnt that way everywhere according to olin westbrook in many big hotels the house dick had to be a keyholepeeper a sneak and a snoop otherwise his employers would get a reputation for running a loose house and the trade would go to their competition but the hanlon had no competition nor would it ever have any so it could rock along in the easygoing style of its area and bugs mckenna had to do nothing offensive to his selfrespect he heard the rattle of silver as a coffee tray was set down outside his door bringing it in he took it over by the window sniffing its steam happily as he filled a cup now this was something like it he thought to live in a nice place be treated just about the same as a paying guest and get paid for doing it of course joyce hanlon was kind of a nuisance just a little too interested in how he was getting along too friendly for comfort on the other hand it was a lot better for her to be that way he guessed than uninterested and unfriendly and anyway nothing was perfect he wasnt kicking a bit bugs mckenna wasnt no sir not one little bit he was satisfied with things just like they were later on perhaps he might want something more out of life than he had now but for the present a slight frown crept into his eyes doggedly he pushed away the thought that had prompted it the present that was all that mattered maintaining the status quo and doing nothing that might endanger it as surely it would be endangered by taking an active interest in amy standish she was lou fords girl ford was obviously a thoroughly bad egg so for the present until he was a lot better established than he was now he would have to leave her alone no damned good anyway bugs thought bitterly and knew that he didnt really think it a swell girl like that and she throws herself away on a a bugs severed his chain of thought again firmly and finally lou ford had done him a favor thus far there was no indication that there was any string attached to it he was in the deputys debt in other words and it was only decent as well as smart to keep the fact in mind he drank half the coffee and smoked a couple of cigarettes then he took the cup and saucer into the bathroom and washed and dried them he had just finished when rosalie vara the maid arrived how are you tonight mr mckenna she came in smiling a dream come to life in her neat blueandwhite uniform i hope you slept well not too bad rosie mckenna gestured toward the coffee tray sent up more than i could drink tonight welcome to have it if you want it why thank you thats very nice of you mr mckenna sall right bugs said no sense in letting good coffee go to waste he was conscious that he had used these same words gone through this same rigamarole practically every night since he came here but the fact didnt bother him as it would have with another person nor was he anything but pleased by her warmly gentle laugh a laugh which told him that she saw through his gruffness he felt at ease with her as he had never felt with anyone else probably he supposed because she was so completely at ease herself she finished the coffee bugs idled near the window while she made up his room wondering why such a swelllooking girl who could easily have passed for white should have declared herself a negro it wasnt because she was stupid as westbrook said she was obviously smarter and better educated than most of the hanlons white employees neither was it because of the aggressive arrogance which bugs had found in so many negros and which had always made him so excruciatingly uncomfortable around them they that type of negro hit you in the face with their color they drew a line then despised you if you came over to their side and hated you if you stayed on your own rosalie vara on the other hand well rosie was just herself an exceptionally pretty and nicemannered young woman who happened to be a negro and who saw no reason either to flaunt or conceal the fact well she picked up her work bucket and cleaning equipment it looks like im all through mr mckenna thanks again for the coffee not at all thank you bugs said well guess ill probably run into you later on tonight huh yes sir bye now mr mckenna she left her small round hips swinging a few minutes later as bugs was preparing to leave olin westbrook pounded on the door bugs opened it the manager pushed past him brusquely seated himself and pointed imperiously to a chair in front of him sit down sit down i said ive got some things to say to you and its going to take a little time well sure ollie bugs sat down whats on your mind ill tell you but ive got a question to ask first what do you think of me personally that is think im on the square got any kicks about the way ive treated you since youve been here why do you ask that bugs looked at him frowning has anyone said that just answer me dammit you came here green as a gourd have i or have i not done everything that a man could do to put you on the right track and keep you there you have no one could have been more helpful and ive tried to tell you how much i appreciate it now then you do owe me a favor i helped you when you needed it and im not out of line in asking you to help me now thats right bugs nodded curiously look ollie lets lay it on the line im going to be pretty short until payday but you can have what ive got and if theres anything else that i its something else its dudley you know the auditor hes my baby i hired him over the old mans objections all right hanlon was right about him in the last quarter dudleys knocked down more than five thousand dollars between five and six i cant say exactly how much i want you to get it back from him me bugs gave a start oh you mean you want me to put him under arrest turn him over to the cops and file a complaint no i dont mean that because i cant prove hes stolen it i know he has understand weve done just as much business this quarter as we did last but weve got five or six thousand less to show for it so but but how bugs was beginning to see where the conversation was drifting and it frightened him stiff but whats the difference how theres a thousand and one ways an auditor can knock down he cant do it in a place where theres other auditors a system of checks and rechecks but westbrook flung up his hand in exasperation look hotel books are kept in pencil the transcript sheets the cash sheets everything they have to be because theyre running accounts new charges being added all the time erasures and changes are taken as a matter of course all right then just to give you one trick for knocking down a guest checks in one night he doesnt leave until after our checkout period the following night so naturally we charge him for two days but in hours hes actually only been here one day and by altering his folio and the cash sheet yes nothing bugs said nervously i mean i was just going to say that if you cant prove something if you arent absolutely positive i told you i was positive dammit i know that he took that dough and hanlon will know it and hell hold me responsible but but how did he get away with so much why didnt you stop him when he first started knocking down its not something you can spot on a daily check the loss isnt big enough but when it collects over a period of three months westbrook scrubbed his face irritably would i be kidding you he demanded dont you think i know what im talking about no of course not bugs shook his head he nodded it but dudley took that dough he wouldnt have banked it or put it in a safety deposit box it might cause talk and anyway hed want it where he could get to it in a hurry so hes got it with him either in his room or on his person hes probably changed it into a handful of big bills and westbrooks voice faded suddenly he choked and coughed stared at bugs out of desperately belligerent eyes youve got to get it back bugs scare hell out of him slap him around beat him up if you have to but get it back it was what bugs had expected and he had known what he was going to have to do but still it was hard to do it he liked ollie westbrook few people had been as kind to him as the stiffnecked haughtymannered little manager lets see what youre asking of me ollie he said quietly you cant recover the loss through the bonding company right theyre in the same boat with you they cant prove that any dough he may have isnt his own and you cant prove it either but goddammit where would a guy like that get five or six grand how can he prove its his he doesnt have to he doesnt have to say where he got it so bugs spread his hands thats how we stand ollie ive got a criminal record a damned ugly one one wrong move and im in the soup up to my neck and yet youre asking me to pull a robbery an act of extortion to take a mans money and it is his in the eyes of the law by force and violence i dont believe youve thought this thing through ollie i dont really think you want me to take a chance like that or do you westbrook hesitated then shamed but dogged he said it was exactly what he wanted and expected i mean i want you to get that dough back make him come across youre not taking any chances a bastard like that isnt going to make trouble for anyone he wont for me anyway bugs shook his head firmly im grateful to you ollie but i think youve got a hell of a lot of guts youre afraid to tackle this deal yourself yet youll ask me a guy walking a tight rope and afraid hell westbrook exploded id take on fifty skunks like dudley if it would do any good but it wouldnt i insisted on hiring him i swore that he was straight as a string how can i do an aboutface now and call him a thief hed laugh in my face id just be tipping him off that it was time to scram you see that dont you youre not completely dumb are you you overgrown meathead mckenna colored he said coldly not this dumb at least im sorry ollie you wont do it after all ive done for you you i wont do it bugs nodded and ill be damned careful not to accept any other favors from you from now on westbrook brushed the back of his hand against his mouth he said hell he was sorry he didnt want bugs to feel that way he hadnt done anything more for bugs than hed do for any man that he liked and bugs didnt owe him a cent but but his voice rose turned suddenly ugly the alcohol washed over him like a tide killing all inhibitions leaving nothing but his terror and sense of outrage and hateful words spewed from his small hard mouth in a poisonous stream he didnt mean what he said it was the alcohol talking not the man but he was inherently cynical gifted with the faculty for totting circumstance with circumstance and arriving at invariably unflattering conclusions conclusions answers which were at once laughably illogical and insidiously convincing bugs gaped at him not knowing whether to laugh or get sore the reddish haze cleared from westbrooks brain and his tirade ended as abruptly as it had begun he got to his feet stood weaving on them slightly murmuring dullvoiced apologies he was sorry just lost his temper worried and burned up about dudley and that was all he hadnt meant a word of it well christ bugs frowned i should hope not sure not not a word westbrook tottered toward the door so just forget it huh enough trouble now without the door closed behind him bugs stared at its polished surface a sickish disturbance spreading through the pit of his stomach he was supposed to bump off old man hanlon that was why joyce hanlon and lou ford had done so much stringpulling to get him this job nuts how crazy could you get anyway stifi if that wasnt the reason behind fords and joyces unusual interest in him and of course it wasnt what well it was like ford had said a good tough housedick at the hanlon saved work for him and his deputies but that wasnt true nothing had happened at the hanlon thus far that required any great amount of toughness or muscular activity so well so nothing perhaps things had just been unusually quiet so far or well maybe ford had just been doing him a favor in a way that would be easy for him to accept that last didnt seem very likely but ford was a grafter a crook and joyce hanlon was obviously pretty lowdown the two of them were both moneyhungry and if they were looking for a guy to pull a murder what could be more natural than to pick someone whod bugs let out a disgusted snort a sound filled with forced disbelief he told himself that just because ollie westbrook was acting screwy was no excuse for him to do so ford and joyce knew that he was on the level hed made it damned clear that he was and that he intended to stay that way and if theyd actually been looking for a killer he wouldnt have got the job that was that poor ollie had just been grasping at straws saying the first thing that popped into his mind bugs slipped on his shoulder holster with its police special then putting on his hat and coat he left the room he was supposed to make a complete tour of the hotel at least once a night tonight as he sometimes did he decided to make part of it before eating and the rest afterwards since he was here he did his own floor first walking the main hall and the two wing corridors then mounting the two flights of steps to the fourteenth the top floor he began working his way downward to save doubling back on his tracks he descended the eastwing steps on one floor those on the west wing the next in this fashion he arrived some twenty minutes later on the eleventh floor at the room of the auditor dudley he had been thinking about westbrook meanwhile worrying about him fretting himself into a state of stricken conscience hed acted like a heel he decided just turned the little man down flat without a crumb of comfort naturally he couldnt go to the lengths that westbrook had suggested but there was every chance in the world that they wouldnt be necessary westbrook was too rattled to think straight to suggest anything but threats and violence whereas if the auditor actually was a thief he might easily knuckle under to a few firm words at any rate bugs thought there was no harm in trying and he certainly owed it to westbrook to make the try so impulsively without stopping to listen at the door and god how he was to regret that later he knocked briskly there was silence the kind of silence that follows the sudden cessation of sound bugs waited a moment and knocked again still silence then a sudden creak and rattle the brisk chatter of the bathroom shower and dudleys irritated voice yeah who is it mckenna bugs said i want to see you this time of night what the hell bugs bugs didnt say anything dudley muttered something and turned the key in the lock stepping into the bathroom as bugs entered be right with you he called sourly just as soon as i dry off and get he slammed the door cutting off the last of the sentence bugs went on through the entrance areaway and sat down except for the moonlight drifting through the window drapes the room lay in darkness the bed was rumpled as though slept in dudleys clothes were flung over a chair or rather part of them were the trousers with the belt halfpulled out of them lay on the floor in an untidy heap bugs looked at them frowning unconsciously that was funny dudley was kind of a ladys man a real dude about his clothes it was strange that hed drop them on the floor in a wad as strange say as his getting out of bed in the middle of the night to take a bath the bathroom door opened a figure darted past him suddenly dudley his hair rumpled naked save for the towel tied around his middle he snatched up the trousers clawed frantically at the inside surface of the belt he dropped them again and turned on bugs eyes glittering in the darkness teeth bared in an animallike grimace all right he hissed lets have it you sonofabitch huh bugs scrambled from his chair what the hell are you its mine you cant prove that it isnt i know the law see and you either fork it over or or by god ill kill you the words came out in a rush he came at bugs with a rush and hell he was a setup for bugs a flabby wildswinging punk like that bugs sidestepped expertly effortlessly as the auditor shot past him he chopped his hand against the back of his neck now simmer down he warned turning i dont know what what he stopped talking there was no one to talk to there were only the soles of dudleys bare feet on the window sill and then they were no longer there they had slid over it following his body through the fluttering drapes into the elevenstory void of space ted gusick set down his load of baggage and turned to the cross dyspepticlooking guest in hushed funereal tones he advised the gentleman that the house doctor was on call at all times and that the corner drugstore had twentyfour hour prescription service of course you may be all right here he said on a note of hopeful worriment a lot of people the really rugged types you know it hardly bothers em at all but if you should feel yourself getting sick the man stared at him nervously he asked worried questions dolefully ted declined to reply i guess ive said too much already sir after all ive got a big family to support and if i lost my job he hesitated then threw in the clincher probably i wouldnt have said anything at all if you hadnt been doublerated that was just a little more than i could take to charge you a double rate for a room like this this room above all rooms what that derk charged me double you said anger was added to the mans nervousness whats all this about anyway whats wrong with this room ted wouldnt tell him he just couldnt as much as he wanted to and felt that he should he was just scraping by see and he was too old to get another job and oh thank you sir he said smoothly pocketing the guests fivedollar tip now dont let on that i told you but they call this the dead room i guess its something in the wallpaper know what i mean arsenic or something like that anyway practically everyone that stays in it gets sick as a dog and quite a few of em have died so if youll take my advice he left as the guest was acting on his advice ie he had leslie eaton the derk on the phone and was demanding another room a decent room by god he concluded furiously and dont try to gyp me on the price either thoroughly bewildered the clerk agreed to a transfer ted accepted another key from him moved the gentleman to a room less desirable than the first one and collected a tip of another dollar the next guest to arrive was flushed faced jaundiced of eye after considerable sly coaxing and a tendollar tip ted revealed to him that there were indeed a great many girls in the hotel the clerks got a whole stable of em some of the hottest babes you ever laid eyes on now dont let on that i told you because he gets kind of embarrassed about it but just tell him you know damned well hes got em you been hearing about it all over texas and that if he dont come across the old craps going to fly the gentleman licked his lips he reached for the telephone and ted made his exit arriving at the elevator bank he found ed waiting for him lets have your passkey his brother spoke impatiently old man reimers just came in fried to the gills forget him if hes really fried he hasnt got any dough left says who how the hell do you know so much give me that key or ill paste you one ted stepped into the car he pulled the door shut gesturing his brother into silence no key he said i got rid of it i dropped in on dudley a while ago and after i made the hit he named the figure he had hit for ed let out an admiring whistle dudley for christs sake must have tapped the till dont ysuppose howd you ever get wise that he was carrying heavy didnt ted shrugged modestly didnt even know it was his room until i got inside well i knew sure but i wasnt even thinking about whose room it was i heard the shower running as i passed by and i could tell by the sound that the bathroom door was closed so naturally i paid him a fast visit naturally ed opened the door at the lobby floor a chance like that you dont get every day well what dyou know he chuckled dryly so dudley gets cleaned while hes getting clean i figure that isnt all he got i wouldnt say for sure but i got a hunch there was someone in the bathroom with him it kind of figures see otherwise hedve had the door open you have it closed with the shower on and you practically get drowned in the steam ed nodded wisely entertaining a lady guest in the bathroom with the water running was one of the very oldest of tricks it was poor for neatness as the saying was but perfect for secrecy ted returned to the front office and went behind the key rack seating himself in the open window of the air well he lighted a cigarette relaxed grinning as he listened to eatons highpitched voice he was talking to that ruddyfaced guy apparently the last one that registered and the guy obviously as ted had advised him was refusing to take no for an answer you listen to me sir i do not have any girls i do not well i dont care all ive got to say is that theyre just a bunch of nasty old liars and they ought to be ashamed of themselves and what what dont you talk to me that way thir excitement was bringing out eatons lisp i thimply wifi not lithen one more minute to thith thith he banged up the telephone chuckling softly ted flicked his cigarette out the window and then as his eyes followed its course to the bottom of the shaft he emitted a startled curse he sat staring downward for a moment his stomach churning queasily a faint chill gripping his hard wiry body but he had seen suicides before leapers like this one and dudley thief and chiseler that he was bound to be was certainly no great loss to the world ted slid from the window sill and lighted another cigarette he dropped it to the floor emerged from behind the key rack and joined eaton in the roomdesk cage the clerk was still indignant from his talk with the ruddyfaced man he told ted about it his voice cracking and squeaking announcing his conviction that the gentleman was plain raving mad ted nodded soberly its this weather he said you take a night like this if people got any mental weakness at all they blow their lids like bedbugs eaton giggled cautiously oh you whats so different about the weather tonight you aint noticed ted shook his head well i guess you wouldnt but if you were an oldtime hotel man youd know this was nut weather the kind of night when people go sailing out their windows like airplanes oh sure eaton giggled again now what are you up to you crazy thing no kid kid why ill lay you ten to one we have a suicide tonight eaton laughed ecstatically ted took him by the elbow led him to the airwell window and pointed the clerk looked out he fainted leaving him lying on the floor ted picked up the telephone he called westbrooks room first there was no answer which was as he had expected since by this time of night the manager would be pretty thoroughly anaesthetized with alcohol ted jiggled the receiver hook and called bugs mckenna when bugs thought about that night later everything seemed to move in the hazy yet welldefined grooves of a dream he had committed murder yet he had not committed it it was something of the moment something that would have no meaning once the moment was gone similarly he was in dire danger yet none at all the means for extricating himself were ridiculously obvious as easily and immediately accessible as those in a clumsily constructed story even after lou ford came on the scene entered the dream there was no rift in the smooth haziness ford in fact proved its happy culmination a suicide huh well now wasnt that somethin mustve been an awful nice fella too yknow gettin hisself all cleaned up before he did it ford wasnt at all suspicious he had no reason to be and almost every reason not to be and bugs was sure that he wasnt later within a few brief days but that was later taking things as they happened bugs stared at the stillfluttering curtains of the window and a black and terrible sickness engulfed him he had killed dudley for the second time in his life he had killed a man he hadnt meant to it was an accident but he had done it and for a moment he wanted to die himself the moment passed the blackness and the sickness went away fear gripped him shook him back into his senses shattering his regrets before they were fully formed dudley was no good dudley had brought about his own death he had betrayed westbrook a man who had befriended him and indirectly the betrayal had cost him his life as to what had happened to the money that dudley had stolen and which he apparently believed had been stolen from him bugs did no thinking at all about that not at the time he didnt he simply got out of the room fast as soon as he had ascertained that the hall was clear he was out the door almost as soon as dudley was out the window racing up the stairs bursting into his own room and picking up the telephone speaking with a yawn in his voice mckenna guess i fell asleep again after you called me what time is it that late huh well maybe you better try mrs hanlon for me anyhow she had been asleep she said and she was a little slow about answering the telephone bugs apologized for waking her up and she said it was okay but she hadnt really wanted to see him about anything important so why didnt he give her a ring tomorrow bugs said he would and they hung up so that took care of that he hadnt left his room at the time of dudleys death or at least he had been in his room at the approximate time of that death of course the body might not be discovered immediately or even for hours and if it wasnt his alibi would be worthless or at least seriously weakened but again before he could feel any real sense of danger a solution presented itself nothing was required but to leave his room immediately and proceed straight to the elevators that gave him three witnesses instead of two it proved in the absence of contrary evidence that he had gone downstairs within seconds after his second awakening oh it wasnt perfect naturally no alibi ever is but it would take a finger to upset this one and a finger was conspicuously absent no one had seen him go to dudleys room no one had seen him leave and so necessarily no one could say that he had been there ed gusick greeted him unctuously bugs responded with his usual monosyllabic grunt and got out of the car at the mezzanine it was close to one oclock now and rosalie vara was absent having her dinner in the kitchen bugs guessed he walked down the mezz to its far end descended the staircase there to the lobby and turning to his left entered the coffee shop it was a popular place the one really good restaurant in town and even at this hour many of the tables and most of the counter stools were in use looking things over automatically bugs glanced at a table in a far corner of the room a table occupied by a taffyhaired young woman and a grinning sataniclooking young man bugs gulped and his heart did a hopskip ducking his head he started for his usual stool at the end of the counter but lou ford had already seen him hey bugs mckenna he stood up and beckoned insistently come on over bugs scowled and shook his head ford repeated his invitation at a shout come on fella dont be so skitterish got a friend here that wants to meet you bugs joined them there was nothing else to do blushing he mumbled an acknowledgement of fords jovial introduction to amy standish without raising his eyes he gave his order to the waitress he felt like his face was on fire he felt like he was smothering practically all women affected him that way until he got to know them but none had done so to the extent that amy standish did he heard an amused chuckle from ford angrily tossing the menu aside he forced himself to look up amy was smiling at him gently her small round chin resting in the palm of her hand you mustnt mind him mr mckenna she inclined her head toward the deputy hes just naturally ornery bugs tried to smile back at her he said he agreed with her in spades well dont you mind anyhow were friends now so theres nothing to feel shy or awkward about wwell well thanks bugs stammered i mean heck he aint shy ford drawled hes just embarrassed thats right aint it bugs youre just embarrassed about that day you come up to the house and busted in without knockin shut up bugs snarled i if you dont shut up ill yeah whats the matter i say somethin wrong bugs glowered at him amy looked curiously from one man to another what is the matter she said you may as well tell me lou now that youve started to i no mr mckenna im sure this concerns me and i want to hear what it is ford grinned at bugs he spread his hands easily why it wasnt nothin really all i was going to say was that bugs seen you in your birthday suit did he amy looked at him steadily didnt have a stitch on that i could see ford said and i sure could have seen any close as i was yes sir you went skittering out into the hallway naked as a jaybird stood there puttin on your underclothes while you was chewin me out yes well go on youre surely not going to stop there are you ford drawled that yes he guessed he would stop there probably aint a real fittin thing to talk about at table he added with unapologetic apology kind of looks like i maybe already sort of spoiled bugss dinner amy turned away from him seemingly at least for the moment he ceased to exist for her well she said well mr mckenna her voice was quiet too quiet her gaze too steady well she repeated we sounds like a deep subject remarked lou ford yes sir id say that was a plumb deep subject and thats a fact bugs suddenly shoved back his plate he shoved back his chair and stood up and amy smiled at him mistily and also stood she seemed to have been waiting for him to make the move he took her arm and they started for the door hey wait a minute now ford called after them where yall rushing off to but he didnt sound like he actually cared only sardonically amused and they continued on across the restaurant and out the door to the sidewalk bugs had paid down on an old coupe out of his last salary check and it was parked a few doors down the street he helped her into it and drove her home her house was a companion piece to fords was in fact in the same block as his and as in his case it had been her parents home and their parents before them they were both old family lou ford and amy standish the last survivors of two old families bugs considered that fact taking another look at her in his minds eye and he decided that she must be older than he orginally thought around thirty maybe maybe as old as thirtyone he stopped the car she smiled at him softly spoke as though answering a question and making an explanation ill be thirty my next birthday she said ive lived here all my life and ive never gone with anyone but lou what would you do in my place what would i considering my age and my background considering that there is a very limited number of eligible men in a place like this bugs didnt see what she was driving at or perhaps he didnt care to admit that he saw it he was pretty broadminded understand by his own admission and hed fallen for this amy standish the moment he saw her but falling for her liking and wanting her was one thing and something else was something else and hed already had one chuck of secondhand goods i guess i ought to be getting back to the job he said uncomfortably am i can i see you again i dont know mac is it all right to call you that i dont care for bugs i dont either and macs fine well how about it amy as i was saying i dont know mac im not sure that you should no it isnt that she anticipated him lou has told me quite a bit about you your past and that isnt a factor at all its just that that you think lou might not like it im not sure i cant tell you but she smiled with sudden brightness head tilted playfully to one side theres one thing i am sure of very sure of in fact there are several things im sure i like you a lot and im sure youve got the kindestlooking eyes ive ever seen and im sure she kissed him lightly on the mouth ive been wanting to do that for the last thirty minutes she laughed and scampered out the car she turned her head back through the window and another thing im sure you ask a great many questions on short acquaintance and then she was crying the laughter had changed suddenly to tears weeping she fled up the walk to the house bugs kicked open the door called a question after her yyes she stopped and whirled around why shouldnt you see me why shouldnt anyone everyone why why she started running again bugs let her go after all he was going to have this dudley matter to deal with tonight and hed damned well better keep his mind on it until it was safely wrapped up and aside from that well well he cursed cursing himself and lou ford with equal venom feeling frustrated his mind churning with confusion he drove back to the hotel ford was loitering in front of the entrance one boot heel hooked back against the bricks one of his thin black cigars in the corner of his mouth he slouched out to the curb as bugs climbed out of his car youre bein paged he announced looks like you got a suicide on your hands a suicide bugs managed a satisfactory start who was it how did it happen joyce hanlon drank herself a cup of poison guess she heard about you bein with amy and it plumb broke her heart he nodded soberly very long of face then as bugs gaped at him he laughed and slapped the big man on the back just jokin with you fella doubt if theys anything on the market that would make a dent in joyce very funny bugs snapped look has there actually been a suicide or oh sure theres been one all right sure looks like one anyway man name of well lets see if you can guess three guesses and if you hit it right ill give you a seegar never mind goddammit bugs started for the entrance of all the you mean you dont like seegars ford easily joined stride with him well seem as youre so impatientlike it was a fella named dudley alec dudley you know him i reckon sure i know him hes the hanlons auditor i dont mean i was wellacquainted with him but uhhuh then you wouldnt have any idea why hed kill himself dont know of any trouble he was in or whether he was feelin deespondent or anything like that no well lets see what we can find out ford linked arms with him companionably been waitin for you to come back before i did any investigatin me im a great hand for observin protocol as the sayin is guess you might call it my greatest vice and my strongest virtue they made the investigation together if such a casual asking of questions and lookingabout could be called an investigation then an ambulance having removed dudleys body they stood once more at the entrance of the hotel bugs didnt want to be there not with ford at least he wanted to be alone to relax his taut nerves to sort out his thoughts about amy standish but the deputy held him as if by an invisible magnet he didnt have anything to say he simply rambled on and on with his usual drawling rubeish chitchat until bugs was on the point of crawling out of his own skin and then ford broke off suddenly staring at bugs out of shrewd narrowly amused eyes aint you got some work to do he inquired his voice softhard hadnt you maybe ought to be gettin at it bugs said he had he added curtly that he couldnt very well work while he was standing around listening to a lot of goddamned nonsense ford nodded equably he took the cigar from his mouth and examined the tip and then swiftly he looked up his gaze striking into bugss face like a blow why listen to it then he said why not just say goodnight or go to hell and turn around and walk off youre all paid up with the law you got a clean conscience i reckon so whats the answer what are you afraid of why put up with me a minute more than you care to bugs looked down at the walk not answering him he couldnt he couldnt put his feelings into words nor naturally would he have dared to if he could have he was guilty technically guilty of at least manslaughter there was a growing impression in his mind that he had been given his job for a sinister purpose and that tacitly he had agreed to that purpose so he could be held by ford forced to bend to him and ford knew it and he was making him admit it the silence lasted for seeming hours then ford cleared his throat and his tone was casual again looks like you made quite a hit with amy cant say when ive seen her quite so taken with a fella howd you like her anyway i liked her fine bugs said gruffly a lot more than i should i guess yeah i mean well im just getting a start here never really had anything in my life and dont know that i ever will have and if shes your fiancee mmm well yeah i believe i did say that didnt i but thats kind of a loose expression out this away gal and a fella goes steady for years its just kind of taken for granted that theyre engaged dont really have to do nothin or say nothin about it themselves well said bugs i uh see had an idea you didnt like the way i talked to her tonight kind of got the impression you didnt like it atall i didnt i thought it was a goddamned lousy thing to do yeah uhhuh what do you mean yeah uhhuh i mean you got some right not to like it i mean just what the hell is she to you for you to like or dislike it sure you aint got nothing but youre still young and youre a pretty fair figure of a man and amy aint the kind to count the money in your pocket she was pretty taken with you thats all that counts with her and you seemed to reciprocate the feeling and remember i aint standin in your way got too much pride to use my job in a personal matter even if i did want to so lets have your answer just what the hell is she to you or maybe i should say whatd you like to have her be to you hell bugs squirmed whats this all about anyway im busy and i hardly know the girl and you can be unbusy a minute longer and maybe you know her too well you feel like you know her too well and you dont like what you know for gods sake ford i told you that why dont you say it spit it out say that she might be all right for you to play around with but she aint good enough for anything more so all right bugs thought savagely i do feel that way kind of and how can you blame me for that he didnt say anything however although he might as well have ford stared at him lip curling his face a mask of profane wonderment well i he said incredulously i will be a sonofabitch never let no one call me that in my life but ill say it myself i will be a dirty doubledonged sonofabitch a jailbird like you a stupid stubborn jerk that never did a damned thing right in his life thats fouled up everything and you think he turned slowly and walked away scowling defensively bugs reentered the hotel so maybe he had botched up his whole life or rather since it wasnt his fault it had been botched up for him that was why he had to be extra careful now because he wasnt so young any more and just about one more wrong move would foul him up for good and just where and this was what completely bewildered bugs where did ford get off at lecturing another guy about amy he was no good a crook and a grafter shed been a sweet clean girl and hed made her into something not so sweet and clean and then the lowdown louse he kidded her about it in front of a stranger he was that kind of guy he did that to her and yet he had the gall to bawl out the aforesaid stranger for his entirely natural concern with what had happened before he came along hell bugs thought i didnt say i held it against her did i hell shes still going with him isnt she hell i just met her didnt i hell hell hell hell bugs stood in a corner of the vaulted lobby smoking a cigarette in short angry puffs noting absently that rosalie vara had returned from her dinner or wherever she had been and was once again at work on the mezz she saw him looking at her and flirted a hand at him he grinned back weakly and sauntered toward the elevators well nuts he thought he was getting all up in the air over nothing getting the cart a mile in front of the horse this was a hell of a time to be thinking about amy standish her or any other woman to be thinking about anything except hanging onto his job and staying out of trouble and he wouldnt have been if ford hadnt hailed him there in the coffee shop and acted like the doubledistilled sonofabitch which he admitted being well well maybe it was all for the best maybe ford had done him a favor he hadnt been afraid exactly but naturally hed been pretty shaken up over what had happened to dudley and then ford had latched onto him diverting his mind from dudley until it could accept his death without shock until he was prepared to face up to the death in front of ford with no telltale nervousness yeah everything had worked out for the best the means hadnt been exactly pleasant maybe but the result had been perfect because he was safe now hed been in a mess that might have meant curtains for him but now he was safe he wondered why he felt so lousy he wondered why meaning as well as he did he was always getting into messes bugs was working as a guard in an aircraft plant when world war ii broke out since the beginning of his working career he had almost always landed in jobs as a night watchman or a guard or something of the kind he wasnt trained for a wellpaying position the kind a man might be proud to hold and having a little authority even at relatively low pay helped to buck up his ego this particular job was somewhat better than average and bugs did his best to hold onto it he did everything he was supposed to nothing that he shouldnt sticking to the rule book right to the letter and his best wasnt good enough the chief engineers wife showed up at the plant one day she had a pass as was required but she also had a sealed package and bugs over her vehement protests insisted on opening it it contained a box of sanitary napkins she departed the plant in tears about thirty minutes later just as quickly as she could reach her husband by telephone and he could get in touch with the plant superintendent bugs departed with his final paycheck the loss of the job lost him his draft deferment bugs went into the army where he shortly found himself an mp he was patrolling the airplane hangars one evening when he discovered a man in a russian officers uniform prowling amongst the planes accosted by bugs the man complimented him on his alertness and displayed the credentials of an american general well as bugs admitted at his courtmartial he recognized the credentials as genuine he had even recognized the general still the masquerade had been a damned stupid thing a violation of regulations in itself and he bugs had been entirely within his rights in insisting that the general march ahead of him to a guard post where an officer could dispose of his case the general had refused profanely and violently he had started to walk away from bugs bugs told him to halt when he kept on going bugs shot him in the hip the shooting cost him two years in the army stockade he was also sentenced to a dishonorable discharge but a higher court toned that down to a discharge under honorable conditions also remitting six months of his previously forfeited pay he was in san diego looking around and resting on the money when he met his wifetobe it happened one sunday at the citys justly famous zoo bugs was standing in front of the monkey cages one of the crowd of people tossing peanuts through the bars and watching the animals antics he was standing there gawking and grinning and thinking he looked pretty nice in his new suit of clothes when a monkey reached behind him suddenly came up with a brimming handful of ordure and flung it all over him talk about messes he looked like hed just crawled through a sewer and everyone was laughing at him really knocking themselves out and he didnt know what the hell he was going to do how he could get across town ten miles to his room where he could wash up and change clothes then a hand touched his arm closed over it gently and he looked down into a face that wasnt laughing but only tender and sympathetic and he realized later that a dame didnt get a pan on her like that in less than forty years but at the time she looked like an angel to him she had a little apartment nearby he was more than welcome to come there and get himself in order gratefully he accepted the invitation he bathed and scrubbed himself while she worked over his clothes in the kitchen then with a sheet pulled around him he sat down on the bed to wait for the return of the garments she came in with them finally dressed in a robe she started to hand them to him and somehow accidentallyonpurpose her robe fell open and apparently shed had some laundry to do of her own because she sure as hell wasnt wearing any naturally she was thoroughly mortified as she put it she felt just like sinking through the floor by the way of compromise she sank down on the bed instead where needless to say her nudity was promptly covered with more of the same she wept bitterly afterwards bugs almost made with the tears himself it was her first experience with a man possibly excepting the members of the pacific fleet and the local marine contingent and he was dismayed at having despoiled her they were married in arizona the next day it was the very least he could do to make her an honorable woman two weeks later when he came down with practically every disease in the venereal category he was still too unawakened to connect her with them and was completely satisfied with her theory as to how they had been contracted fortunately for himself at least he had just taken a job where a physical examination was necessary and with the ancientest of medical jokes the doctor rid him of his childish naivete a toilet stool eh he said do you sleep with a toilet stool of course i dont bugs frowned i sleep with my wife no one else dont do any playing around well then said the doctor well then young man and he spread his hands significantly bugs almost killed her except for the arrival of the police he might have been beating on her yet arrested and held for trial he would give no reason for the assault he had too much pride he was too ashamed of being taken for a sucker he was sentenced to six months in the county jail plus permanent banishment from the state released he started drifting arriving eventually in texas in the mushrooming townsbecomecities municipal employees were at a premium particularly if they were young and ablebodied and had anything at all in the way of police experience bugs fitted those specifications he also was an honorably discharged veteran true he had a bad record but in those hectic days a man might work a very long time before his record caught up with him if it ever did bugs became a city police patrolman after three months during which there was an almost one hundred per cent turnover in the departments personnel he was promoted to plain clothes it was in that job that he landed in his biggest and worst scrape one of the other dicks was a wildeyed constantly grinning boob with a penchant for practical jokes he didnt bother the other guys much and so was fairly wellliked by them but to bugs who had been fiendishly singled out as a born butt he was nothing less than maddening he was going off watch one evening when the guy lurched through the door of the lockerroom he was more wildeyed than usual drunk apparently yanking out his gun he announced that he had taken as much off of bugs as he intended to and that now he was going to kill him murmuring protests pulling long faces the other dicks got out of the way among them was one who only a moment before had asked to take a look at bugss gun with a view of making a swap bugs spoke to him out of the corner of his mouth begged him for gods sake to return the weapon the man didnt seem to hear him sweating he whispered a plea for someone to do something to step in and stop this character no one seemed to hear that entreaty either or ostensibly they were too shocked or frightened to heed it bugs let out a roar of fear leaping sideways suddenly he snatched back his borrowed gun whirled and fired he emptied the chamber and at that distance of course he couldnt miss the dick was dead before he hit the floor to state what is probably obvious he had only been playing another of his practical jokes and the other dicks had all been in on it it had been a crazy trick to pull in fact as was established at the autopsy the guy was crazy his erratic behavior was due to a tumor of the brain which in another year or less would certainly have killed him so bugs couldnt really be blamed for what he had done and with a different attitude on his part the matter might have ended with a departmental investigation unfortunately well you can probably guess what his attitude was it was anything but proper to a situation where a mans life had been lost he was goddamned glad hed killed the sonofabitch he said he should have done it long before given the opportunity hed do the same thing all over again he surlily repeated those statements at the inevitable trial those and others that were equally damning he shouted them as he was hauled out of the courtroom the recipient of the stiffest jolt that the law could give him and now tossing in his sleep im glad he told himself ive done nothing to be sorry about he they shes got no one to blame but herself ive got principles by god and no ones ever made me change em and she christ i wish i didnt have i wish he lurched and sat up in bed it was eleven oclock in the morning a few minutes after eleven and the phone was ringing he picked it up spoke with drowsy grumpiness yeah smckenna this is mike hanlon bugs mr hanlon id like to see you see me bugss throat tightened unconsciously uh now you mean now said hanlon and hung up the receiver it was the second time since the date of his employment that bugs had talked with hanlon the first occasion had been about ten days after he came to the hotel when at the old mans request or order he had taken him along on his nightly tour of the building hanlon had had to be in his wheelchair of course and in place of the stairs they had moved from floor to floor in one of the outofuse elevators the cars were very simple to operate bugs learned hanlon had taught him all there was to know about it in a few minutes also showing him how to open the elevator door from the outside thinking back on that evening several incidents which had had no meaning for him at the time began to acquire significance bugs had unlocked the car you did it by inserting a short rod through two holes in the door and bearing downward he had started to wheel hanlon into its darkened interior and the old man had gripped the wheels of his chair holding it immobile if bugs didnt mind he said wryly hed like the cars lights turned on before entering it bugs turned them on studying him shrewdly hanlon had explained the reason for his request like to make sure the cars actually there yknow cant really tell without the lights on might not be anything but the empty shaft but why wouldnt it be there bugs looked at him blankly if i left it with the door closed isnt exactly hard to open is it do it with practically anything strong enough to bear a little weight yeah hanlon nodded slowly things like that have happened a bellboy gets impatient and takes a floored car or a maintenance engineer thinks its been stalled and takes it for a test trip or maybe its just a fluke the thing slips on its cables thats happened too with cars that get a lot of heavy service anyway he concluded i dont enter any elevators unless im sure theres one to enter he had said rather shyly that there was a swell view from the roof so bugs had taken him up there he had wheeled him up close to the parapet and together fourteen stories up they had looked out over the twinkling thundering garishlylit forest of derricks the smell of crude oil was in the air the smell of natural gas fresh from its miledeep storehouses the smell of drilling mud and salt water and sulphur hanlon sniffed the breeze hungrily wasnt that something he asked wasnt that really something bugs said it smelled a lot like rotten eggs to him the old man stiffened but ignored the comment thats death out there bugs all over out there all dressed up and with his pockets full of dollar bills its the most dangerous business in the world did you know that coalmining construction they arent in it with the oil fields well its not so bad now that the big companies have moved in but the kind of operation i used to run that the average wildcatter runs god almighty insurance costs you practically as much as your payroll yep its death everywhere you turn and bugs it never bothered me much not out there i met the old boy day after day and i didnt like him naturally but i wasnt worried about him i wasnt afraid of him out there a gust of wind whipped across the roof it snatched the robe from the old mans knees and bugs grabbed at it his arm striking against and rocking the chair instantly he found himself looking down the barrel of a gun which the robe had concealed hey he grunted more surprised than alarmed what are you doing with that hanlon hesitated laughed apologetically you know id forgot i had the thing with me i was cleaning it today and i must have shoved it in my pocket afterward didnt discover it until now just as that robe blew off and when i made a grab for the robe he left the sentence unfinished bugs held out his hand mind if i take a look at it why sharply why do you want to look at it bugs was immediately haughty if you put it that way i dont want to forget i asked you hanlon handed it to him insisted that he look at it but the gun was kind of a pet with him apparently for he kept his eyes on it every second bugs could understand his attitude what he thought was his attitude he liked a good gun himself somewhat mollified he examined it and started to hand it back carry it for me bugs keep it until we get back to the suite thats all right bugs said misunderstanding i just wanted to look at it no id like to have you do it its kind of awkward for me in this chair bugs carried it back to the suite for him there hanlon asked him to prepare a dose of his medicine its in the cabinet above the sink the round bottle with the blue and white label i take three drops in a halfglass of water bugs entered the bathroom he drew exactly onehalf glass of water and cautiously dripped exactly three drops of the fluid into it he turned to leave and there was hanlon his chair wheeled up into the doorway thought id have you give me a drink of cold water first he explained mouth seems to have got a little dry up there on the rool bugs gave it to him gave him the medicine he said then that he guessed hed better be shoving off unless hanlon wanted something else nothing thanks and bugs he grinned in an odd way thanks very much for the excursion i cant tell you how much good its done me glad to do it bugs said gruffly any time youd like to go again just holler weell i wouldnt feel right about asking you telling you to do it its a lot of extra work for you and youre not paid to play nursemaid hell its no trouble i really dont mind at all mr hanlon bugs insisted well ill leave it up to you anyway hanlon said im usually up pretty late any time you feel like youd like to have a little company or theres something youd like to talk to me about why just stop by dont need to call beforehand just knock on the door and ill be rarin to go bugs was touched by the old mans eagerness moreover he sensed hanlons very genuine liking for him and appearances to the contrary he hungered for liking so he said theyd be seeing a lot of each other hed be dropping by soon and often and he really meant to and then he had got to mulling over the implications of the situation implications which would never have occurred to anyone but him and he had never dropped by nor did he intend to unless so ordered it just wouldnt do you see hanlon would misunderstand hanlon would think he was sucking up to him that he was the kind of guy who went around brownnosing the boss if he was ordered to wheel him around okay he did want to keep his job so hed follow orders to the letter but even then he wouldnt knock himself out being pleasant as he had done before hed make it clear that this wasnt his job that he wasnt a nursemaid to use a term which the old man had tactlessly used himself he knocked on the parlor of hanlons suite receiving no answer he unlocked the door with his emergency key a key used in opening doors locked from the inside and went in hanlon was on the terrace his chair drawn up to an umbrellashaded table he heard bugss entrance and gestured a greeting to him and bugs crossed the room and went out through the french doors coffee the old man motioned to a chair and poured from a silver pot sorry if i got you out of bed bugs thats all right bugs said not too graciously whats on your mind mr hanlon westbrook hanlon took out a cigarette looked at bugs over the tip i tried to get in touch with him early this morning when i couldnt i had his room checked it hadnt been slept in hes nowhere in the hotel i wonder if you know where he could have gone to me bugs set down his cup and it rattled slightly against the saucer how would i know i just asked give me a light will you bugs held a match for him hanlon gripped his hand and steadied it looking into his eyes did you talk to him yesterday bugs or last night i should say no sure about that one of the maids that pretty little vara gal saw him last night on your floor according to the telephone operator you were still in your room at the time i dont know of any reason why he would have been up there except to see you a bead of sweat rolled down bugss forehead a weak silly laugh welled out of his throat oh well yeah he laughed again ollie did stop by to see me for a few minutes but it was after midnight yknow think it was anyhow it was this morning not last night when you asked me if id seen him last night why why never mind hanlon grimaced distastefully what did he want to see you about nothing much i look mr hanlon bugs had a seeming inspiration i didnt want to tell you about his coming to see me because hed been drinking quite a bit i thought if you found out he was wandering around i need you to tell me that ollie drinks you think i didnt know it now you look hanlon crashed his fist down on the table i wasnt born yesterday or even the day before ive been around get me im not stupid get me im supposed to be smart get me and i damned well am and if youre halfway smart youll start talking he leaned back in his chair shakily after a moment he said all right im waiting bugs nodded all right i didnt want to tell you about it because well youll see why ollie did a quarterly audit of the books last night he discovered a big shortage better than five thousand dollars he couldnt prove it but he was sure that dudley had knocked down the money thats right hanlon said as though he were following a recitation with the text i knew it was something like that i warned ollie against the bastard i hate to speak ill of the dead but i told ollie at the time that if there ever was a sneak and a sharper excuse me bugs you were saying well thats about it he was worried to death he figured this place was his last chance if he lost out here hed never get another job and he was sure youd fire him and he didnt miss it either when you warn and warn a man about something and he still goes right ahead and well hanlon sighed grudgingly i guess id probably give him another chance shouldnt but i would hes a mighty good little man and i cant really fault him for being loyal to his friends bugs was calming down a little he said it was nice of hanlon to feel that way just practical bugs just practical the old man leaned forward confidentially do you suppose he will show up again in a few days you know as soon as he snaps out of his drunk well sure why not you cant think of any reason why not dont try to cover up bugs for him or me it just wouldnt wash id hate it if its like it could be like i was afraid it might be it would cause a hell of a scandal get us into a whopping lawsuit if dudley had anything as close as a fourth cousin but i still couldnt go for a coverup so if ollie had anything to do with what happened to dudley he didnt bugs said steadily he knew it wouldnt do him any good to see dudley he elaborated briefly explaining the matter as westbrook had explained it to him hanlon seemed something less than satisfied weell ill buy that part ollies a practical guy drunk or sober and he wouldnt have talked to dudley when he knew it wouldnt make him anything still he is missing and five thousand dollars is missing and dudley is dead dudley could have spent the money bugs shrugged he could have had it cached somewhere and as low as ollie was feeling yes i can see that too he cant face the music so he just goes off on a bat hes done the same thing in other places but this suicide hanlon lingered over the word as a cop bugs doesnt that jar the hell out of you dudleys stolen the money hes gotten away with it he cant be touched that being the case why it beats me bugs shook his head soberly probably there was some trouble in his past something that finally caught up with him well yes that could be of course and of course if a suicide behaved logically he wouldnt be a suicide yes that figures its not so unreasonable when you look on it that way youve taken a great load off my mind bugs bugs murmured modestly he held another match for hanlon s cigarette but im still left with one question the old man blew out the flame rather im left without the answer to one question i wonder if youd like to supply it bugs looked blank or tried to but he knew what hanlon meant it was the question hed been dreading why had westbrook visited him the night before just to babble just to explain his predicament to weep on a friendly shoulder or for another and very practical reason that was the question troubling hanlon bugs knew essentially the only question the one hed been leading up to right from the beginning and he knew something else that hanlon didnt really give a whoop about dudley per se that he was only mildly worried if at all about the possibility of a scandal or a lawsuit he was interested in dudleys death only in so far as it might be the forerunner of his own for if bugs had killed dudley if he would kill for money and bugs couldnt admit what he knew he couldnt confess to his growing conviction or suspicions that he had been hired for the purpose of murdering hanlon obviously he couldnt the admission that he entertained such suspicions while continuing to remain on the job would be damning in itself i dont know what youre talking about bugs said maybe youd better tell me ill tell you one thing bugs im not doing ford any favors and im not interested in playing cops and robbers or killers anything you say will be strictly between us so if it was an accident or even something a little more than that if you were just trying to do ollie a favor and you lost your temper or i dont know what youre talking about bugs repeated but i sure dont like the way it sounds now either stop beating around the bush or throw your stick away otherwise im walking out of here and if i do ill keep right on going that did it the return to his normal surliness hanlons eyes searched his face the haunted look in them giving way to relief forget it bugs he said its nothing important just a foolish idea i had for a moment well forget it and thanks very much for stopping by bugs started to leave at the doors to the terrace he paused and turned around he didnt know why he did it at the moment he didnt know why he said what he did it was something instinctive a long step forward or downward taken into the darkness of the future i was just thinking he said i promised id pick you up some night and wed do the rounds together yes oh yes i guess you did said hanlon well i didnt really expect you to bother about it no bother would you i dont suppose youd still like to go would you hanlon hesitated for the merest fraction of a second he seemed to waver a little to melt and lose form like candy over a hot flame then as though plunged suddenly into cold water he was himself again reassembled into a harder steadier self than he had been that split second before yes he said id still like to go why not bugs ill do it then bugs said ill stop by some night he returned to his room and went back to bed lying there wakefully too tired to sleep rested just sufficiently to keep him from resting more he struggled with a question why did i invite him anyway i didnt have to he didnt expect me to so why why the answer finally came to him aided by weariness it weeded its way through the many mental blocks he had set up burst forth into his consciousness and yes you know it it scared hell out of him it was three days after dudleys death that bugs received the letter a blackmail letter demanding the five thousand dollars which he had supposedly murdered dudley to obtain the writer left no doubt about the fact that he or rather she it just about had to be a she meant business she made it clear that she had the goods on him and she did have in a hideously false but irrefutable way and that failing to get the five thousand she would turn the matter over to lou ford so bugs was back again in his natural habitat that vulgarly named creek which he always seemed to wind up in and this time he was not only without a paddle but also a boat because naturally he didnt have and couldnt get the five thousand which he had to have or else he couldnt get five hundred he couldnt have scraped up fifty without seriously straining himself that left him with only one alternative to find out who the blackmailer was to find her and give her something in place of the five thousand this presented something of a problem of course but he had a good strong lead on the dame a pretty good idea of who she was he thought so it boiled down to a matter of leading her on concealing his suspicions and then but that was then all that began on the third day after dudleys death taking things as they came the events following his interview with mike hanlon bugs had a hard time getting to sleep in fact it was almost three in the afternoon before he finally did doze off then around six he was awakened by a soft but persistent rapping and his several whoisits and whatisits being ignored he yanked on his trousers and went to the door it was joyce hanlon dressed in her usual uniform of flankfitting skirt and overstuffed sweater she smiled at him brightly and bugs tried to smile back at her the best he could manage was a fearsome baring of teeth hi bugs she said were you asleep asleep oh no nothing like that he laughed hoarsely no i never sleep in the daytime i do that at night when im walking around the hotel oh well i hope i didnt wake you up bugs let out an angry moan he tried to control himself to smirk politely to say it was all right and that it didnt matter a bit but but she hoped she hadnt waked him up goddammit hed just got through telling her that he was asleep and then she hoped she hadnt waked him up how goddamned stupid could you get anyway and what did she want anyway the questions growled and snarled through his mind they rushed out of his mouth before he could stop them her eyes widened and she took a startled backward step well she said i cant say that i appreciate who gives a damn i just got to sleep for christs sake and then you i all right im sorry i didnt mean to blow my top but now thats better she said primly well arent you going to invite me in hell i guess so i mean certainly glad to have you i aah to hell with it come in or stay out whatever you damned please she marched past him mouth quirked cheeks flushed she sat down on the bed gingerly and bugs closed the door with a bang slouched down in a chair in front of her she crossed her legs brushed at a tiny crease in her skirt bugs plucked at an imaginary hangnail they looked up and their eyes met they looked quickly down again and then slowly up again and suddenly she exploded into laughter flung herself backward on the bed her heels drumming against its sides her entire body quivering and quaking with amusement oh bugs ha ha the way you looked like some old bear just out of its cave and when i asked you if youd been asleep ha ha ha when i asked you ooohwhoops ha ha ha ha bugs grinned chuckled selfconsciously tried to keep his eyes off those long luciously fleshed legs he said he guessed he had acted like the king of the grouches and that she shouldnt let it bother her now dont apologize im glad i feel like im finally getting acquainted with you and i was beginning to think i never would come here uh where what for bugs said here silly she held up her arms wiggled her fingers at him here to mama and what do you think what for so that was how it came about that was how bugs wound up in the hay with joyce hanlon the wife of his employer by talking ugly telling her to go jump to go to hell and like it or lump it that broke the ice between them advanced their relationship to a point which might ordinarily have taken months to achieve but it was a hayroll only in the literal sense just a petting spree with plenty of kissing and clinching and probing and pinching but without the usual climax and it was no fault of bugss that the climax was missing he might be straitlaced prudish but a man changes under enough stress also he couldnt feel that he was depriving or injuring hanlon the old man would be disappointed in him perhaps but he wouldnt care about her so such credit as was due for their continence was due to joyce it was she who held off holding him just far enough letting him go just far enough to keep a firm grip on him that she said was a bedtime story that wasnt nice that was something she really couldnt bring herself to do yet but why not dammit if you didnt intend to because thats why now be a sweet darling hmm give joyce one of those real pretty smiles horseshit with sugar on it hmm hmm come on now grouchy lets see you smile she tickled him in the ribs bugs squirmed grinned unwillingly now thats better what did mike want with you this morning honey what did he talk to you about nothing how do you know he talked to me at all now bugs im a very bright little girl and the wife of the owner finds out lots of things then find out what he talked to me about well hell bugs said it wasnt anything much just wanted a report on the suicide why i thought dudley had done it and so on yes well he was short in his books i know at least westbrook said he was incidentally i suppose youve heard that westbrook has yes yes joyce cut in forget westbrook all im interested in is dudley why you and him pally were you now silly i hardly knew him to speak to i doubt if id ever passed a halfadozen words with him why whoa whoa up now bugs drew his head back to look at her i just asked you a question its not a federal case well i didnt know dudley at all he was just another one of the employees as far as i was concerned i only asked about him because of you yeah yes now stop it bugs this is serious did mike did he blame you i mean well you know do you think he uh held it against you for any reason that he uh trusted you any the less because of it bugs was getting tired perhaps because of his increasing awareness that that was all he was going to get he studied her covertly noting the tiny wrinkles around her eyes a thin furrow of powder on her neck a dozen distasteful things which the excitement of sex play had blinded him to selfdisgust rose in his throat he felt ashamed dirty filthy he told himself and he meant it that he wouldnt take her now if she was served up on a platter god what had he been thinking about anyway what kind of a guy was he getting to be he knew what she was angling for and here hed gone right ahead and jumped at the bait no joyce he said no he does not trust me any less joyce not one damned bit and do you know why he doesnt joyce because he knows damned well he doesnt have any reason to and joyce he never will have he nodded his head firmly joyce gave him a playful pat on the cheek spoke with forced lightness now isnt that nice thats real nice isnt it yes said bugs i think its very nice its too bad that he isnt a younger man that hes sick and old he might do a great deal for you youre still young and whats the matter honey her eyes shifted nervously why are you looking at me like that i was just thinking bugs said you know i used to play a lot of football pretty good at the game at one time football but what it isnt worth getting up for so i was wondering whether i could give you a good hard kick in the ass from a prone position whaat she let out a gasp sat up angrily well of all bugs hand slid under her buttocks he boosted viciously and she soared from the bed came down on her feet on the floor now beat it he said clear out before i bounce you out she sputtered furiously her eyes raged for a moment there was something close to murder in them and then she laughed laughing down his threats leaving him frustrated and disarmed she wouldnt get angry with him she was not the kind to get angry where it would cost her and after her first brief flash of temper she had felt no anger the rough stuff shed been weaned on it shed known plenty of guys who substituted a kick in the slats for a kiss and more than once she had found herself thinking of them fondly they werent so bad some of those fellows at least a girl never got bored around them so as bugs grumbled and cursed futilely she sat down on the bed again rumpled his hair patted and poked him with caressing tenderness now just stop it you old bear big overgrown brute ill come back tonight after youve rested and youd bygod better not come back tonight well soon then whatever you say well have a nice sweet talk real soon and maybe get out of here okay mama knows hes tired so shell just tuck him in real good and mama mama bugss voice cracked with outrage jesus christ what kind of a woman are you anyway how the hell can now now just hold your legs out like a good boy she gripped the cuffs of his trousers pulled them off expertly draping them over a chair she tucked the bedclothes up under his chin and planted a lingering kiss upon his mouth now she said gathering up her purse now youll sleep good it was probably the misstatement of the century despite two cold showers and four aspirins he didnt sleep at all and it did no damned good at all to tell himself that he was eight kinds of a heel and that he ought to be ashamed he was ashamed he was also frightened plenty but it didnt change anything he was so far gone that when rosalie vara came to do his room he made occasion to brush against her she stood perfectly motionless for a moment still bent over from the bedspread then gently but firmly her rounded hips returned the pressure of his body bugs got out of the room fast by morning he was approximately his old self again he had wallowed in worry and reproach shrived his shamed soul with the acid of disgust and then finally he had emerged shaky a little frayed around the edges but also spotless practically and filled with firm resolve dammit every man had an occasional weak moment every man played the jerk at least once that didnt mean however that he was a weak man or that he would continue to be a jerk on the contrary he was better off for having got the nonsense out of his system bugs was all right now he told himself he was back on the ball again and he intended to stay there thered be no more of this hankpanky not only that but hed steer clear of any and all situations which might lead to such he hung a dont disturb sign on his door when he turned in he also warned the telephone operator that he would accept no calls from anyone except of course mike hanlon hanlon didnt call bugs got a solid ten hours of sound sleep awakening about six in the evening he yawned and stretched luxuriously he squirmed against the pillows grinning with contentment and then remembering his resolutions and the dangers they were meant to forefend he almost flung himself from the bed he bathed shaved and dressed by seven oclock he had finished his dinner in the coffee shop and was out of the hotel and it would be a good four hours before he was due on the job hed already seen the picture playing at the local movie house he had no money to waste on gambling even if he had been inclined toward such diversions and nothing can be more wearisome than simply driving or walking around with no objective in mind so he stepped into a drugstore and called amy standishs house he wanted to see her he had meant to he guessed from the moment he had waked up he had a feeling that being with her again would do much toward expunging the memory of his session with joyce hanlon she didnt answer the phone he hung up with an annoyed sense of having been mistreated he could be like that almost childish once he decided to do something he wanted to do it right then and he was unreasonably affronted if he couldnt shed said he could see her again hadnt she well why couldnt he then why didnt she stay at home like she ought to he walked around for a halfhour and called again still no answer smoldering and stubborn he continued to call at thirtyminute intervals and finally a few minutes after ten oclock she answered the phone by that time of course it was too late to see her to do anything more that is than get out to her house before he had to turn around and come back oh mr mck mac she said and was there or was there not a trace of disappointment in her voice were you trying to get me a little while ago probably been trying to get you all evening bugs grunted oh im sorry id just stepped in the door and i got to the phone just as fast as i could but it doesnt matter bugs cut in gruffly i just thought we might have got together for a soda or a drink or something ridden around a little while but i suppose you probably enjoyed yourself a lot more with doing something else the phone went silent quiet with rebuke or indecision then she spoke not with coolness perhaps but something not too distantly akin to it i was working mac at the library the library i thought you were a teacher i am the librarys in the school and its only open in the evenings we teachers have to take turns serving as librarian bugs waited not knowing quite what to say feeling that it was up to her to go on from that point at last he broke the dragging silence with a gruff i see and i suppose youll be working there tomorrow night too yes as a matter of fact i will i have these two nights together i see bugs said again okay forget it sorry i bothered you he started to slam up the receiver her quick cry stopped him just before it went down on the hook wait mac mac yeah yeah he said quickly im still here amy i was just going to say that ill be through by nine or a few minutes after just as soon as i can get the patrons out and lock up if youd like to meet me then swell fine bugs exclaimed i mean yeah i can do that i guess thatll be all right she drew a quick breath she frowned he could hear the frown in her silence just as he had heard the rebuke and then and he knew it as well as he was standing there she was smiling it began with her lips curving them with lovely tenderness it spread slowly over the heartshaped face dimpling her cheeks gently indenting the laugh lines and then it was in her eyes lighting them up as though the sun had arisen behind them mac she said mac youre crazy huh well yeah bugs admitted sheepishly i guess i probably sound like it sometimes fortunately i like crazy people particularly those named mckenna who work as house detectives now isnt that a happy coincidence bugs swallowed a warm pleasantly prickly feeling spread over his hulking body there were a thousand things he wanted to say and he couldnt cut loose with one of them amys voice came over the wire soft and understanding im glad you called mac and ill look forward to seeing you and now good night and very gently she broke the connection bugs returned to the hotel walking on the sidewalk ostensibly but seemingly treading on air it was preposterous to feel that way over a girl who over lou fords exgirlfriend if she was his ex but that was the way he did feel and nuts to whether it was preposterous or not in fact with very little effort he managed to exclude ford from his thoughts about her he could cut that tinstarred lunk out of the picture as completely as though he did not exist which to bugss way of thinking would have improved the world by several thousand per cent there were two telephone callslips in his room box two requests that he call mrs hanlon bugs ripped them into shreds dropped them into a sand jar and started on his nightly rounds it was an unusually quiet night a good night bugs supposed to take mike hanlon along with him still there wasnt any rush about it and he didnt feel like carrying on an extended conversation as he would have to with hanlon so he dropped the idea and went it alone there was a little ruckus on the tenth floor some poker players in a corner suite bugs asked them to quiet down and replied to with belligerence he quieted them he elbowed one guy across the windpipe he grabbed another by his necktie and slapped him in the chops he hustled the remaining two who had been drinking heavily into the bathroom and shoved them under the shower then he gathered up the cards and chips tossed them down the waste chute and calmly departed that was the only trouble he encountered on his whole tour well there was a very small rift in the routine on the sixth floor a guy was pounding on a door with the butt of his sixshooter threatening to kill his wife as soon as he got inside but he was just drunk and the gun which bugs took away from him proved to be empty so there was really nothing to get the wind up about nothing else happened nothing that is that was worth a second thought in bugss opinion by a few minutes after one he had completed his rounds and was back in the lobby again leslie eaton was talking on the telephone as he started past the desk he saw bugs and gestured to him silently mouthing a name bugs shook his head and went on toward the coffee shop joyce again well let her call all she damned pleased when she got tired maybe shed quit he no longer felt obligated to her neither needless to say did he feel constrained to be pleasant or polite to her she was a tramp she couldnt lose him his job do anything at all to hurt him with hanlon and she was smart enough to know it the night wore on uneventfully strolling about the hotel wandering through the always amazing world that was the backothehouse bugs wondered about westbrook what had happened to the little man how had he disappeared so suddenly and completely and yet there was really nothing much to wonder about was there the manager had been without hope convinced that he was thoroughly and finally washed up as an alcoholic then he had taken refuge in booze abandoning all else before it could be taken from him as he was sure it would be holing up in some dive where he could drink and drink and drink until it was too bad bugs thought sadly it just went to show that a man shouldnt throw in the sponge too quickly all westbrook would have had to do was make a clean breast of things to hanlon if he had done that he would still be on the job none the worse except for an a chewingout there was something else that bugs wondered about a riddle which at last would no longer be ignored what had become of the five thousand or whatever the exact sum was that dudley had stolen certainly the auditor must have had it specifically he had had it in his trousers their zippered moneybelt rather from which he assumed bugs had stolen it you just couldnt account for his attitude in any other way you couldnt at least except by a fantastic stretch of the imagination and that being the case bugss thoughts reached this point and could go no further so he indulged in some of the aforesaid imaginationstretching hell dudley might have stashed the loot somewhere and forgotten that he had or well maybe hed lost it or maybe it wasnt the dough that hed gotten so excited about maybe he hadnt stolen it and it had been something else that had made him make that wild lunge at bugs you couldnt be sure could you the room had been dark theyd hardly exchanged a halfdozen words and everything had happened so fast been over and done with in the space of seconds yeah bugs thought there was bound to be some simple explanation for the missing money just about had to be otherwise well he wouldnt let himself think about that he preferred to think about amy standish and this new life he was building for himself and he did he turned in early again that morning he again hung the dont disturb sign on his door and left word to the same effect with the telephone operator he got another good days sleep he had dinner in his room and by eight oclock was on his way out of the hotel passing the desk he saw two white oblongs in his keybox he grinned sourly and went on leaving them there a pretty stubborn gal this joyce hanlon well let her be it didnt bother him any the school a combination high and grade was on the immediate outskirts of town adjoining the brief blocks of houses which comprised the old family section bugs idly circled the ancient redbrick structure then since it was stifi well before nine oclock he drove back past the austere old houses looming aloofly in the night like so many boxlike fortresses driving as slowly as he could it took him no more than a couple of minutes he returned to the school and parked at a minute or so after nine the doubledoors of the school opened and a trickle of people youngsters and a few adults came down the walk a few minutes later the building lights that had been on went off and amy came out she smiled and squeezed his hand as he helped her into the car he restarted the motor asked her where shed like to go oh anywhere just so its not too far i have to work tomorrow and i know you dont have much time either well like to turn into town pick up a couple drinks no the word came out almost sharply and then she laughed with a trace of sadness and apology this is a small town mac the people are pretty free and easy about some things but never their women and theyre the direct opposite of free and easy when it comes to women schoolteachers i see bugs yanked the car into gear you have to be careful about your reputation yes she said evenly i have to be careful about my reputation they rode over to the highway to a recently erected drivein restaurant after consulting her stiffly bugs ordered malted milks and hamburgers he had no appetite for the repast but she ate hers to the last bite and swallow gaily making a joke of it she even finished the frenchfries he had left on his plate by then it was ten oclock and time to be going at least she said timidly she was afraid shed have to i was up so late the other night you know and i know bugs grunted but that was on a date with ford that made it all right yes with someone ive known all my life someone i supposedly was going to marry it was all right and anything else would be no anything would not in fact she left the sentence unfinished her voice trailing away wearily and worriedly then she sighed and said im sorry mac thats about all i can say at this point that im sorry what the hell bugs shrugged you dont owe me any explanations no i dont or any apologies either i simply said i was sorry because i like you and i thought it might make you feel better much of bugss hurt and anger went away and his feeling of compassion returned he stopped the car in front of her house turned humbly and faced her im a dope he said a big fatheaded dope and you can take that as an apology and explanation all right her smile came back and mac i would like to see you longer than this just for an hour or so it hardly gives us time to say hello does it so would you like to come here and have dinner with me tomorrow night would i bugs beamed but that would be a lot of trouble for you and no it wouldnt not in any way theres a negro woman who used to work for the folks i can get her to come in and help and by the time shes eaten herself and got things cleared up hed be gone thered be a third party with them throughout the evening she looked at him obviously anxious but too proud to press the invitation choking back his resentment bugs said hed be very glad to come to dinner then its all settled you can come early around six and well have the whole evening together and now she leaned back in the seat held her arms out if youd like to kiss me good night id like to have you bugs drew her to him he kissed her not at all in the way that he wanted to nor in the way that subconsciously he felt that he was entitled to it was no more than a gentle touching of their lips and his arms were loose around her body she drew her head back studied his hard face dreamily she brushed a lock of hair from his forehead and said thank you mac thank you very much youre thanking me what for you know for not spoiling things for not making me feel that but i knew you wouldnt you couldnt with eyes as kind as yours yeah bugs said gruffly kind of screwy you mean i mean kind good like they had seen so much hurt that they could never cry enough hell i never cried in my life then i think its about time and i think youll be happier when you do but anyway her voice sank to a drowsy murmur kiss me again mac and mac if you want to do it a little harder he kissed her again a very little harder only a little less chastely she thanked him simply as she had before and then they said good night and parted bugs drove back to the hotel very happy and pleased with himself ignoring the tiny voice which jeered him for a chump and insisted that he was a sucker he felt good he had a nice thing going here why wonder about its niceness then why take it apart to see what made it tick he stopped at the desk and got the stuff out of his box he almost tore the letter up before he discovered that it was a letter and not another of joyces callslips absently his mind still on amy he sat down in a corner of the lobby and opened it mr mckenna you killed mr dudley i know you did because i was in the bathroom and i heard everything that happened and if you are stubborn or uncooperative i wifi see that mr lou ford knows about it you have a choice mr mckenna you can mail five thousand dollars to me at the address below or you can go to jail perhaps to the electric chair naturally id prefer that you did the former since telling what i know would necessarily be embarrassing for me and would make me nothing but i will do it if i dont get the money the choice is up to you mt mckenna better not delay in making it jean brown c o general delivery westex city texas the letter was printed neatly in pencil the text as well as the address on the envelope it was postmarked westex city but that was just a dodge of course the blackmailer was right here in the hanlon someone who had been on intimate terms with dudley and who knew enough about him bugs to know that he had two strikes against him it had to be also considering the circumstances of the blackmailers rendezvous with dudley it just about had to be a woman one of two women for bugs could think of only two with the necessary qualifications both would have some knowledge of his past both would have or could have known dudley well both could come and go about the hotel without attracting attention joyce hanlon well she was capable of it all right and it would perfectly suit her purposes to swing a club like this at him she wouldnt actually want the money of course it would simply be a means of making him sweat crowding him into a corner then she would step in and offer him a way out unfortunately unfortunately since bugs wanted her to be the culprit he knew that joyce could not have been the lady in the bathroom hed talked to her seconds after dudleys tumble from the window she couldnt possibly have got from dudleys room to her own in time to receive that call so that left rosalie vara she had to be it rosie whom he had always liked and gone out of his way to be nice to shed gotten the five grand and now well maybe dudley had kidded her that he had more another five or maybe she was just making the old college try a man may not have much but hes apt to bust a gut getting it if it seems the only way to stay out of jail or the chair bugs shredded and reshredded the letter and dropped it into a sand jar he guessed he must have kind of been expecting something like this although not from rosie because he was worried naturally but not greatly surprised this was the kind of lousy break he always got it would have been damned strange if he got anything else but hed smartened up a lot since his last bad break and he had a lot more to fight for than he used to have so maybe hed wind up catching it in the neck again catching it worse than he ever had before but he sure as hell didnt plan to what he planned was something else entirely rosie slowly his eyes lifted up to the mezzanine seeking her then shifted to the huge squarefaced clock at the head of the lobby eleventhirty shed be or should be up on the room floors at this time bugs pushed himself up from his chair he strolled over to the elevator bank and ascended to the twelfth floor he was very calm casual maybe he guessed the full implications of his predicament hadnt had time to register on him or it could be that he found it hard to feel anything much toward rosie but hurt and irritation at any rate he had seldom been calmer more sure of himself in his life she had admitted herself to his room with her maids key and was now busily at work bugs got some cigarettes and a clean handkerchief out of his dresser drawer said that yes he had been getting out of the room early the last couple of nights figured i was getting stale yknow just eating and sleeping and working im going to try getting out a lot more from now on well now i think you should mr mckenna she nodded seriously this night work well of course im very happy in my job but i do find myself getting into a rut it was an opening shed handed it to him herself casually bugs moved into it you get that way too huh well look im driving over to westex city the day after tomorrow pulling out right after work how about coming along with me with you she gave a start but but fellow ive got to see a few miles the other side of westex owns a lot of property in that section im having him rush me some money tomorrow so ill have to go over and fix up a note or something but well thats awfully nice of you to ask me mr mckenna but i i could drop you off there in town and pick you up in a couple of hours dont suppose it would be very exciting for you just the ride and lunch but mr mckenna she said mr mckenna yeah i dont think id better there isnt as much prejudice here in the southwest as there is in the south but i am a negro and so what bugs shrugged you dont look like one you wont be wearing a sign on your back her eyes flashed her lips came together in a proudly angry line because even for bugs mckenna the statement set a new high or low for tactlessness and yet maybe it was that tactlessness the apparently complete lack of guile that turned the trick she stared at him a moment eyes narrowed lips compressed bugs looked back at her the very picture of innocence personified and suddenly she was laughing bubbling over with delicious amusement all right mr mckenna she dabbed at her eyes id like to go very much if youre sure you want me and as you say i wont have a sign on my back now i didnt mean that like it sounded bugs said sheepishly i i know i know how you mean it the day after tomorrow you said thats right ive got an appointment here in town tomorrow anyway i have to be here to receive the money this fellows sending me it went over perfectly it seemed to bugs she left and he locked the door and sat down at his writing desk he took a halfdozen sheets of stationery from the drawer tore them into crude oblongs he stuffed them into a lettersize envelope and stamped and addressed it later that night he mailed it at a box outside of the hotel the night passed in the usual manner of his nights retiring at the end of his shift he followed the routine of the previous two mornings it wouldnt work indefinitely he guessed joyce was a very determined dame and she was playing for big stakes so sooner or later shed start pressing shed ignore that sign on his door or insist that the operators put her calls through but first things first hed take care of her when the time came right now there were other things to be taken care of he arose at five oclock was on his way in thirty minutes there were a couple of callslips in his box and he leaned over the desk to make sure they were callslips leaving them in the box he went out the doors to the street he bought a bouquet of flowers the best that five dollars would buy also after a little mental calculation he bought a onepound box of candy carrying these modest burdens he knocked on amy standishs door at five minutes of six he knocked he knocked and knocked he noticed for the first time that all the shades were drawn that there was no sound of activity in the house he hesitated uneasily wondering if he could possibly have got mixed up on the invitation whether it had been for tonight or some other night and the door cracked open an inch and amy spoke to him through the crevice mac her voice sounded muffled choked up what are you didnt you get my message message oh bugs said remembering well i guess there was one in my box but im sorry well have to make it some other night mac but look whats the matter bugs protested whats wrong did i do something that no its nothing you did i i cant talk about it now mac now if youll excuse me please mac bugs persisted stubbornly hell if she was sick or something he wanted to know about it suddenly her voice cracked rose hysterically i said to go on leave me alone ive told you and told you that i ccant talk and if you had any sense youd youd the door slammed in his face bugs glowered at it furiously then he flung the candy and flowers to the porch and stamped back to the car he had a very bad time with himself for the next few hours disappointment mingled with anger and anger with hurt and it was a very bad time so bad that it burned itself out before much of the night had elapsed and he could reason and be reasonable of course there was no excuse for what amy had done couldnt be any that he could think of still she had doubtless thought she had a reason for standing him up even if she didnt have and no matter how sore he was or had been he couldnt see her pulling such stunts for the hell of it to see that is how much she could get away with shed been badly upset too she hadnt liked it any better than he did he became reasonably placid again reasonably at peace with himself by the end of his shift he had firmly decided to forgive amy provided naturally that she was properly contrite and that she satisfactorily explained her actions he picked up rosalie vara a couple blocks from the hotel he had previously purchased a couple of containers of coffee and some sweet rolls and they ate breakfast as they rode neither did much talking rosalie seemed very tired from her nights work and bugs was reluctant to talk in view of what he had to do and what she was doing to him even maintaining a decent silence was an almost intolerable strain westex city was a city in fact as well as name not a large one the population was under fifty thousand but one that was prosperous and important since it was the field headquarters for various oil companies it was less than sixty miles from ragtown but what with the narrow highway and the heavy traffic it was almost eleven when bugs and rosalie arrived he made arrangements for meeting her later entirely unnecessary arrangements he thought grimly and asked where she would like to be let out she said politely that any place in the business district would be fine so he dropped her off seven or eight blocks from the post office he drove on as though he were heading out of town then after a block or so he whipped around a corner and sped back toward the business section he found a suitable parking place a sidestreet spot which was near his destination and hers he left the car in it hastened up to the main thoroughfare and entered a restaurant it was directly across from the post office seated a few stools down the counter he could see both entrances of the building if he had been less intent on those entrances if say he had taken a good look around the restaurant he might have seen but no probably he wouldnt have the place was expensive pretentious dimly lit in the sometime fashion of such places so even if he had looked around it is doubtful that he would have seen the two people in the distant rear booth but he could be seen not by amy standish since her back was to the entrance but lou ford seated on the opposite bench could see him perfectly he gave no sign of the fact to amy made no mention of bugss presence he went on with his meal drawling idly grinning at the girls bitter or dispirited rejoinders but he was watching interestedly noting bugss watchfulness the course of his intent stare and so he saw what bugs saw and when bugs jumped up and left the restaurant he also arose bugs had given her a couple of minutes inside the post office he reached the entrance just as she was coming out of it shoving something into her purse and her eyes widened and she stopped dead in her tracks why mr mckenna she faltered what i thought that i know what you thought bugs gripped her by the arm come on but her trembling smile fell apart she held back fearfully bbut what have i done why are you im warning you rosie bugs gritted i dont want to hurt you but if you dont move ill move you ill rip that arm right off you she held back a moment longer started to say something else then all the spirit seemed to go out of her all the quiet pride and selfassurance and she went with him meekly he hustled her back to his car he shoved her into it roughly crowded in at her side she was crying a little now pressing her fingers against her eyes to hold back the tears bugs took here purse and yanked it open the place was a few miles outside of ragtown there are places like it near almost every town and city areas densely overgown with trees cluttered with shrubs and bushes laced with a winding maze of footpaths and car tracks they are isolated yet easily accessible they have various names all carrying the same slyly lewd connotation the two girls women of about thirty had draped their clothes over some convenient tree limbs now stripped to their slips they shivered in the chilly west texas morning wonder whats keeping those guys grumbled the girl called peg why the hell couldnt they undress here like we did now honey murmured her companion gladys real swell fellas like that you cant ask a lot of questions you dont find guys every day that pop for twenty bucks yeah i guess you spose our purses are all right in the car glad why not the fellas are lockin it up tight arent they well i wish id brought my coat with me anyhow i paid five hundred bucks for that hunk of fur and and what did i pay for mine hon exactly the same wasnt it we both started saving for em at the same time now you know we wouldnt want to drag those nice coats around these bushes but im cold darn it im absolutely freezing well now you wont be very long hon the fellas are bound to the sudden roar of a motor drowned out her sentence a lessening roar as a car was slammed into gear and driven away the girls looked at each other dumbfounded they broke into curses scampered a few futile steps in pursuit then weeping they fell into one anothers arms ed and ted gusick were stripping the purses as they drove slowing down they tossed them into the bushes then gathered speed again and then as they neared the highway ted suddenly slammed on the brakes a man had stumbled out of the underbrush tumbled directly in the path of their car he lurched to his feet again a man in shape only a ragged bedraggled stinking bundle of filth cursing frightfully he wobbled toward them friggers caught you didnt i upn the goddamned floor an no friggin around about it listen mr westbrook ted and ed eased out of the car watching him cautiously its me you know ted gusick and heres ed right here with me now no scuses westbrook bellowed makes no difference who yare either ycut the stuffr ill show you by god he came at them in a rush ted tripped him nimbly ed caught him under the arms and lowered him gently to the ground he began to cry sobbing out curses as the tears streamed down his bristled filthsmeared face ed looked worriedly at his brother jesus he whispered what are we gonna do with him ted do with him why were gonna take him with us you jerk but what then i mean what are we gonna do ted didnt have the slightest idea being at a loss for one and in typical gusick fashion he responded with a kind of selfrighteous abuse i suppose you want to leave him here you rotten sonofabitch just walk off and leave a fine man like mr westbrook well i always thought you were pretty goddamned lowdown and now by god i know it he swung irritably landing a painful punch in eds ribs ed swung with identical results these formalities dispensed with they loaded westbrook into their car made him peaceful with a gently expert tap on the button and drove off they lived in the oldfamily section of town in an excellent apartment which before its transformation had been the loft of the family barn the building was on an alley a good two hundred feet removed from the house the lower floor was boarded up and the only entrance to their apartment was from the alley briefly they could just about do as they pleased come and go as they pleased without being heard or observed and lovers of privacy that they were for reasons which need not be gone into they were delighted to pay the boomtown rental of three hundred dollars a month they got westbrook up the stairs unseen and installed him in the master bedroom they bathed him fed him waited on and catered to him and they continued to do so from that day on they got him through the dts with drugs pilfered from the hotel doctor they doled out drinks to him trying to taper him off the binge they were partially successful in this getting him down to a mere few pints a day but even this relatively small amount combined with westbrooks totally hopeless outlook was enough to keep him sodden he had nothing to hang on to nothing to go forward or back to so he succumbed to the booze accepted its deadening and deadly embrace without resistance ted and ed pleaded with him they declared as they believed that he was the best damned hotel man in the country one of the few real hotel men left and if hed just pull himself together things were going to pot at the hanlon a new manager had lasted just one day and now old mike was trying to swing the job himself with the help of the chief clerk and brother were they bitching up the joint hed be tickled to death to get mr westbrook back if hed just get off the goddammed whiz so so how about it huh mr westbrook get right off it huh sir and everythingll be swell westbrook wept babyishly charging them with prevarication and boobishness then getting a grip on himself he lashed them with earpurpling profanity he would do something all right he would keep them under the closest observation see to it that they did not cut his throat and steal his clothes as indubitably they planned on doing he would see to it that they conducted themselves properly while in his presence that never in any way did they give any outward manifestation of their pimpish thieving shiftless impertinent and generally bastardly souls they would tell him no more of their goddamned lies about the hotel and anything they said would be a goddamned lie he had put up with them as long as he intended to and from now on by god they would toe the mark or he personally would kick the crap out of them and i can do it get me this with a belligerently redeyed glare you think i cant just give me a little more trouble yes sir certainly sir mr westbrook all right then open nother bottle and be quick about it they obeyed they continued to in their feudal minds the fact that a liegelord had lost his sanity did not lose him the right to reign he was still the boss he was authority he was a symbol of something which far more than the socially enlightened the ted and ed gusicks find necessary to existence during the day they took turns about waiting on him before departing for work at night they set out whiskey food and cigarettes everything he might need or want or think he needed or wanted and never again did they mention the hotel in his presence he had told them not to moreover in his increasingly sodden state it had become impossible to talk to him one night or rather very early one morning westbrook awakened with a feeling of having been reborn his head was entirely clear there was none of the hideous shaking the gutwracking nausea which normally accompanied his awakenings actually he was in a state of euphoria nature was giving him one last unhampered whirl at life before closing in for the kill but the sense of optimism and wellbeing seemed entirely valid and while it lasted he dumped every bottle of his liquor into the toilet he had scarcely done so when he was plunged back into the abyss to a far deeper depth than he had previously penetrated a convulsion wracked him doubled him with terror and pain invisible hands gripped his head squeezing tighter and tighter and still tighter until his brain squirmed and screamed in agony he looked around wildly he saw the empty bottles on the floor and had no memory of how they had got there ted and ed he thought it was they who had done this to him theyd been after him to stop drinking and now kill em he mumbled fiercly kill em kill em kill em i i got to have something i i got to have staggering into the kitchen he pawed frantically through the cupboards he went from room to room jerking out drawers knocking over furniture upturning cushions and mattresses in the bathroom medicine cabinet he found a pint bottle of rubbing alcohol he clutched it to his breast and staggered back into the kitchen he set a small pan on the work shelf he held a stack of bread over it started to filter the alcohol through the bread and his hand jerked convulsively crashing the bottle against the wall he screamed sobbed over the terrible loss for a moment he was too dispirited and hopeless to go on then he jerked open the refrigerator and began jerking out its contents there was nothing in it nothing westbrook thought angrily but crap food the bastards oh those fiendish sneaky bastards theyd loaded their refrigerator with eggs and butter and milk and cream and steaks and roasts and dozens of worthless items and not a lousy wonderful drop to drink kill em westbrook babbled kill em if its the last thing i ever do ill ill back in the rear of the refrigerator concealed until now by a bag of grapefruit was a bottle a juglike gifttype carafe filled with a chocolatey liquid it would be syrup of course they had guessed that he would be dying by now and had planned this ultimate and unbearable disappointment to shove him over the brink westbrook thrust his head inside the refrigerator scraping his ears in the process squinting the print wavering and blurring before his eyes he read the label on the bottle creme de cacao a full fifth minus a sip or so of seventyproof liqueur westbrook let out a low moan he started to grab for it then remembering the horrible accident with the alcohol he held a pan against the shelf and raked the bottle into it he put the pan on the floor he tilted the bottle on its side and pulled the cork there was a gentle gurgle a rich brown flow whimpering westbrook reached for a teacup he wasnt risking the loss of a drop of this they might fool him once by god but they couldnt do it twice hed get it all out into the pan and the flow stopped something inside the bottle had lodged in its neck westbrook moaned piteously somehow he managed to nip the obstruction between a trembling thumb and forefinger and yanked it out the wonderful gurgling resumed westbrook tilted the bottle cautiously assisting the flow finally his patience exhausted he snatched it up shook out the few remaining drops and hurled it into the corner and then at last he drank he drank two full cups one after the other cheeks puffed eyes bulging he shuddered violently he sighed and leaned back against the refrigerator breathing in long deep grateful breaths he got a cigarette lighted picking up the pan and he could trust his hands now he started to fill his cup again something plopped into it the object that had stopped up the neck of the bottle gingerly he got it between two fingers examined it frowning it wasnt a cork as he had thought it was a small balloon stuffed tightly with something and its end closed with a rubber band a premonitious shiver ran through westbrook he wiped the thing off with his handkerchief wiped his fingers clean and ripped open the balloon the stuffing fell to the floor it consisted of currency a tightly rolled wad of fivehundreddollar bills he counted them and a low yowl of mingled triumph and outrage spewed through his teeth outrage yes for while he didnt know how theyd latched onto this dough he knew damned well where it had come from dudley had been short five grand and here was five grand and if they hadnt stolen it from him the self same sum that he had pinched who had they stolen it from and if it wasnt stolen laughable thought if it wasnt too hot to handle why had they hidden it so carefully the questions were nonsensically elementary their answers axiomatic to a man of westbrooks background he thought of the terror and hopelessness he had lived in because of the theft and his lips parted in another yowl now i am going to do it he vowed grimly now i will kill them there was a supply of clean shirts underclothing and the like in his bedroom and his suit unworn since he had moved in here was also cleaned and pressed he bathed and shaved dressed himself meticulously he made and drank a pot of coffee casually kicking the creme de cacao pan out of his way alcohol why had he ever wanted the stuff what could it give him that he didnt have or could easily get well no matter he didnt want it now and he had a strange conviction that he would never want it again he finished the coffee then he began prowling through the apartment looking in closets and on shelves studying various maneuverable objects he took his time about it and at last he found exactly what he was looking for a heavy wooden rod some three inches in circumference and approximately four feet long it was installed in a closet where it served as a clothes hanger rack ripping it out he took a few practice swings with it and grimly satisfied returned to the living room this would do the trick he thought he wouldnt quite kill those bastards but hed make them think theyd been killed hed god he said suddenly god he flung the pole from him whats the matter with me whats been the matter with me and when the gusicks arrived from work he only talked to them there was nothing funny about theft he said it was not amusing or shrewd or sharp ever to inflict pain or loss upon another and it was the job of everyone not just the individual affected to see that no one suffered preventable pain or loss you had to do it otherwise you had no peace you had constantly to keep your guard up and when you wearied as you inevitably must you got it in the neck yourself he liked them he went on in many ways he was deeply indebted to them they were sharp and on their toes and he liked that but if they were to work under him again they had better be sharp in the right way and he hoped hed made it clear what the right way was that was what he said in substance having said it and clutching the money tightly in his pocket he returned to the hotel but this as has been indicated was days after dudleys death and the fate of bugs mckenna and various other parties had already been settled there was nothing incriminating in rosalie varas purse and nothing on her personally he had searched her briefly but efficiently and god how he hated himself for it now and all he had found in her clothes was rosalie she had gone to the post office for an entirely innocent reason and the evidence was in his hands he went on staring at it the postcard he had found in her purse feeling stupider and stupider feeling his face grow redder and redder he didnt know what to say to her he was afraid to look at her so he kept his eyes on the card dear rose sure was glad and surprised to get your telephone call today and sure wish i could see you but like i told you i had to check with my boss and he says he is going to need me straight on through until six oclock so unless youre going to be in town that late i guess we cant get together sure sorry rose let me know a little more ahead of time when youre coming over again love ella mae bugs could stare at the card no longer awkwardly he laid it in her lap gave her a sidewise miserable glance she was wearing a crisp linen suit with a starched white shirtwaist her small beautifully arched feet were shod in highheeled canvaslike pumps a wisp of a hat pert and attractive but with the indefinable stamp of the homemade perched atop the glossy smoothlying thickness of her coalblack hair it was a cheap outfit very lowpriced at least charming and chic only because she wore it and because of the hours that must have gone into its selection and preparation and this was supposed to have been his blackmailer this was supposed to be a common tart a gal who would hustle a fast buck in a guys bedroom this this quietly goodmannered young woman who was so honest that she announced unnecessarily and to her undeniable disadvantage that she was a negro well sure the postcard didnt absolutely establish her innocence she might have planted it herself suspecting that he intended to trap her she might have could have but he knew damned well she hadnt everything about her contradicted the theory shed liked him as he had liked her right from the beginning so she had accepted his invitation got herself all tyked out in her sundays best tried to arrange a meeting with her girl friend thus tactfully freeing him of any necessity to entertain her and he had repaid all this by rose he said i wish i could tell you how sorry i am rosie its qquite all right her lips trembled after all you dont have to apologize or explain to anyone in my position you can do anything you want to and if they dont like it dont dont rosie he begged you know im not like that wwell i certainly never thought you were i thought ssomething awfully foolish i guess that you asked me to come with you as a mark of respect tthat you were saying we were ffriends and you werent ashamed to to her eyes brimmed sobbing she turned suddenly and buried her face against his shoulder i ffeel so dirty so degraded like there was just no use in in you mustnt bugs patted the small square shoulders i was just gagging see i mean a guys been pulling a gag on me and i thought maybe ttook me back to something i thought id forgotten to a time in chicago years ago a man struck up a conversation with me on a streetcar and he seemed very nice so the guy had gotten off the car with her hed grabbed her purse suddenly and shoved a fivedollar bill into it kept possession of it while he whistled up a prowl car a vice dick yeah one on the make like a lot of them were so hed fallen for her he said and if shed like to stay out of the can keep from getting a police record why he was willing bugs listened hardfaced sharing her heartbreak he said again that the post office thing had been in the nature of a gag he couldnt explain it just now but aw go on lou ford peered through the window sounds like itd be real amusin bugs gave a start and rose drew away from him quickly scowling he snarled a question at the deputy what am i doin here ford said well now what would i be doin here banking some dough maybe investin some of my illgotten gains how does that sound to you ill buy it like it huh figured you probably would yes sir i plain counted on it and thats a fact but maybe that aint the real reason i aint sayin it is or it aint but lets just suppose suppose i said i was here to keep an eye on you bugs snorted laughed hollowly ford beamed at him like that even better do you really rubs you on the funny bone well maybe we ought to take it a couple hops further down the trail then lets say the reason i was keepin an eye on you was because i thought you might do a runout and the reason i thought that lets say is because i thought youd killed a guy and robbed him of five thousand dollars the deputy waited grinning widely he had the air of one who has sprung a delightful joke you dont think thats funny he said it dont tickle you atall i dont know what youre talking about bugs grunted whered you get the idea that dudley had five thousand dollars well it wasnt too hard to come by hotels got lots of employees employees all got mouths and i got a couple of ears just in case you hadnt noticed they aint as good as yours maybe dont hear somethin that aint said and and i didnt mention dudleys name bugs i didnt say it was dudley that had the five thousand bugs shrugged hed seen his mistake the second he made it hell he said casually hes the only guy thats died recently that i know of i figured you had to be talking about him yeah well ford moved his head in a judicious nod ought to give you an a for sharpness anyhow or maybe an aminus cant hardly give you a perfect score when you aint introduced me to your lady friend what makes you think she wants to be introduced to you bugs snapped but he curtly performed the introductions rosalie murmured a polite acknowledgement ford leaned further through the window studying her interestedly believe ive seen you before aint i look a lot prettier in them street clothes but thank you said rosalie yes sir i work at the hotel mmmhmm night maid right did you make up dudleys room when he was alive no sir he worked days so his room would be done by one of the day maids but you got up around that way at night could have dropped in on him easy enough yes sir i could have but i never did i had no reason to real sure about that sure you didnt have about five thousand reasons to five thou she gave him a startled look but but mr ford you surely dont think that i no he doesnt think it bugs cut in angrily this is just his way of amusing himself it gives him something to do between shakedowns ford winked at him he said maybe hed give bugs that a for sharpness after all but gettin back to the subject ever use any chloral hydrate miss vara i dont mean did you ever take any personally just if you used it why i i dont believe so im afraid i dont even know what it is well maybe you dont know it by that name maybe youd call it knockout drops or knockout drops but how wwhy would i you wouldnt bugs said and he knows it now what are you getting at ford whats chloral got to do with dudley i didnt tell you well now i guess it plumb slipped my mind ford drawled dudley had a whoppin load of it in his innards enough to coldcock a cow the doc figures itdve killed him if he hadnt gone out the window first but kind of knocks the suicide idea in the head dont it makes everything as confusin as excuse me miss vara all hell there wasnt none of the stuff in his room so we know someone slipped it to him but if they was gettin home that way why bother with the window deal they didnt have to the guyd have been out cold inside of five or ten minutes and anyone who knew anything about chloral hydrate would know it well bugs couldnt think a great burden had slipped from his conscience and his one thought was that dudley would have died regardless of the scuffle between them well i suppose this person whoever he was she you mean dont you its a womans weapon and a womand have the best chance of slipping it to him she then id say she pushed him out the window if he was pushed to cover up on the chloral you know to make it look like a suicide instead of murder thatd make her pretty stupid wouldnt it even halfway bright shed know that an autopsy was a cinch so she was stupid bugs said so are a lot of people he had seen amy at last standing in a nearby doorway he caught her eye and she smiled uncomfortably disclaiming connection with the situation with an embarrassed gesture he looked away from her coldly turning to ford you dont really suspect miss vara you have no reason to but shes answered all your questions and uhuh fraid youre wrong there ford said aint begun to ask em all then ask them back in ragtown follow along behind us if you want to but were leaving ive had enough by god im not going to sit here while you pull your clown act on miss vara and shes not going to sit here and take it we you mean you dont like sittin here fords eyebrows went up well now i thought it was right comfortable but ocourse if youd rather go down to the jail thats right yep he nodded youre still in my county but bugs choked up with fury whats it all about for gods sake why are you now dogged if it dont look like youre gettin all excited ford said miss vara maybe we ought to do our talkin out on the walk shes not doing any more talking were going bugs said wouldnt be much point to it doubt if you get six blocks before a squad car brought you back hardly figure its worth doin do you miss vara rosalie didnt answer him she simply opened the door quickly and got out ford strolled around the car and joined her on the walk now whichall rooms do you make up at night miss vara besides mr mckennas that is well the other night workers sleep out so his would be the only one i do regularly but there are always a few others not always the same ones on the same nights that i occasionally make up uhhuh mr and mrs hanlon for example mr hanlon particularly he frequently doesnt go to sleep before morning because of the pain hes in and bugs got out of the car he asked what the hell ford was pulling lf your questions are so damned important why didnt you ask them sooner why did you wait until now why did you just let everything slide until now and then could be i wasnt ready until now ford said blandly whats wrong with now anyways everything miss varas shes had a hard day and she doesnt feel well and we both have to work tonight work understand work were working tonight and if we dont get back and work eh ford said now i always thought you spelled it with a u fella learns somethin new every day dont he now dammit ford but i see your point got to be gettin in your beauty sleep cant say that miss vara stands in need of any more beautyin but i can see where you he broke off grinning beckoned without turning around amy girl come on over amy came forward reluctantly lou ford gave her a jovial nudge toward bugs got some talkin to do to miss vara here he explained but her and bugs have got to be gettin back so i figure maybe you better ride with him and she can just come along with me now really lou amys shamed eyes dropped id be glad to ride with mac of course but miss varas riding with me bugs said bluntly i brought her here and no please rosalie gave him a quick smile its perfectly all right mr mckenna lets do as mr ford says bugs hesitated assented surlily there was nothing else to do that he could see as ford and rosalie departed he yanked the car door open grunted a rude invitation to amy standish thank you she said i think id better take a bus oh come on dammit if im willing why yes why she cut in shakily why should i do anything but grovel with gratitude you can get upset and lose your temper and act just as nasty as you know how and thats all right thats your privilege and im just supposed to put up with it im not supposed to have any feelings im not supposed to feel any humiliation im not entitled to any ccourtesy or uunderstanding or she was about to cry bugs observed with an inward groan god hed already had one crying woman on his hands today and a woman in tears was one thing that had always got him he just couldnt take it and he didnt want to hurt amy his feelings about her might be pretty mixed up but he certainly didnt want her hurt so he apologized profusely he got her into the car and they headed for ragtown the traffic was even heavier now than it had been in the morning the aroundtheclock oilfield shifts were changing and the cars of the workmen vied with the mammoth trucks and tractors for space on the highway it was impossible to make any time bugs finally gave up trying to idling along between two trucks he slanted a glance at amy caught her studying him with a peculiar expression on her face it vanished instantly looking straight ahead she remarked that miss vara was a very pretty girl what is she spanish mexican no i mean i guess she could be bugs said because he wasnt ashamed naturally and of course shed probably find out the truth from ford sooner or later but right now he wasnt up to explaining why hed been in westex with a negro maid shes very pretty amy repeated if you like that type she doesnt strike me as someone whod wear very well but im probably mistaken i hope she isnt in any trouble she isnt your friend ford was just throwing his weight around that isnt like lou amy shook her head serenely perhaps he didnt go about it in the right way but im sure that he must have had a good reason to and im sure he didnt have what were you doing over there today anyhow i mean bugs got a grip on his temper its your own business you dont owe me any explanations but why i dont mind said amy and she didnt seem to on the contrary lou goes to westex quite frequently i dont know why exactly but its the largest city in the county so i suppose thered be any number of reasons why he might have to i rode over with him to see about finding a job then it was just a coincidence that we bumped into each other bugs said disbelievingly he wasnt huh you went to see about a job yes the schoolboard discharged me yesterday thats why i was so upset when you came to the house last night but why did he caught himself i guess youd probably rather not talk about it i dont mind now i was pretty torn up about it at the time but now that its happened it was because of that day i was at lous house you know the afternoon that yyou that you came there someone saw me going out the back door and the word got around and yesterday i was fired i see bugs mumbled uh did you get the job today no i think lou took steps to see that i wouldnt get it in fact i think he may have had quite a bit to do with my losing my teachers job she looked at him smiling at his expression no im not angry about it i was and i probably will be again but i always know that lou thinks a great deal of me if he does something like this well its meant for my own good bugss eyes narrowed angrily but he didnt say anything he didnt trust himself to ford had compromised her hed helped to get her canned from one job and hed kept her from getting another one and he was fully prepared apparently to continue with the same hateful line of conduct yet she sat here defending him saying he did these things for her own good you see she went on lou feels that his own life is wasted he hates what hes doing hes not suited to it and its twisted him actually hes very scholarly he was a brilliant student and him ford its hard to believe isnt it amy nodded but yes lous very brilliant he graduated from high school when he was fifteen he went through premed in three years then in his first year of medical college his father took very ill and lou came home doctor ford his father that is didnt get any worse but he didnt get any better either he just lingered on year after year and lou ford had felt that he had to stay with the old man but there was nothing in the small town for him to do no suitable work no real challenge for his mind still he had to do something and because he was old family he had been given a deputy sheriffs appointment it was no job for a booklearned dude obviously for a man with ambitions which would be interpreted as pretensions you had to blend with those around you with the publics conception of a cowtown deputy so ford had blended he had fitted himself into the role with a vengeance exaggerating it until it bordered on caricature and with this outward twisting of the man there had been an inward one in the brain the intelligence which could not be used as it had been intended to be very highhanded and arrogant amy was saying he wont explain himself if you cant see things as clearly as he does then its your own fault youd better smartenup as hed put it but hell do a great deal for someone he really likes and what he does is usually right bugs gritted his teeth it was all he could do to control himself finally his voice merely sarcastic he asked just what great plans ford had in mind for her well amy said thoughtful i believe he originally intended to make me leave town to force me out into the world now i think hes decided that i may belong here so she broke off blushing for some reason why dont we change the subject hmm its hard for me to understand lou and i know it must be a lot harder for you bugs let the statement pass but he did understand ford to his own way of thinking he had ford figured right down to a tee he hadnt reached his conclusions hastily on the contrary hed been willing even anxious to believe that the deputy was okay but fords own actions one piled upon another had made any such belief impossible he was convinced of fords unalloyed unrelieved blackness because ford himself had so convinced him that was that it was maddeningly aggravating that amy couldnt see the truth about the man it was about ten oclock on the night of his return from westex dozing uneasily almost as much awake as asleep bugs heard a faint sound at his door he sat up started to jump up then he quietly lay down again listening watching with slitted eyes there was a click a faint draft of air and flash of light as the door opened and closed silence for a moment an almostsilence then a rustling sound a series of rustles protracted over several seconds and then stealthy footsteps they traversed the brief areaway past the bathroom they stopped right at his bedside bugs couldnt actually see the intruder only that there was one only a blurred shadow among the darker shadows of the room but that was enough he moved suddenly moving with that incredible swiftness of which very big men are sometimes capable his arms swept out and swept shut his body rose and came down again pinning the intruder beneath him now by god he grunted savagely just what the the sentence ended in a startled gulp he had reacted rather than acted his movements rushing ahead of his thoughts but now the body squirmed delicately making certain adjustments fitting him into its bared flesh its soft warm gently undulant contours then there was a contented sigh and a delicious shudder of anticipation and a tense almost desperate whisper youre not angry mr mckenna yyou think less of mme mr mckenna ive wanted to so long and rosie said bugs and that was all he said that either of them said for quite a while he had gotten to bed about five after his return from westex very tired but with too much on his mind for sleep with a riddle which had to be solved yet was seemingly unsolvable for rosalie vara was out of the blackmail picture now and he was very glad of it but if she was out then who was in in actuality she had been his only suspect there had been two possibles she and joyce hanlon but joyce had been in her suite at the time of dudleys death so it had to be rosalie it had had to be something that wasnt and couldnt be she was in the clear and joyce was in the clear the only two women who by any stretch of the imagination could have been in dudleys room or rather his bath room the only two women well couldnt it possibly have been a man it could have been couldnt it after all there was someone and if it wasnt a woman then it had to be a man that makes sense doesnt it mckenna bugs supposed that it did but he also knew no man was involved in the matter dudley had been staging a little party there in his bathroom a sex party and in the intimacy of their secret carousing his guest had slipped him a mickey he wouldnt have had a man in his bath what would have been the point in that why would a man want to keep secret the presence of another man then there was that mickey the choloral hydrate as ford had pointed out it was traditionally a womans weapon a man might clout you or mug you or stick a gun in your ribs a woman did the job with chloral she couldnt muscle you so she honeyed up to you she got your guard down got you to thinking about things that werent discussed in sunday school got you to the point where you werent thinking at all just wanting and then she gave you a drink and right after that the party suddenly ended you were in the land of byebye and if youd gotten a big enough dose you might not ever emerge from it so it had to be a woman which meant that it couldnt be a man but since it couldnt be a woman either despite its having to be why well where were you for gods sake bugs was acquiring a violent headache also at long last he was beginning to get drowsy now who what he thought not a man or a woman not a man or a woman not someone youd think of as being he almost had it the only logical answer he thought the seeming paradox through was on the verge of the exceedingly simple explanation and then at that very moment hed fallen asleep and when he awakened he had other things to think about she came back from the bathroom bringing him a drink from the icewater tap she sat down on the edge of the bed a little shy now timid and pulled a corner of the sheet over her naked thighs bugs had been about to make a suggestion that she should address him less formally in view of what had transpired between them now he decided that he wouldnt she was a funny kid apparently she was more comfortable mistering him yet she might take his suggestion as an order out in the oil fields somewhere there was a sudden mass of light not a flash but a mass racing and spreading through the darkness so brilliant and farextended that some of its glare came down into the court of the hanlon and filtered around the drapes at bugss windows there was the light then since sound of course travels much more slowly than light a thunderous explosion it came from at least a mile away bugs estimated but the blast rattled the hanlons windows rosalie shivered and gripped bugss hand he squeezed it reassuringly a big one huh must have been a battery of boilers going up oh how terrible do you suppose anyone was hurt naw sure not he lied touched by her concern look rosie i is it okay for you to come on duty so early it wont get you in trouble it wasnt the question hed started to ask hed checked himself out of regard for her because in telling him what he really wanted to know as she probably would have out of loyalty and affection she could get into trouble no she shook her head to the query as long as i put in a full shift and get my work done i can come early or late within reason of course uhhuh well thats good he said drifting in on the night breeze now was a wailing eerie chorus of sirens ambulances were speeding out from the emergency hospitals as numerous in the oil fields as drinkstands at a carnival to the scene of the disaster the sound dwindled and was lost in the distance rosalie freed the hand that bugs was holding and got up she had left her clothes in the areaway bringing them back to the bed she sat down again and began to dress bugs made a movement to help her shyly she drew away a little i want to tell you something mr mckenna two things first i wont do anything like this again im glad it happened i wanted to wanted you to have me you stood up for me against mr ford and i cant tell you how grateful i am and i dont want you to be rosie i dont want you to feel that you owe me anything i know you wouldnt want me to her soft voice trembled with emotion but anyway what i started to say mr mckenna was that that this was both the beginning and the end of their affair she said in effect it would have to be obviously since its continuation was certain to bring tragedy and trouble bugs protested he felt that he had to but he was deeply relieved he wasnt in love with her nor she with him and a thing like this life being as it was could only drag them both downhill as the hanlons house detective the official paid to nip potential trouble in the bud he was in a far better position to avoid discovery than most than say dudley had been one of the watched rather than the watchman yet discovery was virtually inevitable in the long run and he was in enough of a mess now without taking on another hell if he could just get out of this present mess get out of it and get to feeling right about amy or stop feeling anything about her either accept what had happened between her and ford or there was something else i wanted to tell you mr mckenna about mr ford he dont bugs said i dont think youd better im going to rosalie said firmly he doesnt really suspect me probably you guessed that but thats only part of it the real reason he wanted to talk to me bugs cut her off didnt he warn you not to tell me rosie well then let me say it he figures that there must have been two people a man and a woman with dudley the woman gave him the chloral and the man knock pushed him out the window and hes got me figured as the man yes sir and its so crazy mr mckenna i mean why would you why would anyone do it if the woman had already killed him as good as killed him why that misunderstanding we had at the post office today bugs said i imagine ford asked you about that no dont tell me of course ill tell you yes he did ask me and and i didnt know quite what to say mr mckenna i didnt understand it myself and i was afraid if i tried to lie to him im glad you didnt you did the right thing just telling him what happened and letting it go at that but but thats the setup rosie its a pretty weak thread but he wants to stick me and hes trying to use that little frammis at the post office to do it but i i dont see how that well bugs said cautiously its really pretty simple im just guessing of course i dont actually know but it seems to me that fords thinking would just have to run like this the man doesnt know that the woman is in dudleys room perhaps shes in the bathroom see but she knows that hes in there and knows who he is and when he apparently kills dudley and takes the money she came there to steal why he left the sentence unfinished he could see something of her now his eyes having adjusted to the darkness and the expression on her face stopped him i see she said at last you thought i was the woman with dudley you thought i was trying to blackmail you and you tried to no i didnt really think it rosie i was just desperate snatching at straws you know and its all right mr mckenna she said gently i understand believe me when youre what i am when youve lived as i have you get a lot of understanding all that matters is that you dont think that about me now i dont i never did im glad were you getting up now mr mckenna im doing a room on the floor below and if you are getting up sure save you another trip bugs said about that time anyway ill run along then bye now bye now goodbye period to anything more than friendly politeness bugs dressed and left the room wondering why things had to be the way they were reluctantly relieved that they were that way he ate he made his tour of the corridors and started his backothehouse inspection except for the kitchens it was generally inactive its various entrances and exits closed and locked at this hour it was part of bugss duties to unlock them and have a look around making sure that no sneakthief had wangled his way inside watchful against the everpresent danger of fire bakery laundry grocery printers painters electricians plumbers and carpenters shops ice plant and icecream plant rug reweaving upholstering linen repair boilerroom engineroom waterworks the hotel was a city and it contained everything necessary for the operation of a city twice during his tour bugs encountered leslie eaton once the clerk was hustling toward the valet department the second time as he was leaving the telephoneswitchboard room he was carrying a batch of charge slips on every occasion so ostensibly he was in pursuit of his duties but bugs guessed that he did a hell of a lot of chasing around that wasnt necessary westbrook had always thought so and eaton seemed to be absent from the front office about as much as he was there the clerk smirked and blushed as they passed frowning bugs looked after him from the door of the telephone room now what was there about that guy anyway what possible connection could there be between eaton and the jam he was in not a thing that he could think of although there was a troubled stirring in the deep recesses of his mind bugs shrugged and went on through the door it was a threeposition board but only one operator was on duty now bugs sat down next to her on one of the longlegged swivel chairs chatting idly with her between calls watching the nimbly casual movement of her fingers it was interesting everything about the hotel was interesting to him often since he had come here he had looked back into the past compared its drabness and dullness and sameness with the everchanging alwaysintriguing world of the hotel and he had shuddered over what he had escaped from felt the deepest gratitude for what he had escaped into he never wanted to leave here it would be nice of course if he could rise to a better job but if he couldnt well he wouldnt kick just staying on here would be enough and he was going to do it he wasnt going to take another rap he wasnt going to take it on the lam he was going to stay somehow somehow regardless of the price for staying hed shot square with people all his life and it hadnt got him anywhere now if shooting square wouldnt do the job hed get it done the other way the operator glanced at the clock propping her morning callsheets in front of her she pushed a plug into the board good morning sir its six oclock bugs left he went down to and through the lobby strolled around the block and entered the coffee shop he had breakfast read the morning paper by then it was eight oclock the end of his shift and he started for his room he heard his name called he turned and waited as lou ford came up the steps from the side entrance well he said youre in trouble ford said lets talk about it they went to bugss room ford settled himself into the one easy chair lighted one of his thin black cigars and spewed out a fragrant cloud of smoke he fanned it with one hand staring at bugs with absent thoughtfulness bugs stared back at him stolidly there was something different about the deputy today but he couldnt quite put his finger on it then ford spoke again and he realized what it was fords drawl was gone his errors and exaggerations of speech he spoke as any literate person might have i said you were in trouble bugs that may have been putting it a little strong i might be more accurate to say that youre on the verge of trouble but that you can avoid it i can help you to i see i hope so but i doubt it perhaps wed better let that lie a moment and go back to the beginning back to the day when i took you out of jail and got you your job here he took another puff from his cigar tapped the ash into the wastebasket incidentally i gather that you like it here you wouldnt mind sticking around permanently thats right id like to have you stick around bugs shrugged waited silently there was a faint flicker in fords eyes a hint of annoyance which might readily become something else but he went on levelvoiced well as i said perhaps wed better go back to the beginning i dont like to its not my way to do favors for people and then throw it up to them or even to let them know im doing them a favor but in this case you came here with nothing bugs nothing but a bad record i got you out of jail i staked you i got you linked up with this job i introduced you to better stop there leave her out of it all right well stop with the other things i did you were sore at the world about as touchy as a man can get so i tried not to make you feel that you were being favored i did what i did in a way that you could accept so that you could possibly feel that you were favoring me i told you that this place needed a good twofisted house dick it would save me and my boys work if youd take the job he paused puffing at his cigar again bugs yawned making no very great effort to stifle it maybe youd better get to the point he said you gave me the world with a ring around it now you want something in return all right i dont expect something for nothing what is it you want not as much as i gave bugs not nearly as much i was established here i had a lot to lose if i was wrong about you and judging by your record i could easily have been wrong but i took you on trust now id like some of that trust back that still doesnt tell me anything you still doesnt tell you anything now goddammit fords mouth snapped shut after a moment he went on again drawling a little gradually slipping back into his usual manner of speech lets get to that trouble we was talkin about cut around the frills and get right to the heart of it you went to dudleys room for some reason you scuffled with him and he got knocked out the window now uhuh ive got an alibi for the time of his death you have huh an what time would that be well uh what i mean is bugs said that ive got all my time covered i went straight from my room to the elevator and i didnt go upstairs after that until you went straight from your room to the elevator sure an you sure went to a hell of a lot of trouble to be able to prove it but you got no way of provin that you didnt leave your room before that or ford cocked an eyebrow at him have you you prove it to me if you can an me ill vamoose right out of here i dont have to prove it i wouldnt lay no bets on that no sir i sure wouldnt and thats a fact now look bugs said doggedly why tab me with this thing anyway the fact that there was a man in dudleys room if there was one doesnt necessarily mean that it was me youve got no lets talk about what it does necessarily mean the guy didnt break in he didnt sneak in like with a passkey maybe a sneak wouldve just copped and cleared out he wouldntve been scufflin with dudley or he would if dudley had caught him which ford winked dudley was havin too much fun to do howsomeever suppose he did the guyd have no right to be there no matter how noaccount dudley was hedve put up a racket about it let out a yell or called for help an we know he didnt do that then theres that gal in the bathroom the one we both know was there in a case like were supposin about i dont see her livin but a mite longer than dudley did because this fellad be a pro he wouldnt leave nothin behind that was worth takin or nothin thatd put the finger on him so hed check that bathroom just as sure as god made green apples an thatd been the end of the gal ford leaned back in his chair crossed one booted foot over the other bugs glowered at him helplessly wanting nothing so much as to smash his fist into the deputys bland saturnine face aint hard to figure out at all is it ford said no sir theys probly plenty of fouryearold boys that could do it without turnin a hair dudley let this fella into his room the guy was someone in authority an he had to who had that much authority enough to make a man open up his room late at night not moren two people that i can think of one of em was westbrook an forget him bugs said curtly westbrook couldnt have had anything to do with it ford nodded his tone decidedly less edged glad you said that bugs a man thatll stick up for a friend when it hurts has got plenty to him but o course youre right the first thing i done was to check on westbrook an i know he wouldntve been callin on dudley his hands were tied hed insisted that dudley was absolutely okay so he couldnt but theys no use goin into that is there or into the setto of ours over in westex what is there use in going into what happened bugs did westbrook ask you to help him out with dudley try to get the money back for him no well all right he did ask me but i refused uhhuh sure just couldnt take a chance on gettin into trouble ford drew on his cigar exhaled a thin stream of smoke and then you changed your mind an this trouble you was afraid of happened bugs shrugged ford could talk theorize until he was blue in the face but he couldnt prove anything the deputy studied him narroweyed spoke as though in rebuttal to a statement not yet he said but i aint tried real hard aint really put my mind to it aint decided whether i want to do any provin if i do then youll have to do some proving against someone else the woman who gave dudley the chloral why why bugs frowned why dammit because you will you cant couldnt why not whats to stop me ford spread his hands maybe they was a mistake about the chloral maybe the gal just saw you comin out of dudleys room and wasnt actually there herself but but she was there youve said so a dozen times could be i was wrong might say somethin else the thirteenth time wouldnt be too unreasonable yknow if she was willin to stand right up and be counted to do her duty irregardless like an upstandin citizen should why a fellad just about have to figure she was on the level yes sir it wouldnt be no bother for him at all even if it wasnt sort o handy for him to figure that way and even if he wasnt in a position where he could call his shots any way he wanted to now youre gettin the idea ford beamed really smartenin up now you keep on an youll be able to pour sand out of a boot without a book of directions then he laughed pleasantly infectiously stroked his jaw with a slenderfingered hand now listen to me will you been carryin on that way so long that i cant stop even when i want to just slide into it without thinkin but we all got our little peculiarities usually got good reasons for em too the way i see it and as long as a man dont fault the other fella for his look bugs cut in if youve got something to say sure youre tired and i aint exactly the soothingest man in the world to talk to so well wind it up fast i cant see you as deliberately tyin into dudley not for money or anything else aside from that and maybe i got kind of a funny outlook on these things i figure there wasnt nothing lost when he died just saved the law a job itd have to do sooner or later so you tell me it was an accident and ill believe you wont be nothin more said or done about it yeah well im not telling you that well ford hesitated his lips pursed thoughtfully well okay well still skip it i gave you a lot of trust in the beginning and ill give you that much more and now bugs he lowered his voice leaned forward in his chair i want a dividend on that trust you know whats building up here you know why mrs hanlon was so helpful in getting you a job youd just about have to by this time all right take it from there what have you got to say about it he leaned back in his chair again bugs squirmed fretfully he was over a barrel what was he supposed to say that would take him off of it listen he began what i mean dammit what do you i cant tell you that if i had to it wouldnt mean anything wouldnt know for sure whether it jibed with what you had in mind and if it didnt id be behind the eight ball id fluff somethin that just better not be fluffed but hell im already way out on a limb bugs a lot further than even a real trustin fella ought to go ive saddled a hoss for you an given you a handup and all im doin now is grippin the bridle just holdin a little in my finger tips until i see which way youre headin and if it isnt the way youre heading i get set down hard if youre that dumb yeah me i got an awful low boiin point for dumbness riles me worsen a cactus under a saddle blanket but what but there was no use asking that again ford in a way occupied the same position bugs was in did he want mike hanlon kiled bugss cooperation in murdering the old man possibly in fact very probably it would seem but ford couldnt say so until he was sure of bugss feelings or did he want the opposite to pin a rap of conspiracy of attempt to commit murder on joyce hanlon that also was possible but again ford could not admit it without knowing bugss sentiments bugs might tip off joyce forewarned she would hold her plans in abeyance and hanlon would never be safe well ford said well bugs i dont know what youre talking bout bugs said i dont know and i dont want to know ford took the cigar from his mouth studied the tip of it absently he rolled it between his fingers then let it drop into the wastebasket so you dont know he said aint got the slightest idea of what i been talkin about could be that thats an answer itself which aint to say of course that im real fond of it look ford bugs said honest to god now dont you think youre asking a hell of a lot well maybe ford nodded judiciously yes sir i could be wouldnt be too much to ask of a man but seem that youre more in the nature of a man with a boys head go on bugs grunted you know i have to take it aint it the truth yes sir its plain gospel an thats a fact ford continued to talk for a full five minutes the bitter biting drawl lashed bugs unmercifully leaving him sick and shaking with fear and fury then at last it was over and the deputy stood up been meanin to tell you that for a long time he said mildly just by way of bein helpful y know it aint got no direct bearin on the problem we been discussin about that now that noanswer answer you gave me i guess well just have to wait an see or maybe itd be better to say ill wait and see ill do the waitin and seem and you can be doin some real hard hopin bugs ate dinner at amys house that night it was a simple but tasty meal of baked beans salad and cornbread but you couldnt have proved it by him as absorbed in worry as he was he could have eaten sawdust and brickbats and never known the difference a full stomach stilled the worries to an extent replaced them with an uneasy sluggishness he helped her wash and dry the dishes and then they moved into the livingroom they talked seated on the ancient horsehair sofa with bugss contributions to the converstion growing fewer and fewer shorter and shorter finally he lapsed into a complete and prolonged silence amy nudged him she got up suddenly sat down on his knees and kissed him on the mouth now she said would he wake up would he or not wake up bugs woke up even in his black mood the treatment was effective amy allowed him to demonstrate that he was fully awake then pulling away a little she tilted his chin up with her hand mac whats bothering you im sure something must be naw bugs shrugged just dopey is all didnt sleep too good today then he shifted his eyes added casually what have i got to be bothered about i dont know would you tell me if you were in if you were having trouble of any kind well sure why not if i thought you wanted to hear about it you wouldnt be you wouldnt think that you couldnt trust me bugs kissed her he couldnt or wouldnt answer the question in his own mind so he did it that way amy seemed satisfied and dropped the subject but the following night as he was leaving she brought it up again im not asking what the trouble is mac just if there is any now listen amy im sorry i just thought that might be the reason you know why you didnt say anything to me about anything i mean if you were in trouble you might feel that oh just listen to me she laughed suddenly with brittle shrillness did you ever hear anyone so mixedup in your life amy bugs began no no please mac she stepped back through the door leaving him on the porch im tired and its getting late and you run along now and ill see you tomorrow night the door closed the lock clicked the hall light went off bugs turned uncertainly and headed for the hotel it was still short of tenthirty when he reached the hanlon plenty of time yet before he was due on the job he parked his car at the side of the building and remained in it smoking and brooding watching the street ahead of him the more he thought about it the more chagrined he became over his trip to westex city hed really pinned a label on himself with that stunt tied a rope around his neck and handed the other end to lou ford and hell even if he hadnt run into ford or if ford hadnt been tailing him the trip still would have been so much time wasted he couldnt hang around the westex generaldelivery window he couldnt hang around indefinitely outside the building rather he could but what the hell could he expect it to make him because naturally as any damned fool should know the blackmailer wasnt going to go near the place thered be a third party someone bugs wouldnt know or recognize and why in the name of god he hadnt seen that well bugs grudgingly excused himself thered been no apparent necessity for him to think of it hed been sure that the blackmailer was rosalie vara equally confident that she was sufficiently naive to walk into his trap hedve known better of course if hed known that the woman in question was a mickey artist but hed had no way of knowing that so hed done what he had and it wasnt particularly stupid under the circumstances and anyway there was no use in beating himself over the head about it now the point was that the traditional trap for a blackmailer the only one he could think of would not work in this case not for a man who was on the wrong side of the fence himself and could get no aid from the other side somehow hed just have to figure out who she was if it was a she and he already knew that it wasnt that it couldnt be and he also knew that savagely bugs hurled his cigarette out the window severed the nagging circle of his thoughts similarly he refused to think about what he would do when and if he caught up withhimherit whoever the blackmailer was hed do something that was a cinch whatever was necessary couldnt say what it would be until the time came a bellboy was crossing the intersection at the next corner a slickhaired youth with a pale phlegmatic face a cigarette dangled from the corner of his mouth and he carried a canvas mailsack over his shoulder he came down the walk with the tiredly jaunty stride peculiar to bellboys nearing the side entrance he took a long pull on the cigarette flicked it into the street and went through the double doors at what was practically a trot bugs grinned sourly to himself those damned bellboys they worked at a hotel rather than for it the hotel was only one of numerous bosses the people they waited on the cranks and drunks the grouches and snides the rubes and the sharpies and to survive they learned every trick in the book they had to be pulling some kind of swiftie no matter how small or they just didnt feel right this lad now hed probably dogged it all the way to the post office and back but returning he went through the door like he was shot out of a gun bugs smoked another cigarette then he got out of the car and moved slowly toward the side door the mail the bellboy had brought would be the last one until tomorrow it was a light mail due to the lateness of the pickup so it should be all put up in the roomboxes by now he could find out now whether he didnt want to if there was a letter well thered be a letter but there was no point in running to look for a headache he walked around to the front of the hanlon and entered the coffee shop he had coffee and some cherry pie a la mode and went through the doors to the lobby feet dragging unconsciously he came down the marble checkerboard of its floor to the front office he stopped parallel with the key rack turned and looked there wasnt any letter only another callslip from joyce hanlon he accepted it with a suppressed sigh of relief and began his tour of the corridors probably he decided he ought to give joyce a ring sometime soon after all she might want to talk to him about something other than what he had assumed she did and anyhow there could be no harm in just talking it could be even that hed be doing himself a favor might find out something from her that would be useful to know as for example just how things stood between her and lou ford yeah he guessed hed better do it every reason why he should and none practically why he shouldnt by two in the morning he had completed his rounds of the room floors he had also worked up enough appetite to want a square meal he got off the elevator and started for the coffee shop and then as he was passing the front office the keyrack section he came to a dead stop he stared incredulously he moved slowly up to the counter leslie eaton was gone and ted gusick was tending desk he reached the letter out of bugss box and handed it to him bugs looked at the penciladdressed envelope at the faint westex city postmark he stood tapping it on the counter dully wondering what how why wondering thered been no mail since that last one the one that hed seen the day bellboy bring in if this letter had been in that mail it should have been put in his box hours ago slowly bugs raised his eyes looked into the smooth pokerface of ted gusick something wrong mr mckenna any little thing i can do for you what bugs blinked oh no no everythings swell i was just wondering uh well where eaton was nothing that cant wait but well ive got three bells that cant wait much longer one of the parties has already called down a second time uhhuh yeah sure bugs murmured vaguely understand theres a new night engineer big muscle man yknow maybe hes got our blushing boy bent over a boiler he laughed winked then misreading bugss startled scowl he retreated swiftly into his usual suavely reserved self not a very good joke was it mr mckenna sir of course i couldnt really think that about a fine young man like mr eaton think it hell it was something youd know if you knew anything at all it stuck out all over the guy and and it must be the answer to the puzzle it hadnt been a woman in dudleys bathroom not a woman literally but now that i think of it ted continued i believe you might find mr eaton down in the valet shop he had some charges to check there and he probably stopped to get a free pantspress pants pressed bugs said not knowing what he said or that he said anything pants pressed excuse me ha ha i honestly didnt mean that as another joke mr mckenna but yes sir ted nodded seriously the valets always glad to do those things if he isnt busy so mr eaton could be getting his p suit pressed bugs turned abruptly and walked away in the alcove leading to the coffee shop he paused and took the letter from his pocket he hadnt really taken a good look at the first one its envelope rather still unnoticing he had noticed certain things about it had registered on his subconscious and repeated on this envelope they soared to the surface of his mind attained glaring significance he ran his fingers over the paper where the address was inscribed he studied the almost indiscernible date of the postmark grimly then he went on into the coffee shop returning the letter unopened to his pocket never mind what the thing said the guy who had said it written it was what he was interested in he sat down on a stool near one end of the horseshoe counter and gave his order to a waitress then with a grunt of dismay he hastily got up just remembered a phone call i got to make hold that order a few minutes will you the girl smiled and said she would bugs laid his hat on his stool squeezed through the service slot between counter and wall and moved swiftly toward the rear of the coffee shop back of the coffee shop was the hotels main kitchen bugs entered it through another service slot and hurried down its vast dimly lit length it was not in use at this hour since the diningroom which it served was closed bugs left it by a door at its far end and emerged onto the back landing the outofuse service elevator was parked there he entered it cut off the lights and piloted it down to the first basement quietly he eased the door open stood listening in the darkness the valet shop was about twenty feet to his right eatons voice drifted down the corridor to him oh dont be so nasty i guess i had to check these charges didnt i charges goddammit you been here long enough to check fort knox eaton emitted a highpitched giggle bugs squirmed nervously as busy as the coffee shop was time would go very quickly for that waitress he could stay away twenty or thirty minutes and it would seem like only a few to her longer than that however hed be putting a dangerous strain on his alibi and at the rate this damned silly eaton was stalling i am going darn it i said i was and i am how many times do i have to tell you none by god just show me just get the hell out so i can get some work done eaton made a pouting sound the gate to the railedoff valet shop clicked open swung creaking to and fro as his footsteps came hurriedly down the corridor bugs tensed his hand shot out suddenly grasping eaton yanking him into the car flinging him with breathtaking impact against its rear wall then almost before the door had closed he shot the elevator upward between the seventh and eighth floors he brought the car to a stop he switched on the lights and turned slowly around eaton met his gaze smirking he was still a little startled but apparently not at all frightened his seeming cocksureness infuriated bugs all right buster he growled start talking talking the clerk tittered nervously juth just about anything mr mckenna dont pull that crap on me you try crapping me and ill scramble every goddamned cell in your skull bbut mr mckenna eatons smirk had frozen mr mckenna i juth ddont you think im stupid you think i wouldnt ever see through a deal like that two weeks ago about two weeks you went over to westex city you mailed some letters addressed in pencil to yourself back here then you erased your address and readdressed them to me and but i didnt wwhat why would i do that to give yourself an alibi damn you id get a letter but you wouldnt have been in westex the day before the day it would ordinarily have been mailed to me might have got away with it too if youd done a little more erasing on these postmarks well bugs took him by the lapels thats it now mr mckenna eaton said evenly why would i write you a letter what would i write you about you know what about you were there in the r bugs stopped abruptly eaton might not be positive of his information mustnt say anything that would corroborate what he had i know those letters didnt come in on the regular mail not the one i got tonight at least so the first one didnt either mr mckenna i mean i know it didnt now thats why i why i got to wondering about them go on keep talking and make it good i found it lying down on the floor between the counter and the roomboxes i thought at the time that it must have fallen out of the box so i just dusted it off and put it back in but the clerks eyes fell and his voice went very low butbut you never get any letters and well im ive always been interested in anything that concerns you so i did notice the date i saw that it had been postmarked two days before a day before that day it should have been and well that made me more curious and spifi it out bugs said gruffly unaccountably embarrassed come on mr mckenna i guess you havent opened the second letter have you if you had youd know that i wouldnt uh he broke off hurriedly timidly well anyway i found the second letter right where id found the first on the floor between the counter and the roombox rack and it had the same date as the first one and naturally i really became curious then i know i had no right to to be so interested because im sure you havent the slightest interest in in never mind bugs flushed you found this letter tonight huh nno sir the clerks voice had sunk to a mere whisper i found it well it was the night you looked so tired i guess youd been up most of the day the day hed gone to westex it must have been eaton had held the letter up since then i opened it mr mckenna oh no sir i didnt open the first one i just wasnt curious enough you know but i did this one the second and i wanted to hhelp all right bugs said uncomfortably i think i understand no sense in breaking up about it i was waiting for payday mr mckenna thats the reason i held it up i didnt want to be fforward or embarrass you but i hoped youd know that the money came from me and oh mr mckkenna eaton suddenly buried his face in his hands im sso ashamed so ashamed bugs took the letter from his pocket and ripped open the envelope there was a curt message inside i want that money mr mckenna and im not waiting much longer there was also a fiftydollar bill will it help any mr mckenna eaton looked at him pleadingly i didnt know how much you might need but i dont need any bugs said flatly this is just a gag see a bad joke that someone is pulling i havent quite figured out who the guy is but i will i can handle it and i want you to let me just keep out of it if there are any more of these letters just put them in my box and forget them yes ssir ill certainly do that mr mckenna ill i dont need any help but you do so goddammit get it he took fifty dollars from his wallet added it to the other fifty and slapped it into the clerks hand theres bound to be a psychiatrist or a good psychologist in westex go see him and keep seeing him until you straighten out will you do that les you may have to do some skimping on other things but i can manage eaton raised his eyes i think my father might help he hasnt had much use for me but hes quite welloff tell him what youre doing what youre trying to do and hell have plenty of use bugs gave him a hearty slap on the back meanwhile we just forget this other you dont know anything about it it never happened no sir it never happened eaton nodded but im awfully glad it did bugs lowered the car to the first floor he returned to the coffee shop and leslie eaton walking very straight went back to the front offices so now bugs was back to joyce hanlon again joyce who had been his favorite suspect right from the start like lou ford she couldnt openly proposition him like ford she was forcing him to show his hand before she showed hers she was the one person of bugss acquaintance who might be willing and able to do him a very substantial favor in return of course he would have to do her one the nature of which had already been indicated to him but he must approach her in the matter she had to be assured before she would take him off the hook that he would do what she wanted done what if he didnt approach her if he just ignored the letters well she wasnt apt to give up that easy she and ford were after the old mans millions and theyd go right on being after them they wouldnt let a threetime loser a pushover for a fourth fall stand in their way since he wouldnt play ball theyd put him out of the game permanently make room for someone who would play on their terms but hell this was all theory the way he thought things stood and there was still that one big hole in the theory the fact that joyce had been in her room at the time dudley plunged from his window if there was some way of explaining that bugs finished eating leaving the coffee shop he began his long tour of the backothehouse as usual he wound up at about fivethirty in the morning yawning wearily he sauntered into the telephone room and sank down on one of the longlegged stools he lighted a cigarette stifling another yawn the operator smiled sympathetically long night huh mr mckenna yeah real long be glad when its time to turn in a light flashed on the board she plugged it out voiced a polite singsong query and made the desired connection with another plug then she turned back to bugs well look mr mckenna if youre tired why dont you turn in now yeah why dont i bugs grinned suppose the old man should take a notion to ring me suppose he did well oh i get you bugs said you mean he wouldnt know that i was there you could say that youd ring me down in the coffee shop or something like that wherever id be likely to be at this hour of the morning uhhuh of course i wouldnt do that for everyone but someone thats all right like i know you are bugs stared at her vacantly his hand moved his cigarette toward his mouth paused in midair with the journey uncompleted the operator turned away plucked the plugs out of the board i hope i didnt say anything wrong mr mckenna she murmured i certainly wouldnt want you to think that i go around deceiving people what aw no nothing like that bugs protested no i appreciate it glad to know you could help me out that way well i dont really see that it hurts anything after all were all here together and if we can do each other a harmless little favor now and then why sure thats the way i see it bugs veiled his eyes fought to keep his voice casual but look let me ask you this suppose we just reverse the deal ive been working too hard say and hanlon orders me to stay in my room and rest up but i dont want to do it so i step out somewhere and i know what you mean the operator bobbed her head well thats an easy one youd just tell me where you were going to be before you left and when he asked me to ring your room id ring the other place instead id get you on the line you know and then id open the connection bugs frowned interestedly he remarked that a writer could make a swell plot for a story out of a situation like that lets say mmm how could you do it lets well how about this youre just being nice doing me a favor but while im out of my room i commit a crime you find out about it and of course its your duty to tell the cops but if you do that youll put yourself on the spot itll cost you your job anyway and oh now really mr mckenna the operator laughed ill bet thats your secret ambition isnt it to be a writer well bugs shrugged easily why not nothing much to it that i can see once youve got a plot just putting words down on paper now thats true isnt it if youve got a good idea why anyone could make a good story out of it it certainly cant take any brains to do that well getting back to this idea of mine then what would you do in a case like that what would a woman do me now i dont think id know which way to jump probably figure that id better keep my mouth shut he waited he dropped his cigarette to the floor kept his eyes on it while he tapped it out with his foot she was studying him he knew comparing him as he was tonight with what he usually was for a guy who didnt ordinarily have much to say he guessed hed been talking a hell of a lot the silence grew heavier at last he looked up stretched lazily and stood up about your story plot mr mckenna the operator would handle hundreds of calls a night she couldnt be expected to remember this one i mean the one to the place where the crime was committed no well probably not bugs agreed anyway you could hardly blame her if she didnt remember and how could she know that this party shed done the favor for had committed the crime just because he was there wouldnt mean that hed done it bugs admitted that this was also right adding regretfully that he guessed his plot wasnt much good well is there anything else i can tell you no i dont believe so bugs said i think youve told me all you can and with a word of goodnight he sauntered out of the room he hadnt learned anything definite nothing that positively placed joyce in dudleys room at the time of his death under the circumstances however the fact that she could have been there was good evidence that she had been dudley was pretty lowdown he could easily have been pulling a squeezeplay on her of some kind and got squeezed himself yeah it figured all right the facts added up despite their one nominal contradiction joyce couldnt move directly against her husband because of his money the dangerously strong motive it represented but thered be no such obstacle in the way of her doing a job on dudley the end of the shift came and bugs went to bed as usual he spent the evening with amy another evening that was at once wonderful yet insidiously aggravating he left early and a little huffily returning to his room he called joyce hanlon she was pretty cool when she first came to his room shed tried to be nice to him she pointed out shed got him his job and then shed done her best to see that he made out okay and in return hed given her a good hard snubbing well she didnt take that kind of stuff she didnt have to take it from anyone and she particularly didnt have to take it from a guy like him particularly understand and he could take that any way he wanted to bugs let her get the mad out of her system now finally she lay stretched out on the bed knees drawn up one long silken leg stretched over the other she was puffing a cigarette lazily blowing smoke toward the ceiling asking a question with her silence and preparing herself for the answer she was like a cat bugs thought perfectly relaxed yet ready to spring instantly in any direction he cleared his throat fidgeted uncertainly in his chair he said joyce i want to ask you something mmmhmm you dont really need five thousand dollars do you five thou well she laughed with deliberate lightness every little five thousand helps you know five thousand here and five thousand there and you know what i mean you dont want five thousand from me weell id be rather foolish if i did wouldnt i a case of wanting in one hand and spitting in the other now dammit joyce listen im trying to bugs very hard im sure if you say anything ill hear it bugs hesitated leaned forward ive been getting letters they demand five thousand dollars as a price for keeping quiet about a certain matter youve been writing them have i now how could you possibly think a thing like that because this matter concerns dudley his death because i know you were with him at the time oh she said so thats where i was she raised up on one elbow dropped her cigarette into an ashtray she lay back down again drowsily shielding her eyes with the back of her hand theres only one way you could be so sure of that bugs you were with him too well lets say im not sure of it only as sure as youre sure about me its a push in other words you cant put me any further into the soup than i can put you into it mmm i dont believe you really think that way do you honey if you did you wouldnt be worried about those letters im supposedly writing you maybe im just smarter than you are bugs said maybe you ought to be worried a lot more now that joyce murmured is a straight line if i ever heard one coming from a guy with a record like yours what about your record and dont tell me you havent got one but i havent darling honestly nuts youre no kid and dudley couldnt be the first guy you hit with that stuff its a modus operandi the trademark of a certain type of worker some gals go in for boosting or paperpushing or lifting leathers others work the chloral hydrate that did it jarred her out of the indifferent act her body stiffened and under the shielding fingers her eyes widened with sudden fear she lay almost absolutely motionless for a moment then she slowly sat up swung her feet to the floor bugs grinned at her she looked at him blankly and then her lips twisted into a different kind of grin yes she said some gals work the chloral hydrate hardboiled gals gals wholl take the long chance so that alleged record of mine isnt much protection for you is it bugs no more than i care to let it be and if i dont care to let it be at all then youd be stupid perhaps under different circumstances but youve got a pretty good idea that those circumstances dont exist in this case that there isnt going to be any matching up of records the lightning is going to strike in just one spot and youll be on it thats your idea your pretty good idea and its a pretty good idea to hang onto youre talking about ford now hell protect you that sounds reasonable doesnt it but youre saying it bugs i havent said a word but dammit bugs snapped youre not telling me anything i cant be sure where ford stands or or you should be able to all you have to do is see how he runs this town remember the way he picked you up out of nowhere and brought you to me id say he was a very pleasant easygoing guy when it suits him he couldnt ignore something if it was shoved right in his face but youre still not telling me anything now lets have it joyce what do you want what am i supposed to do and how can i be sure ill get away with it she laughed softly with false sweetness crinkled her eyes at him coquettishly why bugs i believe thats the nicest compliment ive ever had of course i do think i hold my age very well but compliment what mmmhmm saying i was only a day old or isnt that what you meant that i was born yesterday she laughed again but in a different way amused jeering then she stood up swinging the sable stole back around her shoulders youve taken your time about seeing me bugs and now you dont have anything to say but never mind im sure you wont wait so long next time will you ill hear from you very very soon because otherwise my feelings might be hurt and if that happened bugs let out a moaning snarl of frustration he again asked what the hell she wanted him to say or rather he started to she cut him off with a thoughtful gesture ive been thinking bugs why bother to say anything it isnt at all necessary is it bugs looked into her mocking face he shrugged wearily and was silent at least a word or two should be enough dont you think okay all right she left then leaving the words hanging in the air bugs bathed his face in ice water and went dully to work hed botched things he guessed hed as good as admitted that hed been in dudleys room while she on the other hand had admitted nothing and there was no satisfaction at all in the possibility that she might be bluffing taking advantage of the blackmail act which another person was pulling because someone was pulling it and whether it was joyce who wanted her husband murdered or whether it was another woman who merely wanted five grand he was still behind the eight ball either way a demand was being made on him that could only be met in one way but he knew it had to be joyce he was sure of it and he became surer for there were no more of the blackmail letters and if she hadnt been sending them well they would have continued wouldnt they bugs could see it in no other way joyce had made her point having made it the letters became unnecessary now she was waiting checking the next move to him as the days dragged by she began to prod him toward that move no she still didnt come out in the open she said or did nothing even remotely incriminating it was just a matter of an occasional telephone call or a brief visit to his room no more than the open and patently innocent friendliness she had showed for him from the beginning how was he feeling okay how was he getting along all right well that was fine and so on and so on bugs grew more and more tense he was a bundle of worries and nerves hardly able to keep his mind on his job almost wholly unable to rest or relax he couldnt take any more he thought hed have to give in give up or and he didnt know how he was incapable of it as his tension and worry and fear increased so did his stubbornness no crooked cop was pushing him around no twobit floozy was giving him orders no one was making him do a goddamned thing that he didnt want to do thats the way it was thats the way it had been all his life and if anyone didnt like it they knew what they could do about it they might kill him but they wouldnt change him they might give him a beating but theyd damned sure know theyd been in a fight so there was a stalemate one which no amount of subtly insistent threats from joyce could jar him out of one which would remain in his own mind at least until he himself decided to change it his instinct for survival tangled with unrelenting stubbornness and subconsciously relishing the situation revelling in a feeling of nobility and martyrdom he would neither retreat nor go forward in the end he resolved the stalemate himself for the same reason and as harrowingly as he had done so with countless others because he was tired of it because he had gotten all the selftorturing pleasure from it that could possibly be extracted being what he was however he could not admit this it was amys doing not his it was amy who while he was tottering right on the brink gave him a push if amy had been fair if shed been understanding if shed been forgiving if shed been a saint instead of another human like himself if shed been willing to take everything he dished out meanwhile whimpering with adoration and selfabnegation well that was really all he expected of her although he wouldnt have put it quite that way afterwards when he had acquired a reasonably normal perspective he couldnt understand how he could have acted as he had how any grown man could have behaved in such a determinedly boorish and uningratiating manner he had been given no excuse to behave that way nothing that could be sanely regarded as an excuse on the contrary amy showed much less spirit and independence than she usually did she smiled at provocative statements she laughed off nearinsults she petted him literally and figuratively when she must have felt like clouting him and somehow it only made bugs worse the greater her efforts to please him the greater were his to be displeased and displeasing with part of his mind he was aware of this he knew he was utterly wrong and getting wronger by the minute but he just couldnt help it he was like a man in a dream delighting in deeds which at the same time sickened and shocked him amy had cooked liver for their dinner it was not a dish that bugs had any very strong feelings about either way but tonight he decided to dislike it so after a few obviously reluctant bites he pushed his plate aside yeah he mumbled unconvincingly it was okay all right just wasnt very hungry he guessed oh im sorry arent you feeling well mac yeah sure im feeling well why not i just said i wasnt hungry i guess i should have got something else she said apologetically i meant to but they were having a special on liver today and oh you know how it is with a woman just cant pass up a bargain of course if id known that you didnt like amy for never mind have your own way about it im sorry honey she smiled quickly i wont say another word if youre not hungry youre not and why should you eat when youre not bugs managed to say that he was sorry too but he didnt sound like he meant it and he didnt except with that very small part of his mind she was picking on him he told himself she of all people was finding fault with him he drank coffee and smoked a cigarette while she hurried through her meal he studied her out of brooding sultry eyes she looked childishly young tonight like a gay friendly child in a womans body her clear peachesandcream skin was free of makeup her candycolored hair was pulled back in a horsestail beneath their silky brown lashes her gray eyes were straight forward and sparkling she was wearing a housedress neat stiffly starched and immaculately clean yet faded and shrunken it barely came to her knees fitted snugly over the curves of her body her full breasts strained against the material were pushed upward by its tightness and bugs could see deep into the hollow between them he stared almost openly feeling a surge in his unreasoning resentment he wanted her wanted to look upon her again as he had looked upon her that first time and the desire made him furious what was she trying to pull anyway what was the idea in appearing so damned girlish and innocent when they both knew that she wasnt he continued to stare gradually a slow flush spread over her face and her hand moved timidly to the front of her dress tried to narrow the gap of its neckline ill bet i look a sight she murmured selfconsciously i was racing around all day cleaning house and i didnt have time to fix myself up i i usually plan things better but i guess ive gotten kind of offschedule since i quit working and mac she said mac whats the matter darling darling dear honey thats what she was calling him these days the same names she had used to call ford if she wasnt still doing it matter he said what do you mean well you know why are you looking at me like that like what bugs shrugged just thinking i guess wondering how you were getting along with ford these days but she set down her coffee cup nervously i dont see lou any more honey i told you that yeah i guess you did tell me that didnt you he said deliberately havent figured out where he gets his money yet have you mac she put a hand over his lets not talk about that again tonight please youll just get upset and it wont change anything i dont know how you can do it he raged suddenly hes running a wideopen town isnt he hes rolling in dough isnt he you know he is and you know he cant be drawing much more than three thousand dollars salary a year and yet you sit there and tell me he isnt a crook please dear cant we just why dont you admit it he jerked his hand from beneath hers why do you go on defending him why when youve got all the facts right in front of you do you mac ive tried to explain the towns always been more or less open as you put it the people want it that way theyd never vote taxes to stop something that they see no real harm in and with so many thousands of newcomers well you can understand how it is honey how can one man with a few deputies do anything but what he is doing just keeping things out in the open where they can be watched and keeping them under control oh sure sure ive heard that yarn before every crooked cop in the country has the same alibi i dont say its right mac i dont believe lou thinks it is but hes realistic and and hes got a nice thing going for himself she looked at him steadily almost without expression for a moment slowly she pushed her plate back spoke in a quiet even voice i dont know where lous money comes from mac i never asked he never explained presumably for good reasons of his own no wait she held up a hand let me finish when i say good reasons i mean it literally because whatever else lou is he is honest i know he is so does everyone else whos known him for any length of time but that doesnt make sense bugs insisted surlily if he all right it doesnt make sense then but its still the truth bugs scowled and jabbed out his cigarette amy studied him her gray eyes defiant debating something within herself there was a fiddlestring tautness about the silence a feeling of tension mounting to the breaking point then she smiled and it was as though the sun had come out from behind a cloud and grudgingly bugs found himself smiling back grudgingly yet with a vast sense of relief amy came around the table and kissed him on the forehead she tousled his hair fondly her lips curved with a kind of dreamy softness it was very peaceful never in his life had he known such peace then abruptly he pulled her down into his lap amy he said amy i tell me about it darling tell me her warm mouth brushed lovingly against his cheek itll be all right whatever it is if it isnt well make it all right nothing bugs said i mean and there was no longer anything or rather that is all there was anything something not someone but something buttocks and breasts and thighs and he was crushing her mouth with his pawing and clutching and grasping at her one hand was thrust high beneath the prim little dress roamed there crudely and cruelly and one of her breasts filled his other hand and and she was silent and unprotesting she said nothing made no movement of her own she merely looked at him he released her suddenly and shoved her to her feet he jumped up and started for the door paused without turning around well he said gruffly why dont you say it might as well say it as think it i thought there might be something you wanted to say mac she waited a moment but anyway im not sure what i think so perhaps yeah perhaps theres nothing to be said why dont you go on in the livingroom and ill be with you as soon as i stack the dishes he went in and sat down she joined him after a few minutes and again apparently she had decided to forget and forgive it was all right she told him with her eyes her smile her warmth he hadnt meant what hed seemed to and she knew that he hadnt she sat down at his side on the lounge she talked talking for both of them trying to bring him out of himself then she played a few pieces on the piano singing in her soft sweet voice and nothing seemed to help the bitter blackness crept slowly upward and around him whats wrong with me he thought a little wildly with that small rational segment of his mind shes all ive got the only thing left to cling to all that really matters everything else is headed for hell on a handcar and now im trying to pile her on too and mac she was seated at his side again i dont like to keep asking you but he glared at her silently daring her to ask again if he was in any kind of trouble she left the sentence unfinished moved smoothly to another topic hed never been through the house had he well there was nothing much to see of course but if hed like to look around they began with the basement with its faint sweetsour smell of straw and apples and earth from there they went up the back stairs to the attic huge ghostly and shadowed with the discards of bygone days and then down to the second floor amy led the way from room to room determinedly friendly fighting with everything she had against his growing ugliness once she asked him how he liked the place how he would like to live in a big oldfashioned house like this one another time she said she supposed shed have to sell it since there was no work for her here in ragtown and she hardly knew where else to go or what she would do if she did go somewhere else shed always lived here and her folks had always lived here and this was their room she opened the door of the largest room one with two fourposter double beds poor darlings they had an awfully hard time of it dad fell off a horse and broke his back and he was bedfast until he died and mother she was never quite the same after he passed on she lost interest in everything and and god he thought that must have been hard on you honey harder than anything i went through with my folks they meant well even if they did do a lot toward mixing me up and they didnt ask anything of me and i didnt have much to give them or anyone if id been asked but you a girl like you gay and full of life and pretty as a picture you tied down out here in the prairie nowhere tied to two dying people watching the years slip away from you that was the way his thoughts ran but he said he wasnt quite sure what he said the wording of it but the sense of it was clear enough she looked up at him slowly whitefaced eyes sick with shock then without a word she led the way out of the room and into her own she gestured toward a spindlelegged loveseat covered with faded pink satin he sat down on it started to make room for her and she sat down on a straightbacked chair now about the questions you asked mac she said quietly the answer to the never mind bugs grunted i wasnt thinking how the answer to the first one is yes i hadnt thought much about it but i suppose that his father and my parents being invalided for so long did give lou and me a strong common bond as to the second question the answer is no our parents illness did not make things convenient for us we didnt take advantage of it for the purpose you implied in fact skip it bugs growled uncomfortably i i didnt mean that the way it sounded of course you mean it youve been working up to it ever since we became acquainted i cant blame you i suppose although i am disappointed and hurt i hoped youd accept me without question as ive been willing to accept you since you cant do that however im going to tell you something she had thought she was in love with lou ford made herself believe that she was and she had clung to him chased him fought to hold onto him despite his determination not to be held and the obvious fact that he was wholly unsuited to married life for you see she had felt that she must marry him she had never gone with any other men she had been unable to marry at an age when most girls did and now he was the one remaining eligible the one man of her own kind and without him as she saw it there would be nothing no real reason for existence none of the things that make life worth living only a yawning lonely emptiness stretching endlessly through the endless years ahead it had seemed an unbearable prospect she had persuaded herself that it must be avoided at whatever cost and lou ford had led her to believe that it might be in a certain way so she had been ready to submit to him and when she was he had laughed at her jeered and teased her some other time he had grinned after all that stuff was pretty cheap could be anyways why toss hers away when she might need it later her immediate reaction was one of outrage murderous anger it had taken her a few days to see the way of what he had done that in his shaming of her his calculated cruelty he had reinstated her sense of values so securely that they could never be shaken loose again he had demonstrated that no matter how nominally desirable a thing may be its price can be too high and it is too high if the payment bankrupts the purchaser and he had driven that message home with painful emphasis on several later occasions she had resented the lesson doubtless she was still a little resentful but she knew he was right and after she met bugs i did a pretty cheap thing mac one that ill always be ashamed of and its not my fault that i didnt do something a lot cheaper but it is all i did there was nothing more than well just what you saw you mean bugs frowned you mean you were nak you had your clothes off and you didnt uh thats what i mean dont you believe me well he shrugged well sure if you say so he ran a hand across his mouth but not quite quickly enough not quickly enough to conceal the smirk of incredulity well sure he repeated of course you have to admit it sounds kind of uh funny is that what you were going to say mac well perhaps youre right it is funny and now that i think of it theres something still funnier she got up and moved toward the door he arose too thinking that she was leaving but instead she closed the door and turned off the light and in the faint moonlight which drifted through the window he saw her body arched delicately as she drew her dress off over her head she felt her way across the room shedding her other garments leaving them where they fell the bed creaked and she said all right mac his mouth felt very dry he licked his lips and stammered aw no amy it doesnt make any difference even if even if she said come on well if that was the way she wanted it you couldnt blame him after all he was a man and a man couldnt help being like he was made and a man expected and had a right to expect a woman to be better than he was so so bugs still knew very little about women but by now he knew at least enough to realize that amy had spoken the truth and along with the inevitable ecstasy of his union with her there was also abysmal shame and soulsickening terror terror of the loss he had suffered for naturally he had lost her he knew it even before he arose from the bed from the hateful triumph over her body amy i want to tell you something i i dont want to hear it she said just get out but but i didnt mean it i am in trouble its got me half out of my mind i didnt want to tell you about it because because you didnt trust me because theres nothing in you to trust or love or understand with just a lot of hatred and grudges and suspicion nnow shakily she started to rise her voice rising now you get out get out and dont ever come back dont ever come near me or try to amy if youll only do you hear me get out she advanced on him eyes wild small fists drawn back he grabbed up his clothes and fled into the hallway he dressed out in the hall hopping clumsily from one foot to the other getting his shirt buttoned the wrong way snapping a shoestring making a botch of things generally in his haste to escape in his minds eye he stood off from himself examined the hulking redfaced panting and fumbling figure in the hallway and it was as though he was staring into a funhouse mirror he felt preposterously small and futile he was livid with shame and embarrassment he hated himself and he hated her for making him hate himself he dressed and was out of the house in a few minutes minutes that seemed like hours he stopped at the first bar he came to tossed down five drinks in a row and when he left he took a pint bottle with him he went to the hotel to his room and began drinking the booze didnt get him drunk there wasnt enough whiskey in ragtown to get him drunk that night it merely intensified his fury increased and compressed it until it was like a great rat trapped in a tiny corner raging insanely for the release of action but not tonight he thought not not any more tonight but tomorrow night he would do it tomorrow night do something move decisively and irrevocably one way or another there was a soft rapping on his door a familiar shaveandahaircutsixbits knock grinning grimly he got up and opened it closed and locked it again as joyce brushed past him he moved back into the room with her looked her up and down slowly as she turned and faced him well bugs yeah he moved closer to her backing her against the bed yeah joyce well she smiled nervously uh nothing i just stopped by to to to see how i was getting along he nodded to see how i was feeling well im plumb glad you asked as your buddy lou ford would say im plain tickled that you came by and thats a fact because bugs dont youve been drinking and because i feel pretty lowdown about as lowdown as a man can get and that dont quite bring me down to your level of course but its close enough i cant crawl under the plank with you but you rotten crazy bastard her palm cracked against his face ill im getting out of here without your clothes you mean you go right ahead but the clothes wont be going not if you leave before i say you can well he got a grip on the front of her dress whats it going to be she bit her lip forced a tremulous smile her hand moved coyly to his chest twisted one of the misbuttoned buttons aw bugs this isnt any way for my bugsy boy to act whats got into you anyway honey that isnt the question not whats got into me but whats about to she snickered unwillingly a strange excitement began to dance in her eyes still she liked to call the shots shed gotten used to doing it and shed almost forgotten the days when things were different painfully so and the exquisite pleasure to be derived from that painful difference it was dim in her mind growing clearer but not quite recognized as yet lets not bugs hmm no really i mean it i absolutely refuse and you cant make me you cant i he said his fingers dug into her flesh cant i joyce cant bbugs a great shiver ran through her body bugs yyoure youre ahhhhhhh she lay sprawled on the bed breathing in deep luxurious breaths exhausted depleted replenished bugs sat on the beds edge smoking moodily in the darkness thinking that no matter how low a man went there was always another low awaiting him even after this there was doubtless another one and doubtless he would descend to it and for as little reason as he had descended to this one and the one immediately preceding it bugs honey she found his hand and he jerked it rudely away maybe afterwards after things are settled we could clear out of this place go away somewhere together the nearest whorehouse thats as far as ill go with you park you there and put you to work aw now bugs not that i wouldnt if it was necessary id do anything for you honey but what makes you so sure it wont be where else do you think youre going to get any dough huh she sat up abruptly what the hell do you mean where oh she broke off seeing the sardonic jeer on his face went back to her former meekness it isnt just me bugs if it was just up to me id never think of trying to uh persuade you to do anything that you didnt want to but sure just like you havent been trying to but i cant help it honey you know that theres another person involved what i want or dont want doesnt really make much difference bugs tossed his cigarette into a tray he squared around on the bed a little sat looking down into her face all right he said well say its that way but now youre going to tell me something no more of this damned hinting and beating around the bush get me no more of this amiallright and howamifeeling stuff youre going to come right out and tell me what you do want i want to hear you say it bbut but you already know honey why should i i said i wanted to hear you say it spit it out do it and do it fast or im through so shut up dont threaten me or ill break your goddamned neck so make up your mind say it or drop it but her head moved irritably against the pillows she took a deep breath and held it then slowly let it out again in a quiet sigh of surrender all right bugs she said all right darling you dont trust me but ill still out with it i want you to kill him i want you to kill my husband there was a kind of peace on this new level at which he found himself uneasy but still soothing and peculiarly satisfying marvelously troublefree compared with the black turmoil he had come through he had known such peace before experiencing it now he wondered why it must be so insistently impinged upon by the leering image of chief deputy lou ford because of course ford was all wrong about him the deputy had apparently dug deeply into his background excavated the facts behind the bleak syllabus of the police record and hed twisted the annals of bugss life into that seemingly factual but cruelly and viciously distorted casehistory which he had recited to bugs several days ago he made trouble for himself ford had said he deliberately plunged himself into one scrape after another in so doing he bulwarked his selfpitying conviction that the whole world was against him and it was a hell of a lot more fun as well as a hell of a lot easier than doing something constructive there was that dame he had married for example yeah sure he was a greenhorn when it came to women but that was no excuse a tenyearold boy anyone that had sense enough to come in out of the rain would have known that she had to be a tramp and he bugs had damned well known it even if he wouldnt admit it hed simply stuck his neck out because he liked being hit over the head another example that screwball detective bugs had shot now here was a guy who was obviously dangerous and who obviously had a pick on him yet bugs hadnt done a damned thing to forestall the disaster which he must have foreseen hed just hung around waiting for the lightning to strike pride guts balls he wouldnt kick a skunk would he or lie down next to a rattlesnake making a damned fool of yourself didnt take pride or guts did it well then ford had had a lot more to say but it was all in the same vein he liked being in jams hed rather have things go bad than good which of course was screwy on the face of it bugs thought angrily anyone could see that it was it had just been some more of fords whipcracking pouring in on him because he knew he had to take it the guy couldnt open his mouth without needling someone and when that someone was really under his thumb bugs finished his shift he went to bed slightly hungover from the booze he had drunk grasping at that strange uneasy peace which kept slipping away from him he started to doze and a disturbing thought pushed into his mind aung there stubbornly forcing him back into wakefulness everything was going fine no trouble no way for anyone to make trouble and then i went to dudleys room ollie had no right to ask me to he couldnt have honestly expected me to but i went anyway knowing that it wouldnt do any good to talk to dudley knowing that i didnt dare to do anything more than talk boiling it down i didnt have to go and i didnt have any reason for going and yet bugs squirmed irritably and flopped over on his back he lay scowling eyes squinted staring up at the ceiling suppose there had been no woman in dudleys bathroom suppose dudley hadnt gone out the window wasnt it still pretty likely that hed have gotten into trouble in fact wasnt it virtually inevitable that he would have and hadnt he known that he would at the time he went to the room well well of course not it was easy to second guess on a deal to see where youd goofed after youd done it if hed known it was going to land him in a scrape why he rolled over on his side again he burrowed his head into the pillow closed his eyes firmly and kept them closed at last he slept and when he awakened it was night the night mike hanlon was in the bathroom when bugs arrived at his suite braced against the sink he finished washing his hands then sank back down into his wheelchair and rolled himself out into the livingroom well bugs his shrewd old eyes swept over bugss face we get our tour at last huh i was beginning to think youd forgot all about me no no i hadnt forgotten bugs looked away from him i well i just kept putting it off and sure i understand well ill be with you in a minute or two help yourself to a drink while youre waiting bugs decided he could use a drink he poured a stiff shot from a nearby carafe and took it into the bathroom he added ice water to it gulped it with a shudder as he bent over to draw another glass his head bumped lightly against the medicine cabinet and its mirrored door swung open sipping the water he stared absently at the crowded shelves of nostrums one bottle was sitting right on the edge of its shelf in danger of falling off he pushed it back inside then frowning unconsciously continued to stare at it for a moment longer it was almost empty the liquid in the bottom was a clear white and had an oily look about it bugs couldnt say why it interested him subtly disturbed him any number of medicines were a clear white and oily looking but still he was reaching for it starting to turn it around to examine the label but hanlon called to him at that moment so he closed the door and went back into the livingroom he wheeled the invalid out into the hail unlocking the door of the elevator he had appropriated he switched on the light and wheeled him inside i see you havent forgotten my preference for lighted elevators hanlon grinned not that id ever be worried of course about you being careless yeah bugs closed the door turning his back to him whered you like to start mr hanlon weel how about the roof bugs nodded silently he was calm enough not afraid to speak but the words somehow would not form themselves and something whispered that it was best to leave them unformed as much as possible hanion should do the talking they reached the roof bugs wheeled him out of the car and across the tiled floor to the guardwall and they looked out over the oil fields bugs didnt think there was plenty of time nothing needed to be done or decided now in this moment all there was was this he and the old man and the night and the blazing thundering jungle of steel flame licked the sky from a thousand flambeaux the huge torches set up to consume excess gas were everywhere barely burning at one moment then suddenly ripping the darkness with a fiftyfoot spear of flame still smell like rotten eggs to you bugs huh no i guess it doesnt got to where i kind of like it thought you would hanlon murmured i mean how can you dislike a thing like that anything that comes from the oil because well maybe people got hurt the way i went after it but damned little relatively and most of em profited in the long run yknow he laughed a little sadly itll sound funny to you but that was originally what attracted me to the business you could help yourself in it get rich maybe without hurting other people you didnt have to squeeze em you didnt have to push them down to push yourself up all you had to do was find the oil and everyone was better off and no one was hurt unless it was you yeah yes sir bugs said yes because theres one thing a man needs damned bad if he hits it rich and its the one thing he cant buy he cant buy someone he can trust if he could do you think he could bugs do you think if i bought a man offered any price he named within reason that hed stay bought he waited looking up into bugss face bugs shrugged silently indifferently but his heart quickened its beat well hanlon sighed well thats that i guess they remained at the guardwall for a few minutes longer then hanlon peered around in the darkness gestured toward a shadowy mass a dozen or so feet away thats where the remodeling is going on isnt it the terrace extension well lets go over and have a look at it bugs pulled the chair back from the wall and wheeled him down the tiles they reached the array of building materials and tools and bugs paused to let him look around he waited a minute or two then started to resume pushing the old man stopped him quickly nothing to see over there i guess just more brick and lumber whatever you say bugs said lets see now i wonder if you could squeeze me through this stuff and out to the terrace ought to be a good view from there well yeah i guess there is but he stared down at hanlon eyes blank and dull he seemed to stand there for hours hesitating yet it was not even a split second for there was no decision to reach nothing to make up his mind about that had all been done right in the beginning just a minute he said ill see how it looks he moved a wheelbarrow out of the way and went down a narrow aisle between some cement sacks and a long mixingtrough at the terrace doors he pushed two stacked sawhorses aside and pulled them open he took a cautious step or two forward came to an abrupt stop ahead of him there was a breach in the guardrail an open door into emptiness on the left where the terrace was being extended the rail had been completely removed a man would have to be damned careful out here and even then in the deceptive darkness it would be easy to bugs hesitated deliberating then he went back through the doors and returned to hanlon guess we better not he said too dangerous dangerous but yeah you might wind up down in the street ill just block those doors again and bugs hanlon cut him off sharply bugs i want to go out there and i know that you i mean there isnt a thing for you to worry about ill take the responsibility everyone knows that i like to have my own way and and he looked up at bugs with a kind of wheedling eagerness he waited the eagerness fading giving way to something else and then he laughed nervously and shifted his gaze this damned robe he plucked it from his lap dont need it any more than ha ha that gun i had with me last time shouldve left it back in my suite with the gun i okay bugs well well bugs said look mr hanlon i guess wed better be shoving off ive got work to do and wait the old man gripped the wheels of his chair holding them motionless whats the matter i told you itd be all right didnt i i showed you you wont be taking any risk at all and his voice trailed off into silence and one hand went up to his face rubbed it shakily and he heaved a tired and wondering sigh bugs he quavered ii dont know how to say it i i was right wasnt i bugs right and all wrong you cant buy a man and you dont have to all you have to do is his voice broke he sighed again and went on youll stay here in ragtown wont you bugs stay with the hotel im not trying to buy you but youre capable of something a lot better than a housedicks job and bugs shook his head in honest bewilderment for consciously he could not understand briefly his path had run parallel to an abyss of evil but now it was aeons behind him it was a bad allbutforgotten dream rather than a onetime reality im sorry bugs hanlon said apologetically i should have known you wouldnt do it you couldnt you couldnt commit a coldblooded murder told you so myself lou fords voice drifted out of the darkness too bad i cant say the same for you mister hanlon trailed by another deputy he emerged from behind a pile of brick he sauntered up to bugs and hanlon flicking the head from a match touching the flame to the tip of his cigar yes sir he grinned easily at bugs i told him you wouldnt catch you doing anything that anyone wanted you to bugs stared at him dumbly hardly hearing what he said still trying to digest what hanlon had said fords grin changed imperceptibly and for a moment the bite went out of his voice you wouldnt do it period he said just aint built that way now mister hanlon here he could do it probably make a pretty slick job of it too fr example he could make out like he was scared to death hisself and while he had the law lookin the other way thats enough hanlon snapped i made a mistake and im damned glad it was one however if you feel that youve been imposed upon that ive taken your time up needlessly why just say so and ill give you a tip a big one ford asked in an awed tone maybe a big shiny twobit piece aw gee mister hanlon what do you think al a whole twobitses to divvy up between us makes my mouth plumb water the other deputy drawled probly go hog wild and spend it all in one place ford chuckled hanlon let out an angry snarl i said to cut it out go pull your clown act somewhere else i dont have to take it and im not going to well okay ford said sadly i guess if we dont get our twobits and you aint even going to offer us a drink did your wife have a drink with you tonight mister hanlon did she have a drink with me what the hell has that did she mister hanlon well i i believe she did she was in my suite tonight she usually stops by at least once a day and we usually have a drink together uhhuh sounds real homey got any chloral hydrate around your suite mister hanlon i believe so i had a prescription for some i seldom use it because of the aftereffect but then you got practically all of it left right hanlon started to nod then caught himself remained silent for a moment you dont need me to tell you do you ford he asked quietly if you knew i had some as you undoubtedly did then you know how much i have left you already had the answer to every question youve asked me now what are you implying that i doctored my wifes drink with chloral weel dont hardly believe implyin is the right word i see you really think im stupid enough to do a thing like that well fords eyes glinted you was stupid enough to chisel a lot of folks that like you and trusted you but i guess you wouldnt figure that was stupid would you probably looked on that as real smart the old mans shoulders slumped a little his hands moved in a tired gesture and then he dropped them into his lap how is she no never mind he said dully whats the charge murder or attempted murder murder i see the poor damned fool hanlon shook his head mustve figured on sticking me with an attempt rap and she took too big a dose well murder isnt a bailable offense is it ford nope it sure aint and thats a fact then what are we waiting for at the twelfth floor ed gusick brought the car to a stop and bugs prompted by a nudge from ford got off the deputy also got off and escorted him a few steps down the hallway want you to stick around your room a while he said quietly quickly now you got that you understand what im sayin you aint maybe in a kind of a daze bugs nodded shook his head he was pretty well out of the stupor which the rush of events had thrust him into but what why because someones comin to see you and its damned important that you be there wait a minute he peered down the hall aint that your room with the door open bugs turned and looked he heard the faint hum of a vacuum cleaner its just rosie the maid you know now the maid huh well that party ought to be comin to see you any minute now he clapped bugs on the shoulder ran back to the elevator its door clanged shut and bugs went on to his room his head ached his body was damp with sweat of nervous excitement hed had it tonight he thought if anything else happened before he got a chance to pull himself together he supposed he should feel relieved because joyce was out of his hair for good which meant that if ford ever had been in it he also was out he had to be obviously since he could only work through joyce so there was much to feel relieved and grateful about and bugs was but not very much right at the moment he couldnt feel much of anything he entered his room nodded an absent greeting to rosie her bright smile faded and she looked at him anxiously as he dropped into a chair is there something wrong mr mckenna anything i can do for you thanks ill be all right bugs shook his head just a little upset you see he told her about joyces death and hanlons arrest rosies lovely eyes sickened with horror oh how awful how terrible you know mr mckenna she must have already been poisoned at the time i saw her tonight she didnt look at all well but she insisted that shed be all right after she laid down a while so i just got her suite cleaned as quickly as i could and left if id only known forget it bugs said no way you could have known perhaps not but i cant help feeling a little guilty are you sure she is dead mr mckenna not just dying i mean theres no chance that they may be able to no shes dead dead when they found her i guess how awful rosie repeated if id only there was a brisk knock and amy standish came through the open door she was very prim chilly of manner as bugs got clumsily to his feet took a hesitant step toward her she gestured curtly to rosie no dont leave miss vara go right ahead with your work what i have to say to mr mckenna will only take a minute amy bugs said id like to please she held up a hand i want to get this over with youre in some kind of difficulty i believe i think you mentioned something about it well i dont know whether the amount is sufficient to be of help but i have five thousand dollars at the house if youll stop by ill give it to you but bugs was starting to scowl whered you get that much money why should you give it to me does it matter you got it from ford right youre trying to help him not me am i sure you are he cant use me any more everything is washed up for good and if i stuck around i might get to be a nuisance so this is my payoff im supposed to take it and get amy smiled peculiarly a smile of tired and wondering amusement bugss scowl deepened what was so funny anyway what he said made sense didnt it well maybe it was a little odd that ford would pay him to clear out ford could doubtless run him out if he chose to do it without any fear of repercussions and amy could have borrowed the money on her house but still he didnt know he couldnt say why hed said what he had it was as though hed been compelled to as though some inner compulsion had swerved him out of a smooth path and into a rockstrewn rut i couldnt believe it amy said wonderingly lou told me youd react like this he told me what youd say almost word for word and i so he did put you up to it you admit it did i i dont recall that i did but well all right then bugs said stubbornly tell me im wrong you tell me im wrong and ill ive said all i have to say the moneys at the house if you want it ill give it to you but but she was gone jerking the door shut behind her bugs remained standing one hand halfextended feeling very lost and lonely in the echoing silence just aint happy when things are going good cant foul em up one way you ll do it another he heard a faint sound a suppressed gurgle quickly he dropped his hand to his side and turned glaring to rosie she was shivering shuddering with laughter her eyes danced with impish merriment well he said whats so goddamned funny you she said you are you sweet stubborn stupid lummox she came to him suddenly drawing him into her arms laying her head against his chest her arms tightened pressing him into the soft length of her body and then her hands began to roam probed sensually delicately uh look rosie bugs began i dont think we no you dont do you you dont think at all and i really think its pretty wonderful do you know darling if things were only a little different id take you with me i have more than enough brains for both of us and youd be so easy to manage and you are such a pleasant bed companion rosie bugs said sharply i what the hell is this oh yes my stupid sweet i really enjoyed myself very much sex is one thing i simply cant fake about of course sex wasnt my primary purpose you didnt have the money in your room so i thought you might be carrying it next to your body and when i found out you werent well you didnt get any more of those letters did you and you never saw any connection between the two events did you dont do it darling dont ever try because you must have an awful lot of guts literally i mean and these specials do make such a mess she stepped back quickly levelling the gun his own gun at him she said again dont do it darling dont even look like youre going to id hate terribly to kill you but like you hated to kill joyce huh and dudley who says i did what proof is there no i dont have any murder charges against me yet and i wont if i can possibly avoid it so if youll just take out your car keys and drop them on the floor come on do what i told you to bugs did it hastily rosalie ordered him to turn around gesturing impatiently when he hesitated i mean it darling im trying to be nice to you but im liable to get tired very suddenly but i dont get it bugs said stubbornly ford doesnt have anything on you why do something that will but mr ford is a very peculiar man sweetheart if he ever got the notion that there should be something against me and i have an idea that hes about to hed never stop until he found it aside from that theres nothing more for me to do in this hole i havent accomplished what i came here for but ive made a good start on it even after ive deducted for a protracted vacation in mexico ill have practically enough to to what sorry i cant tell you that now if youll turn around please wait a minute bugs said you youre talking about that five thousand youre going to rob amy of course but you neednt worry honey she wont get hurt at all if shes sensible bugs looked into the placidly beautiful face a face as free of warmth as lacking in honest compassion as something chiseled out of marble sensible he groaned inwardly what would the word mean to a dame like this just how unsensible would you have to be to get the curtain drawn on you dont do it rosie he begged its armed robbery you can get a life sentence for it in texas why run a risk like that for five thousand bucks you dont have to for gods sake why a girl with your looks could thanks but believe me darling five thousand dollars can be very hard to get particularly for a girl with my looks when those looks become a little too well known you know she finds it difficult to move around where the money is available but dammit thats all turn around turn around or ill kill you there was finality in her voice bugs turned all right now over to that closet and open the door thaats the way thats my darling now get in there the gun suddenly prodded him in the back go on you overgown ox you can make it get in and get down on your knees bugs squeezed and jammed himself into the closet he went down on his knees fine rosalie vara said softly hes a real nice boy and now hes going to have a real nice nap the gun crashed down on his head the door closed and the lock clicked but bugs didnt hear it it was very peaceful in the large corner room of the city hospital the lights were dimmed to a friendly glow the airconditioner purred sleepily there was the gently pungent smell of antiseptic and subdued murmur of voices intermittent glimpses through the doorway of whiteuniformed nurses and whitejacketed men life was all around you all its sights and sounds and smells pressing against you but never obtrusively leaving you alone until you were ready to join it mike hanlon yawned luxuriously squirmed his tough old body against the coolfeeling sheets of his bed it was the first time hed really felt relaxed since he didnt know when he decided wryly that hed have to get arrested for murder more often and he said as much to lou ford as the deputy came through the door ford sat down looking a little discomfitted hanlon laughed goodnaturedly but dont let me take all the fun out of it for you ford im okay now but you really had me sweating for a while well now ford said sheepishly wouldnt want you to think i did it just to give you a bad time i had to make it look like a real cinch or sure you did i understand and no hard feelings hows joyce doing still talking ninety to the minute nothin like a persons thinking theyre going to die to start em to talking ford tucked a cigar into his mouth and struck a match to it course she never was in no real danger of dyin she got help too quick for that how did that happen anyway hanlon said interestedly youd anticipated an attack on her nope probably should have but i didnt ford said joyce is alive because she played it smart she keeled right over and played dead the minute she felt the stuff working on her so rosie didnt stick around to make sure that she was dead she beat it and joyce was able to use the phone before she passed out i see hanlon nodded now heres something else i dont get in fact he hesitated theres damned little of the deal that i do get i know youre probably tired of talking about it but if you wouldnt mind filling me in wouldnt mind at all ford said promptly if you hadnt asked me he added grinning id probably have told you anyway it aint often that i get to take a hand in anything real interesting and the telephone rang ford murmured a word of apology and picked it up lou ford speakin yeah well thats good uhhuh uhhuh no i guess i can wait until tomorrow swell see you then he hung up hanlon shot him an inquiring glance was who ford said innocently looky hanlon you did invite me to tell you the whole story didnt you you want it all instead of a pecky piece here an there that wont give me no chance to show how smart i am sure hanlon laughed not that i need to be shown take it right from the beginning then with dudley getting killed but that aint the beginning dudleys gettin hired was the beginnin why did westbrook hire him an why did he insist that dudley was on the level an why did dudley turn out to be not on the level well hanlon frowned im afraid i dont youd say westbrook was one hell of a shrewd guy wouldnt you it was his job to size people up an he risked that job when he stood up against you an hired dudley now whyd he do that anyway what made him so sure that dudley was absolutely okay just one answer isnt there hanlon hesitated for a moment then he let out a startled grunt why of course westbrook was sure he was okay because he was he but ford wait a minute if that was the case why why ford nodded an that one little why is the key to the whole thing dudley was up in his middle years hed been in hotel business all his life and hed never pulled a dishonest trick before an now a good friend had got him into a good job he didnt have no family dependin on him he wasnt in no personal jam where he had to have money all he had to do was just like hed always done an he was hunkydory an he didnt do it he did somethin that was bound to cost him his job an his reputation he broke faith with westbrook an he knew westbrook would get him blacklisted in every hotel in the country in other words he washed himself up for a lousy five thousand dollars just dont make much sense does it makes a hell of a lot less when you know he could just as easyve knocked down ten thousand wouldntve hurt him a bit more than stealin the five ford paused to relight his cigar he puffed on it grinned enjoyably at the hotel owner well gettin any ideas none that isnt pretty obvious all dudley needed was five thousand i cant see how he expected to live the rest of his life on hanlons voice trailed away then as ford continued to grin at him a slow grin spread over his own face why hell yes that five thousand was supposed to make him rich he was going to invest it in well oil couldnt be anything but oil out here he but wait a minute five thousand is peanuts in a proven oil field even if hed had ten times that much he couldnt have done anything with it well sure maybe he could have bought a tiny interest in an operation but hed be about as well off puttin his money in government bonds so we got another of those cantbebutis riddles ford said an the only person with the answer as i saw it was the person that killed dudley which brings us to bugs mckenna now i aint got the slightest idea why bugs did scuffle with him probly went there as a favor to westbrook thats right id take an oath on it but dudley was already a dead man before he ever tumbled out the window so we know our killer is someone else a woman by all appearances one of two women well joyce was out of it as far as i could see if shed wanted five thousand bad enough she couldve hocked some jewelry or talked it out of you so that leaves us with rosalie vara and rosies the biggest dangdest riddle yet a mickey artist is a pro you know bound to have a record somewhere and rosie didnt have one i put out twothree hundred informationwanteds on her every place big enough for a gal like that to operate and i didnt turn up a thing still i was sure she had to be it and i got a lot surer when i saw bugs give her a shakedown as she was comin out of the westex city post office mustve been tryin to blackmail him the way i figured on the dudley deal since there wasnt nothing else she knew hed been in dudleys room so she mustve been there herself well she was too smart to let bugs catch her but ford laughed gently absently that poor damned bugs so scared of doin something wrong that he couldnt do nothin right should have know i couldnt expect him to cooperate with me and i guess ive been pretty hard on him put him under all kinds of pressure to go bad but i felt i had to do it see there was a third person involved a young lady i think the world of and if bugs couldnt stay straight no matter what i wanted to scuse me aint borin you am i no no not at all hanlon stifled a yawn you were saying something about a third party about covered the subject i guess goin back to rosie and that day in westex i had her ride with me on the return to ragtown and that hunch of mine just kept growin and growin she was just too good to be true yknow pretty as a picture nice manners intelligent pretty fair education apparently and so dadblamed honest honest in a way that hurt her and didnt do no one any good i mean the gal was whiterlookin than me couldnt be more than a teensy bit negro so why make such a big todo about bein one well though i pretended to take her at her face value told her i was really after bugs and asked her to keep an eye on him for me and she got all wideeyed and trembly but she promised she would now ocourse if id mugged her or fingerprinted her idve known the truth right away but i didnt have no grounds for doin that an unless she was wanted somewhere shed be long gone fast anyways a murder had been committed in my county an i wanted it solved before i turned her over to anyone else so i put out another informationwanted on her practically the same one id put out before except for one word i didnt identify her as a negro well hell you never saw anything like it must have got fifty replies on her looked like shed been workin the chloral hydrate before she was old enough to walk no she wasnt wanted for anything right at the moment all that these different places wanted out of her was to keep the hell away from them and any time she showed up in one of em they gave her the roust they had plenty more to say about her none of it flatterin but ill just hit the high spots her folks came from here and they were pretty good people poor but honest she was of mexican or spanish descent her real name was vera rodriguez oh yeah and she had a pal named joyce and joyce had disappeared from her usual haunts about two weeks after rosie did yeah it was the same joyce your wife rosie came here first an then joyce showed up looked to me like rosie must have sent for her well i began to get the framework of the story about then tsee how it just about had to shape up rosie was layin low but whyd she travel fifteen hundred miles to a town where she couldnt operate and she didnt know no one she had to have a reason a mighty good one and she had to have it before she came here it couldnt be somethin she run across afterwards only thing i could think of was that it must be somethin connected with her folks and since her folks was spanish or mex maybe i better tell you that im part spanish on my mothers side some of my ancestors came over here way back in the sixteenth century and one of em got a whopping land grant from the king o spain god knows how many times the title changed hands in the next threefour hundred years but it had existed an if a person could prove it like i could and if he could prove that he was a descendant of the original grant owner like i could hed be in a pretty nice spot hed have a hell of a time takin the land away from the current owner probably wouldnt live long enough to fight it through the courts and itd cost him more than it was worth if he did but he could make one awful nuisance of himself you know he could doud the title to the property keep it from bein sold stop any business havin to do with it from being transacted in the end if you were the owner of the property youd just about have to cut him in with you yeah thats where my money comes from drawin a percentage of production from two oil companies over near westex i had to swear to keep quiet about it naturally because a lot of people around here have at least a little spanish blood and it might give em some ideas but itll all be comin out in court now anyways so say you are gettin tired aint you maybe i better huh no im fine hanlon protested just resting my eyes for a moment well ill wind it up fast cut out my surmisin and deductin and tell what actually happened spanish people take a lot of pride in their ancestry and a lot of mexicans like to claim spanish descent so rosies dad told some pretty tall tales about what big shots his ancestors had been stories hed probably heard from his own folks and when he died he left her a number of old papers and maps and legallookin documents well the time comes when shes got to lay low for a while go some place where she aint known so she takes this stuff to some lawyers to see if she can cash in on it they tell her she can that shes got a bonafide claim to several thousand acres of this country but theyll need a fivethousanddollar fee to prove the claim in court now that was a dead giveaway right there it proved they were shysters because if the case had been that much of a sure thing theydve wanted to take it on a percentage basis but rosie fell for the story probably talked herself into it as much as they did and since she had to do some travelin anyway she came here to see just what she had claim to an what it was ocourse was your holdings millions and millions of dollars and all she needed to get it was five thousand well bein so close to that kind of dough she didnt like to take any chances so she sends for joyce promisin to cut her in on the deal joyce has been mixed up in some offcolor stuff but nothin really serious in a boom oil town it wont be no trouble at all for her to golddig a few thousand bucks howsomeever joyce looks the situation over an she gets a lot better idea why split with rosie an she dont exactly trust rosie any more than rosie trusts her when she can grab the whole hog for herself so she marries you and right away she starts figuring out how to get rid of you she was afraid if she didnt do it pretty pronto ysee if she waited to inherit in the normal course of events you wouldnt have nothin for her to get she had to grab the property and cash it in or rosie would take it away from you naturally she couldnt blow the whistle on rosie if she did rosie would do some talkin herself more or less prove that the marriage had been entered into in bad faith which would be grounds for havin it dissolved so joyce stalled tried to kid rosie that she was doin her best to squeeze five thousand out of you an i guess you know that rosie wasnt kidded a bit she pretended to be shed visit joyce in her suite and everything would be friendly as hell meanwhile however she was working on dudley gettin him to steal the five thousand for a halfinterest in her claim he steals it she bumps him off because she never had no intention of splittin with no one but somethins happened to the money just what i dont know but i reckon i will some day anyway she thinks bugs got it and she tries to get it out of him until shes finally convinced that he dont have it well according to my calculations shell look around for another sucker and i plant one on her a guy thatll grab her when she tries to bump him off but rosies afraid to move just yet and if she can get joyce out of the way she can take all the time she wants so while shes workin in your suite she taps your chloral hydrate like she did yeah when she killed dudley she fills up the fountain pen or cigarette lighter or whatever she carries the stuff in then she drops in for a visit with joyce and dumps most of it into joyces drink joyce keels over rosie washes their glasses and puts em away then puts the rest of the chloral into an empty perfume bottle its supposed to be suicide see joyce supposedly killed dudley an now shes gotten scared or remorseful an scuse me ford picked up the phone again he said lou ford speak oh hello amy how are you understand the boys grabbed rosie without no trouble never mind about rosie amy snapped mac just got here and figured it was about time ford chuckled bet he ran all the way from town didnt he yes he did the poor darling he was actually crying he was so afraid something had happened to me and you stop that laughing lou ford me ford grinned

good care of you lou she said quickly wait a minute i but ford had already hung up the phone he bit the end from another cigar tucked it into his mouth he flicked the head from another match now about that missing five thousand he began i dont know what a soft snore interrupted him hanlons mouth was slightly open and his eyes were firmly closed and he slept the peace of the just or the adjusted the loneliness swept over ford again the loneliness and the bitterness but only briefly it was gone almost as soon as it came he grinned and stood up quietly he tiptoed out of the room he went down the hall stetson shoved back on his head cigar gripped between his teeth rocking in his highheeled boots laughing at himself jeering at himself laughing away the unbearable he reached the entrance and he
