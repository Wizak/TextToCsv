joan lowery nixon the specter chapter the whisper strikes through the darkness and i struggle to meet it clutching at the sound sikes it comes again a terrifying hiss did something in the darkness move is something there i grope for the light cord that dangles over the metal headboard of my hospital bed whos there i stammer and the sound of my voice in that dark room frightens me even more no one answers but i can feel the tension of someone listening my fingers jerk the cord and i swing my feet over the edge of the bed with the courage that comes only from that rush of light i jump up and throw back the white cotton curtain that separates my bed from that of the child by the window through the guardrail she stares at me with enormous deep blue eyes in a face that is as pale as her hair its the first time shes opened them since she was brought to the hospital this morning its as though the whisperer had broken a spell we are two scared people confronting each other her small body is a rigid board her hands like white clamps on the edges of the mattress sikes its a question and her glance darts about the room her voice is so thin so terrified that i put the rail down and sit on the edge of her bed i grasp her right hand uncoiling her taut fingers and wrapping them in my own sikes was here she says dont be scared i tell her look around the room im the only one here i can feel her begin to relax cautiously a little cat staring out the territory i sit with her quietly because i dont know what to say mrs rosa cardenas the round little nurses aide who gives back rubs the way shed knead bread fills me each day with fruit juice and hospital gossip through her i know that this little girl who looks as though shes about nine or ten had been with her parents in a fiery onecar smashup on i heading toward the hill country out of san antonio her parents had been killed but she had come out of it with what they hoped was nothing more than a concussion i also know that she has been unconscious from the time she was thrown from the car so i jump when she suddenly says sikes killed my father its creepy i dont want to handle it i jab at the button for the night nurse he was here you know she says i dont know anything yes someone had whispered but maybe it was this kid i had first thought someone had been in the room but i hadnt actually seen anyone sikes who was sikes i hit the button again wishing the nurse would hurry dont go away the girl says her fingers cling to mine so rightly its painful hey its all right i say im in the bed next to yours im not going anywhere the anger comes back with a rush and i tuck it around me hating my body that has brought me to this place who are you the girl asks dina harrington i answer then i remember that no one in the hospital knows who she is they found a wallet with a drivers license with her fathers name on it out of state with an address that doesnt exist according to mrs cardenas there was no identification for the mother whatever was in the car had burned mrs cardenas having a brotherinlaw in the police department is a great source of information you havent told me your name i say i work the call button julie she answers her eyes never leave my face it bothers me that she isnt asking the right questions i dont expect her to gasp where am i like in an old movie but shouldnt she call for her mother or try to find out what happened is she in some kind of state of shock the door flies open and mrs marsh the tall nurse with the mole on her chin comes in theres a black hair growing out of the mole and when she talks to me i go crazy trying not to stare at that mole mrs marsh never smiles i once told mrs cardenas mrs cardenas shrugged she has problems who hasnt her husband told her he wanted a bigger house they sold their old house she went out looking at model homes and he took off with the money and the receptionist in his office el diablo shes awake i tell mrs marsh she thinks someone was in the room she i stop in midsentence as mrs marsh briskly and efficiently begins doing all the temperature pulse and straighteningup things that nurses do seemingly ignoring me she shoos me out of the way get back in bed dina she says leave the light on please the doctor on duty will be here in a few minutes she yanks the curtain back into place between our two beds and leaves the room the door swings shut without a sound but julies voice is like a shiver behind that overlaundered barricade i dont want to be alone she whimpers could you pull back the curtains sure i manage it with one swift sweep of my arm this rime its my own bed i sit on dangling my legs over the side dont go away julie tells me im here i say ill be here a long rime after youve gone home with your relatives i havent got any it dawns on me that she knows her mother is dead too i shudder dont you have a grandmother an aunt somebody no weve got something in common although ive had seventeen years to get used to it the door opens and i quickly swing my legs up on the bed and pull the blanket up to my chin covering my clumsy cotton gown a stocky man with bristling yellow hair strides into the room hes wearing the traditional white coat but green plaid slacks sack out at the bottom like two grasshopper legs mrs cardenas says that dr paull is going to be a good doctor someday when he starts liking his patients but for now hes my least favorite person around the hospital mrs marsh who has followed him moves between the beds and reaches out for the curtain but julie cries out no dont do that i want dina to be here if shes here sikes wont come back who is sikes the doctor asks he puts up a hand to stop the nurse he killed my father julie says the doctor is silent for a moment studying her you know about the accident his glance moves to me and i shrug i didnt tell her she told me i was supposed to be killed too julie says without emotion as though she is talking about someone who doesnt exist dr paull ignores this and i wonder why maybe he thinks julie is out of her head shouldnt he ask her about it weve checked you carefully he says fortunately we think youve had nothing more than a concussion but now that youre conscious well be able to make some more tests thats a dumb way to talk to a little kid i have my mouth open to translate but he goes on does your head hurt yes he sits on the edge of her bed he is close enough to me so that i can smell his woodsy shaving lotion and see a little wrinkle flicker between his eyebrows as he talks he pushes back the sleeve of julies hospital gown and studies the bruises on her arm i study them too anyone can see they arent from the accident they are old browning bruises and i wonder how she got them i want to ask but decide i had better keep my mouth shut dr paull shines a light into julies eyes and makes a satisfied humhumming noise finally he takes a slow breath we dont know your first name he tells her julie how old are you julie nine and where do you live can you give us an address no she says we just lived in san antonio a week it was an apartment house its next to the freeway how about a former address where did you live before lots of places we used to live in a mobile home we moved a lot she is staring at him and his wrinkle flickers like a bad light bulb it would help us if we could find your relatives can you give us some names and addresses i havent got any relatives she tells him dr paull smooths down her sleeve and gently pats her hand maybe mrs cardenas is right about him we dont know much about you julie he says can you talk to us about what happened she doesnt move i dont see her even blink you and your parents were traveling in a car julie you were in the backseat apparently were guessing from the police report that there was some malfunction in the car that your father in some way lost control of the car sikes killed my father how can she say this in such a calm way i shiver again julie dr paull says quietly your father was killed in the accident your mother was killed too can you tell us her name nancy tears begin to roll from her eyes as she continues to gaze into his face i hug my knees with a sense of relief tears i can understand but there is so much i dont understand including myself i wish i could leave this place with its smells of laundrysoaped sheets and alcohol rubs even leave my body moving out and away through the walls through the air like so much vanishing mist and never come back dr paull takes a clipboard from the nurse and scratches at the paper with an old pocket pen were going to give you medication to help take away your headache julie he says he stands and pats her hand again before gently placing it on the bed mrs marsh makes quick movements with a hypo and a bottle rolls julie onto her side pulling back the bedcovers and zaps a needle into her hip i wince but julie doesnt seem to notice what is happening she slowly closes her eyes her shoulders relax and she sinks a little deeper into the bed mrs marsh slams the protective rail back into place the doctor turns and looks at me he leafs through some papers finally looks up and says dina harrington thats all i had almost begun to like this man when i saw him pat julies hand but now im angry at him i didnt used to get so angry at people dr lynn manning the resident psychiatrist tells me im really angry at myself i try to remember this its not dr paulls fault that im here but it is partly his fault that i dont like to be here shouldnt something go with the dina harrington i ask him like how are you feeling or any more problems with nausea according to what i read on the chart youre progressing satisfactorily not me the chart i try to sound matteroffact but its hard to keep the anger out of my voice the chart is progressing satisfactorily but im going to die didnt the chart tell you that mrs marsh sniffs and looks upward as though to say shes being a problem the hair in her mole quivers and i have to wrench my gaze away from it dr paull nods and says having a negative attitude wont help you nothing is going to help me i answer id be stupid not to face the facts dina im not your doctor he says im not going to go into that with you what id like to do is find out if julie kaines gave you any information about her family or herself i glance over at julie shes asleep and breathing smoothly her straggly blond hair tangled around her thin face she talked about this person sikes she thought he was in the room aside from that nightmare he says why do you think it was just a nightmare i ask him i heard the whisper too it might have been julie it might have been someone else it felt as though someone was in the room it was dark in here and i was scared the wrinkle between his eyebrows is at it again you didnt see anyone it could be i didnt see anyone because it was dark and because it took a while to turn on the light if someone was here hed have had time to get out of the room you think someone was in the room yes i sigh oh i dont know did julie talk about what happened about any relatives who might come for her she said she didnt have any relatives no one thats hard to believe believe it im proof that its possible he looks embarrassed thats a step in the right direction but he turns away from me and talks to mrs marsh maybe the patient will be more communicative in the morning shes not a patient shes a person i say and shes scared cant you see that shes scared of this guy sikes she said he killed her father her mother and father were killed this morning in an automobile accident but what if sikes tampered with the car i saw that once in a movie on television the brake line was cut and the car went out of control couldnt that have happened its up to the police to investigate things like that he says what we need to find out is who can take responsibility for julie as he walks toward the door he pauses if she talks to you tomorrow dina and tells you about any relatives or friends please let one of the nurses know for the first time he smiles at me maybe hes trying to be friendly maybe hes just wanting me to do things his way maybe hes remembering what he learned in medical school about how to be nice to patients if they teach anything like that i dont want to sort it out i just wiggle down under the blanket and sheet and pull them up around my ears curling into a ball i snake one hand out and pull the string attached to the light chain snapping the room into darkness i squeeze my eyes shut and listen to them leave im not going to make any promises to him julies life is her own not mine what she wants to tell people is up to her the anger i feel toward the doctor and the nurse the anger for being pushed into someone elses life meets my old familiar anger headon leaving me uncomfortable and confused and so i retreat i have learned to move out and away from the pain and the illness becoming a separate being from my body i pull away from these feelings now away from my body away from the hospital room and my mind slips through the moonlit rooms of the place where i grew up the churchrun foster home for girls like me whose absent parents clung legally until their children were unadoptable people want babies to adopt they told me over and over as i wrapped gangly legs around chair rungs and ached to be small and petted and loved now i am far from my body and i glide through the living room of the central building stroking the smooth oak tabletops and the sturdy upholstered chairs i had once thought them ugly and they were they are but they are an anchor to my other world and i need to touch them the moon shimmers through windows without drapes open to the fields and the woods of gnarled elm and mesquite and i can see beyond to the vegetable garden where i once helped to hoe fat clumps of weeds from between rows of pole beans and corn whacking the weed roots with a vengeance in the hot summer sun clods of dark soil flying into the air sweat running down my face and back softly i am now in the kitchen slipping into one of the wooden chairs remembering old carlotta who does the baking and who hands out cookies like love tokens even in the aloneness of night the kitchen is memoryfragrant with cinnamon and chocolate and the warm breasts of carlotta who knows when a child needs a hug in order to survive and here is the room in which i cried at night when i was very young wishing someone would want me wondering how anyone would find me in this hill country place here i grew older no longer caring about the childhood i had once wanted focusing all my energies on a future i would build for myself holley jo my best friend has been at the home almost as long as i have and our lives are so intertwined that we would sit crosslegged on our beds after lights out and talk about the years we would plan and how great they would be until someone would come in from the next room and threaten us with all sorts of dire things unless we let them get to sleep as i move through the closed doorway i am no more opaque than the moonlight that spills over the windowsill the room is vibrant with rhythmic breathing and sleep murmurs and tiny night noises holley jos long brown hair is spidery across the pillow and i finger it wistfully thinking of the short thin curls that are all i have left of the dark hair that once whipped through the air as i ran holley jo stirs and i pull my hand away hush sleep im not here to disturb im here because im clinging to something its hard to give up my bed is still empty and i curl up at the end my cheek against the fuzzy chenille spread for so many years this bed has been my refuge my planning place here is where i had decided that the whole world ahead was open to me and what i wanted to work for could be mine i would aim for a scholarship and knew i had a darned good chance of getting one i would go to the university of texas and work part time and live in a dorm and come out clutching a degree in economics and an acceptance to law school thats when my real life would begin i was going to win i could be patient with the promise of what my life was going to be then that dream was ripped apart and smashed when the doctor sent me to the hospital in san antonio and they told me there that the chills and weight loss and that stupid lump on the side of my neck meant hodgkins disease i cried out that it wasnt fair i couldnt be a winner because they had snatched away the race and i wasnt ready to die what am i doing here i whisper jarringly i am back in the hospital room with its medicine smells and the brisk footsteps following the jangle of a cart in the hallway past my door the words i had whispered hang in the air reminding me of another whisper and i shiver clutching the blanket to my chin for comfort who are you sikes lying there in the dark room i hold my breath terrified that i will hear an answer chapter hospital mornings break the day into clatters and rattles with a background of voices even before the sun is up theres not much privacy in a hospital we cant keep from hearing what goes on in the rooms around us theres an old lady across the hall who sometimes cries like a little kid and keeps calling eddie eddie mrs cardenas said the old lady is ninetysix and she wants eddie to come and take her home except there isnt an eddie anymore one night i sneaked across the hall and sat in the chair by her bed i thought if she had someone to talk to she might feel better she was like a little skeleton with transparent skin stretched over her bones and her fingers kept poking out the top of the blanket wiggling like spider legs she stopped crying and stared at me but she didnt talk so i told her about rob whose tortoiseshell glasses match his hair and slip down his nose when he leans over to write and about the terrific poetry he writes in english class and about the special poems he wrote just for me i told her he had promised to give me his senior ring next year but since i came to the hospital i havent heard from him and i told her about the place i lived before i came here and how my friend holley jo keeps sending me getwell letters that make me homesick for the low hills and the brown grass in the fall and the wild flowers in the spring and even for the dust smell of the garden and the rattling bus to school and i told her they said i couldnt go back there to live again because they had no facilities for taking the right land of care of me and i told her i was going to die she just kept staring at me and all of a sudden she made noises and began to smell awful so i ran back to my own bed and scrunched down under the blanket and cried this morning the day after julie had come is just like every other morning with all the bustle of trays and face washings that have to take place before anyone is really awake my doctor wont come by until ten so theres going to be a long wait after the breakfast trays are picked up i take a shower then decide to paint my toenails holley jo sent me the nail polish in my favorite shade of pink i glance over at julie you didnt eat much breakfast i dont like that stuff she answers i can see theyve given her a liquid diet they probably have to until they find out if everything is all right my knee is tucked under my chin and i take a smooth stroke with the brush thinking at the same rime how pale and spindly my legs look i need the sun thats pretty julie says i hold out my foot stretching my toes and smile at her would you like me to paint your toenails too she nods so i pull the sheet and blanket away from the end of the bed put her feet on my lap and paint away i am just finishing when a nurses aide comes in and watches us shaking her head shes not supposed to move around she tells me only her feet got moved i answer and the concussion isnt in her toes julie actually smiles and she lifts her feet to examine her toes its funny how a little thing like nail polish can make you feel better about yourself even if the feeling lasts for only a few moments julie ive brought you a comb and hair brush and toothpaste and the other things youll need the aide says she pulls the curtain between our beds and tells me to scoot julies got to have one of those chilly bed baths that make you feel like dried soap for hours dont go away julie tells me im right here i say i turn on the television and sit on my bed crosslegged brushing my hair in all my jumbledup memories of what happened to me after i came to this hospital one of the worst was losing my hair i was sick so terribly sick from the radiation and the medication they were giving me and i was weak and sore and tired from the bone marrow tests and the operation for a while pain was not just a word it was a monster that had come to inhabit my body what is a spleen anyway i had asked they said it wasnt important to me and id never miss it and it had to come out and after they studied it and tested it they said encouraging things but my mind did not agree they told the truth because my miserable body was the lie on my back in bed id watch the little cracks in the plaster near the ceiling watch them come together like a tiny face with fat cheeks and puckered lips and id drift in and out of the pain and the illness and think about what mattered most my hair when i began to feel better someone gave me a wig it made me look as though i had just stepped out of a beauty parlor some time in the sixties it was made of washable stuff and had a permanent curl oh how i missed my own hair what was growing on my head now was sort and curly and babyfine and i had the weird feeling that id been given the wrong hair holley jo and i used to measure our hair with a tape measure to see whose was the longest and wed brush our hair each night feeling it slither down over our shoulders i wasnt going to wear it that long forever the day i graduated from college i planned to have it cut in one of those smart straight hairstyles that would be just right for a woman with a degree in economics who was on her way to law school why are you thinking of economics dina mrs schaefer the math teacher had asked me i rested my elbows on her desk leaning into her smile because i like the way economics puts everything into order because the laws of economics make a lead to b and its fair i like things to be fair i added fair i found out that nothing is fair i didnt know they had televisions in hospitals the voice sounds a little stronger i climb off the bed and poke my head around the curtain the nurses aide has left and i havent even noticed the board of directors at the home where i live paid for it what are you watching i have no idea i really havent noticed its a game show and it runs into the next game show which runs into the next day i guess they all look alike can you pull the curtain back julie asks sure i say and proceed to do so the nurse this morning was nice julie says some of the people around here are real nice i tell her wait until you meet mrs cardenas she gives back rubs and shes full of good stories im going to have some x rays this morning julie says theyre going to wheel me down to the xray room on a cart the nurse told me she said it wont hurt and i shouldnt be afraid but fear is in her eyes i sit on the edge of her bed again x rays are just a way of taking pictures they arent anything for you to be scared of i wish you could come with me theyd never let me but remember i told you ill be here when you come back promise julie says and i wonder where theyll send her to live promise i answer ill try not to be scared i look at her thin arms bare against the white sheets each discolored bruise standing out youre afraid of a lot of things arent you i ask when she doesnt answer i add you cant keep all that fear inside i think you should talk to someone who could help maybe the police for a moment she grows even more pale she grips my hand and im startled at how strong she is no okay i say but youre awfully scared of that guy sikes you said last night that he killed your father and that you were supposed to die if i thought someone was going to try to murder me id yell for help her fingernails are digging into my hand you help me she says i cant help you the way the police could i shift on the bed and try to pry her fingers loose shes stronger than i am and shes hurting me stay here she says i need you to be here okay but stop hurting my hand she looks surprised and i can see her trying to relax thanks i say and rub my hand you want me to help you are you going to talk to me her eyes narrow just a little about what for one thing about how the people at the hospital can contact your relatives i havent got any really how about where you were living before you moved to san antonio arent there any friends of the family her face puckers up like one of those dolls made out of dried apples and she starts to cry we moved and moved and moved and i dont have anybody awkwardly i smooth back her hair trying not to feel guilty for causing the tears hey julie its okay dont cry i say julie suddenly pulls up and flings herself at me hanging on as though were in the middle of canyon lake and im the only life preserver i want to stay with you she says julie i cant take care of you i cant even take care of myself her body is shaking now and i try to move her back on the bed to help her lie down but she wont budge please she sobs warm tears are dripping down my neck and i squirm away from them saying look ill see what i can do okay please stop crying it helps a bit but a nurse comes in gets excited and sends me back to bed i dont know what happened i tell her i guess i said the wrong thing she shouldnt be upset the nurse tells me she soothes julie and wipes her nose and washes her face again i lie in bed watching some fat woman on the television screen jump up and down and beat on the master of ceremonies and i wonder if shell have a heart attack with all that screaming and i wonder what made julie cry with so much desperation were some of those tears for her mother and father ive never seen anyone so panicked before and it seems to me that it takes more than one problem to make someone explode like that i cant figure out why she doesnt want to tell the police about sikes if shes afraid shes going to be murdered it doesnt make sense the door bursts open and a pair of orderlies fasten it against the wall they rattle the cart to the side of julies bed and lift her onto it as they wheel her out of the room she holds out a hand toward me her eyes are pleading ill be here when you get back julie i tell her they release the door but it does a double flutter as dr hector cruz comes in stepping out of the way of the cart hes a quiet man with not much hair on top and a nose that looks as though it had been in a lot of rough football games he perches stoopshouldered on the side of my bed and smiles at me i know better than to ask how youre feeling he says last time i asked your answer went on for five minutes im sorry i say sometimes i get angry theres nothing wrong with being angry its a human emotion its what you do with the anger that counts sometimes feeling angry is the only thing that helps i answer but at the same time i remember dr lynn telling me how people can cling to their anger because theyre afraid to leave it and take the next step lets talk about remission he says in his calm way i dont think you really understand it i stuff a pillow against the painted headboard of the bed and wedge myself against it pulling my knees up under the bedspread and wrapping my arms around them dr cruz waits until ive settled down and says if you understand remission you might feel better about what is happening to you youve responded very well to treatment and we feel your disease is in remission that means during a certain period the disease will not progress how long the period will last we cant say but we have hopes it will be for a number of years and after that were back to zero right were back to more treatment and a hopeful chance for another remission he takes my hand and looks at me earnestly dina the scientists who are working so hard to discover a cure might i interrupt theyve been working to find a cure for cancer for a hundred years there are many forms of cancer hodgkins disease has its own characteristics and there has been great progress made in moving toward a cure there are many people living active lives with the disease in remission who wouldnt have been able to do so years ago you sound like a textbook im offering you the facts youre offering me wishful thinking im offering you hope same thing he sits there rubbing his chin finally he says doctors have found that a patients attitude can mean a great deal of difference in whether hes cured or whether he dies from a serious disease another woman is screaming on the television another winner mornings full days full weeks full of winners who cares i snap the off button and blot her out as though she never existed please dont talk to me about my attitude dr cruz i try to keep my voice quiet and calm to match his i had a whole life ahead of me filled with all the things i wanted a career and love and all i was going to be and do and youre holding out scraps of it little pieces that wont add up to anything how can you expect me to be happy about that i didnt say happy i want you to simply make the most of the life you do have i close my eyes and shake my head lets not talk about it anymore all right he says lets talk about your leaving the hospital for a moment i cant breathe my eyelids snap open you mean i can go back no he says you need to live here in san antonio where you can be treated at the hospital as an outpatient but where i dont know anyone here he smiles again oh little dina do you think wed turn you out with a map and an apartment guide believe me well find a foster family wholl take good care of you i realize im not dunking clearly im trying to absorb this news im surprised to find that i dread having to live with strangers i long for the comfort of the home thats familiar to me the people i know and there was a promise what about the little girl they put in this room the one who was in the accident julie kaines what are they going to do about her i dont know he says she isnt my patient i lean forward and grab his arm listen dr cruz shes awfully frightened she hasnt got any relatives and doesnt even want to talk about where shes lived i think shes afraid to tell anyone even me but she does trust me and she made me promise id stay with her i cant break that promise you cant stay here he says youre well enough to leave the hospital as soon as they find a home for you i guess what i mean is could they put both of us in the same home at least for a few months i think it would help her if we stayed together for awhile he studies me for a moment then he says id have to talk to her doctor of course and i dont know how all the red tape works ill ask a few questions well see what we can find out i know what hes thinking hes wondering if this will help me get my mind going in the direction he wants ill let him jump to any conclusions he wants i wont tell him that its not going to do me a bit of good its just that i made a promise to julie and i can understand how scared she is ive been scared too what i dont understand is why no one around here seems to be worried about what julie said that she was supposed to die too i cant walk away and leave her with a fear that she might be murdered just because no one saw that guy sikes doesnt mean he wasnt in the room dr cruz picks up his clipboard and makes some notes then he gives me another big smile i automatically smile back and he looks pleased and encouraged ill try he says again and leaves the room a hospital volunteer comes by with the mail and i reach for my letter hoping its from holley jo who hasnt written for almost two weeks or rob just once if it could be from rob but its never been from rob i open a funny card from carlotta just signed with her name the morning sunlight hurts my eyes making them water and i blink im glad she sent me the card but couldnt she tell me what was happening at the home couldnt anyone write that the sixyearolds had started their swimming lessons and they wanted me to come back and be their teacher or that whoever had replaced me in the firstaid class wishes i was still there couldnt someone say how cool the lake water is early in the morning before the sun has warmed it and if the old blue station wagon still makes that bucketybuckety noise that the mechanic never has been able to fix and if the driversed teacher still keeps teasing the kids in his class telling the slow scared ones that they ought to drive in the indy and if the red clover has faded and the long grass smells dustysour in the noon sun im startled when the door bangs open again and julies cart is wheeled through her doctor is following hes a long thin man whose body dangles through his clothes he waits until julie is tucked into bed and he tries to talk to her but she gives him the same answers she gives everyone else finally he leaves lunches are brought in and slapped on the rolling tables that fit over the beds julies bed is rolled up this time but she stares at the tray without moving hey its like a big surprise i tell her you take off those metal lids to find out whats underneath i hop but of bed and pull the covers from the plates its an improvement over breakfast which is a good sign they think shes basically okay how about that red jello i try to sound enthusiastic everybody likes red jello right julie picks up a spoon i like jello but whats that stuff broccoli havent you ever eaten broccoli she shakes her head well try some i think youll like it no you cant just eat the jello i tell her you have to eat the chicken and the broccoli and the lettuce salad because its good for you i sound like a mother and i cringe what am i doing taking on this little kid she obediently takes a mouthful of broccoli and i climb back in my own bed and eat my lunch before it gets any colder than it was when it was brought in maybe now is a good time to tell her so i talk about what my doctor said about leaving the hospital and what i said to him she studies me carefully i can feel her tension its going to work out all right julie i say my doctors a good guy and hell really try to get us a home together when i dont know it depends on who they can find someone has to want us i flip on the television again i can see julie trying to keep her eyes open when the orderly comes in to pick up the trays i point to julies bed and he slowly rolls it down again in a few moments shes asleep mrs cardenas sacks her head in the door looks at us both and winks at me pssst she says crooking her finger i put on my robe and join her in the hall shes going to retire soon because she says being on her feet so long makes her back hurt im going to miss her ill walk with you she says ive been strong enough for a while to walk by myself i tell her surprised that she doesnt remember i know she answers and she looks both ways before she continues in a conspiratorial voice but i got some news about that little girl the police checked on the drivers license they found out that william kaines served time eight years ago in illinois for assault and rape i stop walking and stare at her thats awful for the last few years there wasnt anything on him and there was nothing left in the car because it burned mrs cardenas squeezes my elbow and pilots me down the hallway again they may have been the kind who keep one step ahead of the people they owe money to it makes me think or ahead of someone who is after them i say i look at mrs cardenas whose round cheeks are red with the excitement of the story shes telling me where did you get this information she begins to look huffy so i quickly say i mean did the information come from newspapers or the radio news or where she chuckles her good disposition restored straight from my brotherinlaw arturo the policeman he ought to know what hes talking about then listen could he find out something for me i glance down the hall and one of the nurses is staring at us head cocked like a banty hen i grab mrs cardenass arm and say come on keep walking she does leaning close to me find out what she asks could your brotherinlaw find out the name of the woman who william kaines had raped could you find out if her last name was sikes mrs cardenas falters her mouth a rosy o i heard about that sikes name she says lorena said the girl had a nightmare last night and that you gave dr paull a bad time maybe it wasnt just a nightmare julie insisted that someone named sikes was in the room did you see him you were in the room too no i didnt see him but i felt someone was there it was weird her forehead wrinkles up like a pleated collar but nobody was in the hospital who shouldnt have been i shrug theres no use arguing just because they didnt see anyone leave the room they dont believe julie they didnt see me sneak into the old ladys room either not seeing something doesnt mean it didnt happen after what mrs cardenas has told me im beginning to guess why julie is so terrified of the man sikes well can you find out the information i want why not mrs cardenas says smiling i can usually find out anything weve reached the end of the hall and have doubled back and i havent noticed were close to my room when a scream smashes the air someone bursts out of the storeroom and dashes through the door to the stairway a nurse flaps out of the storeroom screeching that a man had been hiding in there people begin running toward the stairs and into each other i flatten against the wall pulling mrs cardenas next to me did you get a good look at him no she says she tugs me toward the nurses station we can hear one of the nurses on the phone how should i know shes saying he was probably looking for drugs like that creep on the second floor last month we hang around scooping up little pieces of information until we find that whoever it was has got away and there are no witnesses including the nurse who had surprised him in the storeroom because he had thrown a pillowcase over her head before he shoved past her and ran from the room i tell them i think he was tall and had on a blue shirt and pants the nurse at the desk says shes sure he was wearing dark brown slacks an orderly who nearly collided with him on the stairs didnt see his face bur insists he saw navy blue slacks and a plaid shirt the world is full of strange people mrs cardenas says to me you go back to your bed for a nap and ill call my cousin carmen who will want to know all about this so i go back into the room but i stop at the door when i see julie shes sitting in the middle of her bed shaking as though shes naked in a snowstorm did you see him she gasps was it sikes chapter no i say it couldnt have been sikes and i wonder if im lying as i try to soothe away her chattering fear i know fear ive watched it flicker behind the tears of kids new to the home in those first days in which all they knew was that they werent in control of their lives any longer and i knew the gasping throatscratching fear that came when my body confirmed what the doctors had told me the retching aching fear that lasted until it turned into anger the man in the storeroom was some pot head after drugs i tell julie forget him she leans back and stares at me with eyes that are cold are you telling me the truth no one saw him it all happened too fast sikes is a murderer she says he killed my father i cant go this route again so i try to change her direction tell me about your father her eyes become softer and her thin little face picks up a glow my father was tall he called himself a beanpole hed put me on his shoulders and run and id bounce up and down and wed laugh and laugh id hang onto his chin but it was prickly once my father grew a beard but it was so light my mother said he looked like a blond santa claus so he shaved it off did he have the same color hair as you yes and blue eyes too she pauses every time my mother said we looked alike my father would laugh and say how can you dunk that nancy when julie is short and doesnt have muscles shes looking back into another space and im with her visualizing this tall young father with the pale hair who looked at the world through eyes like julies eyes then i ask the wrong thing julie how did you get the bruises on your arms she closes up hike the petals of a flower in timelapse photography shutting me out a wall of tears ready to spill is between us i want to watch television she says i climb on my bed turning on the controls its the afternoon movie something left over from the forties two people have just met at a party and are nose to nose gulping each other with their eyes instant love i had liked being in love and in love and in love with some of the boys at school especially with rob the feeling i had for him was a step beyond the early giggly romances at sweaty school dances with guys with damp hands and the kisses behind the gym before the bus came to take some of us back to the home rob had a creative mind and he gave me copies of the poems he wrote which id read to holley jo holley jo i think about the way we whispered about our dates after wed finally settle down to sleep sooner or later wed drowsily slide into our own private daydreams before the night dreams took over because we knew that someday wed be women and get beyond the boys to the men and the love would be for real someday the familiar exhaustion creeps through me and i give in to it unable as ever to fight it sleep is a healer they told me but sleep is also a private place to hide when thoughts become too hard to handle i awake to hear voices dr lynn manning is sitting next to julies bed she doesnt look the way a psychiatrist ought to look i guess ive been influenced by those solemn bearded pictures of dr sigmund freud dr lynn has lots of freckles and a snub nose and reddish hair that curls in every direction when she smiles she means it and when i talk to her she really listens in spite of that white coat sometimes i forget that shes a doctor if anyone can get through to julie it will be dr lynn im so glad shes here talking with julie that i lie on my side and listen in dr lynn doesnt seem to mind but julie is holding back these are the same shutout answers she has given the other doctors dr lynn gets up and stands at the window looking out ive been at that window so many times i can see the scene as though im standing with her the hospital is built on a hill at the west edge of san antonio in the medical center beyond it are sloping hills that roll one into another and in the springtime the grass is long and green and shivers in the wind the hill country stretches out to meet that flat bright texas sky dotted with white globs of clouds that look as though an amateur painter had slapped them there its a beautiful country the only country ive ever known tell me about your mother dr lynn says what did she like to do surprisingly julie responds she could sing and dance she told me she used to work in a nightclub a long time ago she was in a play a long rime ago when i was little my father took me to watch only it was at night and i fell asleep so the next morning my mother put on her costume and put me in the big chair in the living room and sang as long as he needs me she sang it just to me dr lynn gives julie that warm supportive smile was she in other plays maybe before that one julie says but that was the last do you know why no her voice becomes right dr lynn sits on the chair by julies bed and takes her hand its all right to miss your mother and father its all right to cry julies voice is not much more than a whisper i cried for my father it didnt help it didnt bring him back i cant stand it theres something she has to tell dr lynn julie i interrupt tell her about that man youre afraid of but dr lynn shakes her head at me well let julie take this at her own pace she says is there anything else youd like to talk about julie no julie says she slithers down in her bed and pulls the blanket up under her chin all right dr lynn smiles at her again and moves toward the door then she pauses picks up my robe which ive left on the end of my bed and tosses it to me want to go for a walk dina she asks me i really dont but i climb out of bed fumble for my slippers and put on the robe can we walk just as far as the waiting room im tired again she puts an arm around my shoulders dr cruz tells me that youll gradually get back much of your energy hes enthusiastic about your progress before i go through the door i turn to look at julie shes watching me intently ill be back soon i explain dr lynn steers me into the little waiting room no one is in it at this hour no one is usually in it i wish holley jo could visit me it comes out without warning and startles me if she cant visit you maybe you can visit her dr lynn says youll be out of here soon my breath catches as though someone had just popped me in the stomach i hadnt thought about being able to see holley jo again the idea is so welcome so exciting so unexpected that i cling to it wanting to shout with it and i think this is what it feels like to be happy i had honestly forgotten dr lynn sits on one of the hard plastic chairs and i plop on the brown vinyl sofa which lost its springs generations ago maybe i could drive you there on my day off she says id love to see some of the hill country this part of texas is new to me she adjusts the green skirt that pokes out from under her white coat thank you i say oh thank you and tightly wound in this crazy ecstasy of joy i say something as insanely foolish as i feel in that green skirt with your white coat you match old grasshopper legs her eyes widen who in the world is old grasshopper legs dr paull hes got the weirdest green plaid slacks oh she says she blinks rapidly a few times and stares at a spot over my head its just a private joke if you saw those green slacks youd agree with me not necessarily theres a lot of pink under those freckles i suddenly catch on dr lynn is there something between you and dr paull its funny to see someone who is usually so selfcontrolled look embarrassed i dont think we want to discuss my private life hes not good enough for you her chin lifts what do you mean by that hes kind of a pill thats what i mean hes a dedicated doctor hes serious about his work if he loved you hed be happy then hed act nicer to his patients no ones talking about love she says she leans forward shes in command again dina you can be a big help with julie its obvious that she knows something she doesnt want to tell us in fact we know very little about her she doesnt talk to me either what about this man who is frightening her when she woke during the night she was scared to death she said he was in the room jack told me about the nightmare jack oh dr paull thats one thing i dont like about him he just assumed it was a nightmare he didnt listen i told him it felt as though someone was in the room i was scared too but he didnt listen to me he didnt listen to either of us she thinks a moment finally she says there is a possibility someone could have been in the room the nurses cant see everything thats going on at every minute thanks for having an open mind julie was afraid that the man in the supply room was this guy too what does she call him sikes she insists that he killed her father she says she cried when her father died have you seen her cry yes and i was glad when she did it sort of frightened me when she knew her parents were dead but she didnt cry sometimes its hard for people to cry sometimes theyre in a temporary state of disbelief can a state like that come and go i dont understand dina what are you asking well sometimes julie lets down and then shes like one of the kids at the home but at other times i get the impression that her head is so filled with terrible thoughts that the fear has pushed her into a corner of her own mind and shes afraid to come out okay she says i know what you mean shes so afraid of this sikes that she cant feel what shes supposed to feet about losing her parents i told you that youd be a help she says this gives me something to work with she said she should have been killed too apparently sikes tried to kill all of them if someone did this and hes after julie shouldnt somebody care shouldnt somebody try to stop him yes she says a detective asked to question julie and i requested that he wait until after i had talked with her hell probably come by soon after i phone him ill tell him exactly what you told me hell know what to do she gives me that wide smile want to talk about yourself how you feel about leaving the hospital dr lynn i cant go yet and i tell her about this dumb promise i made to julie why do you think it was a dumb promise because i dont want to get mixed up in anyone elses life yet you are and by your own choice you could have rejected her on the spot dont try to look inside me i want you to look inside yourself i get up from that sagging sofa and walk to the other side of the small room keeping my back to her when i look inside myself i see a monster its an eyeless thing with a gaping mouth and a thousand claws and its churning inside me and eating away at me she is suddenly beside me your disease is in remission you know that you must accept that im trying to accept it but i know the thing is there and even if its in a cage for now someday it will be strong enough to break the cage and get out dr cruz was honest with you he expects you to be honest with him your being honest means believing that you will be one of the survivors theres a fine chance of survival now in the years to come everyone who gets hodgkins disease may be cured i hate my body for doing this to me she puts an arm around my shoulders not like a doctor like a friend finally she says ill do what i can to help find a place where you and julie can be together at least for a while i say until she has other people she can trust agreed thanks now i can smile at her lets go back so you can call that detective i want someone to start working on this problem if sikes is frightening julie then the police should find him its after dinner when the detective arrives im not surprised to see dr lynn with him but julie is afraid of the man shes a little shrunken shivering person in that bed eyes stretched wide in a tight face im here to help you julie he tells her im roger macgarvey he looks like his name hes a broad muscular man with dark thick hair he reminds me of those big men with kilts and bagpipes in the eighthgrade geography book even at that age holley jo and i could appreciate those great burly legs i wonder how roger macgarvey would look in kilts its an interesting thought julie tell me the names of some of your relatives youve got a grandmother an aunt his pen poises over his notebook but she shakes her head you must have someone no she says maybe its someone you havent met did your mother or father ever talk about a cousin or a brother someone in another city negative julie he says we need to find someone who can take care of you her eyes flicker to me where i am perched on the edge of my bed my bare toes playing with the hem of my robe i havent got any relatives she says macgarvey stares at his notepad for a few moments then he raises his head julie you must have gone to school could you tell us the name of the last school you went to i went to lots of schools she answers it surprises me that now shes willing to talk we moved a lot sometimes we lived in apartments sometimes we lived in a mobile home i didnt like the mobile home tell me the name of your school there were so many schools i dont remember there was brookhollow i remember brookhollow i was in the second grade and we stayed long enough so that i could go to the halloween carnival my teacher was nice but she left to have a baby and i cried because she was the only one who told me i was smart and put gold stars on my papers what city was brookhollow in her forehead crinkles then those clear blue eyes focus on his and she says it might have been in tennessee or georgia i was only in the second grade what grade are you in now fourth no third ill be in fourth grade next fall but i havent been to school for a long time my mother just gave me lots of books to read im a good reader macgarvey pauses and dr lynn steps forward what kind of books do you like to read julie i like to read about horses she says and ghosts there is something about that highpitched thin voice in this quiet room that makes me uncomfortable your doctor told me that you just moved to san antonio macgarvey says can yon give me your address it was just for a week about a week i think we lived in an apartment house near the freeway we have a number of freeways in san antonio julie can you describe the apartment house for me she thinks for a minute its white it looks like most apartment houses look its ugly and it has ugly furniture most apartment houses have ugly furniture is it near a shopping center yes what kind of stores do you remember in the shopping center she names two chain stores that must be in every shopping center in the united states what can you tell us about your father julie what kind of jobs did he have he was an auto mechanic she says do you know where she shakes her head again did your mother ever tell you what kind of work she did while your father was in jail the blue eyes spark and she struggles up from the pillow my father was never in jail macgarvey looks at dr lynn then back at julie please try to think of something that will help us julie we need to know where your parents come from we want to find someone who will take good care of you i cant think of anything for now can you give me the names of some cities and towns where you recently lived any addresses she hesitates and he adds youre nine years old youre old enough to know where youve lived during the last year we were in a trailer park in miami florida in january and february she says i think it was named seabird and then we were in another trailer park in a little town in louisiana for two weeks but i cant remember its name and we stayed in texarkana in an apartment house and thats where they sold the mobile home because my mother was afraid of tornadoes and she said they hit mobile homes the apartment house was on a street called she suddenly stops we were just there for a week i dont remember the name of the street but i think it started with a c and we lived in some places in arkansas and texas macgarvey leans back resting his pad and pencil on his lap dr manning tells me that you think a man named sikes is responsible for your parents death and that you may be in danger from him is that right julie gets white and i jump to my feet expecting her to pass out but she doesnt her voice is a hoarse croak as she says i was supposed to die in that crash too i hate sikes i hate him he killed my father where is this man sikes macgarvey asks where can i find him julies voice is so soft now that for a moment i must have misunderstood her but as she repeats what she just said i get so scared i grab the bedside table and hold on hes watching us julie says and hes waiting because he knows where i am chapter her eyes move toward the doorway and the three of us look too as though we expected the door to open and someone to walk through he might even be hiding in the hospital julie says hes good at hiding the police can never find him dr lynn steps up to macgarvey and nods at him i think we can let julie rest now she says maybe youd like to talk to her tomorrow sure he says tomorrow he looks as though hes glad to be leaving but he takes a moment to study julie try to think of an address julie he tells her come up with something that will help us the two of them leave and mrs cardenas pops in shes got two paper cups of ice cream and she gives them to us i was working in the hallway she says i heard some of it i think you know everything that goes on in this hospital i tell her the ice cream is cold and i lick the spoon slowly letting it numb my lips probably she says matteroffactly she sits on the end of my bed and the mattress sags she grins at julie ninita hows it going okay julie says i like the ice cream i liked the fruit juice you brought me too mrs cardenas winks at me you missed the fruit juice dina because you were busy walking down the hall with dr lynn you want fruit juice you gotta stick around i take another mouthful of ice cream and she says sometimes it happens a man can hide from the police for a lifetime i know some people who came over the border when they were young got jobs raised families and now theyre old and the law still hasnt caught up with them she pauses for a deep breath and a man commits a crime he can keep moving too my brotherinlaw arturo tells me that theres lots of crimes that never get solved its not like all the detective shows on tv julie is staring into her ice cream cup rhythmically eating as though there was nothing in the world more important to do mrs cardenas goes right to the point julie she says if you know places you lived all that stuff you should tell the detective who came here but i dont know julie answers mrs cardenas nods at me es una posibilidad people on the run dont teach their ninos addresses and phone numbers its safer if the little ones dont know much is that it was your family running away julie i ask we just kept moving julie says i hated all the moving i hand my empty cup to mrs cardenas will you tell all this to dr lynn i dont think the doctor or even the detective understands they live in a different world mrs cardenas says and they dont ask people in other worlds how it is she elaborately shrugs her roundly padded shoulders but the smile is there and i suddenly hurt at the thought that shell leave the hospital and ill leave the hospital and ill never see her again but a stronger startling thought tramples the first mrs cardenas what are you going to do after you resign from the hospital rest my aching back she says the legs dont feel too good either she stretches them straight out and studies them rotating her pudgy ankles carlos hes my husband dont bring in much money but at least its steady and we can get along you could make a little extra money i say and have some help besides she peers at me sideways one eyebrow raised how am i gonna do that win one of those big contests i lean toward her eagerly take in a couple of foster children julie and me julies mouth is open and both of mrs cardenass eyebrows are raised like little banners the idea has been forming while ive been talking and i am just beginning to realize what ive said im surprised too but it seems to make such good sense i dont want to spend what time ive got with strangers i like mrs cardenas she cares about people she really likes people shed be good for julie i talk fast i can drive i can run errands for you and im a good cook julie and i can help you clean house and i know that youll get paid for our expenses and something more its a lot of responsibility she answers but i can see her turning the idea around and around examining it for leaks as she does the paper juice cartons ask your husband see what he thinks poor old carlos when he gets home from his job he heads straight for the table and when his stomach is full he plops himself in front of the tv and snores and snoozes until its time for bed what would he do with a couple of noisy kids around the house the hearty laughter that bubbles out is so contagious that i have to smile i guess youre not exactly a couple of noisy kids are you she adds do you have room for us in your house i ask oh sure she says thats no problem for the first rime julie speaks up she crawls to the foot of the bed and sits crosslegged tucking down her oversize hospital gown which twists around her do you have a real house you bet mrs cardenas says its not the land to go on the cover of a magazine but it looks good to me its a wooden house and its painted white and theres a green trim around the windows and lots of oleander in the front yard what color pink she says that nice bright pink thats like the inside of a watermelon in the middle of july and my dining room is fancy because ive got my grandmothers handcarved table and a red glass bowl full of those silk fruits i made in a crafts class at the center and my aunt lila crocheted doilies for the backs and arms of the red plush chairs in the living room so it looks good too whats a doily julie asks its a little fancy white thing mrs cardenas says she thinks for a moment well youll just have to see for yourself im not that good at describing things yes you are i tell her i can see your rooms and i like them i didnt tell you about the porch and thats the best part along the front of the house is a porch with a white rosebush climbing up one side i can sit on my porch and look down to woodlawn lake the joggers run around the lake in the early mornings and when the day cools down near evening time little boys and girls come to the casting pond and throw in their lines she smiles and this smile is for herself its a nice place to live its a real house julie murmurs for a few minutes each of us shuts out the others i try to picture myself in this house but i keep moving through the living room to the back searching for a quiet room a place where i can be alone to sleep mrs cardenas gives herself a little shake and hops from the bed well she says i gotta get home or carlos will sit down at the table before dinner is ready and he wont like that at all she picks up julies ice cream cup ill ask carlos what he thinks will you talk to dr cruz too he can give you all the information maybe it would work maybe not ill think about it but her eyes as she smiles at me are not counting the pros and cons they are the eyes of a friend later when the darkened room shows only the slim strip of light from under the door i linger before going to sleep this is my private part of the day and i cling to it jealously julies breathing is a steady snuffle a muffled metronome occasional footsteps click in the hallway and nasal voices hum garbled words down at the nurses station its now i can tuck my unwanted body between the sheets and leave through the gateways of my mind i can smell the soft earth around the pole beans in the yard of my home in the hills i finger the silky tassels of corn budding on the young stalks a lone bee burrows into the moondipped pollen of the ligustrum bushes ignoring me as i silently invisibly glide to the main house slipping through the wall resting my cheek against the smoothly polished wood molding around the front entrance thick yellow light pours from the open door of dr martins office but im not tempted to step inside and see his balding head bent over the perpetual stack of papers on his desk im here to keep strong the bonds between me and the home i have always known and that bond is strongest in my own room my bed is so tidy so sterile i sit on it tucking my legs under me wishing i could rumple the faded chenille spread dent the pillow with my presence holley jo rolls her hair on big pink sponge rollers she doesnt use the mirror propped against her desk her history book is open against the mirror and she mumbles to herself as she reads exam time i had forgotten end of term end of school panic of endless facts poured into our brains i wish i could help her we always studied together question and answer it was a good system we did so much together two little pea pods carlotta used to call us and wed giggle because she got her clichйs so mixed up i smile as i remember the time holley jo and i were thirteen and decided to become fashion models we practiced walking with chins held high noses uptilted in a gliding kind of step we thought models would use were perfect holley jo said so we went into town to the jcpenney store and walked through their fashion department hoping people would think we were real models people did stare especially when holley jo with her head so high she couldnt see where she was going fell over a stroller and i landed on top of her and i think of the time she got a part in the sophomore play it wasnt a very big pan and all she had to do was say a few lines and munch one or two potato chips that were set out for hors doeuvres i helped her memorize her lines as gwendolyn until i was sick of them but she was terrified shed forget them on opening night you wont forget i insisted i will i know i will ill stand in the wings i said if you forget your lines ill whisper them to you it took a push to get her onstage i remember that but she came in on cue just one thing was wrong she forgot to reach for a potato chip potato chips i whispered as loudly as i dared dont forget the potato chips potato chips she murmured picking up the bowl and staring at it wont you sit down gwendolyn one of the characters said holley jo did still holding the bowl of potato chips which she proceeded to put in her lap eating the chips like crazy until the bowl was empty she didnt forget her lines but sometimes it was hard to understand what she was saying i lean back against the wall and watch her holley jo i miss you but i may be coming to see you dr lynn said shed take me ive changed since we were last together i hope youll look at me the real dina the inside dina i dont want to see the shock of my body in your eyes the window is open and the warm breeze that lifts the curtains carries the fragrance of newly cut grass there is a cricket underneath the window punctuating holley jos monotonous murmuring im content now and im sleepy i am always surprised when morning comes there were days when mornings seemed to bring pain and nausea and firm voices saying youre doing fine dina slowly the gentle mornings followed this is one of them and i greet it with relief the rattling carts the slapping hurrying feet the chattering voices are filling the hall but theres another sound a closer sound julie is humming its nasal and thin but i can recognize the tune as long as he needs me i try not to move i dont want to disturb her this was the song that her mother sang and in her own way julie must be mourning her mother but the door slams open and mrs marsh sails in popping thermometers in our mouths taking pulses and pulling the curtain between our beds so definitively i look to see if theres a rule printed on it you can get up and shower by yourself today julie she says remember the red button on the wall of the bathroom if you need me dont dawdle mrs marsh tells me the breakfast trays will be here in fifteen minutes she leaves a wake of quivering air currents that take a few moments to settle if you want to use my shampoo its on the shelf i tell julie you go first julie says im always poky and i dont much like breakfast anyway so i shower and shampoo and toweldry my hair in record time over my pink cotton underpants standard regulation at the home i put on a fresh hospital gown id like to wear my own nightgowns but theres no one who can do my laundry for me its julies turn next and shes right she is poky the trays come and i nibble at the stuff i like best the bacon the fruit cup why do they serve those bowls of gluey white lukewarm cereal who eats it hundreds of patients get it on their trays all of them send it back bowls and bowls of gluey white stuff returned to the hospital kitchens there is a knock and dr cruz comes in hes early i like to see you smiling he says he stands at the foot of the bed hows it going pretty good im so glad to be off those chemotherapy shots i hate the awful way they made me feel i watch his face carefully when im an outpatient and come back to the hospital for whatever youre going to do to me i wont have to get those shots again will i each time you come in well give you a blood test check your lymph nodes and do a progress report he answers while youre in remission you wont need those shots if necessary the chemotherapist might give you medication by pill i groan what good will any of that really do we want to keep you in a state of remission eventually we want to cure you with promises he rubs an invisible spot on his left thumb dina i made you a promise thats going to be hard to keep i find that its difficult to find a foster home for you finding people who will take care of both you and julie is going to be almost impossible and we cant keep you here other patients need the beds what does a person have to do to be a foster parent its not difficult the people who apply have to be checked and approved of course and the agency keeps checking on them but being a foster parent especially to someone who needs medical care is a big responsibility and not many people want to take it on theres an older couple in balcones heights whove helped us out before i was counting on them but they turned me down shes having trouble with arthritis and says she isnt up to taking care of anyone now so i tell him about mrs cardenas he looks hopeful ill leave a message for mrs cardenas to call me as soon as she comes in i think shell be good for julie julie needs someone to mother her julie he looks over at her empty rumpled bed so many patients come through this hospital we give them whatever care we can and its good care but we cant follow through on everyone who knows what julie needs we dont have time to find out dr cruz glances at julies bed again she hasnt touched her breakfast tray where is she taking a shower i answer then i realize that i havent heard the sound of the water running for quite a while i jump out of bed not caring that all ive got on is this dumb hospital gown with nothing but ties in the back i clutch it together with one hand and with the other i hammer on the bathroom door julie come on out and eat your breakfast no one answers i try to turn the knob but it resists julie i call dont lock the door julie answer me chapter dr cruz is at my side these doors dont lock he says he takes the knob and tries to turn it pushing against the door shes holding it shut he grunts and gives a harder turn to the knob i can see hes afraid of forcing the door with so much strength that hed risk knocking julie to the rile floor julie he says let go im coming in the door and i dont want you to get hurt the door suddenly flies open julie has backed away and is standing there naked clutching her towel in front of her get her a clean gown from the closet dr cruz tells me and quietly he adds julie whats the matter i heard what you said her voice is shrill you said no one would take us together i dont want to go someplace by myself i bring the gown edging past dr cruz who is keeping the bathroom door open by standing against it i hold it out so julie can slip her hands into it and i move around her to tie the tapes in the back for a moment i stare then i close my eyes trying to breathe evenly there are welts on julies back and buttocks diagonal and horizontal slashes that look as though shes been whipped dr cruz just a minute dina he says and he turns to julie climb back in bed and eat your breakfast you didnt hear all our conversation or youd know we havent given up julies mood changes abruptly she obediently walks past him and toward her bed dr cruz i have to talk to you i whisper not in the bathroom he answers get your robe and come out in the hall ill be right back i tell julie feeling as though i need to reassure her every rime i step out of her sight she simply nods and dips her spoon in the fruit cup i struggle into my robe fumbling with the tie and run barefooted into the hall tugging the door shut behind me her back i whisper although im sure she cant hear me its awful someone has beaten julie he nods we know her doctor saw that when he first examined her but i dont really know what i want to ask theres no point now in trying to find out who did it if thats what is bothering you he says her parents are dead the person responsible isnt going to do it again its terrible to think about someone doing that to a little girl i rest against the wall isnt there anything we can do yes he says you can be her friend let her lean on you for a little while i stand up straight and scowl at him dont lay this on me whats she going to do when she gets dependent on me and suddenly im not around to pick up her problems for her i said for just a little while remember it was your idea in the first place just to be near her thats all nothing more and what about later he starts rubbing his thumb again and i take a step toward him all i want to do right now is go home but you cant he puts a hand on my shoulder youre old enough to accept facts we think the odds are in your favor but youre going to have to live a different lifestyle with regular treatments at the hospital as an outpatient those are the facts the facts taste bitter they stick in my throat and swell my tongue and make me want to vomit ill talk to you later he says and ill see if we cant get the rest of your clothes and things sent here from the home i could go there and get them i grab his arm my hands are trembling dr lynn said she might that maybe my desire is so deep that i cant speak he seems to understand dina he says well all do our best i go back in the room and stand at the window gazing over the low hills to the horizon if i could only steal a cookie from carlotta greet the people ive known for so long laugh once more with holley jo the possibility is so close so precarious that i can hardly bear it what are you thinking about dina whats the matter julie is staring at me with concern for a few moments ive forgotten her ive been thinking of the place where ive grown up there may be a chance i can go back to visit and get my things youll stay there no they wont let me what are they going to do with us when i was nine i still hoped to be part of a family someday dreams have a way of clinging long after theyve grown thin and impractical my world was not a secure one and i can remember nine can be fragile ten is a milestone a strengthening point but nine needs a helping hand i perch on the foot of julies bed facing her i dont know where well be im hoping that mrs cardenas and her husband will want to have us bat i know that dr cruz and dr lynn will do their best to find us a home together im scared she says are you i stopped being scared i tell her one day i just stopped when we live with someone else will we be like their children theyll take care of us the way they would their children or anyones children and well help around the house didnt you do dishes and make beds and all that for your parents surprisingly she shudders my mother got mad at me if i didnt do it right no ones going to get mad at you and ill be with you i wont let anyone hurt you i listen to myself make this promise and i wonder what im doing julies shoulders relax and i have to ask who beat you when she doesnt answer i add i know this is what youve been trying to hide from the doctors and the police but they know i dont want to talk about it i dont want to talk about sikes sikes ive spoken too loudly and i glance around not wanting anyone to hear i dont understand where was your father how could he let this happen julies knees are up and she hugs them tightly i told you she whispers sikes killed my father there is a knock and the door swings wide its detective macgarvey good morning he says good morning i answer as i untangle my legs and slide off the bed is dr lynn coming too i doubt it he crooks one finger under the metal tube rim of a chair and easily deposits it next to julies bed she and a couple of doctors and somebody named mrs cardenas are in an office at the end of the hall and theyre having a very loud conversation one at a time with someone on the other end of the telephone julie i say they may be talking about our going to live with mrs cardenas oh is all that julie answers she has backed away from macgarvey as far as she can go pressing the headboard of the bed with her spine macgarvey lowers himself into the small chair which wobbles into place he opens his notebook julie do you know if your parents were running from someone i wonder if hes been talking to mrs cardenas julie just stares at him without answering he waits a moment then tries again tell me about this man you call sikes he says was your father afraid of him i break in julie please answer detective macgarveys questions he wants to help you she hesitates for a moment then says i dont think my father was afraid of sikes but i know he hated sikes lots of times when i was little sikes came to the house how little i dont know were you too young to go to school its hard to remember what did sikes do i dont know i didnt see him do anything bat my father hated him how do you know this because he told my mother he never wanted that man to come to the house again there really was a sikes there is a sikes and it sounds as though julies mother but if its true that sikes lolled her parents why and why did he chase them and why should he want to kill julie what did your mother say when your father told her that macgarvey asks she cried they argued what did they say i dont remember julie has knotted her fingers in a tight ball under her chin sikes killed my father she says i told you that i told everybody he killed my father can you give me a first name for this man sikes bill sikes she says the name sounds familiar as though id heard it before i dont know where i guess there are more bills in the world than anyone could count there were ten bills and billys in my class at school macgarvey folds up his notebook and tucks it in his pocket thank you julie he says we may talk another time its not until he leaves that julie begins to relax lets walk down the hall i tell her i want to know whats going on in the office i havent got a robe she says no problem i find a second hospital gown in the closet its even bigger than the first so it comes to her ankles but i put it on with the opening in front so shes wearing them one on top of the other back to back it will never make the fashion scene but it serves the purpose she takes my hand as we walk her hand is a thin fivepronged clamp and im surprised again at her strength maybe its just that ive spent the last few months being weak theres a contrast as we get close to the office i hear dr cruz saying red tape all this red tape why cant people do things the sensible way tell her not to mail the application dr lynn says ill pick it up that will save time what do they ask at the interview mrs cardenas says i thought the hard part would be to get carlos to say yes but he said if it would keep me home then hed go for it now we gotta be interviewed i dont know what theyll ask tb test food handler health card fire inspection julies doctor says all that will take time i got a sisterinlaw whos a social worker for the county mrs cardenas tells him ill call dolores and see what she can do it may take a few days dr lynn says but its going to work out well for everyone mrs cardenas were so glad that i step into the small office pulling julie with me were going to stay with you mrs cardenas really is it true she laughs es verdad its just a matter of getting through some forms interviews home checks that sort of thing dr cruz explains and in the meantime we can get you both some clothes dr lynn says what do you think they worked it out with the office here to give me two weeks vacation time so i still get paid but i can quit at the end of the week mrs cardenass cheeks are flushed and she wiggles as though she wanted to bounce up and down i hope i get my party she adds what party when somebody who works here leaves the people on the floor usually have a cake and some punch a real nice party youll certainly have your party dr lynn says i should be glad that mrs cardenas wants us but for some reason i am sad why i try to move back to look inside my mind to find this mixedup person who lives inside but there are too many people in the room too much chatter i am locked into the now planted firmly in the here dr lynn has moved beside me she takes my other hand and leads me into the hall julie comes too with her grip that wont let go on thursday jack dr paull and i are off duty would you like us to take you to the home where you lived so you can see your friends get your things oh yes thursday is real a square on the calendar a time i can count on three days away yes i repeat ill be ready can i come too there is a tugging on my arm id like to cry out at julie i dont want to be your mother but instead i take a long breath and wait dr lynn picks up the answer i think it would be nice if julie came with us after we drop you off to see your friends dr paull and i can show her some of the countryside thank you thank you thank you thank you youd like that julie you wouldnt know anyone at the home julie thinks a moment then nods okay ill let them know were coming dr lynn says and ill make sure they give the message to holley jo the days go slowly dr lynn comes in each day to talk to julie and mrs cardenas pops in as often as the witch on a temperature gauge who announces the rain in the dripping months of autumn but mrs cardenass announcements are all positive her sisterinlaw got the paperwork speeded up and her cousin carmen is dating someone in the fire department who got the cardenas house inspection at the head of the list theres a slight delay on the food handler license because none of the relatives have connections there but dr cruz has used his deepvoiced authority to try to get things moving in that department after my party on friday mrs cardenas tells us youll come home with me wednesday and dr lynn has brought julie some clothes i have my jeans and blouse which i wore when i came here i put them on and stare at myself in the mirror these are clothes that fit another girl who lived in another world what am i doing trying to put my skinny bones in pants so large i have to hold them up in a blouse that droops over the shoulders and flaps around my waist mrs cardenas shakes her head when she sees me this is the place for a needle and thread she says somehow the juice cartons get delivered to patients in record time and she comes back to our room with everything she needs to pin and tuck and sew and cut i try the clothes on again and this time they fit thursday moves from a long sleepless night into a sudden rush of morning the air is still the sky is golden i cant eat i am dressed and waiting in the chair by the window before julie has even finished her breakfast hurry up i tell her you keep saying that she complains dr lynn wont be here for a long time she dawdles so i help her i pull her twiglike arms through the sleeves of her tshirt and jam the neck of it down over her head ouch she says you messed up my hair ill brush it for you more slowly more gently i brush her pale hair reminding myself that shes only nine years old dr lynn and dr paull arrive together his professional dignity is punctured with the smiles he keeps giving dr lynn he looks much nicer when he smiles we have a great day for a drive he says and we do the wild flowers are gone now but the air is fragrant with sunwarmed field grass and the pricklysour smell of new oak leaves id like us to be friends dina dr paull says okay i answer its hard for him to unbend but i can see that hes trying for dr lynns sake then he tells us some fourthgrade jokes that he probably memorized from a book for kids hes just not with it hes wearing those green plaid slacks again and its awfully hard not to think of him as old grasshopper legs the highway passes the farms on the outskirts of boerne and climbs past the exit to kerrville we chat about a number of things what i dont know my mind is already at the home holley jo will be waiting for me shell be wearing shorts her legs already tanned and shell brighten like the floodlights on the baseball field when she sees me coming shell run to meet me and well hug each other and laugh and shell try to tell me everything that has happened since we last were together it will be like always and i need it i need it to happen just this way i need her to say oh dina welcome back ive missed you so much it takes another hour before we are close enough so that i can recognize things the old white house where the farmmarket road cuts across the highway the windmill that has been rotting away forever the road to the right that leads to the home i perch on the edge of my seat its hard to breathe dr lynn smiles and says something to me but i dont hear her i dont want to hear in a moment well round the curve and ill see holley jo the car makes a wide swing and i grip the seat in front of me there is the main building there is the porch i am able to breathe again i give a shout there is holley jo pacing in front watching the road she stops and stares as we get closer she waves she runs toward the car and i am out and running toward her before the car has come to a complete stop my arms are wide holley jo i shout im back she falters and there is such shock on her face that i stop too for an instant we stare at each other unable to cross an invisible barrier that has sprung up between us at first i dont understand holley jo she looks the way she did last summer when she managed to take a young bird away from one of the yard cats and she held it in her hands and knew it was too late when she speaks her voice is a whisper oh dina she says is it you chapter dr lynn is out of the car now she has one arm around my shoulders and she propels me toward holley jo im dr lynn manning she says im so happy to meet you holley jo because youre dinas closest friend shes told me so many lovely things about you holley jo has wiped the shock from her eyes she reaches out and hugs me but gently as though shes afraid im going to crack into little pieces you dont know how much ive missed you she tells me i answer and ive missed you everyones waiting to see you but i said i wanted to be the first im glad i kick at a little brown bug that is trying to crawl on my sandal carlotta baked a huge cake for you she sent me a card mrs pettigrew said to say hello for her she left this week to live with her daughter theres so much i want you to tell me everything thats gone on since i left up until now our words have politely skirted each other keeping a distance moving in selfconscious little circles but holley jo suddenly grins guess what daisys getting married to one of the parker brothers the gooney one we laugh and time is back in place dr lynn says well pick you up about two oclock dina i wave as they leave a small white face stares at me from the backseat i refuse to think about julie right now this is where ive wanted to be for so long and im not going to think of anything or anyone else as we enter the main building dr martin and his wife come to meet me her broad toothy grin hasnt changed nothing has changed except me everyone swarms into the room and im pulled into the dining room someone has fastened balloons and a banner saying hi dina around the door to the dining room theres pink punch and a cake and laughter and all of them looking at me through glittery glass eyes that hide their feelings its a nice party i didnt expect a party and im tired so tired people are drifting into little groups and talking about baseball games and how glad they are the semester has ended and who has to go to summer school i tug at holley jos arm and whisper could we go to our room for a little while sure she says i know youre tired so i must show how i feel and i hate my body even more for not being strong enough to hide its horrible secret my feet have become so heavy one step at a time thats the way try to keep pace with holley jo who is awkwardly trying to keep pace with me my whole body is exhausted so unwilling to move here are the stairs i can make it i will i will i will there is a room up there a room with my bed in it and i can rest my mind pulls and pushes and prods this body and it obeys ill get the door holley jo says my bed is nearest the door and i flop on it gratefully closing my eyes feeling the pieces of my body settle into place again im sorry i murmur sometimes i get so tired just lie there as long as you want she says ellen wont mind ellen my eyelids flip open im on a yellowandgreenprinted bedspread i roll on my side and stare at the room its yellow and there are curtains with a ruffle in this same yellow trimmed in green everythings changed i cry the womens gospel committee decided to redecorate this wing holley jo says i dont much like it i wish theyd picked blue ellen i ask did they give my bed to ellen greeley holley jo squirms and twists her feet around the chair at her desk they did some shifting they said you wouldnt be back i guess they had to its just that in my mind this has always been my bed and our room she leans forward eagerly if when you get better and come back i know theyll put you in here if you want i lie on my back and stare at the ceiling tell me about rob hes a nothing whos he dating she shrugs and gives me a quick look debbie i guess its okay i tell her im over him did he ever write you rob held an early funeral for me it was easier for him that way dina she says dont talk like that then tell me about daisy and her wedding isnt the one shes marrying named floyd yes she says with a rush of words and theyre going to be married in the clarewood baptist church next month and daisy wants daisies in her bridal bouquet and i think pamela is going to be her only attendant because floyds mother is picking up the bills and the wedding is in this room and the bride wears a dress that matches the bedspread and curtains ugly i whisper and everyone stares the wedding cake is pink and around the top is written hi dina goodbye dina i dont like this wedding and i wish i hadnt come all the hollow places inside of me are filled with sadness through a faraway humming i hear holley jo saying shes been asleep but youve both missed lunch i didnt want to wake her up she looks so so i just had to let her sleep youve been sitting here with her all this time of course i want to be with her i open my eyes mrs martin is standing at the foot of my bed watching me your friends have come to pick you up she says i struggle to a sitting position and cry out oh no i didnt want to sleep its okay holley jo says she comes to sit beside me there was so much i wanted to talk about next time when youre feeling better mrs martins face stretches into that toothy smile ill serve your friends some iced tea and im sure theres some of the cake left that will give you and holley jo a chance to chat while you pack your things she closes the door as she leaves i look around the unfamiliar yellow room again i had wanted everything to be the same holley jo tries to look cheerful but i can see the traces of red around her eyes nothing stays the same each year is different next year well be seniors and graduate and im a semester behind you now i say oh well you know that well probably be going to different colleges wherever we can get scholarships and well be moving away from the home and things wont be the same you know that she jumps up and drags a cardboard box from the closet i folded up your clothes and put them in here and there are the things from your desk in a smaller box inside i was very careful with them i packed them so neatly youll be proud of me i wish i had something of value to give you i tell her something of mine that would last forever so youll never forget me how could i forget you weve been sisters well always write to each other and have vacations together remember all our plans were going to take a cruise through the caribbean and fly to london and visit all the castles that have ghosts in them and go someplace where they have lots of snow and learn to ski she stops and her voice quavers you have to get better dina wed better go down i finally say ill carry the box maybe dr lynn will bring me back for another visit i try a smile next time i wont fall asleep it doesnt matter i was glad to be with you no matter what down the stairs its easier now some of my energy has come back i follow holley jo into the dining room where julie stares at me over a mustache of pink frosting dr paull leaps up to take the box from holley jo he looks surprised that it isnt heavier we had hamburgers julie says in fredericksburg everyone is introduced and dr lynn says well have to leave now or well get to the city in time to be caught in the rushhour traffic please come again holley jo says please bring dina back to us maybe in a few weeks dr lynn says well see how our schedules are set up there are all the little goodbye things to say and thanks for the rest of the cake which carlotta has wrapped for me to take and nearly squashes in her pillowed hug holley jos goodbye is the last word i hear as the car swings around the driveway and pulls onto the road anger swells through me like the blue northern winds that strip the sky as they rush through winter its not fair even my retreat has been taken from me i think of my room and all i can see now are the yellow walls the stiff gauze curtains the tidy green and yellow spreads which have obliterated any part of me that clung to that room well well dr paull says into the silence dina you must tell us what you did today did you have a good time i am trying to dredge up words through a deep pain but dr lynn quickly says i think we should let julie tell dina what we did julie turns toward me whoever wiped off her face forgot a spot of frosting over the left corner of her mouth it wiggles as she talks we went to a park she says there were swings and slides but the slides were too hot and when we got hungry we bought hamburgers mine had pickles and onions on it and we did a lot of riding around in the car and i got tired of all that riding dr lynn laughs we saw quite a bit of the hill country and i like it she rattles on about texas and what shes learned about texas history grateful to her i lean back against the seat and close my eyes goodbye holley jo goodbye yellow room the day after tomorrow we go to mrs cardenass house julie tells me she slips her hand into my left hand its a real house she adds ive never lived in a real house have you no i answer the car gives a sudden swerve and speeds up theres that fool driver again dr paull snaps i recognize the car i thought wed seen the last of him near fredericksburg surely he wouldnt be following us dr lynn says julies eyes grow too large for her face and i know what shes thinking i twist around and see a dark green sedan behind us hes tailgating and hes all over the road maybe you should slow down and let him get past dr lynn says dr paull is hunched forward concentrating on the wheel this is a lonely stretch out here he says im not about to give him the chance to force us over you think he wants to rob us i dont know what he has in mind its like watching a movie but were suddenly the actors ive seen this before over and over on television two cars careening down the road the one behind surging forward just missing any cars coming up the other side falling back and trying again our car lurches so violently that julie and i are thrown across the seat the car wobbles slows and dr paull mutters something under his breath julie starts to cry that was sikes did you see him i manage to pull myself up and watch the green car speeding out of sight around the next curve i know it was sikes dr lynn turns around how do you know julie because i know that idiot tried to force us off the road dr paull says did anyone get the license number no did any of us get a good look at him dr lynn asks no one answers we drive in silence were close to the junction where the road meets the highway into san antonio when dr paull shouts look ahead is the dark green car tilted drunkenly on the shoulder of the road a highway patrol car has nosed in ahead of it dr paull pulls to the side of the road and turns off the ignition im going to talk to that officer he says i want to report what happened to us julie flies forward and grabs him around the neck so tightly that he coughs and gurgles before he can break her hold dont go out there she says sikes will hurt you he sidles out the door keeping a firm grip on her hands if it is sikes he says then well see that the officer keeps him in custody but im not afraid of sikes i put an arm around julie the three of us watch dr paull approach the patrolman we can see them talking now the driver of the green car is spreadeagled against the side of his car his head is down in a few moments dr paull walks back to us hes just a kid dr paull says as he drops into the drivers seat hes high on something isnt sure where he is or what hes doing they think its a stolen car we are back on the road again and entering the highway before he adds julie do you want to tell us more about this man sikes no julie says i dont want to talk about him it would help if you could describe him tell us why youre so afraid of him no she is wedged against me and i feel the current that stiffens her body her fingers in mine are hot calm down i tell her dont be scared it wasnt sikes dr lynn and dr paull begin to talk in low voices so i tune them out i keep patting julies hand until i feel her relax it wasnt sikes she repeats my words to herself who is sikes why does he come wrapped in terror what does he want from julie i look down at the child beside me and ask myself one more unanswerable question how much does julie want from me chapter the day has been too much for me and as we return to the hospital i try to become vivacious sparkle bubble put on a false face please may i go again see it was good for me please look only into my eyes where im forcing all my energy and dont notice the blue shadows under the transparent skin dr lynns arm is around me she is damp and warm and smells of stale cologne take it easy dina get some rest now im not a bit tired but she knows our emotions can sometimes make us more tired than our physical problems you had a pretty fair amount of stress today the first time back to see your friends can be difficult in some ways next time will be easier for you will there really be a next time youll take me again yes she answers when youre ready and when we have time grasshopper legs has put on his starched white manner without benefit of starched white coat here in his environment he is once again the serious medical man ill send the box up to your room he adds thank you for taking us i say and julie adds thanks for the hamburgers it was an enjoyable afternoon he says but hes looking at dr lynn this isnt the kid love ive seen and felt the roblove without roots not even the cantwaittogetmarried love like that between daisy and gooney parker i can recognize something else here and i suppose dr lynn will end up giving dr paull a good part of her life maybe the rest of it is this what her lifes all about i ride up to our floor with julie clutched in one hand the package of leftover cake in the other i didnt want to go with them julie says i wanted to stay with you her lower lip curls out in a pout and she half turns from me you dont own me i say but i look at that thin back with the protruding shoulder blades and remember the scars so i squeeze her hand and say i didnt mean to be cross julie im tired and you are too the doors open as soon as we step into the hallway mrs cardenas beams and comes toward us everythings okay with the agency she says tomorrows my party and after that you move in with me youre a very good person to do this i tell her i should feel glad to leave the hospital maybe i should feel relieved but i am too drained to feel anything i just want to be by myself i pull my stiff fingers from julies grasp hand mrs cardenas the cake and flop on my bed without even taking off my shoes julie goes into the bathroom mrs cardenas quickly whispers to me arturo found out the name what name the name of the woman that william kaines had raped it wasnt sikes it was one of those long russian names i wrote it down and i still cant say it even when i look at it my guess was wrong i murmur dont close your eyes she says youll go to sleep and the dinner trays will be along soon im not hungry i hear the rustle of paper and mrs cardenas says my what a beautiful cake help yourself i tell her i dont want any more curling dreaming withdrawing head first i slide into a silent shell when i wake its into a fire world with a red sunset flooding the room julie sits on the end of her bed a fragile silhouette against the glow as i lift my head she hops from the bed and walks into the hallway in a moment she is back where did you go i ask her mrs cardenas wanted to know when you woke up ive been watching you so i could tell her i feel uncomfortable thinking of those serious eyes on me while i was asleep i get up and stretch and my stomach growls im surprised to find that im hungry as though on cue mrs cardenas comes in with a tray you need your dinner she says i made them keep this warm for you cake is not enough your dinner has vitamins in it youre wonderful i look at the covered dinner tray and laugh she stands back from the tray table hands on hips well thats the first time first time for what you laughed thats the first time i heard you laugh since you came to the hospital i tuck back inside myself i dont want people to study me and probe me and count the times that i laugh the sun has sucked the color from the hills leaving them gray and dim i reach over and pull the string that turns on the light over my bed ive got to go or my poor carlos will think hell never be fed again mrs cardenas says and she hurries from the room stopping in the doorway to add thats going to be a good party tomorrow everybody on the floor will be there julie sits on the end of my bed were going to the party too i nod my mouth full of meat loaf the man who brought your box up here wanted to open it for you he said he could hang up your clothes but i wouldnt let him i did it for you you didnt have to do that julie ill just have to pack them up again tomorrow she droops and that lower lip curls out again you want to wear a dress to mrs cardenass party you dont want it to be wrinkled oh well thanks julie your friend didnt pack them very well i know how to pack better than that she pauses a moment there was another box inside the big box i put it on the table i finish my salad but just a few bites of the meat loaf is all i can manage the fat woman who was my roommate for a while used to hobble over to my bed after every meal and eat my custard and pudding and roll and anything i didnt want until one of the nurses caught her but we dont get enough to eat she wailed and she doesnt want it julie says what do you keep in that box i swing the table out of the way lean over and put the box on my lap the box is an old gift box from one of the department stores in san antonio what came in it i cant remember probably a new dress or blouse that i got from the church committee for christmas i must have had this box since i was about julies age as i lift the lid julie asks what are all those papers poetry i answer written by someone named rob i read the poem on the top of the pile its not very good why had i ever thought rob was a talented poet i can forgive you for writing a poem that doesnt scan but for the shallow thought never i say what are you talking about about what terrible poetry these are here you can reach the wastepaper basket better than i can she obediently drops them in and leans over to peer into the box a small hand flashes in and out and holds up a circle of green you have a beautiful ring its supposed to be jade but it only cost a dollar so i have my doubts about its quality one year some of us were taken to the san antonio spring fiesta and we went to la villita off the paseo del rio which has all sorts of shops and is part of the old city of san antonio i watch her hold it up to the light we each bought these rings but its been a long time since ive worn mine why dont you wear it now its much too big and i really dont want to bother with jewelry she is examining the ring with such open longing that i follow through and say would you like to have it oh yes its going to be too big for you too then ill put it on a gold chain all you need is the chain ive got one where i ask but she climbs off my bed and onto her own still examining the ring can we watch tv she asks i push the remotecontrol button for the television feeling sure that julie has not suddenly lost interest in the rest of the contents of my box i have a distinct impression that shes been through it while i slept it doesnt matter theres nothing in it of value i just wish she had been honest with me detective macgarvey comes by im on my way home he says and i wanted to make one last try at some information from julie one last try i ask the department cant spare too many manhours on something like this our mechanics couldnt find any sign that the car had been tampered with its listed as a onecar accident and theres no evidence to show otherwise whatever possessions they had with them except for the wallet and drivers license we found on the ground were destroyed when the car burned he sits on the edge of julies bed have you thought of anything else to tell me i dont understand why shes afraid of him shes like a rabbit trembling and trapped by a fox what have you got there macgarvey asks he reaches forward and takes the jade ring from her fingers dina gave it to me it looks a little big he says here i can make it fit you from his pocket he pulls some string and a small pocket knife he winds the string in a tight narrow band around one section of the ring he ties the ends together and cuts them short with his knife then he picks up one of the hands that havent moved and puts the ring snugly on her finger hows that julie thank you she whispers she holds her hand high and looks at the ring for an instant shes visibly pleased macgarvey tucks the rest of the string and the knife back into his pocket my wife complains i save everything but you never can tell when a piece of string might come in handy he says to julie we ran a make on william sikes and we turned up a few men with that name here and there around the country but none with a record can you tell me where this william sikes came from no julie says but you can describe him hes big he has lots of dark brown hair what color are his eyes she thinks a moment maybe theyre brown a lot of people could fit that description julie can you think of any identifying marks what are identifying marks scars moles anything that would make him recognizable she shakes her head have you had any other experiences like that first night here when you thought he might be in your room julie looks at me no she says macgarvey gets to his feet well then i cant think of anything else we can do if you see him or hear from him just let us know all right he leaves and julies mood changes lets talk about mrs cardenass party lets talk about sikes is there a sikes julie or did you make him up she stares at me as though she couldnt believe what ive said im surprised that i said it myself i guess this thought has been pecking the back of my mind and its suddenly broken through i told you about sikes he killed my father you couldnt even tell the detective what sikes looks like she is on her feet and shes actually shaking there isnt anything to say about sikes i dont want to think about him im afraid of him hush i say moving quickly trying to soothe her theyll hear you all the way down the hall sikes is mean hes terrible she says and now her voice drops so low i can hardly hear her i told my mother the things he did to me when she wasnt there and she said i was lying and sikes found out i told her and he whipped me until my back was bleeding oh julie i hug her to me and hold her tightly until she is calm but i am trembling inside at the horror of what she has told me and my anger is directed at this man whom i cant even visualize a name all i have is a name the television is babbling at the other side of the room and i use it to distract her do you want this program or shall we change channels lets talk about mrs cardenass party she says she climbs on my bed as though none of our conversation had taken place i think theyll have a cake with her name on it she says and you should wear your blue dress because you can tie it in with a belt i listen i make the right responses but im still upset and i wish i didnt have to go to another party it turns out that the party isnt just for mrs cardenas who fizzes back and forth in the employees cafeteria like a sparkler on the fourth of july the party is for me too and someone has made a small cake for julie many of the doctors and technicians and even the anesthesiologists are there jon the radiologist who got on a firstname basis with me right from the start has drawn a funny card for me mrs marsh has actually brought me a rose from her garden efficiently pinching off all the thorns nurses aides volunteers and orderlies who have been in and out of my life for the last few months have come to the party some of them look different to me because when i saw them before it was through a cracked glass of pain they have come with good wishes but their real message is goodbye these are the people who have done whatever was needed to my body to keep it alive i should feel grateful i suppose i dont the ending of my life has been stalled but i know the odds and can figure my chances was any of it worth all the trouble finally i leave the party and go back to my room too many people coming in and out too much noise too many too much i want to sleep no i want to be as i was before but fate has zapped me leaving me with the echo of all those people reverberating in my head i wake to find julie folding my dresses meticulously and putting them in the large cardboard box its time to leave so many goodbyes mrs cardenass yellow ford the ping of cheap gasoline heres the house but its dark tomorrow oh tomorrow you girls must see the view of the lake from the porch doilies yes lots of doilies and the hum of the air conditioners in the windows this is my husband carlos very pleased to meet you mr cardenas thank you for allowing us to stay with you thank you for the nice room no hay de quй twin beds i wish i could be alone take whichever bed you want julie thank you gracias yes im tired yes ill see you in the morning my bed has a hollowedout spot in the middle this room had been their sons room before they were grown and moved away where away far away smooth pillowcase against my cheek i am so tired so tired murmur from the other bed dina dina are you awake ummhmm dina well always be together ill take care of you youll take care of me and sikes will never find us chapter morning and my mind is filled with jumbled questions what is this room with its blue trumpet flowers dripping from faded wallpaper why am i here where are the sounds of the hospital carts it takes me a moment to orient myself to remember julies bed is empty and the small electric clock on the chest of drawers informs me that ive slept through most of the morning i stretch enjoying the luxury of awakening when i like of opening my eyes to trumpet flowers instead of to pale green hospital walls of smelling hot chocolate from a kitchen and not from a tray but guilt crawls in i had promised to help mrs cardenas i cant stay in bed another minute i hurry to get dressed in my jeans and a pink tshirt that hangs loosely on me i follow the sound of voices and find mrs cardenas in the kitchen with julie julie is swathed in a gigantic apron over her shorts and shirt and she is happily drying cups im helping mrs cardenas she tells me she looks so smug that i have to smile and im not i say i didnt mean to sleep so late you need your rest and now you need some breakfast mrs cardenas bustles to the gas stove and turns on a circle of blue flame we have scrambled eggs pan dulce and julie and i made hot chocolate i look at the round sugared loaves of pan dulce that are piled on a yellow platter ill get fat you need a little fat a little fat never hurt anyone the guilt clings i should have eaten with the rest of you and washed the dishes julie puts the cups she has dried into the cabinet as though she knew where everything went each morning ill do the breakfast dishes while you sleep and you can do the dishes after dinner there are other jobs to take care of i answer what else would you like me to do mrs cardenas dust vacuum not today she says today you eat something then go sit on the porch in the shade if you feel like it take a walk down the block to the lake so i eat slowly and its peaceful in the breakfast room there is a honeysuckle vine on the fence next to the window and a small blur of hummingbird swoops and darts into the blossoms mrs cardenas answers the phone in her bedroom and julie is somewhere in the house the breakfast room with its scratched wooden chairs and plastic tablecloth and puddles of sun belongs to me i have no sooner finished surprised that ive eaten my scrambled eggs when julie returns sweeping my plate to the sink and rinsing it i made your bed julie says and i hung up your clothes in the closet and i put your other stuff in the top two drawers of the chest because youre taller than lam why should i feel irritated shes trying to help thank you i manage to say you didnt need to do all that but i wanted to in the distance i can hear the sounds of children playing some kind of game so i say i bet there are some kids your age around here mrs cardenas would know when she gets off the phone why dont you ask her julie just shrugs she peels herself out of her apron stretching on tiptoe to hang it up lets go outside we can sit on the porch she takes my hand and leads me opening the door and the screen for me its really funny in a way i had thought i was going to have to mother her now shes trying to mother me there are some chrome and webbing chairs on the porch but i sit on the steps my legs in the sun at the foot of the block across the boulevard the strip of lake that is visible is flat bluegray a pair of joggers pump their way along the edge and a boy with a fishing pole strolls past julie sits beside me and i point out the pole the boy is carrying maybe mrs cardenas has something like that left over from when her sons were young you could go fishing i dont like to fish youve got a whole summer ahead of you before school starts well have to find some things for you to do so you can have fun ill have fun right here with you but i wont always be with you what do i say to her her head pivots toward me why not she demands are you going back to that place that home no i give a long sigh ill never be able to live there again strangely her expression changes to one of satisfaction but she asks then where are you going why wont you be with me well julie you know ive been very sick shes only nine i cant tell her about the percentage who make it the percentage who dont and how im marking time waiting until im one of the statistics what do i answer but she has taken charge then ill take care of you she says its as simple as that two guys come down the street they look to be about my age one of them is wearing a cutoff net shirt and walks like a football jock good body but i bet he wouldnt know an isosceles triangle from a bunsen burner the guy with him is a little shorter a lot less in the muscle department hes wearing glasses that look like robs glasses he reminds me of rob they stop and the jock says hi skinny do you always come on so charming i shouldnt bother answering him the two of them come up the walk to the porch mrs cardenas told my mother she was taking in some fosterhome kids he says you dont look like a kid im a junior in high school you look older than that you going to our high school next semester i shrug the other one speaks up hes claudio and im dave we live next door to each other just up the street this is julie and my name is dina dave nods at julie but claudio ignores her my sister cut her hair like yours dina and i think it looks awful why dont you let yours grow long youd be prettier youre not badlooking even if you are skinny id like to date again but i dont want to go through another rob thing ill tell them now and get it over with i lost all my hair i say when i had chemotherapy treatments for a while i was bald now its growing out claudio takes a step back nearly tripping over dave you had chemotherapy but thats for yes i look directly up at him i have hodgkins disease its a form of cancer he moves around dave putting more distance between us is it contagious no uh well dave and i have gotta get down to the gym well see you why should it hurt when this guy is no one id want under any circumstances but it does hurt i wont let him see it come on dave he yells from the sidewalk dave sits down on the steps near my legs you go on claudio he says i didnt want to go to the gym anyway claudio doesnt stick around long enough to argue i watch him striding down the street are you sure you dont want to go with him i ask dave and its hard to keep the bitterness out of my voice no dave says i was going to come sometime today and get acquainted this seems like a good time unless youre busy yes she is julie says dina promised to take me to see the lake ill walk with you he says julie stiffens and i dont answer him i dont know if i want his friendship or not is he going to be another rob mrs cardenas told me you have hodgkins disease dave looks at me so intently i cant look away you should have gone with claudio she also told me that youre an interesting person a smart person she said wed find a lot to talk about did she ask you to come and see me does that make a difference shouldnt it i ask why are you going to answer my question how do you like this game were playing answer a question with a question do you know you can be the winner if the other person goofs and makes a statement i have to smile are you crazy he grins thats the spirit then he slaps his hand over his mouth and we both laugh the screen door squeals open and mrs cardenas comes out on the porch hello dave she says im glad you came by and she adds for my benefit daves a nice boy muy simpбtico she may be right i find that im glad dave has come mrs cardenas lowers herself into a chair and fans herself with her hand the hot weather is here for sure i like it out here on the porch i tell her and i like the sun ive spent so long being cold did julie tell you that some of my relatives are coming over tonight to meet both of you julie and i are going to make fudge brownies all the kids like fudge brownies will you give out samples dave asks come to the party mrs cardenas answers theres lots of room for everybody she hoists herself out of the garden chair and says come on julie the ovens lit and we should get busy with those brownies julies glance rapidly flickers between dave and me i cant she says were going to walk to the lake i give her hand a reassuring squeeze we wont go to the lake without you have fun with the brownies youll be right here i wont leave the porch i promise okay julie says reluctantly she follows mrs cardenas into the house flashing dave one last resentful glare shes really hanging on to you dave says whats her problem she was in an accident both her parents were killed and she has no other relatives they put her in my room at the hospital and i guess she needs someone to cling to for a little while thats tough he says on both of you nows a good time to change the subject claudio talked about the gym i tell him are you on some kind of team no he says we were just going to goof around and see if there were enough guys there to get together a basketball game claudios into all the sports but i just tag along sometimes what do you like to do i have to ask the next question do you write no he says looking surprised my grades in english are good enough but what i really like is science i may go to med school after college i dont know yet hes not another rob he doesnt write bad poetry i lean forward resting my arms on my knees studying to be a doctor would be hard work will you specialize i dont know yet he says its the research that interests me the most so we talk about that for a while i havent talked to a guy my age for a long time and i feel good about it until he says tell me something about this hodgkins disease whats there to tell i dont even like to think about it well i mean are you cured of it now no im not he turns toward me quickly banging his right knee on the steps he rubs his knee i didnt mean to make you mad im not mad at you im mad at suddenly its too much and everything spills out we talked about what you want to be well i was going to be an attorney and now im not my doctor says the percentages of people who survive the disease are getting higher all the time but face it there are some who dont survive they let you out of the hospital that must mean something im what they call in remission that means im sort of hanging in space until the disease comes up and zaps me again youre giving up im facing facts what youre doing is telling yourself that youre going to die there is a gasp behind me i turn to see julie standing in the open door her face against the screen julie i say i didnt hear you the door slams and all i can see is the imprint of her stricken face what a terrible way for her to find out i am on my feet reaching for the door but dave is beside me and he grabs my arm why dont you tell her that youve got a good chance too because i dont believe that i have you dont know anything for sure sit down for a minute think this out i sit on the steps next to him shaking my head trying to remove the memory of julies face dave pulls a leaf from the ligustrum bush that crowds the edge of the steps and turns it over and over as though hes studying it look at it this way even if you were an attorney a really good attorney for ten years or five years he stares right into my eyes even if it was for only one year dina you would have reached a goal wouldnt you i jump up i cant talk now ive got to explain things to julie want me to help no thanks he stands on the lower step squinting at me in the sunlight ill be back are you sure you want to he doesnt have time to answer the windows rattle with mrs cardenass shriek i stumble up the steps banging through the pair of doors dave is right behind me julie is standing in the middle of the kitchen blood is splattered on her clothes the sink and the floor she must have tried to chop some more nuts mrs cardenas cries i told her not to the knife she cut oh madre de dios could it be an artery we got to stop the bleeding i am at julies side in an instant its not an artery i know that much from first aid and i know my pressure points and what to do things are under control before my heart is its still popping around in my chest when i take a look at julies woebegone face it has a good color it looks as though she lost more blood than she did i tell mrs cardenas see its just a surface cut and the bleeding has practically stopped she wont even need stitches should we take her to the doctor we wont need to i answer if youve got something to make a bandage with and an antiseptic ill take care of it in the medicine cabinet mrs cardenas hurries toward the bathroom how did you know what to do dave seems impressed i teach i used to teach a firstaid class mrs cardenas returns with gauze pads and tape i thought i was watching a big girl of nine i told her not to touch the knife oh pobrecita nina i wasnt careful enough you were careful mrs cardenas dont blame yourself this was julies fault mrs cardenas and dave have an armful of paper towels and a pan of hot soapy water and are mopping the floor and cabinets julies gaze is steady blinkless i just wanted to help chop some nuts you were told not to touch the knife i forgot i wanted to help you heard what i said to dave you were upset she nods i know i was upset thats why i wasnt careful i tried to be careful but i wasnt mrs cardenas straightens with a grunt one hand at her back you gave us a terrible scare im sorry julie says she holds her arm stiffly and examines the bandage dave dries his hands on the seat of his jeans id better leave he says but ill be back tonight for the brownies mrs cardenas asks sure he says i walk with him to the door stepping out onto the porch one question he says in a low voice if someone is chopping nuts and the knife slips they cut a finger or thumb right i know i answer i wondered how she cut her arm instead the honeysuckle fragrance is strong in the hot noon sun its cloying and drowsy and makes a lie of the emotional upheaval weve just been through for an instant i close my eyes then i look at dave ill talk to her i say ive got to explain what she overheard he nods see you later i dont watch him leave i go back into the house to the hum of the air conditioner and the blasts of cooler air but its not that which makes me shiver julie is sitting in one of the big deep red overstuffed chairs i sit across from her in a matching chair feeling as though im in the mouth of a large plush lion who is going to swallow me at any minute i can hear mrs cardenas on the phone again shes speaking in spanish rapidly excitedly theres blood on your shirt julie says i know and on your clothes too in a few minutes we can change and ill wash them out it was just an accident julie says lets talk about something else about what you overheard youre going to die too julie i dont know when no one really knows when theyre going to die this disease ive got can stay in remission for years for a long time i begin to parrot what ive been told dr cruz said that right now theres a good chance for a cure in the future something may be discovered that will cure everyone who gets hodgkins at some time the disease may be wiped out the way you say it i can tell you dont believe it julie says you dont care what if i care too much and dont make it through college or hope too hard and dont make it through law school what if i want to fall in love but the disease comes back its that caring and wondering and hurting that i dont think i can handle am i talking to julie or to myself i dont want to be alone she says oh julie you arent alone im sorry youre upset about what i said i didnt explain myself very well i guess why did i expect a nineyearold to understand all this she stares at me with those solemn eyes my father died she says abruptly startling me sikes killed him it was dark one night and they fought and kept banging into the side of our mobile home i was scared and i screamed but my mother tried to make me be quiet somebody called the police i think she is quiet staring at something only she can see julie i ask did sikes threaten your father after they fought did he say hed get even julie turns and looks at me dina she says theres something i want to show you now no she says ill tell you when chapter mrs cardenass party is a clustering of relatives all sizes and ages and shapes mr cardenas is having as much fun as his wife he argues politics with anyone who will listen a strand of gray hair flopping on his forehead as his head punctuates his remarks dina he says every time he passes me are you having a good time do you like the party his weathered cheeks are crinkled with laugh lines and the black eyes that peer over the top of his outofshape wireframe glasses are interested eager most of the time he confides to me in a voice that can be heard throughout the room id rather sleep in my chair than hear all these noisy relations but sometimes its a good thing for everyone to be together i meet carmen and dolores and many people whose names i cant remember there are a number of children but julie clings to my side and doesnt attempt to talk to them arturo the policeman is there i am as curious to meet these relatives of mrs cardenas as they are to meet me arturo shakes my hand and looks down at julie muy bonita he says she must be much like her mother come come get something to eat mrs cardenas shouts pulling arturo toward the kitchen someone with a broad redlipstick smile shoves a loaded plate into my hands theres a fragrance of spicy meat and flaky piecrust and moist cake and buttery chocolate frosting eat up enjoy the good food she says i made the empanadas which between you and me are a lot better than carmens dave squeezes through the front door and searches the room until he sees me suddenly surprisingly im glad hes here he works his way to my side and takes a piece of cake from my plate hi he says i know youd want me to help you eat that he looks down at julie are you having a good time he asks she doesnt answer so he adds tomorrow id like to take you and dina down to the river walk paseo del rio have you ever been there no julie says would you like that now hes looking at me yes id like that very much i tell him i was there once a few years ago and id like to see it again i glance at the green circle on julies right hand its where i bought that little jade ring dave grabs the arm of a small boy who is wriggling past ricky he says take julie to the other kids she wants to play too ricky makes a face do i gotta were going to play ball julie can play ball with you wheres your sister estella shes julies age shes in the kitchen stuffing her face okay take julie and go find her ahora julie looks less eager to comply than ricky does where are you going she asks me in a voice filled with suspicion im not going anywhere im here enjoying the party i think its a good idea if you have fun with the other children she moves away and once more i am myself i hold my plate out to dave and this time he takes a sandwich from it someone small dashes between us stepping on my toes i seem to have a lot of foster relatives i say i think youve got a good deal he answers licking some cheese spread from his finger if i were picking a foster home id check on the cooking first mrs cardenas is a good cook as though on cue mrs cardenas makes her way toward us she is carrying a platter filled with some kind of little sausage buns dave takes one in each hand and begins to eat them im glad you came dave she says this house is too full of people and its gonna make dina tired she met everybody and now she needs to get out why dont you take her to a movie i cant look at dave im so embarrassed i wish i was on the other side of the room i was thinking about that dave says easily i like your relatives mrs cardenas but you know i come to your parties just for the food she laughs loudly then get some punch and cake before you go wait a minute its time for me to break in i cant leave i told julie id be here why should julie care if you and dave go to a movie she wants me around shes unsure of herself shes well shes unsure of me mrs cardenas gestures with the large platter nearly spilling the contents look at her shes having a good time carmens little girls are keeping her busy dave nods i think it would be better for julie if you didnt worry about her let her play with the kids her age guilt slides away like a shadow at noon theyre right and i need to be away from julie you talked me into it i tell them ill go home and get my fathers car and the movie listings in the newspaper while you get ready dave says he makes his way out of the house julie looks up watches him leave then goes back to her new friends the noise level is rising its beginning to bother me so i get my handbag and slip out to the front porch an evening breeze has come up and a wisp of hair tickles my face my hair is getting longer i reach up to touch it in wonder my hair is growing dave pulls the car to a stop in the street he gets out and comes toward me but i run to meet him you look happy he says are you that glad to leave the party my hair is growing i tell him it sounds so silly that we both laugh but he puts a hand to my head and strokes the short curls i like your hair its so soft its soft like well like the belly of a duck its so ludicrous that we laugh as though well never stop hes holding my shoulders and im warm with the happy chatter coming from inside the house and the night burst of honeysuckle perfume and the sharpripped moon dave opens the car door for me and i slide across to the middle of the seat its not until after he edges the car away from the curb that i realize his closeness the warmth of his body next to mine what am i doing slowly carefully i move a few inches away dave gives me a quick glance a grin where are you going he asks i was crowding you oh no you werent when i dont answer he says for a few minutes you were relaxed and having a good time now youre sitting all by yourself with your hands clenched in your lap whats the matter nothing i answer quickly i just didnt want you to think i mean this isnt exactly a date why isnt it because i shrug look dave there was a guy named rob we were dating and i thought he felt about me the way i felt about him except that after i came to the hospital i never heard from him again hes dating someone else and i dont blame him i just dont want to be hurt like that again there was a girl named arlene he says thats all after a minute i turn to him what is that supposed to mean it means that youre not the only one whos been hurt my mom said its a part of growing up i sigh i suppose she called it puppy love no she said its real and its painful but relationships either grow into something lasting and serious or they break up and at our age they usually break up most of the time someones left with a lot of unhappiness to handle then its better to protect yourself from getting hurt he smiles thats exactly what i told her and she said that people who are afraid of being hurt can never find out how wonderful love can be so you take your chances isnt it worth it i dont know ill have to think about it i settle back against the seat feeling more comfortable about the evening its easy to talk to dave i have to admit to myself that i like being with him during the movie i glance sideways at dave in the flickering light with his tortoiseshell glasses he reminds me again of rob rob who rob whocaresaboutrob i giggle and dave turns toward me its a funny movie i whisper on the way home we talk about a lot of things but not about me and not about julie i tell him about my high school and how holley jo and i not knowing any better tried out for the cheerleader squad against all those juniors and seniors and didnt get a single vote but got invited to the football dance and he tells me about his high school and how claudio ran last year for student council and made stacks of posters with his picture on them and even plastered them inside all the girls lavatories at school and i tell him that speaking of posters i won an honorablemention prize for a poster i made in a goodnutrition contest and he tells me that speaking of good nutrition theres a momandpop place in san antonio that makes the best burritos de guisada in the world for a few hours ive forgotten who i am but as we go up the walk to mrs cardenass house there is julie sitting on the top step of the porch looking lost in someones handmedown pajamas what are you doing out here i ask her its all right mrs cardenas hasnt gone to bed yet ill help her clean up no everybody helped its all clean shes watching a movie on tv she says shes wound up and has to run down dave sits on the step next to her and i sit on the other side she turns so that her back is toward dave and says to me accusingly you told me youd be at the party i know but mrs cardenas suggested that we go to a movie i would have gone with you you were playing with your friends theyre not my friends just some kids i saw you you were having fun i wanted to go with you youll be going with us tomorrow dave says lets talk about that we can walk along the river under the bridges that are streets and theres an ice cream shop youll like julies back is stiff but shes listening theres a theater out of doors with the seats on one side of the river and the stage on the other and some restaurants where you can sit outside and watch the boats go by what kind of boats she turns toward him just a little theyre flatbottomed boats that the tourists ride on but theyre not as much fun as the paddleboats that are on the part of the river that runs through brackenridge park by the zoo i add theres a zoo now she is really interested its in a different part of the city but well go there sometime too dave says i cant help but yawn the excitement that has kept me going begins to dissipate and i feel like a portable cassette with its battery level sliding downward dave is smiling at me over julies head good night he says ill pick you both up tomorrow afternoon around two julie stands and takes one of my hands helping me to my feet goodbye she says formally good night he answers julie tugs me into the house but i turn to watch him drive away we say good night to mrs cardenas her eyes glitter reflecting the blue and white light from the television screen julie what are you doing out of bed she asks but without waiting for an answer she says to me did you have a good time with dave yes it was fun hes a nice boy she looks as pleased as if she had put him together with her own hands oh what a nice evening she says and turns back to watch gary grant murmur something clever to sophia loren down the hall i can hear the snuffles and sputters as mr cardenas dreams and snores i wish i could talk to holley jo i would love to tell her about dave i will right now before the evening has begun to blur ill write her a letter if i cant talk to her before we fall asleep then ill write my thoughts once in the bedroom i put on my nightgown and begin to look through the drawer for my box of stationery what are you doing julie asks she pokes her head out from under the blanket im looking for my stationery what for you arent going to write a letter in the middle of the night oh yes i am i turn to look at her did you see my box of stationery its pink and it has some pink and white envelopes and paper in it and a bundle of my letters from holley jo and some other friends no you helped pack my things and you put them away you must have seen the box i dont own that much maybe it got left accidentally at the hospital she is staring straight into my eyes and i know shes lying for an instant i am so furious with this child that i want to scream at her but i clench my fists and try to think if she deliberately left the box at the hospital theyll find it and keep it for me and if she didnt then its probably somewhere here in this room and if she threw it out there hasnt been a trash pickup so it would still be in the trash can i can search for it tomorrow why would she do a thing like this i know shes jealous of dave is she even jealous of holley jo and my past life back to the check of drawers hey thats my drawer she jumps out of bed and runs to my side but i have found my stationery box under her clothes and i pull it out holding it over her head she pushes the drawer shut then turns and marches back to her bed as though her feelings had been deeply hurt i tried to put everything away by myself she says if i got something in the wrong drawer its not my fault why did you do this do what her gaze is clear blue theres no point in pursuing it im going to write a letter if the light bothers you just roll toward the wall it wont take long i know my voice sounds colder than i mean it to be but i cant help it the mood is broken i sit crosslegged at the center of the sagging mattress the box balanced on my lap a sheet of paper on it dear holley jo i look at the words the only words on the paper i cant write im even having trouble thinking straight theres so much i want to write you holley jo and i cant i want to tell you about dave but i keep looking over at the other bed and there is julie lying on her back staring straight ahead without blinking it makes me blink just to think of someone not blinking it makes my eyes feel itchy and start to water holley jo there is a lot i dont understand about julie shes had some awful things happen to her and maybe thats the problem what problem i dont know i dont understand what im thinking so how can i write it i only wanted to tell you about this guy dave but all those other thoughts have me too mixed up to write i look again at the words ive written dear holley jo not much of a letter i slip the paper and pen inside the box lean down and put it on the floor dont ever touch this box again i tell julie tears are running in little streaks into her hair and her ears she hasnt made a sound i didnt realize she was crying what im trying to say julie is that the letters in this box mean a lot to me and i dont want anything to happen to them you understand dont you julie gives a loud snuffle and her eyes close i told you i just got mixed up when i tried to put everything away it wasnt my fault and you didnt even say you were sorry the yellow lamp is harsh and the fading bruises on her arms are still there blotches that remind me how much she is hurting all right julie im sorry there was a misunderstanding im going to turn out the light now so we can sleep good night she says in the morning mrs cardenas serves another big breakfast then she announces its time to get ready for mass nobody has to go she says but it would be nice after all it is the lords day and you dont have to be catholic to go to mass she makes everybody go to mass mr cardenas says his wife ignores him in a family its a good thing when everybody goes to church together you see im not telling you to go im just saying it would be nice she cocks her head like a fat little robin as she looks at me dina did you ever go to mass in a catholic church no well then she says you dont know what its like how beautiful it is and you wont know unless you go how do i explain to her that im blank inside that i tried to pray and i couldnt please i say im not ready yet not now she gives me a long look then nods okay not just yet how about you julie want to come with me i want to stay with dina julie says mrs cardenas sighs then its up to you and me carlos he leans on the table and pushes himself upward from his chair the wood creaks and he says thats my knees complaining theyre getting too stiff to kneel going to church is good for stiff knees she is trying to make me holy he says to me youre much closer than you used to be she says maybe its not going to church thats doing it maybe its old age hurry up old man she tells him ill take care of the kitchen i say i carry the plates nearest me to the sink and rinse off the runny yellow egg yolk that paints the rims julie comes to the sink too and nudges me out of the way i said id do the breakfast dishes we can do them together and make the beds and then read the comics in the newspaper youre supposed to rest i just got up im not the least bit tired i smile at her come on julie lets work together all right she says putting the dishes she is holding into the sink and then you can write your letter but the letter doesnt get written in just an hour mr and mrs cardenas return and there are preparations for dinner and everything anyone said at the party to retell in detail mrs cardenas is still hung over with happiness dave comes at two just as he had promised and we climb into his fathers car somehow julie ends up between us hola senorita he tells her is that spanish she asks yes wouldnt you feel less crowded in the backseat no she says and she folds her hands primly in her lap dave smiles at me over julies head and i feel a rush of joy in this special day that belongs to me dave has a nice smile and a nice profile i memorize it with quick secret glances as we drive through the older part of the city and the downtown area finally we park in a wide lot near the hilton hotel the river is to our right but were going to la villita first dave says a glass blower there makes little animals i think julie would like one julie perks up she chatters about a glass blower she saw at the beach once when her father took her as we cross the street and head into a narrow passageway paved with cobblestones dave is telling us about the history of this early center in san antonio but i am watching the people and the shops the area is filled with tourists the glassblower first julie says as i stop to look at a pottery display in a nearby window someone takes my hand but its not julie the fingers are long and firm and i like the feel of them i see that dave has julie by his other hand he has moved between us across the way a tall stocky man with dark hair is watching the three of us and i automatically smile at him this is a day for smiles if he smiles back i dont notice because dave is saying right in here julie and fishing some change from his pocket to pay the ten cents admission we edge past some plump women who are leaving the store gingerly carrying wellwrapped purchases and enter an iceanddiamondspangled world there are blown glass figurines of all sizes and shapes lining the walls and hanging from the ceiling ships in full sail ballerinas skittish horses leaping porpoises this is fantastic i tell dave julie adds oh look at the merrygoround tell you what julie dave says id like to buy you anything in the store but i havent got that much money over on this tray are a lot of little animals and i can afford one of those for you take your pick julie is delighted she chooses changes her mind and chooses again until she has decided on a small pink dog i never had a dog she says dave has picked something else he pays for the purchases and puts mine in my hand a duck he says a very softbellied duck we leave the store laughing in our own world not noticing that julie has stopped on the bottom step until we nearly stumble over her watch it dave says catching his footing and grabbing my arm sikes julie whispers and she clutches my skirt that man looking in the window with his back to us is sikes before i can react she begins to run into the crowd back toward the street dave i cry catch her a policeman is standing on the next level should i yell for help no my mind is trying to think while my feet are running toward him he turns whats the matter my words gulp and gasp and spill into each other theres a man his name is sikes please come with me i lead and he follows quickly it isnt far the shop is here no there at the window but hes gone oh no he was a big man tall with dark hair his back was toward us he must have seen me run to you for help hes the door of the shop opens and a woman comes out her widebrimmed straw hat flopping at every step the man follows her its the same man who had been watching us earlier it was hot in the sun he complains i thought you were never going to make up your mind thats him i tell the policeman i dont have to go toward him he and the woman walk right into our path just a minute please the policeman says and they stop the policeman looks at me i glance wildly around for dave and julie but they arent in sight i theres a little girl with us she well she was afraid of this man she said his name was sikes william sikes for goodness sakes the woman says she squints at us and retreats behind an overlarge pair of sunglasses thats not our name it isnt even close ill show you my identification the man tells the policeman he pulls out a wallet and the policeman studies it i wish i were anyplace in the world except right here dina i am so glad to hear daves voice he comes through the crowd pulling julie afterhim she looks at me as though i had betrayed her and shes trembling i dont want to see him dina i take her other hand look julie this is the man you ran from she stares at him and shakes her head he isnt sikes hes the man who was looking in the window you just saw his back you made a mistake other people have stopped to watch the scene i feel like a fool trying to apologize to explain there is really nothing i can explain i wish the man and his wife would help me but theyre annoyed they walk away the policeman shrugs and goes back to the spot where i had found him he isnt curious and im thankful for that how do i explain someone like sikes dave has a hand on my shoulder calm down he says julie just made a mistake no one got hurt i want to go home julie says but we havent been to the river yet and whoever you thought this guy was he wasnt dave pauses does that make sense i know that man wasnt sikes julie says as she stares at the clusters of people who are strolling past us her fingers grip my hand so tightly its painful i wasnt looking at that man julie adds i was looking at sikes chapter who is sikes dave asks me later so i tell him julies story thats weird he says he leans back on the thick pad of grass under mrs cardenass crape myrtle tree the tree is dotted with hard little graygreen balls that in a few weeks will relax and become fragile pink flowers her story is possible i tell him mrs cardenas thinks julies parents were running from something or someone i wonder if they were running from sikes do you think hes following julie or does she just imagine that she sees him i pull at a broad strand of grass and smooth it between my fingers dave ive even wondered if sikes was a real person but he must be the things shes told me she couldnt make up and she does have those marks on her back and bruises on her arms maybe they came from her father i doubt it she adores her father she told me she looks just like him i watch a bee who is investigating my toes i pull my foot back and he shoots off in a straight line thats odd dave rolls over on one elbow its odd that she looks like her father no i just thought of something arturo said at the party he mentioned that julie was a pretty little girl then he said she must look like her mother it was a compliment i dont think so hes a policeman maybe he saw the drivers license description of her father or maybe its the texas kind that has a picture on it and he knows what her father looks like remind me to show you the picture on my drivers license no remind me not to i look like im planning to rob the savings and loan company all i need is a number under my chin ill show you my license ive got a big silly grin that scrunches up my eyes if a policeman ever stopped me and looked at my license hed never recognize me unless i made the same face its a lazy afternoon the scene at la villita seems out of place wrong movie wrong actors ive forgotten something dave i didnt remember to thank you for going after julie shes a fast one dave says scared me to death when she ran out in the traffic before i could reach her she just missed being hit by a car its surprising she wasnt cold cold cold sitting in the sun with shivers up my back and through my shoulders and into my neck there is something here i dont understand a needle of cold pricks me frightens me dave begins talking about his job and im distracted tomorrow ill call dr lynn i need to talk to her all i have is pieces and i need her to help put them together so frying fish and french fries gets kind of boring after a while but the job pays okay and its fine for summer i realize dave is talking but its hard to pay attention what do i tell her about julie cutting her arm but it was an accident about julie running into traffic but she was running away from someone she thought was sikes i try to look interested as dave says and you can sure get sick of that fish smell we get all we can eat but you can only eat so much fish and you start dreaming its a pizza whats happening to julie doesnt make sense it sounds crazy shes just a little girl with problems obviously the story of my career as a fryer of fish has you stunned into speechlessness dave says i tuck away the problems pulling myself back to the here and now back to dave i was just trying to visualize the story of your job as a tv miniseries sort of like cooked jaws i feel at ease with dave and he likes to be with me i know he does but the afternoon turns warm again and its over too soon reluctantly i say goodbye to dave and go into the house mrs cardenas is chopping cucumbers and tomatoes for a salad so i set the table mr cardenas tosses down the comic section of the expressnews theres nothing funny in here today he says you read those comics three times at least his wife says if theyre not funny why read them i keep looking the house is very quiet wheres julie i ask im glad i had a break from her but now guilt is moving in again oh shes back in the bedroom probably still playing with that little glass dog mrs cardenas says she sure likes that little dog that was nice of dave to buy those things for you didnt i tell you he was a nice boy yes hes very nice and the little duck is nice and i want to see it and touch it again ill go back to the bedroom and talk to julie i tell them she may want some company as i enter the bedroom julie stares up at me there is a strong message of fear she is hunched in a little ball in the middle of her bed and she holds out a closed fist i want you to have my dog she says pink glass shines through her fingers no i tell her thats a gift to you from dave he wouldnt want you to give it away i want to give it to you because i broke your little duck oh no julie no i glance at the top of the chest of drawers where i had put it but it isnt there what were you doing with it i know it was yours and i should have left it alone where is it how did you break it she climbs from the bed and carefully picks up a tissue which is wadded around something i hold out my hand and she places the tissue in it i dropped it please dont be mad at me i was just looking at it and i dropped it i stare at the crushed pieces of yellow glass lying on the tissue in my hand tell me the truth julie i am i dropped it to smash it like this you must have stepped on it oh maybe i did when i was trying to pick it up i meet her gaze so steady so innocent she had to do this on purpose because dave gave it to me facing her i sit on the edge of my bed she is so small so thin so young for her nine years i think if we have an honest talk with each other it will help i tell her something is bothering you and something is bothering me talk to me tell me why you did this she looks at me for a long time and i hope she is weighing what ive said julie do you think im spending too much time with dave and not enough with you she shakes her head people have many friends at the home i spent a lot of time with holley jo but i had other friends too and i taught swimming lessons in the summer while holley jo took advanced french in summer school and sometimes she went out on a date and i stayed home sometimes it worked the other way we didnt have to be with each other the entire time do you understand her mind has shifted and i can see the change i know whats bothering you she suddenly says you dont like being sick and waiting to find out if youre going to die i cant help sighing i am trying to talk about you the way youve been behaving is one of the things that is bothering me does she smile it was just a flicker a strange little smile dont worry she says everythings going to be all right i cant get through to her i dont know how carefully i wrap the shards of yellow glass in the tissue and tuck it in the righthand corner of my top drawer when i get the chance im going to call dr lynn in the morning mrs cardenas leans across the breakfast table and says dina you told me you could drive and run errands for me you got a drivers license yes ill show it to you thats okay i believe you she plops back in her chair and says carlos is such a bad driver he takes the bus to work and i dont like to drive too many crazy drivers who want to put their cars in the same spot my car is in ill take you anywhere you want to go i say im a good driver muy bien she says today i got some errands for you i want to go too julie says sure mrs cardenas says this one place youre going to a shoe repair shop oh how that man wears down the heels on his shoes is right next to a nice little ice cream store ill give you some money to have ice cream cones thank you i say and julie repeats it like a small echo youd better give me some directions i add im not familiar with san antonio julie clears the table while mrs cardenas draws red dots on a gas station map of the city heres where we are and heres the shoe repair shop its in a big shopping mall over near the loop im going to give you a grocery list and you may as well get the things at that store in the mall because they got a good buy on eggs and a halfprice on tomato juice shes busy writing lists and im studying the map the city isnt that big and map reading isnt hard in fact i like it julie is next to me her finger points to i this is the freeway that goes to the hospital she says youre a good map reader i tell her i know she answers finally we are loaded with a list a paper bag with a pair of shoes in it mr cardenass suit which has to go to the dry cleaners and some money for the grocery store once around the block until youre used to the car mrs cardenas says piling into the front seat with us squashing julie up against me mrs cardenass car is like the old blue station wagon it takes the same gentle hand to keep from bucking this beautiful model comes complete with jumps and stalls i know its tricks so by the time we get down the hill to woodlawn drive ive got the feel of the car right turn right turn up the hill and right turn again this house with the blue trim its where dave lewis and his family live mrs cardenas says smugly adding nice boy dave i wonder what time dave goes to work he didnt say when hed come over the car pulls to a smooth stop in front of mrs cardenass house and she beams youre a good driver dina have fun and take your time theres no hurry she struggles from the car and onto the curb panting a little dr cruz says i gotta lose weight sometimes i think hes right she shuts the door waves and i head down to woodlawn again julie scoots over and watches our progress intently she asks questions about the zoo so i fill time telling her how kids under twelve can ride on the elephant and how the little train goes all around the park she sits on the edge of her seat resting her arms on the dashboard and her chin on her arms as we pull into the large shopping area she says ive been here before did you live near here i drop the keys into my handbag yes she swings toward me and clutches my arm dina remember i said there was something i wanted to show you well now its time we have some errands to do after the errands she climbs out of the car as though everything had been settled cleaners first then shoe repair shop how about that ice cream cone now i ask her i dont want an ice cream cone heat rises from the expanse of cement i think ice cream would make us feel a lot cooler lets go to the grocery store why are you in such a hurry im not in a hurry julie says i just know what i want to do what is it you want to do i want to go where i used to live shes marching down the pavement turning into the supermarket the huge glass doors swing wide as we approach and close behind us with a smack i drag a cart from its stack and pull out the shopping list julie you told detective macgarvey that you didnt know where you lived i dont remember the address but i know how to get there you could have told him that i didnt want to it wasnt time to go there and it is now yes she says now its time why dont we call detective macgarvey he could go with us no okay i say dont get so upset the list isnt long so soon we are back in the car the bags tucked on the floor behind the front seat ill tell you how to get there she says she sits upright clutching the dashboard staring out the windshield turn down this street next to the freeway and keep going until i tell you to turn freeway traffic zooms past up on a raised level a purring swishing rattling roar im not in that traffic but its invaded my life and for a moment i wish for the quiet roads of the hill country here she says turn here wait not so fast pull in right here and park i turn off the ignition and stare at the dirty white stucco building in front of us curls of paint are peeling from the brown trim at the windows and the asphalt shingles on the roof are streaked and stained occasional outside stairways break the flat monotony and down at the far end is a sign with an arrow manager julie is already out of the car so i join her carefully locking the doors because of those bags of food inside i start toward the managers office but julie says no this way dont we need to talk to the manager she shakes her head come on i follow her around the side and to the back where sagging carports stretch to the end of the unit just where are we going i ask to our apartment but well have to ask the manager no we paid by the week the time isnt up yet you were leaving the city we always do it that way sooner or later the manager finds the keys in our mailboxes that way there arent any questions about where were going or forwarding addresses or stuff like that why julie for a moment she looks puzzled but she simply shrugs its this one downstairs she stoops at the door and fishes through a crack around the sill coming up with a key i always hide my key she says because sometimes nancy goes out and im outside and cant get in julie are you sure we should go inside but the door is open and she has disappeared into the dimness i follow her carefully closing the door feeling creepy in this dingy apartment with its smell of stale cigarette smoke and bacon grease with its dusty beige drapes drawn against the sun where is julie theres a small hallway leading off one end of the living room two bedrooms but sounds are coming from the one on the right i enter in time to see her backing out of the closet its here i knew it would be she holds up a square metal can the kind cookies sometimes come in its scratched and dented and the christmas poinsettias on the cover are faded she puts it on the one twin bed whats inside something i want to show you she pries off the lid holding it as a shield so that i cant see into the box in a moment she has found what she wants its a snapshot she studies it then hands it to me the picture is that of a man who is smiling and i see julies face his nose is long and narrow eyes wide and blue hes standing on a bridge and a strand of pale chin hair is blowing across his forehead is this your father i ask we look alike she tells me you certainly do is there a picture of your mother in the box too solemnly she takes the snapshot from me and carefully puts it back she snaps the lid of the can shut and hugs it to her chest now we can go she says julie are there other things in the apartment that belong to your family no she says i think id better look around i open a drawer of the nearby chest but its empty i told you they took everything except my treasure box why didnt they take that too they decided to leave while i was at the playground theres a little playground two blocks down that street out in front and they just picked me up and said we were moving nancy had packed everything i told them they had left my box but they wouldnt go back her voice is rising and there is such anger in her face that it frightens me why would they leave this this treasure box because i hid it everywhere we go i hide it so no one will find it except me theres always someplace this closet has some boards loose on the floor i hid it under the boards she is so intent she must be telling the truth but she has lied to me before i cant be sure i walk into the other bedroom the bed is unmade a pair of mans shoes are on the floor a shirt draped over the small chair cigarettes and matches on the chest i open the top drawer its stuffed with mens underwear some papers rolled socks in a heap of disorder julie look at all this your parents didnt pack everything there may be something here that will help detective macgarvey i flip through the papers a credit card a photograph i pull them out george washburn the photo is of a smiling family theyre black julie what is all this she shrugs maybe we just paid for one week i forget someone else must live here now chapter i shove things back into the drawer as though they are crawly alive and biting lets get out of here we could be arrested for breaking into someones apartment we didnt break in ive got the key give it to me i grab it from her ringers and run into the living room i can hear footsteps across the walkway in front of the apartments i hope whoever is out there is not coming in this apartment the footsteps stop julie comes up beside me shhh i whisper and clutch her arm ouch she says i am frozen into the minute which goes on and on the footsteps move down the walk i think im breathing i think im moving across the room the key where am i going to put the key if mr washburn finds it hell know someone was in the apartment theres a small table with a drawer in it it rattles as i open it the table isnt shaking i am theres nothing in the drawer except a phone book so i drop the key in beside it and close the drawer no the footsteps are returning i tug julie out the back door not even looking to see if anyone is outside were the only ones in this parking area youre pulling my arm im sorry im trying to make you hurry why because we have to get away from this place we have no business here you sound like nancy here is the car i cant find the keys theyre in my handbag somewhere what happened to the person on the walk no one is around now is someone watching us from one of the windows the keys get in julie lock your door im still trembling as we drive away it occurs to me as we double back to the shopping center that i havent noted the name of the apartments the name of the street or the address now lets go home she says calmly thats where were going why are you mad at me im not mad i was just scared suddenly i remember something she said why did you tell me that i sounded like your mother because shed rush around and get excited when we had to leave did you always leave places in such a hurry not all the time but sometimes do you know why no but youre a smart little girl julie you must have figured something out was someone chasing your family sometimes was it sikes i hate sikes i wish hed go away hes mad because i didnt die too back to the beginning why why why dont yell at me this is no time to try to talk to her ive got to watch the traffic i must calm down take a long slow deep breath calmly calmly nothing matters now watch the traffic home again home again jiggity jog what am i doing in this car with this child playing this crazy game ive got some other things in my treasure box to show you but its not time now no its not not while im driving ill tell you when its time good i remember theres a radio in the car and i turn it on country western familiar stuff it eases me back to mrs cardenass house i leave the car in the driveway dont tell mrs cardenas about my treasure box julie says mrs cardenas i suppose it doesnt matter if she knows or not its dr lynn i need to talk to it has to be my secret for a while julie adds okay i wont tell her i carry in one sack of groceries and mrs cardenas goes out for the other julie slips into the house like a small ghost mrs cardenas doesnt see her wheres julie she came in while you were going out i hand her the sales slip and the change and put a head of lettuce in the refrigerator here i am julie says sweet smile no sign of her treasure box how did she do that so fast dave called he said theres something he has to tell you dina hes going to come over tonight after work about eight oclock is that too late will it bother mr cardenas nothing bothers carlos not even his own snoring dave said it was important it dawns on me that i dont have the number of the hospital there must be a phone book around here where have i seen one i remember the phone book in the dresser in george washburns apartment and i shudder mrs cardenas stops a carton of milk in her hands and studies me are you cold dina on such a warm day cold oh no im fine youve been looking a lot better i said to carlos theres been a big difference since shes been out in the sun and has more color in her face julie is studying me too dont worry i wont give away your secret to mrs cardenas to me a promise is something to keep what can i do to help you i ask mrs cardenas nada mбs she shakes her head there are some books in the living room bookcase maybe youll find something in there that youd like to read carlos and i arent much for reading but we got our boys some books while they were home and in school bookcase i wonder if thats where she keeps the telephone book it will give me an excuse to look she shuts the refrigerator door and says i almost forgot to tell you my sisterinlaw angie is taking me shopping with her in a little while shes going to buy some material to sew new drapes for their den and she cant make up her mind she can never make up her mind about anything always has to have somebody help her this time its me would you like me to drive you no no she has a car she drives like her head is somewhere else but i pray a lot and we dont run into anybody i just want you girls to know that ill be gone for a couple of hours youll be all right wont you the doctors said i dont have to be with you every minute well be fine i tell her help yourself to whatever you want for lunch there are still some of carmens empanadas in the refrigerator i sit on the floor in front of the builtin bookcase on the lower shelf in a brown vinyl cover to make it look acceptable in the living room is what im searching for the phone book mrs cardenas and julie are chatting in the kitchen i quickly look up the number of the hospital i should have thought no pencil or paper ill memorize it i go over and over the number in my mind as i slide the phone book back into its place why are you just staring at those books i jump julie i didnt hear you come up behind me youre just staring at those books are you going to read one of them i reach up and pull down tom sawyer heres one youd like i could read it to you the idea surprises me even as i say the words but its a good idea sharing a book might make julie more open with me maybe we can talk more about the things that have happened to her that doesnt look like a book for children it looks like those other books there arent many books in the case and most of them have the same inexpensive binding part of a set alcott twain dickens i always hated dickens because the children in his stories were so abused i only read his novels that were class assignments and all the time i was reading i had such a miserable feeling of frustration does that story have a horse in it or a ghost in it julie asks there are lots of good stories that dont have horses or ghosts in them when are we going to read it how about this afternoon suddenly i am so tired if there is a sandman i think hes more like a cat burglar creeping up behind me on dark softly padded feet smothering me in a blanket of exhaustion so heavy my head can hardly support the weight my arms and legs feel limp no help whatsoever maybe i can take a nap first i add all right she says first you sleep she looks pleased i guess she likes the idea of being read to after all how am i going to make that phone call julie will hear me mrs cardenas will hear me there has to be some way but what is it mrs cardenas comes in carrying her handbag angie is always late too drives like that and still is late i climb to my feet im going to read torn sawyer to julie muy bien theres a nice breeze right now you might like to sit on the porch while you read shes given me a terrific idea why dont we go out there now while we wait for your sisterinlaw its a little warm out there for me she says then she chuckles but think how angie will feel when she comes and were all out there waiting for her i hope shell feel guilty about being late she and i settle into the webbed chairs julie sits on the steps its hard to sit still the lake is silvery gray in the sun and heat shimmers up from the street i lift my face to the breeze that riffles across the porch were going to have a hot summer mrs cardenas says she fans herself with her handbag clouds are building up over to the west maybe well have rain we need it excuse me for a moment ill be right back i get up slowly hoping my plan will work hoping ill have enough time julie stays where she is mrs cardenas keeps fanning into the house quickly quickly the phone is in their bedroom the strange feeling of another persons room the fragrance of the two people who have lived here for many years making this their own domain i feel like a trespasser the number is clear in my mind but the phone dial is so slow the operator at the hospital answers dr lynn manning please can you speak up i cant hear you dr lynn manning i clear my throat one moment two moments three moments hurry finally a voice answers but its not dr lynn this is dina harrington may i please speak to dr manning hi dina this is alice how are you feeling fine im fine i oh could i speak to dr manning gee im sorry alice says shes at some meetings today i think shes coming back this evening do you want to leave a message now what do i do if she calls back i cant talk to her someone else will be around ill have to think of a better plan this one isnt working dina are you there i was trying to think no i wont leave a message ill just call back tomorrow maybe okay im glad it wasnt anything important take care i replace the receiver on its cradle and walk back into the hallway julie is standing in the living room watching me do i look as guilty as i feel i hope not what were you doing in mrs cardenass bedroom she demands i was on the phone didnt you hear me talking no i just came inside mrs cardenas left i didnt hear the phone ring either i doubt if you can hear the phone ring when youre out on the porch i hope to distract her werent you going to show me some other things in your box its not rime yet all right whenever you want are you going to take your nap now id better stay with you im going to watch television you could watch it with me i nod you could sleep in the big chair like mr cardenas does she pauses those big chairs arent very comfortable though its all right if you want to sleep in your bed you could ill be right here in the living room watching the television if you need me you can call me and ill hear you she seems so eager to please and the idea of stretching out on the bed is so tempting there should be no problems julie follows me into the bedroom do you think mrs cardenas would care if we turned off the air conditioner in here for a little while then you wont feel so cold i dont think shed mind unless it put a strain on the others in the house i move away from the blasts of chilly air coming from the window unit we can shut the door julie answers and quickly turns the dial on the air conditioner to the off position the motor grinds and sputters to a halt the silence is a blessing what a good idea julie i smile at her and she smiles back its funny how sometimes you can be so tired you go past the need to sleep like a clock thats been wound so tightly the mainspring twangs loose i lie on the bed in the quietness of the room staring at the little bumps and marks in the plaster on the ceiling if i talk to dr lynn when i talk to dr lynn what do i say i have to think it out so there will be no time wasted the accident the near accident the man julie saw the glass duck she destroyed the apartment her treasure box her treasure box im not a snoop at the same time i tell myself that this is an emergency situation there may be something in that box that gives the answers should i ask her to show me the contents she wont do it she was very careful to let me see only the picture of her father she said there was more to show me but it wasnt the right time suppose i ask her if now is the time suppose i find the treasure box and look for myself off the bed barefoot and the braided rug is stiff under my toes where would she put it and why do i feel so guilty i check the chest of drawers first quiet not a sound slowly carefully ease it open feel around through her things nothing in any of the drawers no point in checking my own what about the closet it must be in the closet wait under the bed the braided rug scratches my cheek nothing there too obvious i should have known there isnt much in the closet how could she have hidden it it couldnt be in this room its not behind the guitar where is the box as i back out of the closet i realize something isnt right theres a strange smell gas i open the door tendrils of the invisible odor creep through the hallway run dont breathe throw open the front door wide and the kitchen door its the oven its on and wide open i turn it off and scream julie where are you shes in one of the plush chairs staring at me julie get out of here i pull at her arm and she stirs we choke and cough as i drag her out of the house down the porch steps and onto the lawn thank god for the breeze its much stronger scudding blueblack clouds ahead of it what do you think you were doing i shout at julie i was making some lunch for us with the gas on full coming out of the open oven her lip curls out again in a gesture thats familiar to me now i put some cheese slices on the bread and put them on the broiler then turned the oven on to broil thats all there is the drip drip of the air conditioner in the living room window the drops slap the wooden porch you turned off the air conditioner in the living room julie did you turn off the one in mrs cardenass bedroom too the wind pushes in sudden spurts against my back it carries the sharp fragrance of rain i liked the quiet julie says it was nice in our bedroom with the air conditioner off and i wasnt hot air conditioners in windows make a lot of noise julie have you ever turned on an oven before of course lots of rimes sometimes when no one came home i made bread and cheese for myself all you do is just turn them on you must have used ovens with automatic pilots or electric ovens didnt you smell the gas something smelled funny but i didnt know what it was how can she look so innocent she must be innocent surely she wouldnt dont you know you could have killed us she opens her mouth wide and wails and i find myself hushing her comforting her i know you wouldnt do it on purpose julie i know the wind taps my back with a low bough from the crape myrtle ill open most of the windows this wind will help clear the air you sit here on the porch right here okay okay julie repeats she huddles on the top step i enter the house throwing open all the windows except those with air conditioners attached having both doors wide has already helped and the wind is a bonus the house comes to life the curtains rise and quiver papers from the living room table ruffle to the floor the nearly empty napkin holder is knocked off the kitchen table with a clatter i stand in the doorway staring at the oven there is the open broiler with two slices of cheesecovered bread julie was telling the truth julie who was sitting in the doilydraped chair eyes staring as i ran into the room i lean against the wall cold to the bone cold bones cold body cold mind the cheese and bread are props if julie had thought they were broiling shed be in the kitchen watching them wouldnt she cheese melts and browns in a hurry burns in that extra instant ive been asking questions and avoiding the answers face it ive looked at the scars on julies body heard about the scars on julies life and told myself poor julie poor julie there is nothing wrong with julies mind now im frightened should i tell mrs cardenas what i think no she wouldnt understand this any more than i do ive got to talk to dr lynn but what should i say are my suspicions enough can i come in now its starting to rain pitiful little voice begging to be forgiven then wed better get these windows down i say you can help me i hurry to each room yanking sashes in place and fastening them julie works with me a helpful nineyearold we leave open gaps in two of the porch windows and the window over the kitchen sink to suck in the coolness of the rainwashed air the red plush lions mouth is scratchysoft and i drop into it stretching my legs and curling my toes julie comes to stand in front of me im hungry dina i want some lunch will you teach me how to make the oven work lets try some of carmens empanadas instead i tell her i dont smell any more gas in the house but id rather wait awhile to light the oven now is the time there are some answers i need and i want them before i talk to dr lynn julie why dont you bring me your treasure box you said there were some things in it that you wanted to show me id like to see them and we can talk about them im hungry julie says and in the same matteroffact voice she adds my box b in another secret place even if you look and look youll never be able to find it chapter the rain is a squall that pounds and passes mrs cardenas comes home after it has gone we sat it out in the parking lot she says i had to hear all about the problems angles daughter nina is having with her husband it wouldnt be so bad except everybody knows the story and i heard it first from carmen blue slips into sharp little corners watching me slantwise watching and waiting did everything go all right today well it must have i see you turned off the air conditioners when it cooled down good for you did you have enough for lunch i forgot to tell you theres some chocolate ice cream in the freezer section she has answered her own question but i feel i must say something we had a little trouble with the oven i tell her the pilot light wasnt on so there was gas in the house we opened all the windows and aired it out i wish i knew more about psychology right now i think julie needs stability and dr lynn would know how to help her not mrs cardenas my suspicions would only frighten mrs cardenas por supuesto i should have shown you how to light the pilot she says she begins to unbutton her blouse as she moves toward the hallway let me change clothes and well get dinner started who wants to peel potatoes i do i answer julie says ill watch so she wants to be near me good it will help me keep watch over her and so it goes through the rest of the day and on into the evening we read the first chapter of tom sawyer and she seems interested until she notices its time for cartoons on television and she insists that we watch them together shes my tagalong and after dinner she sits on her bed and watches me brush my hair i think its at least half an inch longer i take out what is left of the tiny bottle of the perfume i got for christmas and dab it on my neck and wrists i dont know what good it will do the spicy tomatoonion fragrance of the stew mrs cardenas cooked for dinner has blanketed the house it overpowers the perfume mrs cardenas pokes her head in the doorway you look very

nice mrs cardenas says you young people go out on the front porch its too stuffy in here stuffy mr cardenas says peering over the top of his newspaper then why dont you turn on the air conditioners again be quiet carlos she says mrs cardenas opens the door dave and i go outside julie with us julie dave says i bet theres something you want to watch on television i want to be with you and dina she says not this time he says let her stay dave shes so small so much alone but mrs cardenas has noticed julies absence and the door opens julie she says im making popcorn for carlos come and help me popcorn mr cardenas says you know i cant eat popcorn with these teeth mrs cardenas has pulled julie inside and the door closes sit down dave says quietly he pulls the two chairs together i thought of something i wish i could see his expression but the porch is mottled in black and moonlight and daves face is in darkness last year our high school put on the musical oliver he says you know oliver dont you i saw the movie years ago but i hated it i hated the way the children had to live i never liked dickens dont you remember the bad guy in the story was bill sikes i gasp and the woman who loved him wasnt her name we say it together nancy wait a minute memories are rushing back and she sang a song as long as he needs me oh dave thats the play julies mother was in and she took the part of nancy when was this it must have been years ago julie says when she was little her father took her to see the play what if there was something between her mother and the guy who played bill sikes what if julie just kept thinking of him as sikes her mothers name really was nancy that would fit thoughts fall into place no wonder the police couldnt trace sikes hed have another name julie told you that he fought with her father he must have threatened him or nancy maybe thats why they kept moving and had to move so fast should i tell him the rest its too long too complicated not now not until after i sort it all out not until after i talk to dr lynn im so glad you came up with this i say im going to try to get julie to open up to me tomorrow she must know things she isnt telling im hoping i can get her to confide in me he reaches over to take my hand but i stand up dave she stuck to me like butter on bread today i know shes jealous of you and the time i spend with you right now ive got to make her feel shes important to me he stands too so youre telling me to go home i dont want to but i have to he shrugs but doesnt let go of my hand theres one thing more i went to the library this morning and i read whatever i could find in back issues of magazines and newspapers about hodgkins disease and leukemia and other kinds of cancer do you know how much progress theyre making dina do you know theyre finding new things every day that your chances keep getting better youve got to want to fight how many knights were eaten before one of them finally killed the dragon how many but his mouth is over mine and i respond until i remember that its not fair no dave i tug away from him my voice is hoarse and ive forgotten what else i was going to say dina dont hate yourself i back away reaching for the doorknob but i cant help it i do theres no time for him to answer im inside the door leaning against it trembling i dont want to talk about it dave doesnt understand how i feel i wish with all my heart that he could understand mrs cardenas looks up from her bowl of popcorn wheres dave he had to go home before he had some popcorn the whole world is not waiting for popcorn mr cardenas says and he turns the television sound up what did dave want to talk to you about julie asks this is a good program i tell her as i sit on the floor if we talk well spoil it before i go to bed i get out my stationery box its just where i had left it i prop myself against the pillow box on my knees sheet of pink stationery on the box dear holley jo the only words on the paper i met this really super guy named dave tonight but i dont want to tell holley jo about the way i feel for a while i need to keep all this to myself i put the box on the floor and turn out the light holley jo holley jo once again ill slip away and glide up the road and through the walls and into the green and yellow room but tonight it doesnt work tonight until i sleep i hold the smell of daves skin and the feel of daves lips tonight i dont want to go away in the morning mrs cardenas says its a beautiful day she puts a bowl of cereal before me and passes me a stack of buttered slices of raisin toast the kitchen window is wide open the air holds the memory of the rainstorm and its sharp and sweet this is a good day to take a walk i can get julie out of the house get her to a place where we can talk without anyone overhearing julie we havent walked to the lake yet why dont we go this morning morning is a good time to begin things to plan things even to end things before the day weaves itself into a heavy mass of problems and concerns julie gulps down a swallow of orange juice why dont we go to the zoo her question takes me by surprise because the zoo is too far away to walk you promised to take me to the zoo and you didnt dave said hed take us but we planned that for the future julie takes a bite of toast ive never ridden on an elephant more than anything in the world i want to ride on the elephant at the zoo you said i could be reasonable how could we get to the zoo you can drive dina mrs cardenas could let us use her car julie but mrs cardenas gives julie a fond look i suppose i could do that we have to be careful of gas you know it costs a lot now but this one time the zoo isnt far i wish julie hadnt done this im sorry mrs cardenas she shouldnt have asked we can wait until dave takes us julie is looking at mrs cardenas with eyes that are so pleading she reminds me of a miserable waif begging for pennies i want a chance to talk to julie not the distractions of the zoo its okay mrs cardenas says ill pack you a picnic lunch and give you some spending money for the zoo and the little train please dont i tell her we can go another rime no no dont worry now is a good time its going to be a nice day not too hot no more rain she rinses off plates as she talks stacking them on the drainboard the weatherman on tv said so and i believe it even though hes usually wrong you know arturos jimmy would make a better weatherman because ever since he broke his arm in a baseball game he can tell if its going to rain she begins to putter in and out of the refrigerator putting together a lunch for us julie is pleased well maybe this will put her in a good mood it might be for the best ill need her cooperation to get the right answers if you go early it isnt too crowded mrs cardenas says so finish your breakfast then get the map and ill show you how to get there mrs cardenas gives me other instructions before we leave be back before three oclock a woman is coming here to check things out she has some papers to sign and she wants to talk to both of you well be here i tell her and i climb behind the wheel tucking the lunch bag on the floor next to me julie gets in carefully holding a paper sack im watching streets so its not until we are past mccullough that i notice the paper sack is folded and on the floor on her lap julie holds her treasure box oh julie stares up at me and i say you brought the box im glad are you going to show me some of the things in it yes she says today is the rime i lean forward following signs heres a turnoff zoo over on the left there we go up the road look julie horses to ride did you ever ride a horse no theyre too big i dont want to did you ever ride ponies my father took me for pony rides a lot when i was little she isnt very big now she sits stiffly on the seat dinging to her faded dented treasure box and i feel a pang of tenderness toward her so many mixedup problems but i know dr lynn will be able to help her around the curve to the right we must be entering the park from a back road we pass the train tracks and a small train that is chugging along julie stares out the window i want to ride on that train theres lots of rime why dont we find a nice quiet place for a talk and you can show me the things in your treasure box not until after we ride on the train and the elephant to the left is the entrance to the zoo i park the car julie slides her treasure box under the seat well lock the car she says shes in charge all the way the best thing i can do is go along with her plans she chooses the train first and i buy the tickets at the little station we sit together in a car with a pinkstriped canopy top placketyplacketyplacketyplackety over the rails chugging and humming to the next station around the park there are the horses again look julie a squirrel back to the station around in a circle i wish dave were with us we walk up the incline to the zoo pay our admission and go inside there is so much to see find out where the elephants are julie says i want to go right to the elephants its her zoo her show why did it have to be today whats on her mind i cant even guess there is the elephant with a platform of sorts on his back and there is the line for the ride i buy julie a ticket and she has already claimed her place in line that looks like fun i tell her ive never ridden an elephant she says so solemnly that its hard to keep from smiling finally its her turn and she climbs up to join the other children in the carrier strapped to the elephants back she twists to look at me and i smile and wave at her she waves once then turns to face forward the elephant begins to move its a short trip around the compound her group climbs off as another group climbs on most of the children run to their mothers but julie walks to me still solemn something very much on her mind now lets have lunch she says but you havent seen the rest of the zoo i rode on the elephant thats all i wanted to do are you sure because once we go out we cant go in without paying again come on dina she says taking my hand and leading me back the way we had come picnic tables are scattered among the oak trees near the parking lot i carry the lunch from the car and spread it out on a table deep in shade julie carries her treasure box sandwiches bananas apples and oatmeal cookies how does mrs cardenas expect us to eat all this theres a thermos of lemonade and some paper cups i pour the lemonade and put a cup before julie who climbs on the bench next to me she munches on a cookie and gulps the lemonade maybe its too early i tell her im just not hungry id rather talk all right julie says she moves her empty cup aside and puts the treasure box in its place she struggles for a moment with the metal lid then pulls it off this rime she places the lid to one side there are not many things in the box there is a small doll some seashells a picture postcard of sarasota and another with a scene of sand dunes spiked with sea grass julie holds up an inexpensive gilded chain see i told you i had a gold chain she says my father gave it to me i remember you said you could put your jade ring on it her fingers are bare julie what happened to the ring she doesnt look at me i lost it the pink glass dog is in the box but she moves it aside and takes out a newspaper clipping from a tulsa paper its a picture of a pretty brunette woman dressed in a ragged costume a man is standing beside her but the paper has been torn on a diagonal so his face is gone thats when my mother was in the play oliver julie says shes beautiful i read the caption nancy gambrell as nancy and william kaines as bill sikes julie im confused this says that william kaines but i thought your fathers name was william kaines no thats not my fathers name your name is julie kaines its not its julie gambrell but in the hospital they called you julie kaines for a moment she looks bewildered no they didnt they just called me julie thats all i stare at her they took it for granted no one ever asked you your last name a serrated leaf spirals down on the paper and i brush it away then the man in the car wasnt your father of course not she says i examine the yellowed clipping in my hands julie why is the photograph in the newspaper torn i tore off his head she says i hate bill sikes chapter i think wed better talk about sikes i say slowly you havent seen everything in the box yet she answers she pushes it toward me again she calmly takes command there are two more snapshots with a background of trees and a pond the figures are small a young man and a young woman the man is holding a very young child with windblown silver for hair julie hands them to me this is you with your parents julie nods again i look at the photo of her father you look so much like him what was his name gordon peter gambrell tell me more about your parents tell me about your mother but julie doubles over and holds her stomach i feel sick dina it must be the lemonade and cookie too much sugar i should have made sure you ate a sandwich first no i felt sick before i ate you didnt say anything about it i thought it would go away ill take you home right now im up and packing the lunch back in the bag julie curls into a little ball and moans do you want to go to the restroom i want to go to the hospital but julie it occurs to me that might be a good idea if i took her home mrs cardenas would have to call the doctor and wed probably end up taking julie to see him this way she can be checked immediately and if it is serious shell have good care and i can try to talk to dr lynn its more important now than ever that i talk to dr lynn julie must be feeling terrible she doesnt seem to care about her treasure box i pack her things in carefully and snap the lid shut if you can stand up ill try to carry you i can walk just help me we struggle up the slight hill my arms are filled with the bag of food the treasure box and julie heres the car just a minute ill get the door open she leans heavily against me and i nearly fall i want to lie down in the backseat she says id feel better about it if you were in the front seat with me you can put your head on my lap no please julie get in the front seat ill get sick it would be all over you as though shes proving her point she retches the important thing is to get julie to the hospital so i open the back door here you go can you manage to get in let me help she lies on the seat curling into a ball knees almost to her chin her eyes squeezed shut hurry up dina she says i scramble into the drivers seat drop the keys fumble them into the ignition and guide the car from the parking lot how do we get out of the park theres a sign broadway i know that will take me to hildebrand as we pull onto broadway she says you have to go on the freeway to get to the hospital dont you yes i try to see her in the rearview mirror but shes too low will that bother you its faster i want you to drive fast ill do the best i can are you in pain she doesnt answer just makes little mewling noises at the stoplight i check the map again to get my bearings hildebrand to i okay julie i say trying to sound confident well be on the freeway in a few minutes and then its not far to the hospital theres not much traffic on i this rime of day and its moving at a fairly fast clip i try to keep my speed around sixty but im nervous each time julie gives a little moan my foot becomes heavier on the accelerator i swing around a pickup truck pulling into the right lane ahead of him and realize im going much too fast so i pull it down to sixty again theres a movement in my rearview mirror and i look into it startled julie looks back at me shes sitting right behind me leaning on the back of my seat are you feeling better i ask her i have to tell you something she says sure julie what is it i hated sikes because he killed my father and ran away taking my mother and me with him and i hated him more when he hurt me and i hated nancy because she didnt stop him oh julie you said you would stay with me dina you promised and then i found out that you didnt mean it that youre going to die and leave me all alone so i hate you too listen julie its not like that i when the car crashed we were all supposed to die sikes and nancy and me sikes is angry because i didnt julie lets talk to dr lynn she can help you do you know how i did it i put my arm around sikess neck like this my head is jerked back theres a steel vise around my windpipe i cant breathe i cant see i slam on the brakes and julie flies forward against me breaking her grip there is a loud screech of tires behind us i grapple with julie pulling her into the front seat and at the same time i brace myself waiting for the crash but instead the door on julies side is flung open and someone dives into the car he grabs julie trying to pull her away from me put on your brake he yells i manage to get the car into park and yank the keys from the ignition for a few moments we are a tangle of struggling bodies in the front seat when i can manage to look up still gasping for breath he is on his knees wedged between the dashboard and the front seat pinning julie down hes a fairly young man black felt western hat shoved to the back of his head i saw what happened from my pickup he says then your car went all over the road sure give you credit for smarts girl or else dumb luck now we got to get us off this damn freeway an eighteenwheeler pulls up in front of us the driver comes back to check then runs to his truck and radios for help it doesnt take long for a police car to arrive she needs a doctor i tell them oh please help her and i give the nearest policeman some of julies background information detective macgarvey will know all about it julie doesnt cry she doesnt make a sound she just stares at me dont hate me julie i tell her look ill take care of your treasure box for you ill put it in the closet at mrs cardenass house and keep it for you until you want it again but she doesnt answer its an hour and many questions later when dr lynn and dr paull come together into the small brown office where ive been waiting im so glad to see them that i lean against dr lynn holding her tightly macgarvey has called and given them most of the story after all that you drove here to the police station by yourself dr paull asks i followed the police car its funny but i cant remember much about it i wonder what happened to the man in the pickup truck the policemen must have his name ill have to call mrs cardenas i add detective macgarvey did that for you detective macgarvey comes into the room now were getting somewhere he says ive been matching descriptions given by robbery victims in a number of nearby states and they seem to add up to william kaines it looks like he committed a couple of robberies here in the city a week before he died in that car crash did you find out if he murdered julies father she had that story wrong he says maybe her mother told her that her father was dead maybe she jumped to the wrong conclusion about three years ago a gordon p gambrell was taken to a hospital in tulsa oklahoma pretty badly beaten after a fight she said sikes fought with her father i interrupt when gambrell got out of the hospital his family was gone there was something put out on his wife and child but that information wasnt on the computer printout i got on kaines last week can you call her father tell him about julie he nods it might take a day or two to track him down but well let him know julie is here in san antonio the question ive been so afraid to ask they wont arrest her for murder will they dr lynn puts an arm tightly around my shoulders julie will get the help she needs isnt that right mr macgarvey itll come down to that he says he gives me a pat on the shoulder if you want to go home now you can he shakes hands with dr paull and strides from the room can we sit here for just a few minutes i ask them im still shaking inside of course dr lynn says julies doctor is with her now it will be a little while before theyll let me talk to her we settle on the bench one of them on each side of me theres something else i have to tell you i say about julie about me i was fighting for my life we heard about that dr paull says it must have been a terrifying experience you arent listening to what im saying i tell him i was fighting to stay alive when it came right down to it i must have wanted to live dr lynn grips my hand tightly ive decided to work at those odds i say i suppose ive been doing it all along but i couldnt see beyond the anger good for you dr paull says then he gives kind of a scratchy little cough and takes my other hand dr lynn smiles at me why dont we drive up next weekend so you can give this news to your friend holley jo she asks id love to i answer and can i bring someone with me his name is dave
