 london there would be no warning i knew that in the total darkness i thought i could see things the glint of his eyes his bared teeth and in the silence i thought i could hear his breath and the soft tentative padding of his feet as he looked for me but all i saw and heard was in my imagination and i knew that soon my nerves were going to start playing up because of the worry the worry that thered be no warning when he came at me hed come the instant he found me breathing was difficult because this place wasnt very big and we were so close that one drawn breath would be a giveaway also it would have to be expelled before the next inhalation and i was afraid of being caught with empty lungs i breathed tidally right near the top part of my conscious mind registering the smell of hemp and coconut it was worse than id thought the waiting there was nothing to go on no means of orientation he was only a man but he was invisible and inaudible and these were the attributes of a phantom and my scalp was raised it neednt be true that he was where i thought he was somewhere in front of me where my hands could get at him even in the dark theres comfort if the enemy can be faced the real dread is of being taken from behind that was where he came for me from behind we hadnt touched we had simply come so close that the instincts were triggered and the nerves galvanised and i was already in a throatlock with my knees buckling to a flat kick before i could hook at him but my hands were free and i caught him and reached his thumb as we pitched down breaking the hold while he used his foot again and missed and tried again and connected a fraction too late his breath grunting as i forced him over we fought close neither wanting to lose the other in the unnerving dark my shoulder hit the wall and i used the chance going down low and recoiling against him but the momentum wasnt enough and he deadened the spring and forced me into a spinebending yoshida that paralysed the arms then some fool came in and switched the light on kimura helped me up with his usual courtesy and we touched palms and looked for our towels it was good he said no i said it wasnt i wiped at the sweat trying not to worry i shouldnt have let him throw that deadly yoshida so soon when he was fresh enough to follow it through it had left the plexus exposed and he could have killed me within the next five seconds if hed wanted to a straight chop to the heart from under the ribs it was all right here in the gym but it wouldnt be all right one day in some backstreet in buenos aires or wherever the hell id be when it happened again cant you i asked stevens shut that bloody door interrupted did i he turned and shut the fog out pushing his face into his handkerchief again hed come up to norfolk for a routine dose of what they call refresher and then caught a streaming cold before they could start work on him he was better off anyway because refresher is the course where the instructors break every bone in your body unless you can giggle them out of it it was only the wall kimura told me he knew i was worried i heard you go into it and assumed you would make use of it you see he nodded his reassuring smiles at me towelling the sweat off his small ivorycoloured body under the wiremeshed lamps the swordscar looked deep mauve running from one shoulder to the top of his shorts like a zipfastener you can not execute such a rebound you see without leaving the abdomen unprotected but of course you would have extricated yourself from my yoshida if this gentleman had not appeared i didnt think so london old boy stevens stood like a forlorn penguin mopping at his beak kim was pretending to lack one of the coconut mats straight where wed been milling about i said dont worry you made your point the next time i get near a wall i shant leave myself open to a yoshida that do you he nodded quickly pleased he took his job seriously and if a report came in that somebodyd been found with their neck at the wrong angle in the chainlocker of a reykjavikbound bananaboat he liked to feel it wasnt his fault he went across to the showers walking like an independently sprung tiger what i asked stevens a bruise was developing on the upper right arm and id taken care kimura shouldnt notice it because his chief conceit is that whatever he does to you he never leaves a mark the other instructors arent so proud and we always look like a bunch of bitteneared alleycats while were at norfolk london wants you he was putting in his time as a dutyrunner till he was fit enough for beating up on the phone in the flesh stuff london message understood he drifted dismally away in a nimbus of vicks vapour rub in the showers kim said also one must narrow the eyes you see in the dark and not stare about like that with the eyes half closed vision is only a little reduced but the shine on the eyeballs is much less easy to discern it was civil of him not to point out that this was how hed come up from behind me he knew i was worried about that as well all right ill remember ahhaha he sang through the steam in approval much as mum does when wee willie hits the potty first time i was getting fed up hed pulled off a first at the tokyo games and we werent expected to reach that standard but we werent expected to be shown up as amateurs either i spun the taps to full cold and he noted the change in the noise also one must finish off with warm water you see following a trainingbout since the muscles require to relax in london the fog was worse and even the pigeons were feeling the cold huddling in rows along the windowsills below me a long stain of light crept through whitehall the traffic nosetotail ill take you in now so it wasnt parkis he always keeps you hanging about to stop you getting ideas above your station you never know who youre going to see when youre wanted in london because the bureau doesnt officially exist and if theres ever been a door here marked information its been wallpapered over she led me upstairs her snagged heels ricketing on the rubber strips that were peeling away from the treads on a landing i saw fyson going into reports still looking a bit nervy about the eyes someones bright little op had come unstuck in israel so wed all heard and they were being flown home those who were left this wasnt the room with the lowry and the smell of polish it was originally a dormitory i suppose right under the mansard roof the kind of place where the little frilled domestics had hacked at their lungspots through the winters of the nineteenth century there hadnt been much progress egerton was rubbing chilblain ointment into his raw blue hands when i came in and looked up rather guiltily as if discovered in the enactment of a mystic rite ah yes he said vaguely and fitted the lid back on to the tin an opaque grey panel showed where the window was its grime and the fog outside filtering whatever daylight was still in the sky a single bulb in a white porcelain shade dangled from a flex looped in paperclips to keep it out of the way we might have been at the bottom of a mine shaft egerton gestured to the only chair for visitors an incongruous louis quinze with little yellow puffs of stuffing exposed to the wan light id only seen egerton twice before on any kind of real business and each time it had been in this room he was a thin and tiredlooking man his eyes weathered by too many winters of inclement thought his mouth still slightly twisted from the shock of his first disillusionment whenever that had come it was said his wife had committed suicide during one of their seaside holidays at frinton and that the smell of a certain suntan oil made him physically sick but then he might always have looked like this a vessel of despair and that might be why shed done it facts are short at the bureau where nobodys meant to exist so rumours are a prime necessity of the resident staff how was norfolk foggy he smiled thinly we always consider we have a monopoly here sorry to have fetched you away his voice was beautifully modulated an actors voice i expect youve heard what happened in gaza a wheel came off of course he hadnt got a hope they were still flying them in what was left of them and if they meant to send a second wave to mop up the mess they could count me out i was strictly a shadow executive under contract for solo missions and these paramilitary stunts werent in my field nobodys fault he shrugged policy is changing from day to day there was a time once to plan things properly but now there seems a need for hurry so instead of picking quietly at the lock we just hurl a brick at the window and grab at whatever happens to be in reach he was talking about intelligence even when parkis or mildmay threw in a scratch hitandrun unit with clearance on explosives it was still purely an intelligence operation or the bureau wouldnt be handling it at all egerton said with a note of concession of course that kind of exercise isnt in your area no but policy affects everyone really it didnt sound very good and i began digging my heels in but the trouble was that egerton was already softening up the ground i was digging them into he was control not bureau a mission director not admin but if hed fetched me down from norfolk to give me a job it looked as if id have been better off up there as a daily breakfast for kimura you can always refuse a mission its in the contract but you cant ever judge the odds because when they send you in its in the dark we dont mind that we know wed be scared stiff by the size and scope of a big operation if we could see the overall picture and all we want is our own little box of matches to play with in the corner while the boys at the top work out how to stop the whole house going up if we make a mistake but it means you cant assess a mission at the outset so you dont know whether youre accepting a job thats going to blow up in your hands because of someone elses incompetence or refusing one that could turn out a real classic last year dewhurst nearly refused a dull routine investigation of a hijack attempt on board a pakistan international airlines boeing and finished up three weeks later jumping the roumanian frontier at orsova with shortrange shots of the heavywater installations north of piatra that everyone had thought was a sugarbeet processing complex you can never tell all i could tell at the moment was that if egerton had a mission for me he was quite certain i wouldnt like it and all i could hope was that hed be wrong because i wanted one it affects training he said particularly he meant policy did people are being hustled into sensitive areas without preliminary experience even in minor operations im not talking he looked at me quickly about this unfortunate debacle in gaza no he was in his dead eyes i could see two red sparks the reflections of the little electric fire with its cracked insulators that was perched on a pile of splitspined encyclopedias near my chair to a limited degree we can resist these dangerous changes in policy or at least avert some of their dangerous results when the telephone rang he didnt look at it for a moment as if deciding not to answer it then he picked up the receiver the ointment gleaming on his knuckles yes all i could hear was a name gilchrist from the speaker but egerton was saying sharply couldnt they he tilted his narrow head back as he listened his eyes cast down ill go and talk to his wife dont let her get the news from anyone else warn matthews particularly they were close friends he put the receiver down and said with slight irritation they shouldnt get married its inconsiderate where was i a small cracked watt fire like this would never get the chill out of egertons room i thought they must have been after something pretty serious to throw in a man like gilchrist id never liked him but hed been first class so had lovett only last year in hanover id liked lovett we seemed to be getting a bit too cheap changes in policy i said averting dangerous results yes he studied his shiny hands weve just taken on someone new long live the king i said he looked at me quickly but there was no reproof in his tone hes not replacing gilchrist hes too young and hes been given his first mission before hes had time to feel his way carefully he said that is my opinion unfortunately its for me to send him out the exercise isnt inherently dangerous but you know better than i do how easily things can turn awkward no i thought i wont bloody well play he was hunched over his clasped hands as if without any heat of their own they could warm each other his name is merrick good background in the foreign office he was in prague as an assistant attachй during august and was deeply affected by events there he is now with a different embassy and is at present here in london on sick leave following a slight accident his father is sir walford merrick an equerry of the queens household would you like some tea not really i got out of the chair not wanting to sit there while he tried to truss me up in the raw chill here i felt suffocated by the deadness of his eyes and the smoothly intoned innuendoes and the way hed thrown the epitaph across the wreath its inconsiderate look i asked him have you got a mission for me no well its time somebody had ive been out for nearly three months and im going to seed thats why i thought you might like a little trip abroad where to durban would be all right or mexico anywhere out of this freezing hole warsaw christ in winter it would be convenient i know if we could choose its all id get out of it a bit of sunshine send him far enough south and ill do what you want ill go with him and hold his hand he didnt say anything maybe i was raising my voice too much you dont do that till you start feeling youre on a loser among all the stuff on his desk i could see my dossier and among all the things it said in there was the fact that i spoke a bit of polish not many of us do its like stuffing your tongue in a jar of used razor blades i quietened down so that hed know i wasnt worried that i wasnt going youll have to find someone else he waited five seconds and then said you neednt decide immediately not for a few hours yet hours you called me in a bit late didnt you everyone else has refused i looked away it wasnt in my dossier or if it was it was written between the lines that was where hed been busily reading it said if you want to find quiller look for the man who stands facing the wrong way in the bus queue just to show the world he can do without a bus look for the man who wants the window open when everyone else wants it shut the awkward bastard whos going to kill himself one day trying to prove hes bullet proof and if you want him for a job that hed normally throw back in your face tell him that everyone else has refused it i was looking at the little electric fire the coiled filament had broken in two or three places and someone probably egerton had twisted the ends together the joins were glowing brightly absorbing so much of the current that the rest of the filament wasnt more than cherry red i knew he wouldnt speak next what sort of mission have you given him nothing complicated the phone rang again and he said yes to someone and hung up i havent met him yet myself he was rather wished on to me he sat back now his donnish head tilted to watch me the chilblains made red cobbles on the blue skin of his hands and i thought vaguely that as soon as id gone he would get up and hold them near the fire again thats why im really most grateful to you for helping me out really most grateful you havent met him yet not yet i want you to go and see him first and size him up hes been fully screened of course and given general briefing on security then ill arrange for the three of us to talk before you fly out where do i find him personnel section foreign office he got up as i took my gloves off the arm of the chair you dont want this little chore i know but dont blame merrick youre a veteran and hes only a raw recruit dont break the poor little devil up merrick i filled in the green card p k longstreet to see g r merrick by appointment thank you mr longstreet the hall had the dusty acoustics of a cathedral the security doorkeeper at the desk by the stairs watched me nibbling on a fingernail mr merrick please the two other girls stared disinterestedly at the doors will you try and find him hes got a visitor i went to the doors and came back im sorry to keep you waiting but he doesnt seem to be in are you sure there was hes in ill go on up im afraid you cant go up without an escort we have to the doorkeeper was out of his desk as i reached the stairs and i showed him my pass it took a couple of seconds to register because this one wasnt seen too often this was the one that could get you into the houses of parliament with a barrel under your arm even if the green card said g fawkes i went up the stairs and turned left merrick must have been in the lav when shed rung because he was back in personnel when i got there twentyfour medium height brown hair blue eyes heavy spectacle frames recent scar left hand a slight accident egerton had told me there were a few other people in the room and merricks desk was near the door a girl in a lemon blouse looked in and said oh there you are visitor for you in the hall hed seen me and said yes hes here thank you she gave me a pert blink well that was quick someone on a phone was saying if i were you id put mrs pymm on to it shell sort it out if anyone can where do we talk i asked merrick im not quitesure he was standing behind the desk his long fingers shifting some papers to no purpose his slightly magnified eyes watching me nervously come on then yes he followed me out catching his foot against something i think theres one of the undersecretaries at a conference this afternoon so i suppose we could use his room its just along here i sensed him watching me obliquely so i said worst bloody winter since he worked it out as quickly as he could and then took it straight from the book in my paper it said since you mean oh yes by the tone of his voice he was kicking himself it wasnt important here and now but as the years go by you learn to worry less about the mistakes youve made and more about what would have happened if the circumstances had made them important the code introduction for th to th was to throw in a random twodigit number and listen for one below and two above the same thing in london rio or hong kong wherever you were and whatever you were doing it made the whole thing simple hed put in the circumspect from sheer nerves he tapped on a door and there was no answer so we went in very lush carpet and solicitors office furniture and a portrait of the queen and a small photograph suitably half concealed by a filing cabinet an overexposed long shot with plenty of camera shake girl on a horse egerton should have a room like this but what would he do with it plug in a beatup watt fire and crouch over it with his miseries how long have you been in warsaw six months it was said quickly he was going to get everything right from now on he sat forward in the other chair watching me very directly and breathing on his nerves i went out in how longs your tour a year where were you before in prague then there was a home posting before i you were there during the prague spring yes isnt it unusual to get posted to another moscowcontrolled country the next time out i asked for the post why i was very affected by what happened in prague i liked the people there i made a lot of friends he took something out of his pocket it looks like happening all over again this time in warsaw it was an atomiser and he pumped it into his mouth excuse me he said so you want to be there all over again well yes i no wonder youve got asthma he stopped pumping and put the thing away and said rather sulkily if the poles can win their freedom id like to be there itd be something to remember wouldnt it a thing like that were you born in england yes you cant enter the diplomatic service unless englishmen dont think much about freedom well no but thats because theyve got it isnt it i wondered what sort of freedom merrick hadnt got it was no good asking him he wouldnt know itd be below the conscious level but hed tell me if i listened i said youve made friends there too in warsaw yes a few a few friends they in the underground well i mean almost everyones in the underground people of that age my age students oh no well a few but theyre mostly engineers or shop assistants people like that you have to work you see if you want to eat some of them have more than one job doing night shifts as well just to get enough money for food and clothes especially in winter whats the general drift of things out there merrick he leaned forward his long hands chopping at the air theres been tension ever since the prague spring there was a lot of sympathy for the czechs of course and now the underground forces are becoming quite organised this is known and a few months ago the authorities started trying to soften up the workers by leniency all round less checking of sickness reports at the factories smaller fines for indiscipline lighter sentences for stealing state property that kind of thing a shade triurnphantly he said with another chop of his hands well it didnt work whats the aim of these candlelight crusaders youve been running with wreck the talks he drew back into his chair theyre not just a lot of irresponsible students their aim is to bring russia to the brink thats quite a serious intention dont you think could be serious yes for them the other side of any brink is a long drop and if russia goes down shell take poland with her dont they know that their aim he said slowly reading from the dogeared manifesto theyd been waving at him in the cellars out there is to overthrow the present regime and set up a truly national government hi tune for the eastwest talks to take place in a free poland theyre cutting it fine the west german delegates were due in warsaw on the rd today was the th id put it a different way theyre completing their preparations you said it was known so what chance have they got on the defensive again he said quickly its one thing for the authorities to know of widespread dissension and another thing to stop it exploding in their face theyve withdrawn the lenient measures designed to keep people calm while the talks are on theyre trying the other tack now stronger discipline heavy sentences suppressive control of private life in the clear eyes behind the glasses burned the zeal of the convert and that wont work either i got up and looked at the queens rather mona lisa smile as a change from looking at merricks face shining with its secondhand ideals correction they werent secondhand no they were superimposed on someone elses if the poles ever got free something was going to get free inside merrick if it doesnt work i told him over my shoulder then moscow will find something that will didnt you say you were in prague for gods sake this is different i heard him get up and start wandering about there are the talks this time moscow wants them to succeed i expect youve read it doesnt matter what ive read i could hear him pumping the damned thing again then he swallowed and said well thats why theres a brink the actions been planned for three days before the opening of the talks and if moscow orders tanks into the city there wont be any talks russias been trying to make the world forget prague ever since it happened and shell remind us in a big way if she does it again but if she doesnt resort to armed force this time itll mean a new government overnight whichever way she moves shell lose when i turned away from the portrait he was staring at me so i told him what he wanted to hear hurrah poland is saved well theyve got to do something havent christ theyre not expecting a wave of arrests are they by any chance how many brave little soldiers of freedom dyou think therell be left to start this action of theirs a week before the talks half the population of warsaws going to be in a strict regime camp in the urals dont they realise whats it called this action got a name numbly he said just the action czyn his long scrubbed schoolboys hands hung by his sides sticking from his sleeves as if hed not finished growing out of his suit but the defiance was still there behind the shine on his glasses and i knew that whatever i said it wouldnt knock the bright god czyn off his pedestal how did you get into this game merrick im not really in it theyre just friends ive made i dont mean their game ours i was watching him and he wasnt bad they couldnt have had time in a crash course to train him to this pitch of instant reaction concealment and ninety per cent of it must have been n his makeup perhaps this was one of the things that had appealed to whoever had wished this boy on to egerton thered been the slightest flicker across the eyes gone now and it was only experience that had let me sense that my question had opened a wound i went on watching im not sure he said the tone was all right too almost steady but this was why egerton had told me not to break the poor little devil up because it was easy and you could do it without even trying i suppose its a chance for me to help them in secret then he was saying quickly as the thought surfaced from below the conscious level even my father doesnt know this was the freedom that merrick hadnt got i said of course not but im not used to well privacy must find it refreshing he nodded yes i turned away what are your orders for this trip dont you know it doesnt matter what i know im to find out everything i can about czyn and pass it to london surely youre meant to be helping me arent you he sounded uneasy how much training did they give you two weeks if you include all right i turned and looked through the window at the trees in the park their black lacework of branches between the fogyellowed lamps half masked the pale reflected face that stared at me and waited two weeks there was time once to plan things properly its no go egerton you cant do it you cant send this kid out there in the dark without even a candle or if you want to do it then i wont bloody well help you i suppose he said as cheerfully as he could that doesnt sound very long but i took it all in and they told me id done rather well his lips moved on the glass his voice came from the trees out there the dark trees i wont let you down above the haze of the skyline there were vast clouds gathering coming in from the north some people said it could snow tonight there are a few things i said they wont have told you i didnt turn round his eyes had shifted from me to my reflection they probably told you that just as a war is an extension of politics espionage is an extension of diplomacy the idea is to find out the things you cant find out by asking someone at a conference table the things nobody will ever tell you the things everybody badly needs to know its a means of keeping the peace like the bomb is no one can chuck the bomb without getting it back on his head and no one can start a conventional war because the enemys already within his gates ferreting around and exposing all his plans before he can put them into action it doesnt always work the pressure gets too high now and then but it works more often than people ever know the balance has got to be kept between one half of the world and the other east and west so that the whole thing doesnt blow up thats what were for were the angels of peace see how we shine that what they told you he watched me from the dark i said it doesnt matter what they didnt tell you is that once youre in this game youre on your own you dont do what you do for the sake of your country or for peace though you can kid yourself you do it to scratch an itch thats all im not talking about the ones who do it for the money theyre just whores most of us do it because we dont get a kick out of watching the telly and pushing a pen and washing the mini on sunday mornings we want to get outside of all that be on our own so we can work off our scabby neuroses without getting arrested for it we want to scratch that itch till it bleeds as i turned away from the window his face opened in surprise he looked more vulnerable at this moment than id ever seen a man perhaps because in my trade the men i meet have long since grown a shell the years and the deceits and the betrayals adding to it layer by layer until they want to get out and know they cant because its themselves theyve been deceiving and betraying over all those years the shell grows from the inside outwards like fingernails the thing is merrick i dont think youre the type you make friends too easily you like people too much you dont want to cross the line and live your life outside society because societys made of people and youd have to shut yourself away cut yourself off values are different out there let a man show friendship for you and youve got to deny him mistrust him suspect him and nine times out of ten youll be wrong but its the tenth time thatll save you from a dirty death in a cheap hotel because youd opened the door to a man you thought was a friend out there youll be alone and youll have no one you can trust not even the people who are running you not even me because if you make the wrong kind of mistake at the wrong time in the wrong place and look like fouling up the mission and exposing the network then theyll throw you to the dogs and so win i his hand had moved twice to his pocket while id been talking and twice had stopped but his breathing was painful now and he swung away and perked the thing out and squeezed it his back to me it was almost silent the improved model designed exclusively for people of discretion who prefer not to embarrass their friends excuse me he said on my way out i told him think it well over theres just enough time weve got a rendezvous in the morning eight oclock at clive steps i hope you wont turn up warsaw they looked like this when thered been a military coup detat and theyd been hustled out of the cells and stood against a wall the only concession a handkerchief across their eyes if they wanted one this was how i remembered him on clive steps standing perfectly still and perfectly straight in his neat dark coat the first light seeping from a leaky sky and striking across his glasses how long had he been here his face was white with cold with nerves long enough to make sure i didnt turn up a minute early and go away again in the hope of getting rid of him by saying look first he bungled the codeintro and then he missed the rendezvous so im not taking him out there hes inefficient well its your funeral i said we didnt talk much along the mall except when i asked him what his polish was like i took the advanced exams before i was posted there i suppose he wanted me to throw him a biscuit for that we walked quickly because of the cold and i took him into piccadilly to use up some of the time the mist clung to our coats just after hamilton place a bus went by pulling away from the kerb and i nipped on to it giving him room to follow are we late not really the conductor was still on the upper deck when we got off and i took him north and went left along curzon street crossing into the park i heard the taxi slowing from behind us before wed reached marble arch the door came open and i got in first so that hed have to use the tipup seat and face the rear which was what egerton had wanted you realise he said to merrick in slow modulated tones that you are first and foremost a second secretary at the embassy just as you were before this is very important he had dark glasses on which was why he wanted merrick to face him the whole time weve no concessions on the part of the embassy enabling you to behave as anyone other than a member of her majestys foreign service careful in conduct and unimpeachable in character let me put it this way we would rather go short of the information youll be seeking than risk upsetting the ambassador by exposing yourself to criticism on iris part or to suspicion on the part of the local authorities the taxi was keeping in the slow lane rounding towards lancaster gate egertons hands were folded on his lap the ointment leaving dark patches on his gloves and merrick watched him steadily a little disturbed at not being able to see his eyes you should also bear it well in mind that there must be no exchange of confidence between yourself and the people youll be dealing with confidence will be entirely on their side nor must you lead them to feel that the united kingdom is in any way prepared to assist them in whatever projects they have in mind morally physically officially or unofficially you must not even let them infer that such is the case from anything you say and if you think that despite your caution they have so inferred then you must negate it he studied merrick in silence for a bit is that perfectly understood yes sir we went down towards the serpentine and got snarled up twice in a pack of traffic while i listened to egerton briefing him paramount importance of security limited and circumspect use of protected communications attitude if apprehended so forth their methods of interrogation as you know are less charitable than in the west you must therefore avoid any risk of their taking you into custody as far as is possible you will have mr longstreet in support of course but dont allow your benefit of his greater experience to minimise in your mind the real hazards youll be exposed to merrick was quite good sitting to attention on the tipup and never looking away from the dark glasses even when the taxi gave a lurch hed heard all this from the instructors and egerton knew that but he wanted to tell the boy himself frighten him with the softgloved phrases that would bring his imagination into play instead of blunting it with overexplicitness the slightly magnified blue eyes held steady as he listened northwards from hyde park corner we found a clear run and got up speed for fifty yards before a doubledecker blocked us off again baronet with the tip that filters everything but the flavour no after effects egerton was asking no sir i spoke for the first time what was it exactly merrick looked at me and then quickly away i slipped on the snow and a tram nearly got me warsaw yes you werent i said pushed or anything oh no i slipped egerton didnt turn his head why did you ask him that i dont know how deep hes got into things out there he could have found out a bit too much merrick said prissily those people are my friends dont trust them dont walk too near the kerb and the next time you keep a rendezvous with me make sure youre clean is that a lot to askgratuitous of course telling him in front of his director but i was suddenly fed up with his harping on people being his friends one fine day hed trust a friend too many and next time theyd make sure ms head went right under the wheel egerton asked when did this happen this morning we had to jump on a bus merrick was leaning forward you mean we were being followed just watch it in warsaw egerton said youre quite certain longstreet am i what he folded his gloved hands accepting the rebuke i said the fos lousy with tags always has been they hang about like tarts yes never mind merrick youre only just out of training after all the bus in front got moving again and at marble arch we dropped mm off egerton just saying hed be kept informed the poor little tick started looking behind him as soon as hed got out you mustnt expect too much at this stage i dont expect anything now that youve seen him dyou still want me to take him out there they didnt have time to give him more than a token training as im sure you its not only that hes the worst agent material ive ever set eyes on idealistic unstable and a bag of nerves i suppose you know hes got asthma do you its in ms report he said rather tartly but theres no pollen out there in the winter months theres none in this clammy hole the origins nervous anyone can see that we were into the faster lane now and getting a move on hed told the driver to make for the cenotaph how much does he know about the bureau nothing of course hes never been there he was trained by special branch instructors not by us hes seen me only this once and without any chance of recognition as you note all he knows about you apart from anything youve told him are your features and your cover name ive no intention of saddling you with a potential risk quiller accident was it he took off his smoked glasses and shifted into the corner facing me obliquely you accepted this little chore he said patiently and im most grateful its only for a few days and youre not going into a sensitive area so apart from an imminent revolution or is that just a romantic fancy of his he looked past me through the window i doubt if therell be a revolution we dont think moscow will let it get that far by we he meant the bureaus pet department the political analysts meeting my eyes again he got a measure of coy reassurance into his tone but the situation out there could well become interesting and while its not really our cup of tea we thought we might just give it a stir to see if its sugared merricks clearance didnt amount to more than an air ticket which he got from the foreign office anyway a second secretary was resuming his post at the british embassy in warsaw following sick leave and that was all he didnt need a cover because he was already established and in place the bureau doesnt normally use hired labour but it was clear enough that he was going out on a special situation mission and if he survived it i didnt expect to see him again egerton hadnt told me this and i hadnt asked merricks longterm future was one part of the overall background picture that i wasnt going to be shown my job was to check and confirm the information hed be sending in to london and try to keep him out of trouble while he was getting it the one thing id have liked to know was the extent of his value to the bureau at first glance it didnt look too high he spoke a bit of polish and had established organisational cover and unofficial access to the underground cell of an east bloc republic simmering with dissension but someone in the bureau had recruited him and appointed egerton to direct him despite the fact that they knew hed need looking after from the minute he left the uk according to the rules it shouldnt have worried me but the rules dont mean a thing that one do you i looked at it third series fifthdigit duplications with recurring blanks normal contractions and all numerals reversed the alertkey was general not integrated you just put a contraction in full can they recede this for radio it looked as if id be sending my stuff through the embassy diplomatic telegram weve made sure he said oh really codes and cyphers dont normally go into little points like that they just select one that nobodys using and try it on for size this was egerton steering me through clearance as smoothly as if he were at my elbow the same thing had happened in firearms they know i never use anything but they usually try a bit of persuasion so they can feel theyre still in business but today theyd just said nothing for you that right nil under weapons drawn egerton again taking care of me hunched in front of the little fire up there in the other building with his every thought devoted to my welfare i could have done without that i didnt like being taken care of so smoothly by a man whod done his best to pass this thing off as a little chore only for a few days not really our cup of tea maybe it was just because he was most grateful most grateful i didnt think so accounts travel field briefing credentials she opened the folder is this all you need i hadnt asked for deep cover and egerton hadnt insisted because this wasnt a fullscale mission it was only light stuff passport with twoyearold border guard frankings at danzig and krzeszow visa background cps membership card and a few letters carrying fairly recent dates a nice touch was that although their subject matter was in obvious sequence the latest one was headed january of the previous year a thing a lot of people do from force of habit the two top ones are she said we had enough time to m stasiak chalubinskiego warsaw december oh you bastard i thought you bastard on tuesday there was an lot flight via east berlin and id told them to book me on that egerton must have known but he didnt question it there wasnt anything about jan ludwiczak in the paper the stewardess gave me but i didnt expect there would be they always throw a blackout after the first run it didnt matter because id seen the story in a copy of zycie warsawy id picked up on the offchance at the shop near cambridge circus jan ludwiczak there was no address had been arrested for subversive acts against the republic chiefly the operation of a clandestine printing press with three other men and a woman none of whom were named for the publication and distribution of violently seditious material among the bourgeois elements of the universities the arrest of ludwiczaks confederates was said to be imminent i hadnt been looking for this particular story when id bought the copy of zycie warsawy but it was the kind of information i needed as a byproduct it told me quite a lot about the situation out there because in the paper the stewardess had given me there wasnt a hint of subversive acts or even mild unrest this wasnt so much an example of typical russian splitmindedness as a pointer to indecision on the part of the authorities first theyd tried to soften up the workers by leniency according to merrick and then theyd gone on to the other tack and they obviously still werent sure whether to clean up dissident factions by secret arrests or scream their misdeeds from the housetops as a deterrent on a personal level jan ludwiczak was of course cooked and the arrest of his friends was indeed imminent under the glare the rubber truncheons would work through the routine and their names would come out one by one the sky was brilliant and below us lay an ocean of sludge after east berlin i put my watch forward an hour and thought you bastard hed known i wouldnt ask for deep cover because the pitch hed decided to sell me on was the only for a few days ploy so hed told credentials to fix me up with these few letters ostensibly exchanged between me and the people in warsaw arranging to meet that was all right the meetings werent important ones a meal somewhere a little business the sort of thing i could cancel or postpone or leave in the blue if it suited my plans the letters were typed and the ones from p k longstreet were signed in a perfect imitation of my own handwriting so that nothing would look odd if some bright spark thought of checking with the signatures on my passport and visa that was all right too but the first letter had gone off on december so everyone else hadnt refused theyd never been asked he hadnt roped me in at the last minute hed lined me up for this job nearly three weeks ago he wasnt a bastard for doing that he was control not bureau and a director puts his ferret to work in the way he chooses shows him the hole and shoves him down it and stands back and crosses his fingers no he was a bastard for knowing id pick up the date on that letter when i was going through clearance and was therefore committed too late to change my mind without actually getting slung out will you please fasten your seat belt if i must but id rather put it round egertons neck we started a long slow dip towards the sludge query why had he wanted me there were several who wouldnt have refused a short trip like this to keep out of norfolk between missions or break up the dreary round of the girls who were always in bed with someone else when you needed them most because once a job came up there wouldnt be time for anything except getting in and getting out alive waring was in london now and hed have done it like a shot just to get into their good books after cocking up the copenhagen lark but they hadnt asked waring theyd wanted a particular type of agent to work with merrick and the one theyd selected with great care was the one whod proved time and again that he always worked best alone they werent fools itd be dangerous to settle for that the windows went grey but id done it on their doorstep too id keep to the bargain and look after their new recruit for them but id do it in my own way working alone egerton would have known id asked them for the tuesday flight but he hadnt questioned it merrick was due out tomorrow bea direct the tension had gone out of the airframe and wed lost weight plastic fittings creaked the was floating at a slant through the muck query is it even worse than you think have they palmed you off with the worst job of all that one i thought about it again because if i didnt i wouldnt sleep tonight the kid had said no they hadnt told him to deliver anything to anyone hed seemed surprised when id asked that two weeks in training how would he know but id believed him and it should have consoled me itd be all right so long as they hadnt given him any kind of document to carry to deliver but it wasnt easy to get rid of the chill because this whole thing made a pattern and it was the only one that could accommodate all the facts they dont do it often and no one talks about it afterwards correction heppinstall talked about it once to me its not that theyre squeamish you cant fight a full sized cold war without someone sometimes getting pushed off his perch its just that theres not often the need to do it because the other ways round are more efficient but now and then its the only setup thatll fill the bill and thats when they sign up a new recruit and make a pretense of training him and give him the bait the baits not for him hes already hooked its for the opposition usually a file or a brief breakdown on a spurious operation some form of written intelligence either encyphered or straight and specifically designed to fox the opposition and send them at a tangent while the real party goes in in military terms its the feint attack and the principles the same the mechanics vary the technique doesnt you send your man in and he delivers the goods by letterdrop and hes caught doing it because hes meant to be caught doing it thats what hes for after that its just dull routine hes beaten up till he breaks and tells them all he knows but all he knows isnt much oh a few titbits here and there to give them something to chew on the odd bit of info theyve had on their books since god told moses to spy out the land of canaan it looks quite good they know hes telling the truth and while theyre busy dashing off hi all directions on the strength of the stuff they caught him with the real operative goes in sometimes hes not told what the setup is hes simply sent as far as the edge of the area and ordered to wait for a signal he might not know what the mission is or even that hes got one then they throw him the works and tell him the fields clear get in there or sometimes they send him out with the new recruit and ask him to hold his hand ive done mine i said and she smiled and passed on customs declaration form to be completed by passengers prior to landing i hadnt actually done it myself of course its delivered with the visa and the bureau takes pride in relieving its valued servants of these annoying little details its the things it doesnt do for you that sometimes chills your nerves the things youve got to do yourself heppinstall had been drunk that night and i hustled him round to my place before he could break into control and knock loman for six loman was his director at the time i didnt have a clue ol boy not a single rotten stinkin bloody clue an you know you know what there was nothing for me in the end no mission nothing it was for someone else you get it a white face and the tumbler shaking in his fingers his voice thinned with rage some other bastard went in got it all lined up you see an all all i did was come on home like goo good little boy an christ they shot that poor little squirt know that eh put him put him against a wall keep me way from lo loman will you oh god gainst a wall normally they dont talk about it afterwards but heppinstall had got deliberately drunk also he was unlucky because the uk had just sent sharawi hassan down for the maximum stretch of fourteen years for the missile programme filch and the united arab republic was smarting a bit and a decoys no good as exchange material so theyd shot him no smoking the murk thinned off and i saw lights below and the twisting course of the vistula which looked frozen over the runway beacons tilted across the glass as we lined up was that the one theyd palmed off on me that one bounce snow an aeroflot tupolev tu had just come in from moscow and the building was crowded the people from the tu were waving their papers eager to show how uplifted they were by complying with the regulations drawn up by their allwise comrades to protect the rights of the workers it always speeds up the formalities though because theres no tune wasted arguing tell them to shit and theyll shit the young pole at immigration was very circumspect as if he was being observed by a proficiency inspector or someone like that how long do you intend to stay hi poland about two weeks i said it first in halting polish and repeated it in german the lingua franca to show him i was happier with that it was no good making out i couldnt speak polish at all because of the letters from the dealers what is your business so forth i showed him the letters taking them out of the envelope for him the heavy man next to him didnt say anything you have a special reason for meeting these people yes particularly for meeting mr hrynkiewicz im hoping to buy the lewinski collection for an american it was respectable thinking on the part of credentials because the poles need dollars like the irish need a drink what is that i looked blank as if he should know its the authenticated series with the korony mayer engravings of and the german occupation inverted overprints look heres the catalogue with it is not necessary but he took the croydon philatelic society membership card because id been letting it peep out from among the currency vouchers they always seize on new colours because anything strange is suspect while he was making a show of reading it the heavy man beside him reached out and went through the same motions he wasnt a pole this one he had the flat bland face of the men you always see on the front page standing close to the chairman of the presidium when hes just flown in and whenever theyre actually looking into the camera its because they think there might be some trinitrotoluene inside it instead of some perutz peromnia he raised his colourless eyes from the card and let them play on my face and i remembered a thousand frontiers and a thousand men with eyes like these and this was the dangers that my own would show the indifference to scrutiny that will indicate our trade as clearly as the nails of a mechanic will tell of his so i looked uneasy as sometimes a tourist does when despite the comfort of his guide book and instamatic and diners club card he senses how suddenly close he is to a world hed rather not consider where the iron force of alien authority is vested in a single man with eyes like these and where only the conformity of his papers can give him immunity against the nightmare fates that have overtaken other and less invulnerable voyagers brought namelessly to mind by images of dark windowed saloons slowing along dawn streets of barbed wire and a silhouetted guard i looked at the younger one the pole may i have my letters back he tucked them circumspectly into the envelope the heavy man took the envelope and pulled them out again comparing the signatures with the one on my passport looking at no one he said in russian ask him why he flew via east berlin why did you fly via east berlin because the flight was routed that way looking quickly around i lowered my tone tapping the letters in the big square hand the lewinski collection has only just come on to the private market and of course mr hrynkiewicz would prefer to make a deal in dollars so he told me to hurry and get in first you can read what he says put them back in the envelope he told the pole and looked past me to the next one in the queue going through customs i remembered the flash of anger in the young eyes of the pole as hed folded the letters for the second time merrick hadnt been fooling there were no tanks in this city yet but it already had the brackish smell of occupation there was a quietness here voices and other sounds muffled as if by snow and everyone passengers airport staff and security officials did their business with each other deftly ready neither to give nor make trouble in case somewhere a spark were struck to send the whole lot up waiting for clearance i had time to vet the people off the tu and picked out a minimum of six tourists straight in from the soviet state security service getting their luggage chalked at the blink of an eye my bag came through the leather panel at one end flapping from the ragged stitches they wont bother looking for a hollow bottom when the tops obviously having a job to stay on to jest wszystko co mam i told him nie mam nic do oclenia jak to sie nazywa po polsku stanley gibbons i said with a shrug you cant put that into polish he passed it but dropped the mail smartly into the receptacle for seditious literature id never thought kirby much cop but the rest didnt seem that bad there were three kgb men just inside the barrier but they didnt look at me when i went through their eyes work at a distance while youre having your shirts picked over and theyve seen all they want to see before you get anywhere near them outside the building the cold hit like a wave and froze on the face the queue for taxis had already built up but one or two private cars were nosing in and i took a beatup syrena the owner asked eighteen zlotys three times the taxi fare and worth it because you didnt have to freeze to death in the queue just part of the black market service he asked which hotel and i said i didnt want a hotel i wanted a woman there was an open stove burning split wooden road blocks with a galvanised pipe running up through a blanked off window pane the room smelt of tar and sweat and russian tobacco a half finished bowl of chiodnik had been pushed under the fringe of red velvet that hung from one of the shelves the spoon still in it her hands began moving dont do that i said im not staying still young and with carbon black ringlets above the sharp dark eyes a leopard skin coat and knee boots where was the whip her forebears on the distaff side awhoring for the goths come near the stove she said with little white smiling teeth it will warm you whats your name i switched to german because i wanted her to get it clear marie a lot of them use names like that the world over perhaps to bring into their dingy rooms a touch of the splendid plush and bronze and mirrored ceilings of la belle epoque in german come near the stove she began again and i said again that i wasnt staying and the black eyes sparked when you dont want the only thing theyve got it hurts their pride shed said a hundred and fifty zlotys and i put three fifties on the bottom shelf and her lead turned to watch quick as a birds jan ludwiczak i told her got arrested a couple of days ago i want to know his address and where the ub are holding him then you make as much again who are you and what gives you the idea id know a thing like that so forth she added in the warsaw vernacular and tones like a sabre being sharpened that the ub were the original illegitimate sons of putrefaction incarnate and that she had no dealings with them you get the other hundred and fifty if you can find out by ten oclock tomorrow morning her pride stopped being hurt but she thought up a lot of objections in order to raise the price trilling the low german rs and throwing out the genders but i kept on at her because id come here knowing shed have a few of the policia ubespieczenia among her clients anywhere east of the curtain the lower ranks of the secret police can get it for nothing or a girl wont stay in business finish your stew she reached for the bowl and banged it on top of the stove it is not enough for so difficult a thing it was all shed get that bloody woman in accounts was going to question this anyway when it went in as general expenses and even if i put a tart unused against please specify shed only put unjustified as soon as shed come out of the vapours where do you pick up marie what bar i tell you it is oh come on the komiwojazer wed passed it in the syrena the nearest corner from here ill phone there tomorrow before ten and if youve got what i want ill tell them to give you the onefifty sulkily she said i may be lucky this time are there other things you will want to know about she poked at the chiodnik possibly but not if you dont get it right this time not if you bitch me it was their reaction that was interesting hed got as far as the airport perhaps hed booked on a plane out and they knew that or just suspected it or someone like marie had sold him out while a ub mans trousers were still slung over the chair anyway they got him a scandinavian airlines flight had just come in but most of the people in the main hall were polish friends or associates or people with reservations on the sas plane and their reaction was interesting because they didnt just stand watching as most crowds do there was a distinct movement forward as if they wanted to help then hesitation the moskwicz hadnt got a heater so id screwed accounts for a fiat because thered be some surveillance to do and that meant sitting around at anything down to twentyfive below zero id left it in the car park and the wolga had come up very fast two of them piling out as it slewed in alongside the departure doors just when i was going through he was ahead of me and theyd seen him because hed turned his face to look back perhaps sensing the danger or hearing the way the car had pulled up apparently he was recognisable to them because they seemed perfectly sure and broke their run and walked in step towards him while he stood there with the dead fixed look of a rabbit in the headlights perhaps theyd hoped they could do it discreetly be was a man of some age with silver hair below the edges of his black fur kepi an academic face with nothing desperate in it only despair but at the last minute he tried to make a break nothing sensational just a kind of token jerk sideways as if he didnt ever want it said of him that he hadnt resisted it worried them and they used more force than was needed swinging him round and hustling him back to the doors so fast that he couldnt keep up and they had to half lift him as if they were moving a waxwork it was then that i noticed their reaction the crowds the forward motion as if they wanted to help then the hesitation when they realised there was nothing they could do the bea flight was twenty minutes late and i read most of the news section of trybuna ludu which for doublethink motives saw fit to quote some of the problems facing the fourth congress of the polish psychiatrists union now convening in the capital mental breakdowns up by eleven per cent suicides up by ten alcohol and tobacco consumption up by twenty on a different page full coverage was given to the fall from grace of several hundred local civil servants party workers and journalists accused or suspected of antisocialist leanings incompatible with those in responsible positions additionally a further twentyseven known zionists had applied for emigration specifically to israel this report being innocent of any hint that most of them would follow the fifteen hundred who since had changed planes and turned up in copenhagen no mention of jan ludwiczak i hadnt even looked for it the last faint ripple would have gone by now and the surface would be smooth across the monocrome tarmac the trident reversed its thrust and drew out a haze of kerosene i kept to my cover near the edge of the group others had joined it theyd moved by casual heelcooling paces from farther away where they hadnt seen anything clearly what happened they arrested him why i dont know who was he i dont know they looked away from each other across at the tobacco kiosk the sales were going up what would the polish psychiatrists union recommend as a solution to the problem chewing gum he began looking for me as soon as he was through the customs and i turned away and gave him a few minutes and took the end doorway watching him from a distance across the freezing forecourt the grey winter light striking across his glasses his shoulders hunched inside his coat his young forlorn face reddening to the bite of the air he looked for me everywhere when he joined the group for the orbis coach i went and sat in the fiat running the engine to work the heater i was fed up did he think id book on a different plane so we shouldnt be seen together and then turn up to meet him when he got in that was one reason that was why egerton hadnt had the nerve to question it he knew it was routine security anyway i hadnt told him id meet him id just said id get in touch so what was he gawping around for the coach dropped him at the orbis office in ulica krucza and i stayed in the fiat letting him get across mokotowska so that i could take a long look down the narrowing perspective that was another reason and so far he was clean when he turned into aleje roz i drove past and parked at the far end looking through the halfmisted rear window to watch him go into the embassy he was still clean i started up and turned right into wazdowskie and went round the square and came back and parked on the other side of aleje roz so that i could watch through the windscreen instead of the rear window it was a short street and the fiat was a bit close to the police observation post but they were there to survey people entering and leaving the embassy and nobody else and the afternoon dark was coming down so they wouldnt be able to see if there were anyone still in the car the thing was that i might just as well have taken the cheapest according to standing orders the moskwicz because if i wanted any heat in the fiat id have to keep starting up every halfhour and theyd hear that and wonder why i never got into gear and moved off but even if it meant freezing to the wheel id wait till he left the chancery for the residence id give him till midnight wherever he went wherever he went till midnight id be there and hed be safe because if those bastards in london had sent him out with a fistful of marked cards to pass to a contact or shove in a letterdrop id be there before he was caught it was what they wanted wasnt it hold his hand theyd done it to heppinstall and theyd done it to others but they werent going to do it to me two hours before dawn there was the tailend of a moon lying hooked across the heights of the buildings that stood against the west in the half dark they seemed windowless but windows were there and maybe from some of them another attempt would be made today or tomorrow and maybe succeed swelling the numbers of the ten per cent the cost of living in captivity was going up and the soul knew a cheap way out they brought me hot water and i thought about him while i washed the worst of the worry was over and id slept for nearly five hours if theyd been going to do it they would have arranged it for some time during his first few hours here that would be logical to send him early into the trap as if it were important for him to pass the stuff as soon as he could after landing from london the implied urgency raising the value of the material in the eyes of the opposition but his light had gone out behind the shutters in the residence before midnight and id come away i didnt know how long it was going to take me to find my way into the czyn network or how long it would be before merrick signalled london through the diplomatic radio to say i was missing london wouldnt take any notice but it was the sort of tiling he might do because in only two weeks training they wouldnt have covered even a prйcis of the practical experience he lacked hed expected me to show up at okecie to meet his plane and now hed expect me to telephone him or call at the embassy and ask him to infiltrate me into czyn and help him analyse its potential that was understandable because he knew those were the orders id been given but he didnt know he couldnt instinctively see that i had to work alone and make my own infiltration simply because itd be too dangerous not to they hadnt checked him from the airport but from now on hed be under routine surveillance by the observation post across the street from the embassy he wouldnt be given an actual shadow like the military attachй but if he made a mistake and revealed his connections with czyn the central monitoring cell of the ub would advise the observation post and theyd slap a tag on him every time he left the embassy id have to make protected contact with him because my orders were to check and confirm the info he was sending to london and try to make sure his face didnt get trodden on while he was doing it but he was expecting me to turn up at the embassy like a longlost friend and trot him across the pink elephant club for a drink and i wished hed got the sense to know that id be going as near to him in public as id go to a rabid dog so i hadnt unfortunately done it on egertons doorstep hed known id get the point before long hed wanted a particular type of agent to work with merrick the type who could do it best by working alone the bit of paper that had been waiting for me in the bar had told me ulica zawidzka it was in the praga district on the east side of the river and i took up station there in the fiat an hour before dawn it had begun snowing and i used the wipers at intervals she came into the street at halfpast eight and turned left away from me and for a minute i sat watching the flakes drifting across her dark blue greatcoat then got out and locked the car and began following alinka her name was in small gold letters on the triangular block but i needed to know more about her than that you speak english yes i do she was in uniform the tunic dark blue like the greatcoat had been a very white collar below the dense black hair clear stoneblue eyes that glanced behind me through the windows and flickered back to my face when i spoke all id like are the london schedules bea and your own a ludwiczak in small gold letters bea operate direct flights to london on mondays wednesdays and fridays im never good at telling their age say between twentyfive and thirty and divorced too efficient to have lost it through carelessness and quite a few years to leave a mark as deep as that married too young then and the break quite recent or the mark would have gone with this straight nose and decisive mouth shed probably got it off with one irrevocable tug and hurled it as far as she could not jan dow being worked over in the glare of the lamps in the th precinct bureau he was only twentyone he would be her brother alinka excuse me please she turned away taking the form from the girl and signing it swinging her head up as she turned back her eyes focusing on someone behind me ten seconds ago thered been the thump of the door and a wave of cold air from the street it was a quick questioning glance the kind i was getting used to seeing sometimes there was defiance in it and sometimes fear id seen it on my way here in the tram along jerozolimskie theyd made a spotcheck on identity cards the snow on their padded shoulders as they pushed between the seats and at zawiszy square theyd taken someone off his patient jewish eyes downcast as he passed me the blueveined hand uncertain as it touched the rail as if doubtful of even this much support apparently it was all right because she looked at me again though it was an effort to remember what id been asking three other men and a woman it had said adding that their arrest was imminent we operate on tuesdays thursdays saturdays and sundays if i need to know anything else when do you we are open until five oclock the main meal obiad was from four onwards and she went home for it soon after five he just kept on past the house without turning his head and i waited till hed gone before i unlocked the fiat and got in it was normal routine surveillance between where she lived and where she worked it had been a different man this morning and i wasnt worried id have been worried if they hadnt put a tag on a relative of someone they were grilling in the th precinct because that would have been inconsistent with the situation and id have had to start beating the air for the answer instead of concentrating on the way in to czyn she was the way in the thread in my hand and i didnt want anything to snap it not long after seven there was a tug on it and i waited outside the place so that i could go in immediately behind a group of youths carrying a hollowribbed mongrel theyd found in the snow it wasnt far from where she lived and my shoes had covered some of the traces left by her own shed been expected and hed ordered coffee for them both he sat tall in his chair and his wide confident hands were clasped on the table now and then he thumped it gently to emphasise a point and she watched him with steady attentive eyes as she tore up with unconscious efficiency the blue handout advertising the hungarian troupe at the cristalbudapest the one on my own table was soaking up some coffee the girl had slopped over when shed brought it but alinka was tearing hers into small neat squares as she listened to him but refused to accept that it would be all right that they wouldnt be too rough with jan because he was young and hed only been printing the stuff for students anyway and as soon as they could find out where he was being held they could go there and try to see him for a few minutes i could hear nothing from where i sat on the dais opposite the bar and my interpretation of their attitudes could be wrong because in the past two days id already learned how difficult it was to judge people from their behaviour or even their expression in this city the winter was not only in the streets and they were living on their nerves the fierce vitality theyd put into their music and their wars now thrust inwards on themselves and it was worse because the surface of their daily lives seemed still intact they could sit here and order coffee and complain if it didnt come and dance at the cristalbudapest and walk with their children in the park on sundays all they couldnt do was call their country their own and for these people their country was their soul his big confident hands thumped the table again and anger quickened suddenly on her face as if she needed to defend her right to feel afraid but he understood and his quiet answer softened her eyes and she shut them for a moment her dark head going down and only then could he look away from her hopelessness dulling his profile his clasped hands falling open to rest slackly beside the heap of torn blue paper then suddenly and although it was difficult to judge these people by their behaviour i sensed that for him it was an almost violent thing to do his hand swept out and the paper whirled like confetti on to the floor they didnt speak again until they left for half a minute i watched them through the window where the neon sign flashed bathing them in its intermittent light he wanted to see her home but she shook her head walking away alone i switched and he took me northwest and then west across the slaskodabrowski bridge walking fast and with long strides the snow heaped thickly along the boughs in the public gardens the frozen jet of a fountain curving in an arch of ice bells tolling somewhere along the remote reaches of the skyline left and then left again under the deathly blue of the lamps in krakowskie przedmiescie a tram with a snowplough attachment nosing along the rails sparks sizzling from the boom hed gone these were older houses fourstoreyed one of them with dark smoke creeping in a down draught like hair across a face the lift was still moving when i went into the hall and stood listening watching for the counterweight to come into view small yellow lamps burned shining on the snow that had dropped from his shoes the weight stopped at the first floor so i took the stairs to the third beethoven in my head suddenly the theme rhythm a trick of the memory on the third floor i had to push the timeswitch the doors of the lift were narrow panels swingopening outwards and with glazed apertures i couldnt see any snow on the floor of the passage here a cable still quivered in the silence tapping against one of the guide rails the fanlights of all four apartments were dark the floor was composition flint with a buffed surface and even after climbing the stairs my shoes had left moisture but his hadnt i checked the floor above and the one below and came back hed left no traces in the lift was a puddle fringed with slush where hed been standing there was no particular hurry but it shouldnt have taken me so long you get stale after three months without a mission the rear panel of the lift was mostly a mirror damp had got at the silvering over the decades and it looked like scum on a pond but the frame had been reinforced theyd seen to that the catch was above and to one side a flushfitted knot in the wood with a medium spring and i pressed it and swung the mirror towards me the door in the wall behind wasnt easy to see although i knew i must be looking straight at it the vertical edges were concealed by the rear pair of guide rails and there was no handle lock or keyhole he would have knocked at it to the rhythm my ear had detected when id climbed the stairs my mind failing to register it consciously because from two floors up the sound had been too faint muffled by the confines of the stairwell beethovens fifth three short and one long the vsign theyd used in the war just as theyd used this door when the resistance had gone to there was no obliquemirrored judashole that i could see i waited for a minute but there seemed to be no kind of warning device that i could have tripped mechanically or electrically they didnt know id exposed the door i came away this was their base and for the moment it was enough that id located it the sensitive area wasnt here it was in alinka ludwiczaks travel pattern because if she were simply a cutout liaising with two or more of the czyn units shed become an immediate danger to them if the secret police decided to pull her in she looked like a cutout because shed made contact tonight in a cafe instead of coming here but if she were more than that if she were the unnamed woman under threat of imminent arrest theyd pull her in as soon as the time came when the boy in the th precinct bureau just couldnt take any more in either case she could blow half the network and that would expose merrick a new sound had come to the city the light crunching of chains as they bit into the snow the sky was clear by midday but the streets were still covered and along grojecka the heavier traffic had packed the surface into ice the fiat had been fitted up by orbis and before dark i found a slot within fifty yards of the airline office and stayed in the car because it didnt matter which end of the tagroute i left it and for the next fortyfive minutes i wouldnt have to freeze to the pavement like the little man with the earmuffs whod taken up station near the delicatessen soon after id parked it was the same one as last evening this was his shift there was no twilight the night was suddenly switched on with the lamps across the darkened sky an aircraft winked lower on its approach path into okecie she came on to the pavement at and began walking north towards the crossing and the tram stop and he kept pace on the other side of the street i locked the fiat and used quick short steps over the cobbled ice to close the gap so fifty yards by the time she crossed to the island and then to the east side a tram had started moaning behind me but she wouldnt be taking this one if she were going straight home last night shed caught a no on the direct route as far as the stadium on the far side of the poniatowski bridge but i closed the distance again and so did he because we werent certain the pattern was the same until a fourdoor warszawa with smoked rear windows crunched over the ruts alongside the kerb and halted abreast of the little man with earmuffs he went up to it and spoke through the open window turning his head just once towards the tram stop where she was waiting it looked like a pickup and i was badly placed but there was a chance so i started back for the fiat and got there half a minute after the no ground its way past going north with the engine running i watched him through the windscreen at a hundred and fifty yards until a snowcaked mercedes slid against the kerb and i had to pull out and slow again to keep him in view he was climbing into the warszawa and beyond it the tram was moving off and they followed not hurrying so it was a pickup but they didnt want to do it here in grojecka because there were too many people about and there was no need for the rush tactics theyd had to use at okecie because she wasnt trying to get on an aeroplane theyd do it on the far side of the river where the streets were quiet jan ludwiczak had held out for nearly three days but now theyd got the names and the heat was on i couldnt do anything about the others but there was a thin chance here and the fiat began sliding a bit as i edged out of the rutted camber and shaped up to overhaul two risks one of them calculated i might clout someone if i struck a bad patch and that would leave me blocked while they kept on going or they might pick her up when she changed trams on the other side of the stadium instead of waiting till she got off near zabkowska and started walking to the house where she lived i didnt believe theyd do that because there was no need her own street was the quietest along the whole of the route and they had her address theyd follow her there only to make sure she didnt change her direction so it was stomachthink not brainthink that was playing on my nerves the fear of leaving her for so long unprotected discount and concentrate in zawisza square there was a snarlup and the civil police were using an mo patrol car to drag a buckled trabant clear of the tramlines and i lost nearly seven minutes and began sweating because by precise reckoning i had to reach the poniatowski bridge and leave the fiat and walk back to the tram stop at the ulica solec intersection before the no arrived there in fifteen minutes from now at add a third risk if someone else caused a snarlup worse dan this one along the main jerozolimskie it would halt the tram and the passengers would get out and walk till they picked up a bus farther on and it was then that the ub warszawa might opt to play safe and take her on board by now there would be directives in force to minimise public scenes because the international spotlight was finding its focus journalists were already flying in to set up their coverage of the west german talks and the snatch at the airport would have hit all the major european editions and the polish delegates must be getting sensitive but there was a limit to what could be done to present this city as the capital of a free people when its citizens were burning to turn it into fact discount the third risk somewhere near the ulica solec intersection we had a rendezvous she and i the snow had piled drifts along jerozolimskie where wind had blown from the side streets and their humps were turning black from the citys smoke the fiat hit one ofthem obliquely and was carried across the tramlines before i could bring it back the traffic was thicker here and the going less easy when solec came up i checked the timing at six minutes behind schedule and kept on towards the bridge because there was still a chance just this side of the river a trailer truck out of the rail freight yards had got stuck in the ruts where the camber was steep so i passed it and pulled in and backed up and left the fiat there with its rear image shielded from the eastbound traffic the red blob of the tram was already in sight along the streets perspective but i couldnt run because in this city a running man was suspect and two uniformed mo police were patrolling towards me on this side id passed them in the fiat and by now theyd be coming up on the tram stop at thirty yards i saw them beyond the people waiting there but i walked faster now because it was normal and legitimate to hurry to catch a tram it had begun slowing and i broke into a trot slipping on the packed snow and waving to the driver the people who had been waiting were getting on board the two policemen were now this side of the stop i slipped again and found my feet and kept going but they didnt move over to give me room your papers in german i said if i miss this tram but he wagged a gloved finger passport visa the last of them was getting on board why do you speak in german from inside the tram the buzzer sounded in thick accents you think we not understand english he turned aside to study the visa in a better light the shadow from the cap peak masking his eyes the other watched me beyond them i could see the warszawa it had pulled over to halt on the tramlines so that traffic could pass where are you going to praga i shrugged if i can get the tram none of the three risks had come off but it didnt matter now the whole thing had become academic thered been a chance and it had died on me and it was the last one id get because it was no good going back to the fiat and overtaking the tram again for one thing there wasnt enough distance left in which to overhaul and establish a lead sufficient to let me walk back one stop and try to get on again we were too near ulica zawidska by now and for another thing theyd start wondering why a dovegrey fiat kept overhauling them like a pilotfish round a shark no go where in praga sparks cracked from the boom and the iron wheels rolled no go she was for the labour camps my hotel the dubienski hotel a volkswagen was coming up not too fast for the conditions but steadily its chains thumping it would pass between the tram and where we stood very well he put the visa inside the passport and gave them to me in english goodnight then suddenly in his own tongue uwazaj he may have tried to grab me because of the danger but it would be dangerous only if i slipped the twin horns of the volkswagen were blaring and i knew it wouldnt be able to pull up if i fell in front of it the rear doors of the tram were abreast of me and i ran at an angle to allow for the acceleration the doors werent closed yet because they werent automatichydraulic at the end of my run they began sliding together and then i suppose the conductor saw me because they opened again and someone gave me a hand pulling me in i heard the volkswagen slithering past a shout coming yes if you wish i am a bloody lunatic yes but the point is that i have made some progress on the condensation of the rear glass the sidelights of the warszawa shifted a bit as its wheels were deflected by the tramlines then it steadied and followed there wasnt a lot of tune left now the next stop was only three hundred yards from here just this side of the stuck trailer fortyfive seconds i couldnt see her uniform it was the same as the hostesses wore with a dark blue militarystyle forage cap easy to identify among all the black fur kepis but i couldnt see it people were standing in the gangway blocking my view of the forward seats and i started easing my way through them one of them was the conductor where to ulica solec but thats the next stop didnt you know yes never mind so forth a handful of coins most of them zlotys take your pick change can be expensive cost you ten seconds twenty depended well forget it he said it made them feel better robbing the state a zlotysworth of revenge not much but a gesture you can use the rear doors theres no need to someone i know the girl from the airline i think shes up here somewhere edging through the heavy leather coats not easy they were helpful but there just wasnt much room swaying together say twentyfive seconds now twentyfour three i couldnt see her sorry did i tread on your sorry przepraszam we all lurched grabbing at the seatbacks varnish cracked a lot of it chipped off the wheels moaned iron on iron she couldnt have got off earlier because theyd have seen her and taken her slamming the doors but they were still following i knew that shed do well to be here somewhere because as id told him half the population of warsaws going to be in a strict regime camp in the urals or the komi republic or murmansk the schizoheterodoxy political cases in the special mental hospitals of chita province the potma complex the sawmills or making heavy boots till your fingers bleed a bit of barbed wire but no guards because its too far across the snow youd never make it alive sorry przepraszam dzeikuje another lurch then i saw her but it was an inside seat bad luck have to be very quick now very quick indeed because if we overran this stop at solec the fiat wouldnt be there and the whole thing depended on that slowing we were slowing ulcia solec he called out a plump surprised man looking up a wieprzowina sausage in greaseproof paper on his lap looking up with a jerk and the fear coming at once into the eyes who was i what did i want he had done nothing against the state as i leaned over him towards the inside seat and spoke close to the dark head as it turned alinka to show that i knew her and might therefore know other things could perhaps be trusted to know them well speak in english police want you police come with me and youll be safe be quick the wheels had stopped rolling her eyes wide staring into my face the pupils enlarged i understand the doors thudded open against the rubber shockstops ulica soled yes i called to him i was getting off here the man with the sausage was twisting sideways to let her pass and then she was in the gangway and as we went to the forward doors i told her to take her cap off and she did it with a natural gesture shaking her hair free two other people had left their seats and i took her arm holding her still so that they could go first and while we waited i gave her as much as i could the ub car was behind the tram and theyd be watching for her the grey fiat was parked in front of the trailer truck and she must get into it without losing time and then crouch low she should be ready for any word i threw at her and if we had to run she must take care not to slip all right she said i held her gloved hand so that i could guide her taking her forward to follow the two people closely the man got out first and helped the woman down and i drew alinka past me keep on that side of them and hold your head low i let her hand go but followed close to make additional cover trying to judge their angle of view and blocking it gripping her hand again and forcing her across the packed snow keeping exact pace with the man and the woman and listening now listening we reached the pavement the four of us breaking the crests of the ruts our breath steaming under the tall lamps stefan might not be home yet the man was saying to the woman and they had no key why must he always forget she asked him to bring the key a red lantern stood on the snow not far from the rear of the truck to warn traffic it looked as if theyd decided to abandon it for the night the tram moved away and i held my head turned to that one ear could hope to catch the sound i was listening for against the noise of the tram the air froze against our faces then the woman slipped her hand was flung out and the man tried to save her and nearly managed it at least breaking her fall but she went down squealing unnecessarily like a pig the cover was gone and i said run just before the sound came the click of a door opening but no shout yet they werent certain just alerted by the colour of her coat but fractionally thrown by the altered image her cap being off i kept to a steady walk but couldnt hope to judge their angle of view at this distance an aching temptation to look behind me but not possible and then a second click and a voice calling a sharp order to the one whod got out this was the breakoff point and i began running too ice when the colonel comes round you shove some dandelions in a jamtin and kick the crapboard under the bed and the corporal gets good marks for keeping a tidy billet so tonight the beers on him and the same principle operates when the capital of any given state receives a foreign delegation everyones so busy brushing the worst of it under the rug that you can hardly walk on it for the lumps i was in yugoslavia when battista farinelli made a tenday visit to belgrade to steer through the uca trade referendum and although i was between missions i chanced to have access to the security service directive that was passed to all units a week prior to the visit and paragraph three stipulated that firearms would not be used unless the life of an officer were manifestly in jeopardy during the execution of his duties you can put out as many flags as you like but foreign journalists are going to suspect things are a bit untidy if they cant hear the church bells for bangs its standard practice otherwise theyd have put one into my legs and although you can keep going if its lodged in the flesh or the bone its no go if it hits a major nerve her arm went out once and i thought she was off her balance but it was all right and by the time i reached there shed dragged the door open and was hunched on the passengers seat with her head against the dashboard i heard them behind me the clump of their boots over the snow shed left the door hanging wide open and i used it to break my slide heaving myself in by the wheelcolumn and punching about for the key someone shouted arid the voice was close we were cutting it fine but that was all right because the nearer they were to the fiat the farther they were from the warszawa unless one of them had stayed behind one of them had stayed behind i heard the pinion hit the band just before mine did but it couldnt be helped and there was a bit of traffic coming through from the lights and that might baulk them because they were on the tramlines and in any case a standing start on tramlines isnt the best pitch so we still had a chance the engine of the was still well into the workingtemperature region and fired without any trouble and i botched in and gave it full gun to get the chains chewing down to the tarmac through the snow it was the only hope because it would have needed anything up to ten seconds using a sensitive rein and i was aware of him now very close nothing visual just the sixthsense awareness of a dark milling shape the rear end was bedding down and crabbing into the camber and there was no certainty of pulling out of here at all it depended on how the equation worked itself out weight of the mass speed of the wheels friction of the chains against the lubric medium we could sit here at full throttle and do nothing but make a noise until they came for us taking their tune id missed the armrest twice but got a grip on it now and he finished sidewayson to the door as i dragged it towards me but his weight smashed it open again the chains had found some purchase and the fiat would have gone forward if he hadnt been clinging to the door so i used an edgeofthehand chop downwards against his wrist and got it right and he fell forwards as his support broke the whole of the rear was vibrating on the springs as the chain cut at the tarmac and the inertia was killed so fast that we slewed half round as the power took up and sent us away from the camber with the door swinging back of its own accord mind your head the acceleration was shifting the loads rearward but the steering was still wild and we could hit something she hooked her gloved hands against the edge of the compartment and rested her head against them i would have told her she could sit upright now so that she could watch for a crash situation but there was just a chance theyd get confused and forget the directive about firearms something tore at the rear panel and the mirror had movement in it but it couldnt be the warszawa because of the distance the leading car in the traffic coming through from the lights had clouted us and in the mirror its shape swung away the drivingdoor had caught at half lock so i hit it open and slammed it as we pulled away in second with someone flashing us from behind and piling up very close because they hadnt left enough time for the braking conditions but this one wasnt a strike and i shaped for a rightangle turn through centralny park and suddenly we were in what seemed forest land the black trees spectral against the snowscape and the lights of other cars moving like slow lanterns between their trunks you might as well sit upright now they know youre on board we were going fast enough to qualify for a highimpact smash if i lost control clip your seat belt lights swung into the mirror is jan your brother what did you is jan ludwiczak your brother yes theyve got him in the th precinct bureau there might not be another chance to tell her the th piaty the lights were on full head hoping to dazzle and i tipped the glass a fraction the surface was much better here richlying snow accept for the intersections where the double volume of traffic had packed it harder our shadow swerved in front of us most of the time thrown by the warszawa who are you please visibility was good because of the albescence and the even spacing of the trees and to the right and left of the crossroads there was nothing in sight so i brought the speed up progressively and cleared the harderpacked area with deadpoint momentum between acceleration and deceleration obliquely aware that if we survived this day i would for long remember her calm and rather formal question as we and our shadow flew in whiteness among the winter trees who are you please theres nothing in a name i slowed on the engine for a lefthander at the tsection and lost everything in the next two seconds because of the ice patch that hadnt showed until we were on it fullcircle gyration with the wheel slack in my hands and the background slowly spinning so that for a moment we were sliding backwards and squinting straight into the glare of their lamps and then bucking suddenly with a rear tyre dragging on the buried kerbstone and sending us to the crown before i used the throttle and got some of the traction back and straightened out and kept going look im trying to make for sobieski very well at the edge of my vision field her white face was turned to watch me aleje sobieski was the street of the older fourstoreyed houses where the lift had a mirror and they thought they were safe there that nobody knew if i can lose them or smash them up ill drop you off there but i might have to drop you wherever i can if it gets difficult a wash of light flooded the interior again and the prismatic colours glowed on the bevelling of the mirror operate your belt clip a few times get used to the release we hadnt lost much ground during the spin the direction and speed had retained most of their values although wed gyrated through three hundred and sixty degrees but the warszawa was closer by thirty yards or so and i didnt like it because if we crashed it ought to happen far enough away from them to give us a chance of getting out on foot left into gwardzislow with a reliable drift across almost virgin snow and we ran now towards solec again just this side of the vistula i didnt know this area so well as the city centre but wed be all right as soon as wed cleared the tsection and crossed left on to the main westbank highway parallel to the river id studied the street complexes in that area while id been hanging about at heathrow and covered the rest of the central districts since id landed here normal routine orientation sobieski wasnt far but some of the oneway streets were going to sticky things up if i didnt watch it she was clicking her release not looking down at it doing it blind and it occurred to me that she might have been a hostess on the planes before they grounded her for some reason or shed got bored with handing out sweets because she was behaving very well considering the odds were that wed finish up by wiping the fiat all over a tram or worse of course if they could pick us alive out of a wreck theyd have us under the lamps for what the kgb called implemented interrogation she knew that you all right alinka yes thank you she looked behind her sometimes and i asked her what the distance was and she said about fifty metres and then we couldnt talk any more because the tsection was coming up and a red oblong was sliding across the end of the perspective but not a tram thered be no tramlines along the river stretch until we reached generala swierczewskiego and doubled back and tried to get near sobieski there was an antenna on their roof and theyd have begun fidgeting with it long before now but there wasnt much point in their calling on base to deploy support patrols because they didnt know where to send them if wed been taking a direct route out of the city they could have set up roadblocks but wed been doubling a lot of the time and all they could do was keep us in sight till we smashed it wasnt very good at the tsection we had to cross ulica solec to get on to the wybrzeze kosciuszkowskie along the vistula and there was some traffic piled up at the major fork we took the first set of lights on the green but had to brake the next on the red and i lost most of the front end trying to clear a pharmaceutical van and not successfully swinging it half round and hitting a drift that the river wind had swept against the centre bollards so that we slewed twice and skinned the long scarlet flank of a bus as the warszawa closed fast with its lights full on and its klaxon sounding a couple of mo police had a go at waving me in and their whistles were shrilling but there wasnt anything they could do and i was worried more by some nasty spin from the rear wheels as we crossed the packed ice of a bus stop the warszawa couldnt make progress either and we were both shaped up for the long straight haul down the river stretch with the gap drawing open slightly as i flicked into third and settled for the odd chance of piling up enough speed to try slotting some of the slower traffic between us and baulk them before we had to go left towards sobieski i didnt think we could lose them now it was instinctive to think in terms of overall speed but in these conditions it was traction that counted and i levelled off at fifty kph and even then we were well beyond the hope of slowing in time if anything crossed our bows the steering kept going slack and for periods we were skating across the surface without any real kind of control and then two things happened in close succession a black stunted moskwicz pulled away from the kerb and ahead of us i saw a truck the surface along here was mostly iceruts with patches of thin hard snow towards the crown there was no point in trying to plan anything because action designed to cope with the conditions lying ahead would be right or wrong according to what they turned out to be when we got there the little moskwicz wasnt a hazard we were already in the fast lane and i didnt even have to touch the wheel but i could see that the warszawa needed to take avoiding action and had started to do it our shadow thrown by its lights against the back of the truck was shifting to the right then something else happened and at first i thought it was gunfire because the effect followed the sound in logical sequence it was as if theyd shot one of our tyres flat chain one of the chains had gone its straps halfsevered when wed dragged a rear wheel along the buried kerbstone in the park it had hammered under the bodyshell and been flung aside and now the fiat was in a slow tendegree pivoting attitude and for the last tune the wheel went slack in my hands good luck she answered with something in polish then we heard the warszawa metal on metal and the explosive pop of safetyglass the light swept away from the truck and across to the buildings on the other side and went out it wasnt important now i cut the ignition there wasnt much noise just the long hushed skittering of the tyres over the ice as we waited the pivoting attitude was increasing and periodicy had set in and i knew that nothing could break it there must come the point where mass dominated momentum and then the fiat would automatically spin left and right wider to the left and wider to the right in a slow swinging action with the brittle whisper of the tyres across the ruts and she spun breaking wild and closing on the truck in a series of loops that took her down the camber to hit the kerb and rebound and spin again and strike it this tune front end on with the wheels rolling so that she mounted and ran straight for a while with the springs hammering at the limitblocks thick snow along the pavement now but the speed too high and the balustrade coming and the swirl of the eastbank lights tiding across the windscreen and then the balustrade and the impact and the drag on the seat belt and a period of weightlessness as we tilted nosedown and struck and shook and struck again and rolled half over the roof sliding the speed dying lights in the sky inverted reflected in the sheen of the ice the thought coming black water below glass shattered i kicked at the screen she was already on her feet as i slithered from under the front end shed used the side window breaking it a faint sound had begun the crackling strain of the icecrust between here and the bank she was moving at an angle loping forward not far from me the surface was blackish here and we made for the nearest patch of white but the crackling became loud and we couldnt run without slipping and falling she turned once and i told her to get on then the crust shivered and broke in a long crescent and i heard the fiat strike water a gigantic bubbling behind us sand a sandbank the thin ice breaking as we trod its edges then stones the ankles freezing quite a long way off the high alternating notes of an emergency vehicle keep moving there were steps going upwards theyll see us she said no they wont there was snow on the steps and we went up slowly a frieze of icicles along the higher plinth flashed diamond colours as the first lamp showed i told her to wait and climbed the last three steps ahead of her checking the street small group round the hole in the balustrade where wed gone through well over a hundred yards from here wed breached it at an angle and the fiat had slid quite a long way downriver before wed got out bigger group half a mile distant on the roadway a lot of people and vehicles the ambulance klaxon had stopped i nodded to her and she came up into the lamplight dark eyes glowing in a bloodless face the blue greatcoat ripped at the shoulder the patentleather kneeboots neatly together on the snow as she stood with her head turned to look along the street theyre too busy i said for us she faced me without expression as if she didnt quite understand it was shock that was all shock setting in it hadnt been much of an impact because wed hit the iron balustrade obliquely and the stanchions had broken away the edge of the stonework the thing was only meant for leaning on while you had a sandwich and the belts had kept us back it was listening to the crackling of the ice that had worried us most i put my arm round her shoulders and we started off crossing over and going down ulica lipowa away from the river nobody noticed us the few people we passed were watching where they put their feet but we had to turn back twice along the krakowskie przedmiescie to avoid mo patrols i didnt know what the situation was down by the river the warszawa had made a lot of noise but there could be survivors and their radio might not have been bust up sobieski was a quiet narrow street more like a mews and we got into the building without needing to check in the lift i said have you got a source for papers what did you say she leaned against the mirror her dark eyes vague and her gloved hands pressed to her face she had more to deal with than the physical shock of the fiat thing we hadnt talked much on the way here and shed had time to think and what shed probably thought was that if the policia ubespieczenia had decided to pull her in it was because jan hadnt managed to hold out identity papers can you get a new one easily the cable tapped against one of the guide rails no we made some but they were not good people were caught with them give me yours its no more use to you it was a recent photograph not much like her they never are when i looked up she was watching me uneasy they are like that or they become like that the people of the police states they mean so much to them these dogeared little cards with their creased folds and their grandiloquent crests polska rzeczpospolita ludowa take them away and you take away their identity leaving them nameless i knew what was in her mind as she watched me put the card into my pocket tonight id blown my cover and that was just as bad the lift stopped its floor jogging slowly to stillness under foot will there be someone here yes shed started shivering with nerves and i was suddenly fed up because id mucked it she wouldnt be spending the next five years stitching boots in the strictregime camps but it had been a hell of a way to pull her out of a snatch i might have killed her in the passage i said tell them to fix you up with something hot vodka grog or something i took my time going down the stairs because she couldnt be sure that someone was there you could be there one day and the next day you could be in the th precinct bureau or some other rotten hole three short one long when i heard the mirror shut i cleared the rest of the stairs a bit quicker because there was a lot to do contact do you know this woman hotel pulawski no go id been working against a deadline and it was already past because they wouldnt wait till theyd dredged the fiat out of the river theyd be on to me before that wed started o from the tramstop at ulica solec somewhere between and and as soon as theyd seen i was going to try giving them a run theyd have radioed the number to their base we are now in pursuit of dovegrey fiat warsawregistered so forth do you know this woman hotel dworzec no go give them ten minutes to channel the number into registrations control and five minutes for registration to come up with the answer and fifteen minutes for the first patrol to reach orbis and get the place opened up and find the relevant documentation yes we booked this one out on the th to a british visitor p k longstreet passport number c give them another fifteen minutes to cover the city with a general alert call by mobilepatrol radios and reportpoint telephones and that made it a shortlimit deadline of so at the police would have started combing the hotels just as i was doing do you know this woman hotel francuski no go that was why id begun sweating we were working the same ground any time between june and september or anywhere south of latitude i could have holedup in the open but this was warsaw in january and if you didnt get under a decent roof youd freeze it didnt matter that by now they might have found the bag with the leather panel coming away from the stitches at one end they were welcome to what they pulled out of it because if i were still a free agent tomorrow i was going to sting that bloody woman in accounts for a set of new winter woollies they wouldnt stop looking for me once they knew id left the hotel they knew id have to find another one i had to have somewhere to live do you know this woman hotel alzacki i showed him the dogeared identitycard he looked at it i was relying on his impression of events to cover my accent theres no precise equivalent for the palatals hi english and youve got to do it with the tip of the tongue on the lower teeth and the middle pressed towards the alveolar ridge and it takes practice and i hadnt had much but events were that a man in a black leather coat and fur kepi had come quickly up to the desk and pushed someones papers in front of his face and shot a terse question and his impression was predictable and he didnt ask to see my badge now i watched for his reaction i couldnt hurry him get it over with and get out if it was no go again i had to stand there with ice down my spine because if that door opened behind me it could be one of his guests coming in or it could be one of the several hundred police who were now checking the hotels for p k longstreet the name wasnt here on the books of the hotel alzacki but although they didnt know my face except for a vague description by orbis they wouldnt miss checking my papers and theyd see it there instead ive never seen her before no reaction there was a lot of noise like the building coming down a brass ashtray crept like a crab across the polished top of the counter he didnt notice anything i took her card back and spun the register towards me to look at the names but i didnt look at the names yet i went on looking at him reaction nothing happened to his face it was big and square with creases weathered into it a seamans face that had looked into the eye of the storm and stared it out irongrey bismarck head and an ear torn at the lobe boathook or the dying flick of a sharkfin salt in his soul nothing that i could say would change a face like this but the reaction was there all right and it had come when id spun the register hed drawn a slow breath as hed straightened up and shifted his feet a bit to redispose his weight as a man of his weight does ive never seen her before shaking his head it was just a hundredth of a degree too natural and there was another thing hed shifted his weight but it had given an odd slant to his attitude and he stood as a onelegged sailor stands but i didnt think he was onelegged of course hed never seen her before it was nothing to do with that it was the number id used to open my act that was all to show i was the hunter and not the hunted it hadnt worried him but the register had the way id spun it round to have a look there wouldnt be anything there i knew that if you take a man in and put him in a garret with a wardrobe shoved across the door you dont enter his name in the book it was just that i was getting warm a hotel register is a revealing document and the police go for it first and even if theres nothing in it to reveal its like when you show your visa and wonder for an instant if credentials have made a mistake and its out of date your stomach does a slight skidturn the building fell down again but among all the noise i heard a voice from upstairs and a door banging this place would do me id like a room his heavy lids lifted the police wont ask for a room if they want to search a hotel they just bring a bulldozer they dont have to sleep there you wont mind the noise they dont run all night what kind of room do you want he turned the register with a horny hand ill need your papers ive no papers that i can show anyone thats the kind of room i want nice and high up and out of peoples way and with someone down here to press the buzzer with his foot when the police made a visit you cant stay here without papers i didnt expect him to trust me but there was a way at least we can have a drink in the back room he poured out some jasne beer and i mentioned czyn it wasnt by luck that id only had to try four hotels almost everyones in the underground merrick had said i gave my accent a lot more rope now as i talked to him throwing out the palatals and throwing in some rich somerset rs have the police been here yet looking for an englishman about fifteen minutes ago hes wanted for helping czyn they were trying to make an arrest and he stopped them what was his name theyre hard for me english names but they wrote it down for you hes looking for a hotel so you were to phone them if he came to yours i got out my passport is this the name yes that one it was a small room on the fifth floor with a decent temperature due to a fat black pipe with convector fins that ran from floor to ceiling he said it was the actual chimney of the boilerhouse feeding the middle room on all floors this side of the building the window was frosted up and i had to open it to take bearings platforms and of the warszawa glowna with a signalbox down towards the shuntyards the street vertically below and with no canopies or jutting roofs the fire escape was wrought iron and unobstructed i didnt ask when he left me who the other man was the one hed buzzed it wasnt my business he caught his breath but i said it was all right and he fell into step quickening his to mine id been hanging about for nearly an hour and i needed some circulation we walked by the vistula along kosciszkowskie because it was mainly for traffic and there wouldnt be so many mo patrols shakily he said i thought youd been arrested what for it had checked me for an instant because i didnt think his communications could be as fast as that then i realised what the poor little devil meant well i mean ive been expecting you to contact me i have the snow was brittle charcoal grey from the smoke of the factories and above us the sodium lamps cast a pallor rather than light objects and their shadows looked derelict destroyed as if we picked our way through the ashen afterglow of the city that not long before had burned under the droning sky in a different way it was dying now with less dignity less rage this morning theyd done for horodecki a majorgeneral at the military academy not a headline just a couple of columninches on page three a man of honour and high purposes his brother the chairman of the national assembly and a leading delegate for the eastwest talks no trial he was too popular for dangerous publicity but summary medical certification by a psychiatric board onset of acute paranoid manifestations with earlier developed symptoms of atherosclerosis put him away no dignity in that no rage and widespread dissension among the proletariat page six with absenteeism at the factories up by thirty per cent pilfering of state property minor sabotage and slogans across the walls the city dying again but in a different way no mourners but the dead themselves have you got anything for me he fumbled for an envelope dropping it because of his stiff gloves and i stood looking down at him as he picked it off the snow he never got anything right tripping on things and dropping things his hands never steady his nerves in his eyes had he been any better than this before egerton had reached for him out of the dark and infected him with the spirit of subterfuge and sent him out here to forage for scraps among the dustbins of a sick society had he been all right once all of a piece and uncontaminated busy with his own little schoolboy dreams of lighting a candle for the oppressed not egertons responsibility of course he was rather wished on to me but egerton could have refused to direct him if hed chosen instead of which hed been party to the decision to use an innocent for their own ends for the ends of the bureau a sacrifice to the sacred bull so here was their key man in warsaw wiping the wet soot off an envelope before holding it out to me his eyes wide with worry behind the glasses his face deathly under the sodium lamps im sorry he said it had been such a nice clean envelope his very first report for london and as i took it i cursed him for uncovering something that id thought had been long ago buried under all those years of deceit and betrayal a sense of compassion as my thumb ripped along the fold i wondered by how much herrick himself had been party to that decision because he could have refused too but like the people of this city hed been driven to pilfering a bit of freedom for himself halffrightened and halfdefiant by taking on an enterprise so secret that despite the official sanction of strangers his own father couldnt be told that was the only kick he was getting out of this he was striking a petty blow against tyranny and the deceit in it was prescribed by others leaving his conscience clear this all theres quite a lot its closely typed i read bits of it as we neared the bridge fifteen autonomous units dispersed topographically about the city at what appeared to be strategic points liaison by cutouts fully completed arrangements for street barricades sniperposts and grenade areas the three main power stations already rigged for blasting by radiocontrolled detonators initial stages marked sroda minus sroda minus so forth final stages just marked sroda wednesday wednesday th three days before the opening of the talks seven days from now sailing a bit near the wind arent they how do you mean theyre giving themselves three days to blow this thing open and clear up all the blood and brickdust before the delegates arrive if any delegates arrive at all id say most of themll be crouching in doorways counting their rosaries wouldnt you the whole idea is to mount a threat not an action excitement came into his tone therell be action all right if theyre driven to it but the aim is to bring of a bloodless coup detat by showing their strength at a time when itll be too late for the warsaw pact troops to retaliate the talks are very important to moscow youll find a summary on page five of the public references to the russian hopes of their success and no one in czyn believes theyll risk sending tanks into the city at a tune like this how could they a light wind blew across the bridge and i folded the sheets and put them away and we walked faster again whos the leader several mentions they never use his name i think hes a deputy hi the party committee quite high up thats why theyre confident that therell be no tanks sent in you see because someone in his position would know what moscows intentions would be at a confrontation get his name in the distance we heard a stationary diesel throbbing and people shouting half a mile upriver there was a ring of floodlights with figures moving about the boom of a crane stuck out from the bank across the break in the ice with a dark oblong turning slowly at the end of the cable whats happening down there merrick stopped looking across the balustrade of the bridge water poured from the oblong shape as it was swung towards the bank the shouting died away and the figures were still now watching it had been a cold job they must have been hours at it how many copies i asked him when hed caught me up have you got of this report ive got the only carbon and youve got the original in future i want the carbon i wont be adding anything youre doing this job not me how many people at the embassy know only he i saw them and turned round come on merrick he came trotting after me whens bag day tomorrow his breath wheezed eleventhirty tut this in c plus visa plus identity card and a short encoded note that ought to take egertons mind off his chilblains for a bit blown cover send new one west german image also new ie as per example enclosed for wanda rek ulica niska profession journalist other details same same photo below youre cushy he took the packet and dont drop the bloody thing third series fifthdigit duplications there was no point in using the telex or dip radio because all i wanted out of egerton were some papers to show so that i didnt have to keep spinning round like a ferret when it sees a fox it was inconvenient merrick had a job getting his breath and i didnt think he even knew what the hurry was but hed cotton on give him a hundred years and hed cotton on when does the bag come in saturday will there be something for you it wasnt giving them long but itd shake the dust up never a bad thing at the bureau i didnt want to turn my head theyd just started on to the bridge when id seen them and wed been walking faster than they should be but the trouble was that the pressure was getting higher every day unless you looked like a robot theyd pull you in and if there werent any tanks in this city a week from now itd be because there was nobody left to shoot at yes the wind cut at our faces if customs decide its a nice day for a snap check try and distract their attention shut their arse in a door or something will you call for it no keep it on you all right nearing the end of the bridge he said are we dont look back theyd shut down the diesel our feet scuffed over the snow his breathing was painful and when i finally couldnt stand it and what they were doing to him and what i was doing to him i left him and went down the steps and along the riverbank where it was dark czyn everyones always complaining at norfolk that in weapons recognition theyre sketchy about the headonimage the artist is fond of a certain forgetmenot blue for the shading and we think hes a pouf but the diagrammatic vital statistics are up to scratch and theres a clever system using key colours for giving what amounts to a visual permutation table for the types of ammo interchangeable among the runofthemill international models but they havent yet conceded the obvious point that we need a set of oblique headon pictures at something like ten or twelve degrees from the line of sight and a specially big one from above because the heads a smaller target and the aim is normally at the stomach or the heart so that youre looking slightly down at the image the only picture they give us is smack into the line of sight so it looks like an endon view of a sausage roll with no sausage in it but this was an easy one a typolt mk xi shortrange sub with sixteen in the drum and i was looking slightly down at it in the normal way i couldnt see whether it was at safe or fire but by the look on his face i knew i ought not to move he had the intent gaze of a bird the iris so dark that the eye seemed all pupil the other one was glass not too well made the streaks of white in his ruffled hair the deepcut lines in the face the strong hooked nose the scratched leather covering of his mechanical hand and his crouched attitude all gave him the look of an eagle mauled in some foray the plumage torn but the pride fiercer than ever the man behind me shut the inner door of the soundlock who are you in polish the room was big but cluttered with trestle tables and sagging settees and a vast carved lublin dresser with a gec transmitterreceiver stuffed into it designers desk covered with papers bottle of wyborowka vodka and three tumblers some tins of meat pair of leather gauntlets with the fleece sticking through a gash packet of sport the stacked boxes in the corner farthest from the stove looked like ammo thick smell of black leaf its all right she told them shed come from behind a baize folding screen i heard a kettle boiling hes the englishman she came towards me so that he had to shift his aim alinka impatiently she said over her shoulder ive told you hes all right viktor black sweater and slacks she wouldnt be wearing the uniform any more she was thinner than i remembered or it was that black accentuated the lean lines of her body as she moved towards me with a controlled rhythm and stopped facing me her patentleather kneeboots neatly together i know that this was how she moved and stilled herself ive learned more about people by their bearing than by anything else even their eyes because it has a permanency and expresses what they are and not just what theyre feeling in english she said ive told them about you alinka his voice was rough with anger did you tell him how to get in here she turned away this time controlling her impatience and i sensed that it was something theyd all had to learn to be patient with viktor hed lowered the gun but his bright eye burned at me no she said he knew how did he know does it matter she held a tumbler to the light and poured some vodka he knew they were going to arrest me but i didnt ask him how he knew im still free thats what counts she brought the vodka to me with quick lithe strides can i know your name longstreet drink i owe you that who are you it was the other man the one whod sat with her in the kawiarnia his big confident hands clasped on the table and sometimes thumping it gently for emphasis but he hadnt eased the fright in her they were all frightened here i asked him what did you say doesnt he speak polish if he did she shrugged would he have to speak to you in german he watched me steadily a good face with the eyes well apart under a wide flat brow the mouth long and compressed contemplative hed be their mainstay here the one who never panicked but i thought that at this moment his confidence had never been under such a strain it wasnt because of me i knew that she said to me this is leo polanski my god do you have to tell him our names please viktor she said quietly polanski inclined his head still watching me he said you have helped us ich verstehe nicht you have helped us he said this time in german but we need to know who you are i turned and put the vodka untouched on the corner of the littered desk there were several versions of who i was but i didnt know which one i ought to give them is it not all right she asked im driving there was actual need for me to tell them who i was it would simply be for the sake of putting them at their ease if i didnt satisfy them they might stop me coming here again they could do that easily enough by changing the signal it might take a little time for them to see that theyd have to cooperate with me because a changed signal wouldnt stop a police squad if i cared to tip them off theyd drill right round the door with heavy calibre rapid fire like opening a tin of course it might take them less time to see that i ought not to be let out of here at all it made no difference that id been of use to them in the last few days before a citywide revolution there could be a change of fortune and loyalties and if it suited my book i could have them dragged out of here and slung into the interrogation cells and later packed into the special windowless trains for the camps in the komi republic viktor realised that much it was in the burning dark of his one good eye as it stared at me he was the only professional here too young for the war but old enough to have manned the barricades in the poznan riots maybe that was where hed trained im an observer youre going to start a war arent you youll need western observers id spoken to polanski but it was viktor who answered limping quickly to the desk and ripping open the packet of sport holding it against his chest with his mechanical hand left leg left hand left eye grenade or a mine whats your paper im freelance where has your stuff appeared most places what byline pseudonymous you wont leave here unless you can do a lot better than that the match flared and then his head jerked and he was staring towards the door of the soundlock and polanski said josef three short one long alinka didnt move she stood perfectly still closing her eyes i could believe she was praying polanski opened the first door then the second and josef came in stumbling hitting the acoustic padding with his shoulder and straightening up and looking at no one a white face bright with sweat and the eyes flickering from shock his breath coming in gusts as he stood in the middle of the room a short clownish figure swaying with the uncertain stance of a bear on its hind legs his thick coat hanging open blood on the sleeve it wasnt any good the neck of a bottle trembled on the rim of a glass never mind jo polanski said are you hurt no he took it and drank and she waited and he let out a long shuddering breath thats not my blood we lost zygmunt and jacek he drank again and she tried to make him sit down but he shook her away and told them all of it all there was the main doors breached with five stickbombs according to plan and jacek and himself in there first with karol giving them cover and jerzy standing by with the stolen van but the alarm had gone off and theyd only had tune to open up the first three cells and jan hadnt been there and theyd had to come away before they were cut off she took his empty glass thank you for trying jo next time polanski said they werent frightened any more because they knew the worst now and it could have been worse than this jan wasnt here but jo was back he nodded quickly his mood suddenly changing a wicked smile creasing his clowns face the ends of his long mouth turning upwards next time yes whos this the anglik she told him so he grasped my hand in both his own and i felt the surprising strength in them we need people like you alinka told us how sorry huh she told us how you drove jesus i drove into the river well anyone can make a mistake no you did a swell job no kiddn jo dont tell him anything dont what he looked across at viktor what like we dont know who he is yet we can ask him cant we he switched so fast that it was like two different people talking what outfit are you with pal the lid of the kettle had started rattling minutes ago and alinka went round the screen im on my own hes on his own that isnt enough its enough for me he shrugged his coat off and dropped it across a settee and poured some vodka viktors a wonderful guy a very wonderful guy but he took a beating and it was because some bastard put the skids under him see someone he trusted so now when his own mother holds out a cookie he bites her fingers off you get it an now hes steamed up because its getting close to the big day were all of us kinda jumpy you know what im talkin about wednesday the sounds were distant at first the traffic seemed a little heavier that was all sure wednesday he raised his glass his smile very bright you think theyll send tanks in they can try we have the approach routes mined what are the chances of what for you doors slamming look this isnt prague they werent prepared we are were taking the initiative you get it theres thirty thousand russian troops in this country and if theyre goin to use them okay theyre goin to use them but if their tanks get in were not goin to throw whitewash over them like they did in prague were goin to shoot back this wont be a walkover itll be a war they wouldnt have dared to go into prague if thered been military resistance how can the ussr let itself be seen fighting a war with one of its own loyal satellites even if it could win the bright smile was frozen now weve raised an army here fifteen units of picked men men like viktor okay men like me men who will not have the land of their fathers turned into a penitentiary for stateregistered juvenile delinquents right we have stockpiles strategically dispersed subguns grenades landmines you name it wednesday morning hours the three main generating stations hit the sky will you be here dont be here wednesday pal he tossed back the last of his drink alinka was moving across to us halfway she stopped and stood listening viktor and polanski had been talking together and now they were silent jo i said is it the only way into this place by the elevator huh yep i guess we just sweat it out hed heard them there was a question i didnt want to ask him voices now not coming from any particular direction just through the walls through the floor the building had come alive doors slamming again but this tune inside the building the doors of the apartments the thudding of jackboots alinka was very still so was polanski viktor had gone for the gun and picked it up and now he sat with it across his knees jo hadnt moved but his eyes had narrowed and they began flickering as if the light was too bright he had stopped smiling and his face looked as it had when id first seen him come lurching in here blank with shock he was a man who lived hot and worked best when he was bombing his way into a precinct bureau and now there was nothing he could do but stand here while his nerves drew thin and the blood receded leaving a mortuary pallor perhaps he knew it now the question i didnt want to ask him had he been followed here listening you would have said there were rats running behind the walls their sound magnified last night id gone half a mile through the shadows of the riverwalk before climbing and cutting across the city centre to the hotel and on the way id seen this taking place hi a quiet street near dworzec srodmiescie they didnt hurry there were no klaxons or shrilling tyres yet the operation was incredibly fast three warszawa saloons pulling up near the middle of the street with an mo riotsquad jeep at each end to block it off ten seconds and five hundred people made captive as if a net had dropped from the night most of them hadnt even known in the privacy of their apartments at their ease in the intimate light of the television screens nothing had told them that for fifteen minutes a paralysis had held them powerless that there had occurred a visitation of the state some had known it wasnt a general search but a raid with specific objectives you are franciszek labedz you will come with us five or six of them guided across the pavement to the waiting saloons the sharp click of the doors the jab of starters a child had run after one group and its mother had pulled it back i remembered the childs voice piping across the snow more than other things i remembered that i found polanskis eyes on me we looked at each other without communication we were looking in our minds at what we heard this was a general search noisy and with nothing in the orders about discretion most of the sound came to us through a lightproofed ventilator high hi the wall above the lublin dresser the sound of boots on the stone stairs the rapping on the doors music from a radio out of tune with events voices surprised co sie stalo policia far away under the same sky the moan of a tram along the krakowskie przedmiescie thered been a door here in the wall opposite the stove and two windows one each side of the dresser the edges were still visible but thered have been a better job done on the other side the door sealed and plastered over the windows bricked up teraz natychmiast iron knuckles in suede gloves open your door the state is here and you are state property i am the state open boots tramped along the wall where the door had been and polanskis head turned slowly as he listened as if he saw their coated figures his eyes were steady it was jo who moved jackknifing like a puppet with the strings suddenly cut i was near enough to break his fall and alinka came and crouched by him whispering hes been giving too much blood he goes twice every week to the clinic blood for wednesday id seen the queues patient in the snow blood for sroda the sudden scream of a woman wladislaw uwazaj viktors right hand was stroking the submachinegun his head lifting as he heard the cry jestza pozno theyd got a man the scream fell to a dying cadence becoming sobs id never seen such rage in a face as i saw now in the face of viktor his eye the eye of an eagle caged and goaded sroda he said to the wall to the boots and the belted coats sroda he promised the woman who tonight would sleep alone polanski heard him sroda polanski said then they left the building their sound ebbing as when a wave fills a gulley and drains away someone had switched off the radio and there was no more music from it faint voices called among the corridors as if people had lost their way engines in the street wed got jo on to one of the settees legs raised and head down droplets of sweat sprang as fast as alinka wiped them away if they let me out of here i said to her they might change the signal the day i will not let them she said quickly they might not listen the day after tomorrow your new karta should be here if they change the signal youll have to get someone to fetch it ill be at the bar kino at nine in the evening ulica czackiego saturday i had to get clear now jo had confirmed the overall situation as reported by merrick and it was all i needed and i didnt want to be still here when the rot set in at any given minute in any given ub bureau someone else was going to break under interrogation and this building would be opened up again and sixteen rounds from a typolt mk xi wouldnt do much more than fill the place with smoke theyd send in riotsquads if they had to the kino she said then jo began lolling his head from side to side and we sat him up it was no good telling them to get out of here with me because there wasnt anywhere they could go wherever they went theyd risk exposure jan ludwiczak hadnt been told where this safehouse was located or theyd have smashed the mirror by now but every time one of them left here the rest were at risk it would be the same anywhere else polanski stood looking down at jo viktor hadnt moved the gun was still across his knees he seemed lost in some other time and some other place maybe the barricades of sroda all right jo polanski said i dont know why it happens it happens because you keep going to the clinic from now onwards youll keep away i began moving to the door halfway across the room i heard the slight clink of a slingbuckle as viktor swung the gun but i went on moving because this side of a verbal warning i thought i was probably safe i didnt know how stable he was but id seen they had to handle him with patience stoj i turned around in german polanski said quietly all we want to know is who you are jo was trying to get off the settee but alinka stopped him it looked as if you didnt go too near viktor when he had his finger inside the guard but she was angry brittle of speech vikki you know what he did for me polanski said to me we dont want to make any conditions he wet his lips compressing them youd be free to go if he moved a loose hand the one nearer to viktor we trust you but we want to feel safe here and you knew how to find us who told you thats really what worries us we know the british are on our side to the point of actual diplomatic backing and we know what youve done for us personally so it must seem were being mean with our thanks but if youll just give us vikki jo said with his eyes squeezed into bright slits youve got ten seconds to put that damn thing down and then im coming to get it alinka murmured something to him polanski watched me with worried eyes i didnt know how much logic viktor was capable of following but it had to be tried one of you led me here i looked away from polanski and down the length of the room at the ravaged untrusting face above the snout of the typolt thats how i knew nobody told me you exposed your safehouse because youre amateurs you dont know when youre being followed or when the police are moving in to pick you up and when one of you gets pulled in you dont know where he is till somebody tells you and then you go in with bombs instead of a blueprint so you never get near enough to spring him youve no source of counterfeit papers so the minute youre on the wanted list youve got to get off the streets and where do you go to a refuge with only one exit and not even a judashole and my name for that is a trap the day i arrived in this city i didnt know you existed id only been told but my job was to locate you and within fortyeight hours id done that im a professional and for me it was routine but for you it could have been fatal none of you would be here now if my interests didnt coincide with yours but it happens that they do so lets put that thing back in the toycupboard and go through our twicetimes again youve struck some luck when you need it most ive been useful to you and i can be useful again but not on your terms on mine viktor hadnt moved i met the fixed black stare of his eye but learned nothing from it there was courage in this face and suffering but no sign that it could recognise an appeal to reason i said im going now if you shoot remember youll be shooting away one of your own barricades as i turned my back on him i heard someone move behind me but it was too late to do anything except keep on going and it wasnt until i was through the soundlock and shutting the outer door that i saw her lean black figure standing across his line of fire it took nearly fifteen minutes to check and recheck for surveillance because of the lightconditions and wallangles and the lack of effective cover theyd only raided one side of the building and they could have posted some people in the area to observe later movements the damned place was a trap then i was filtering through the network of narrow streets where the snow was thick and the lamps few and the night quiet encoding in my mind a fully urgent signal to egerton telling him that tonight the whole pattern had shifted and that something was wrong hellishly wrong rendezvous steam burst across the red lamp and left its bloodied plumes blowing in the dark and wheels rolled iron on iron no one was there it had gone and he crouched in front of the ammoboxes rubbing his cobbled fingers and steel rang dull as a cracked bell see him and pull him out it was getting too close they wouldnt like that but he was no better off than i was he couldnt even take care of himself theyd only got to bust open one of the czyn places while he was there doing his homework like a good boy and theyd clink the poor little sod for aiding and abetting dissident factions clandestinely engaged in activities against the polska rzeczpospolita ludowa so forth make his excellency the british ambassador look a right lemon soot clouded between the massive spokes and he blew his whistle his black bright eye watching me above the drum of the typolt no go i said not even a judashole they ran right to the horizon leaning together till their tips touched in a point one of them was coming it was small at first because of the distance and you wouldnt notice it if you hadnt spent years ferreting in the back streets of the political hinterlands then youd see it sticking out a mile thered been a definite pattern and it had shifted suddenly as if his finger had tapped a kaleidoscope we know the british are on our side to the point of actual diplomatic backing oh are they really well thats very interesting it came fast and grew gigantic a black mountain on the move towards me and she lay there with her lean body stretched under the lamp her shadowed ivory breast tipped with blue in the deathly light and a dark curl creeping hi the wing of her arm then the sky was blotted out and it was on me with a shriek and i was down too many friends next time theyll make sure his heads under the wheel the long sound of it drew out thinning to silence and a signal clattered the ceiling was dark again polyphasic sleep had left me surfaced and i leaned across her a dream fragment persisting and checked the time the to krakow via lodz and czestochowa a black brute loosed southwards across the snows fqb fqqi lub ddqb gjuu hhr ixxn gls eedf nlqq jri srrw hqw oouh yoxx wqk huuh id seen one this morning with weak sunlight throwing clear reflections on the windows because all the blinds were down it had drawn away slowly eastwards towards the russian frontier third series with fifthdigit duplications and recurring blanks normal contractions can you confirm any degree of uk diplomatic backing of potential revolution here but i wouldnt send it somewhere on the crest of a sleepcurve the thought had come egerton knew and he expected me to know to have found out all he wanted was for me to do something about it he was waiting for some raw intelligence to give his analysts not for a signal saying look my drawers are all wet how did that happen there wasnt a lot of time merrick might get me some stuff on this but we were both moving into the red sector by now and id have to pull him out before long behind the official preparations for the reception of the western delegates there was a much bigger operation running and the trains were rolling east the thing was that czyn was being fed with doped sugar the ussr wasnt alone in hoping for the total success of the talks the usa britain france and the benelux states had been grooming their spokesmen since last august and the message was perfectly clear the cold war had been devalued from the moment it was seen that short of global annihilation a hot war couldnt be won detente was back in fashion and when the bonn delegation arrived in warsaw thered be quite a few bricks of the berlin wall lying on the ground if the talk succeeded they wouldnt be the last theyd open the way and the uk would give diplomatic backing to a fullscale revolution in poland as promptly as it would put the whole of its sterling reserves on a threelegged hundredtoone outsider with its arse to the tapes at the off theyd know this if their minds werent inflamed with their dreams of manning the barricades in the holy name of the motherland the smell of the soot came now it always took a few minutes the building was old and decade after decade the trains had shaken it loosening tiles on the roof and the cement round the doors and windows and making cracks in the brickwork so now it was like a sponge absorbing the smell of soot and diesel gas and exuding the smell of bigos and karp po polsku from the kitchen below i assumption the doped sugar was being fed to czyn by an agency purporting to be british and spuriously offering diplomatic backing in exchange for information this agency served a state considered alien to resurgent poland or it wouldnt have to assume british identity rule out the west the cia and the deuxieme bureau and the gehlen organisation and the little mailorder firm in geneva that sent all its bills in plain envelopes to nato what information information on the activities of czyn we were getting that without any offers of backing egerton had meant what he said to merrick nor must you lead them to feel that the united kingdom is in any way prepared to assist them in whatever projects they have in mind morally physically officially or unofficially you must not even let them infer that such is the case from anything you say and if you think that despite your caution they have so inferred then you must negate it is that perfectly understood hed been so specific that hed clearly known at that time what id learned only last night that someone was softfooting it round the warsaw cellars with a borrowed union jack poking out of his breast pocket and merrick would follow that explicit order to the letter his anxiety to make a good showing in his first mission was half killing him from behind me his numbed face reflected against the dark trees of the park hed said with fledgling courage i wont let you down that was his one fear recheck and rule out the hairline possibility that it was mi and not a foreign agency the bureau doesnt exist publicly or officially simply because its empowered to do things that could never be admitted publicly or officially to have been done and built into its anatomy is a selfdestruction unit triggered to go off in the instant when any one of its operations runs wild enough to risk exposing it we all know that each of the shadow executives in the overseas missions echelon has the suffix after his code name to indicate his proven reliability under torture and among the facilities available to agents in clearance is the deathpill because one single operative nosing his way through the warrens of a sensitive area in manchuria or paraguay can hit a counterintelligence tripwire and blow up london control that was why thered been a deathhouse chill over the bureau last week when a wheel had come off in gaza they didnt know where it would roll and that was why merrick for all his tailwagging eagerness to bring us the right bone would have to work through half a dozen missions of increasing complexity before his director would brief him anywhere but in a taxi the situation that ruled out mi was that despite its official nonexistence the bureau was responsible to the same minister and therefore subject to the same policy syllogism the minister dictated policy to both agencies the bureau had orders to negate any inference that the uk might assist polish insurgents the same orders would have been received by mi ergo mi could be ruled out qed it wasnt the ussr for one thing the setup was untypical of russian thinking and for another thing theyd rather tuck a broken stinkbomb into their breast pocket than a flag of the decadent capitalists even for the indirect purpose of hurrying their ruin if moscow wanted information on czyn it didnt have to get it by subterfuge the trainloads quietly leaving the city for the frontier at briest would be passed through the interrogation centres before their dispersal to the camps the snowball effect was already in operation one member of czyn efficiently grilled in the detention cells would buy an eastbound ticket for at least two of his fellow crusaders so there was no one no one with any reason to use the uk as a cover for extracting information from czyn yet it was being done the room was too small shutting me in the window was opaque coated with ice and i couldnt see beyond it i got off the bed and pulled my coat round my shoulders standing by the window to scrape at the ice with my nails a ragged hole grew against the glass and i went on scraping until i could see a lamp below in the station and then other lamps beyond and finally the soft blue haze of the city thrown by the sodium lights and deflected upwards from the snow against the faces of the buildings and the farther my eyes could reach the farther my mind could range and i knew with sudden tingling clarity that tonight id arrived at the edge of the area that control wanted me to explore and that once inside it i must tread with infinite care the bar roxana he didnt know where it was on jerozolimskie the line wasnt bugged id got the picture on the embassy before leaving london and part of it was that three weeks ago the clicks and echoes had become so bad that theyd interfered with the actual conversation so theyd fired a diplomatic rocket at the polish foreign ministry suggesting they took a look at clause para ii of the instrument of convention reference facilities granted to foreign missions and that such telephonic installations shall at all times be free of technical modification everyone does it of course theres a jukebox in a cupboard within sight of the cenotaph where you can enjoy a doityourself linguaphone course right round the clock but now and then a rocket goes in and for a few weeks his excellency can date his bunnies without it actually getting into hansard when did i want him to be at the rendezvous say half an hour he sounded worried because it was the first specific rdv wed made and he was wondering why i couldnt just pick him up in the street as id done before he didnt say anything about this he just said that hed start out for the roxana straight away before he could ring off i said use a taxi get it to drop you off somewhere neutral like a post office and then do the last few blocks on foot they put a tag on you from the residence to the chancellery this morning so make sure youre clean id used a phonebox midway between the hotel and the bar so that id be certain to get there first there was a busqueue opposite and i stood there for nearly thirty minutes in the cutting wind before he came then i gave it five minutes and it was all right so i followed him inside and ordered vodka grogs it took you long enough im sorry he looked like death how many were there only one i think you think only one he couldnt look away from the door dont worry i checked he looked away now his eyes red from the wind that had cut behind his glasses his glasses magnifying them magnifying the fright in them did you then he got the thing out and pumped it excuse me im having you pulled out of warsaw he looked as if id hit him what have i done wrong nothing this isnt your game thats all it was the first time hed had to flush a tag and if it had left him shot to shreds like this then how in gods name was he ever going to survive until it became just a natural act like blowing your nose i havent been at it very long the best time to pull out but the thing was that i couldnt do it to him and i knew that check his reports keep him out of trouble those were my orders and i could signal london till the telex seized up and it wouldnt do any good because they wanted him out here and they didnt care if it killed him and they didnt care if i had to stick here and watch them do it ill get better he said as i go along he couldnt get his breathing right and i knew by the way he hung on to his mug of grog that he was fighting the urge to fetch out the atomiser again and shame himself with it dont send me back i looked away its not in my hands i just wish to christ it was have you got anything for me it wasnt much a couple of sheets certain changes of plan in spearhead deployment reduction of present radio contact to minimise risk increasing importance of persontoperson liaison so forth nothing about what i was looking for which unit was this the one they wiped out yesterday the one in tamka where the power station is yes where theyd fixed up radiocontrolled detonators yes his tone was numb and he sat hunched in desolation and i was fed up with it well they wont go off now will they let there be light next wednesday and there will indeed be light its a bloody shame isnt it merrick itd be nice to think we were looking at a report on something thats going to make history a glorious revolution wresting the independence of an oppressed people from its despotic overlords and precipitating the collapse of russian dominance in the whole of eastern europe but what were looking at is the autopsy on a dead duck i think he hated me then his head jerked and his eyes opened very wide and he stared into my face wishing me dead thats what you and a spasm took him and he sat with it and i waited and finally he managed to get his breath without using the spray and i liked him for that hed got pride thats what you want isnt it no then why because id like to see them do it and i know they cant the tension went out of him and he looked down but they ought to try he said it very quietly and not really to me and i knew he was saying it about himself no one else theyll try all right christ so would i its just that were not going to get much of a kick out of watching them fail two men came in and i checked them in the mirror it was routine but i did it a fraction quicker than usual because until tomorrow it was important that nobody asked to see my papers did that stuff go off im sorry to london oh yes what time does the queens messenger get in hell be on the threefifty plane cleared by fourthirty customs and entries all that a little sooner unless theres more snow and the roads get look just keep it on you and leave at the normal time about six make for the residence and if theres a tag youll have to flush him he nodded swallowing it gets easier every tune you only had a standard gumshoe this morning and youd have peeled him off all right if youd wanted to thing is to know theyre there i folded his report and gave it to him dont you want it hang on to it for the moment he put it away clumsily catching a corner and having to smooth it out and do it again its on the ball i said dont worry but theres no mention of the uk diplomatic support they think theyre going to get why not his face went blank support for the revolution and the pattern shifted again and i wasnt ready for it any more than id been ready the last time and it took me a couple of seconds to steady up thats right they must be out of their mind why should the uk want to disturb the balance of eastwest relations just when theres the hope of how many people in czyn have you been in contact with a rough count fifteen or twenty the ochota unit near and none of them have talked about it not to me or id have put them right you remember what mr egerton told me about scotching any ideas like let it go he shut up and i tried to think of a snap answer because sometimes itll work if you just let your mind take a jump in the dark before you have to inhibit it with data and do it the hard way the logical way sometimes it works but not always not now the thing was that it would be very important to czyn if there were even the slightest hope of great britain lending support to what they were trying to bring off and if one unit knew about it theyd pass it on to the whole network priority flash and they hadnt i finished the hot vodka it had sped up the circulation and i could feel my fingers again it had even given a bit of colour to merricks face though the effect was macabre like rouge on a cadavers cheeks itd be interesting to know why he related his bid for freedom from paternal dominance with the polish peoples attempt to get out from under the muscovite boot to the point where the bare idea of their failing was breaking him up lie sie nalezyi dziesiec zfoty merrick got off the stool thank you wait five minutes be in touch he stopped me halfway to the door are you going to ask london ask them what to take me out of warsaw his eyes were vulnerable ready to flinch well both be getting out before long youre here to get info on czyn so youll stay till the last train leaves for the camps but i dont give it beyond tuesday till then well be treading on eggshells if you get caught in a raid dont count on your diplomatic immunity because it doesnt cover your involvement with elements hostile to the state and dont count on me because you know what i told you in london ill throw you to the dogs the street was clear when i went out the only danger was from the uniformed mos because the secret divisions didnt have anything on me i turned left going westwards through the failing light and picking my way over the sooty crusts that still covered most of the pavements there hadnt been a thaw to make any slush and they couldnt do much with shovels proposition an agency was using the uk as an infiltration image and promising diplomatic support remarks impossible because no one had any reason to do that proposition the said agency had convinced polanski and therefore the whole of his unit that the uk was in fact allied to their cause and the unit had kept this highly encouraging news to themselves remarks impossible because they would have passed it on problem relate two impossibilities to reality most of the shop windows were lit there was no real daylight here night came at any hour after noon and covered the buildings until late morning they said that if the wind blew from the southwest there was sunshine here even in winter and the forests ringed the city with jewelled ermine today the wind sliced through the streets from the north numbing the bones one other question circled my thoughts it looked as if czyn was going to have its lifeblood drained away before it could spill it at the barricades if so why did the bureau want information on its activities why take the pulse of the dying towards the plac zawisza i turned right for safetys sake and crossed the railway bridge and went left again along ulica vrodz and that was where they got me foster it was just bad luck they came round the corner and we were face to face before i could do anything dokumenty they were young and their faces werent quite composed i think theyd been laughing about something perhaps girls and now theyd got their duty to do but the amusement was still in their eyes as they looked at me waiting they would check my papers and walk on again their secretive laughter coming back as they talked i have lost them one of them smiled at my joke it was almost as good as the one about the girls dokumenty he said and showed me his police card tapping it my polish had been halting enough to assure them that i couldnt have understood you do not lose your dokumenty it is all you are i am trying to find my way to my embassy so as to report the matter the british embassy my best way is along ulica jerozolimskie isnt it he put his police card away and tapped the lapel of my coat his eyes very intent now the other one taller leaned forward to listen i could smell the damp cloth of their uniforms the leather of their belts you have no papers i have lost them i am on my way to the british embassy to report it this is a very serious matter for me crossroads and two vehicles opposite directions a few people in a queue conditions awkward a clear run fifty yards but their guns quite often the classic maxims of training duplicate natural instincts but there has to be brainthink as well as stomachthink and the chances here looked remote and it could be lethal in the early days it strikes you as clumsy the idea of making a run for it inelegant then you come to know what its like their tonelessly barked questions the clang of a door the halflit passages the grille where they come to watch you and the moment when you think my god i could have run now its too late but you can swing too far the other way and theres a new one to learn that you mustnt let the thought of interrogation worry you so much that youll make your run blindly you have no papers no they leaned close to me attentively needing to get it quite right to believe the incredible because in a police state if you have no papers you have no face no name you are guilty of not existing come with us recheck no go the discretion factor was the only advantage firearms will not be used unless so forth the rest was all on the debit side and even if they didnt shoot i could come unstuck and go sliding under one of the vehicles will you please show me the way to my embassy the basic rule is to try anything but theres no guarantee itll work they used the telephonepoint on the far side of the crossroads and we stamped our feet till the car came a black warszawa with mo on the side it was down in the ochota precinct a nineteenthcentury building once a private house but with a portico added on later and the doors doubled the guard followed us in big portrait of the chairman of the presidium of the soyuz sovetskikh sotsialisticheskikh respubulik and a smaller steelengraving of the chairman of the council of state of the polska rzeczpospolita ludowa several others one of them behind the desk janusz moczar the minister of the interior he was the man id want there was a stove in the corner and the dry air was opening up the guards sinuses his post was outside in the raw sooty wind long bubbly sniff and mouth exhalation long bubbly sniff fivesecond frequency what is your name bodkin other names john in the old days it was easy youd say your name was need help and when they rang the embassy for information on a british national whod lost his passport the clerk would twig it and send a secretary along and youd all go home and have tea these days the intelligence services had so much on that they kept most of the embassies in a state of quiet hysteria and if an agent got copped they just sent out for champagne you have lost your papers yes he was a police lieutenant in uniform but not an mo and i couldnt quite place him in the eastern bloc states the uniformed branches are the civil police civil police volunteer reserve and peoples militia but the secret divisions can add up to a dozen or more each with its specific interests surveillance of political factions infiltration of foreign missions active suppression of church influence monitoring of the state apparatus maintenance of files on the population with a few toplevel divisions directly responsible to moscow in some cases theres considerable overlap and you can be trundled from one detention centre to the next while they try to work out whos job it is to give you the chopper the other man didnt say anything he sat near the stove with his pale hands dangling over the ends of the chair arms a secretdivision executive hi a black suit and pointed shirt collar and his tie in a very small knot a doughfaced middleaged party official with eyes like a fish that watched me all the time but never looked at me he would be a moczar man but that didnt tell me anything because the minister of the interior was the head of the police power and he could be in any one of its divisions but he worried me because theyre always on the lookout for exchange material and this was a suitable time an international conference tends to cosy up the atmosphere and thats when people like fringe syndicate journalists step out of line and get hooked in addition to which we had blok and shelepov in the scrubs and they were both valuable enough for moscow to try setting up arrangements what is your business in warsaw i cannot tell you that i require some paper and an envelope please i wish to send a message to comrade janusz moczar immediately the first thing was to get into the open thered be an armed escort but a chance could come up in here there was no chance at all he looked at the darksuited man and one of the pale hands lifted and fell by a fraction he didnt speak it flat on the desk and i nodded and got my pen they were going to steam open the envelope somewhere along the line but they wouldnt expect me to know that so i said please place yourself where you cannot read what i shall write i must remind you again this is for the eyes only of the minister he turned his head and the hand instructed him as i reversed the pen top and stuck it on he got up and paced towards the doors his jackboots creaking go outside and blow your nose and come back as i began writing i heard one of the doors open and the guard go out and even after these few minutes i sensed the street and the sky with the hunger of the trapped animal because it might be months or even years before such a door would open for me at midnight i used three asanas to combat the cold uddhiyana jalandhara and vajroli mudra theyd taken my watch but the chiming of a town clock came hourly through the high ventilation grille and the acoustic effect had a freak quality because the space was small it sounded as if the clock were in here with me its volume diminished or that i was listening to it in the open it was only the watch theyd taken the rest had been checked and handed back wallet pen money where are your keys i do not have any why not my room key is at the hotel and i have no car here and i do not require the keys that i use in my home country handkerchief angielskipolsko pocket dictionary penknife nothing else the poor little devil had thought hed got his sums wrong when id given him back his report but it was just that between blowing your cover and getting a new one youve got to watch what you carry the search had surprised me they ought not to search a personal acquaintance of comrade moczar and they ought not to take his hat off and shoot a full face and profile against the white board but theyd done that too it was all right because those pictures are useful only when theyve got you inside and if you can get out again theyre no good as an image to work with when theyre looking for you in the street especially warsaw in winter when everyones identical in a fur kepi but all the same they ought not to have done it the lieutenant had given me an envelope and id sealed it myself i must tell you that if this message is not delivered immediately by hand you will invite serious trouble for yourself if it is intercepted or opened before it reaches the minister he will learn shortly from my associates that i have been apprehended and will know that my first action would have been to contact him and demand my release hed gone off with it himself cap greatcoat and gloves and a salute for the waxfaced man in the black suit then i was taken to a smaller room with barred windows for the search and the photographs that was nine hours ago from here to the najwyzsza izba kontroli it was twenty minutes by car but of course he could be absent or busy supervising the clearance of the underground forces from the city but it didnt look good some hot stew and black bread at half past eight then id spent a few minutes facing the possibilities a fullscale interrogation and the subsequent workout when i wouldnt talk solitary detention sleep and sensory deprivation stress imposition and the ordering of painful postures sudden switches of attitude from the accusatory to the benign physical strictures and they wouldnt be the worst within a few hours you can turn any man into a mad animal but theres a breakoff point because the object is to get information and they cant get it if theyve gone too far and wrecked the personality its up to that point where the suffix has a value beyond it youre lost and so are they and they know that the good ones and thats your only hope but nobody likes the dentist keys again he was a big man but thin about the face and his eyes were never still showing their whites like a kicked dog watchful for a boot dobrze dobrze he took the tin bowl and the spoon away snatching them suddenly and hurrying out frightened that someone might have heard him offer a word to me out of his inborn peasant courtesy his hands should be on a plough as his fathers had been what was he doing here among bricks and bars the cold was depressing cold is for the dead in presenting my compliments i request my immediate release from detention in the ochota precinct and your personal guarantee that i shall not in future be molested in any way by members of your police services their action in questioning the loss of my regular documentation was fully justified but i wish to avoid similar incidents during my stay in warsaw and therefore require the use of a provisional laissezpasser bearing your own signature and seal which i shall be prepared to surrender on leaving poland i have no wish to jeopardise your high position in the cabinet at a time when critical pressures menace the stability of government but since i am in possession of certain facts at present unknown to your political opponents i find myself obliged in my own interests to ask your immediate attention to those matters stated above a light burned in the corner near the latrine channel a lowpower unshaded bulb that hung within an inch of the wall its warmth had been melting the frost on the brickwork since the beginning of the winter and now an icicle clung there reaching to the concrete floor in it the bulb glittered many times reflected gilding it and giving it the semblance of an ikon here for the prayers of the wretched working principle to the cupboard of every man a skeleton and the greater the man the more need to keep its door locked in the hierarchy of government this truth has no exclusivity but in the state apparatus of the communist world it has particularity because the discipline of the party credo leaves scant room for human error and as the comrades labour their precarious way up the pyramid of power a thumb in the eye and a boot on the neck of their nearest competitors they know that a slip will send them pitching down again tell any man i know what youve done and hell think at once of his worst indiscretion fear and guilt will persuade him automatically that if anything is known then it is the worst that is known i thus expected that if comrade janusz moczar ever received my message he would send for me i might be bluffing but how could he risk that assumption once in the privacy of his office all i could do would be to use his face as a guide making veiled references to black market manipulation if greed showed there hinting of mistresses if he looked a lecher comrade minister the regulations controlling foreign currency exchange have always been subject to certain evasions as im sure youll know but few people realise that a large part of the profits made by the touts in the big hotels finds it way to the coffers of those empowered to stop these widespread transactions if they chose comrade minister the private affairs of the members of the polish cabinet are of course not my concern but the world is sometimes inconveniently small and a certain lady of my acquaintance here in warsaw recently proved herself regrettably unentitled to the confidences extended to her by others you know how it is when an exclusive little party lingers on delete where inapplicable and use his successive reactions as data feedback to correct my course to the target it could be done it has been done braithwaite is particularly good at it and whenever he shows up at diplomatic receptions a lot of the guests take out instant insurance by cabling their wives through interflora he works as i would work by the elementary rule that the surest way of extracting information is to imply that you know it already moczar would come out strongly for proof and he wouldnt get it because i hadnt got it but the aim would be to convince him that he couldnt take the risk by throwing me back into detention hed be smart enough to know that even a fragment of evidence against the head of the police power could be worth a lot to the officer responsible for my safekeeping if i took a crack at trading it in for an arranged escape the gilded ikon glowed perhaps i was dazzled by its light or by the wishful thoughts that some call prayers but the throw id made could get me out of here and into the open where the clock chimed under the sky it could at least do that and give me the chance of a break keys a different man older and less scruffy a professional imprisoner impersonal his remote eyes playing directly on my face i have never been taken out of a cell for abortive execution but i thought i recognised the look he gave me hearing already the predestined crackle of shot among the walls outside he seemed puzzled that i still had movement perhaps he looked at us all in that way his time sense dislocated by monotony two guards come with us they said in the room where theyd taken my watch away they now handed it back and i fastened the strap it was an hour before dawn and the barred window was still dark there were four of them now a captain of the mo and three sergeants all in spruce uniform and waiting punctiliously while i fixed the buckle and pulled down the sleeve of my coat eskorta two ahead and two behind as we clumped down the passage and through the office and out by the double doors salute from a rifle butt and the bang of heels the air smelt of steel and i saw a star caught in a web of cloud high over the skyline the tang of lowoctane exhaust they swung the step down at the back and we climbed in there was no hustling one of them put a hand on my arm but only to help me up the narrow steep step as if i were infirm or to be valued we sat in formal rows along the side benches and no one spoke it was all very official and through the heavy mesh on the windows i sometimes caught the reflection of the amber swivelling lamp on the roof of the van beneath us the chains flailed softly at the crusted snow raszynska and a right turn into ulica koszykowa the czechoslovakian embassy with its windows dark and the flag still frozen into the folds left by the last wind before winter north along chatubinskiego and in silence something smashed and i knew it was hope because this wasnt the way to the najwyzsza izba kontroli where the minister of the interior was going to give me the freedom of the city in recognition of the fact that i had him across a barrel he had me in a mobile cage and i was no better off here than where the light of the yellow bulb was turned to false gold and the mind was moved to false hopes wolniej tak kapitan we swayed sideways as the driver obeyed the surface was treacherous and it wouldnt do to have an accident when carrying a prisoner the streets jigsaw slowed across my eyes cut into a matrix of images by the mesh at the windows it was no good thinking when they take me out because when they took me out theyd be ready for an attempt and if i broke clear theyd shoot and thered be no point in facing the sky with a hand flung out no answer to anything then they were moving their positions slightly straightening up and the snow at the edge of the roadway crackled under the tyres i couldnt see where we were because the name of the street had swung past in parallax behind the stem of a lamp but i knew wed crossed into the wola district north of the railway the captain and a sergeant climbed down and turned and i knocked the hand aside as it tried to help me and they closed in quickly as we stood in the rising gas my arms pinioned now because the sudden movement had worried them a good escort works like a blinddog regarding his charge as an extension of his own body and there was no chance for me here when the prison van backed away i saw the big moskwicz saloon by the kerb it was in the russian style amorphous and lumpish and with domed hub plates and curved quarter lights at the rear it stood on the snow like an immense polished beetle and above its roof i saw two men in black astrakhan coats coming down the steps from the pillared entrance to the building the guards at the top still holding their rifles at the salute the whole thing went smoothly as if rehearsed i was led quickly to the saloon and put inside my escort shutting the door and standing back to keep orderly station along the sank of the car as the two civilians entered it from the other side ducking their fur kepis and taking their places one on the occasional seat and the other beside me the doors clicked shut and the engine was started and we got under way jolly cold isnt it he fished out a whisky flask with the ease of habit he was the one facing me and i thought id met him before as one does when one has seen so many pictures of a face in the newspapers this one was crumpled rather than lined as if the tissue paper skin had been crushed into a ball and then smoothed out again the large eyes were pinkrimmed their whites laced with red rivulets and the mouth was long thinlipped and set in an expression of irony as distinct from cynicism it was the mien of a man who had long ago discovered with secret delight that the follies of others matched his own his name was foster he held out the flask warm the cockles old boy i shook my head and he made a token gesture towards the man beside me before he unscrewed the top and with studied formality poured a tot and drank it at a gulp i looked at the man beside me and saw that he was russian with the flat heavy features of its eastern peoples a son of irkutsk or krasnoyarsk more northerly he sat with a rocklike equilibrium watching the englishman we drove through deserted streets towards the vistula the glass division isolating us from the chauffeur and his uniformed companion hows the old country these days keeps going he nodded putting the flask away not yet quite ready to meet my eyes i supposed it was courtesy to ask about england not wistfulness because to do what hed done must have needed hate of some stamina love of country is only love of oneself a grand form of identification and that wouldnt have worried him but to turn his back on the love of friends might have been more difficult are you here for long a few days picked the wrong time his nerves showed behind the faint rueful smile and he looked away again i mean the winter which one ah he said yes he stared through the glass at the slow parade of the buildings these people would be all right you know if theyd only get down to their work and show a bit of faith in those who are trying to create the new world but theyre too proud of their past warrior nation and all that its old hat these days things have changed and theyre going to change a lot more the pasts all right but you wont get far if you spend your life in a museum he turned his face to me theres such a lot of good in them though just as there is in everyone and its a shame to see it go to waste i sensed the unconscious appeal not for the poles but for himself he believed he didnt give a damn whether i thought there was some good in him or not but he hadnt been long enough away to get a perspective on his convictions and the shock alone was going to take time to dull off twenty years in whitehall with a solid reputation and a circle of friends whod admired his two conflicting qualities of modesty and brilliance then hed been sent out to port said on a piddling little extradition job and by sheer chance had got blown less than six months ago with just enough time to get aboard the kovalenko before she sailed for odessa and in london the headlines broke the news hed hoped never to make they give you any grub old boy yes he nodded satisfied sorry they kept you hanging about like that i only got called in a couple of hours ago he leaned forward suddenly his head on one side thing is its quite a chance for us to talk to someone like you we watched each other steadily for two or three seconds before an innocent smile touched his eyes i mean someone of intelligence from the uk i dare say youve got a better idea of whats going on than any of these smartalecky businessmen who think they know all there is these talks now theyre just as important to you as they are to us we all know what they could mean dont we if theyre given half a chance virtual end of the cold war put it that way arent i right the tone was easy the eyes lit with the warmth of fellow feeling this was the charm the popular sundays had plugged six months ago when the kovalenko had been steaming through the bosphorus the dangerous charm of the arch deceiver he was laying it on a bit thick but to a certain degree it was genuine and the real danger was there at dawn in the capital of a police state east of longitude i was being vetted by two kgb men of the soviet state security service and if one of them happened to look like an amiable bar fly in a london pub it was the more necessary to remember that hi fact he was a man whod sold his country and his friends for a coin hed valued higher a man who was going to send me back into the cells when this little ride was over the van with the meshed windows wasnt keeping escort station fifty yards behind us just because it hadnt got anywhere else to go of course you know were having a spot of bother here these hotblooded young rowdies all they want is a bit of excitement now theres a chance boys ourselves once werent we hegave a short goodhumoured laugh and this too was partly genuine i remembered reading that thirty years ago hed been sent down from oxford for the traditional prank of sticking a jerry on top of a weathercock boys will indeed be boys but i also remembered the silverhaired man theyd half carried out of the airport like a waxwork doll he hadnt been a young rowdy it doesnt add up to more than that he said comfortably as im sure you realise thats why were a spot puzzled by these rumours going around you know what i mean we were still heading east nearing the vistula thered been a new prison established some eighteen months ago on the other side in grochew no he looked at me steadily for a moment and then sat back with a shrug there are so many rumours arent there at a time like this journalists in from all over the place keen to jump the facts without any change in his tone his eyes still sleepy i mean the one about the uk looking kindly on whatever shindy these young asses can kick up if we let them so i could have wasted my time busting a hole in the ice with the fiat because the proposition was that polanskis unit was the only one that had been fed the dope about the uk diplomaticbacking thing and now the kgb had picked it up and the kgb picked up most of its stuff by augmented interrogation so who had they grabbed polanski viktor jo where was alinka now the trains were rolling east i could have wasted my time i said can you spell it out for me her lean body a dark curl creeping in the wing of her arm all she would ever be a dream fragment persisting we dont want to tell you things his smile was faintly coy we want you to tell us things if shindy means a fullscale revolution and young asses means half the population of the polish republic and looking kindly means the explicit patronage of great britain at foreign office level id say its worth about as much as any other rumour wouldnt you i come from a country where we both do i was forgetting where people would get a certain kick out of seeing the poles chuck the kremlin off their backs because weve always had a soft spot for the underdog whoever it is but thats not enough to make us queer the pitch at a time when theres a hope of an eastwest detente in the offing but you ought to know that so why ask me a spark had come under the heavy lids but now the eyes were sleepy again full marks for that the russian hadnt moved but i sensed a reaction in his total stillness beside me his grasp of the idiom must be pretty fair i see yes thats what we thought then i havent been much help you mustnt think that old boy youre being most cooperative just what we were hoping for bit of cooperation lamps swung above us their glow lingering wanly against the first milky light of the day the span of the bridge curved upwards across the wastes of ice as we were lifted losing the skyline finding it again in the glass division the sidelamps of the prison van floated higher two bright bubbles and floated down thats where someone went in he was looking through the side window couple of days ago went in down there in a car bust the ice yes i think he was trying to get away from the police they say there was quite a chase poor chap what a way to go but he shouldnt have been so silly the police here are very good weve got to keep order thats awfully important we slowed down the long descent towards the wilenska station having to use more of the camber because the first trams had started running of course it could be the other way round the kgb might not have picked it up it could be their own man the one with the borrowed union jack poking out of his breast pocket feeding the stuff in why its like wales he said turning to look at me and scotland you must try seeing it that way theyve kept their spiritual independence but theyve willingly helped england fight her wars bit of flagwaving goes on at the cup finals but theres no harm meant is there charles went over pretty big at caernarvon proof enough by rough reckoning i had ten minutes i didnt know why theyd switched me from the van to the saloon it wasnt so that they could vet me because they could have waited until we were inside grochow where the grilling was going to start perhaps it was caprice on his part and his masters had indulged him he was a first ranker of high value to them twenty years loyal service on the books what then had moved him in the shadowed psyche below that brilliant mind to offer me a ride in his comfortable motor car since we were going to the same place not his sense of irony that was too cerebral something deeper theyd said of him those whod been his friends that if hed ever gone right over the edge he would have been a schizoid that the strain of his critically balanced double life would have led him sliding into a world of phantasy but there was no real edge no borderline he was the type who would order a cleanly laundered shirt for the condemned on his way to the gallows to give his death a token dignity or choose that on my way into grochow and beyond i should hear the accents of familiar speech here in a foreign land and know the comfort of being called old boy or was it something more basic self justification on the infantile level here are you a captive and here am i a free man so whos the better ten minutes but it was a question of chance not time hit the door open and pitch out and hope not to break a leg and try to run before the snow was pockmarked around my feet and they corrected the aim and i knew it hadnt been worth it smash the glass division with a rising kick and connect with the drivers neck and send the lot of us sliding wild and hope to get clear of the wreckage and use the confusion as flying cover not really there was too much against it and i was only making sure i could answer the question that later days later would needle me when they got round to the advanced stuff and id give my soul to be free hadnt there been anything at all i could have done there had been nothing at all poland he said reasonably and czechoslovakia and the others all keeping their spiritual independence and living in harmony with their mother country just like scotland and wales does it sound so odd it always takes time of course the future never likes being hurried think what a fuss there was when the romans came but they did a world of good didnt they gave us good laws and proper plumbing dont know what england would have done without them its the same here and you really ought to try taking the long view looking out at the dark figures huddled at a tram stop he said in a quicker tone you know your way do you around warsaw a few of the main streets you know roughly where you are now east of the river he nodded tapping at the glass division thats right not far from anywhere really as the big saloon began slowing i saw the shape of the police van reflected beside him closing in and then dropping back a little keeping the distance he leaned towards me his tone intimate now the whisky on his breath the thing is old boy we dont want you to rock the boat moczars got his hands full at present cleaning things up for the talks and wed rather like him to be left alone he swayed back an inch as the saloon came to a halt by the kerb the reflection of the van had also stopped but none of its doors were opening they were just sitting there holding off it could be a trap but if they wanted to rub me out they could do it quietly inside grochow the only point hi this setup would be to establish public testimony to the fact that id been shot while trying to escape and it didnt seem logical it looked like a chance and this time a real one and itd have to be done explosively within the next few seconds the right elbow driven hard and upwards to paralyse the windpipe of the man beside me and the left foot kicking for the face in front of me as the weight came back difficult because of the balance factor but only difficult not impossible kimura could have done it without any trouble this or nothing this or grochew so were hoping youll be a sport he leaned forward head tilted the tone engaging weve got your name and well see its passed around to all the mo stations so if you get picked up again just tell them who you are a smile narrowed his eyes bodkin so english and so russian alexandrovich bodkin yes what i mean is you wont need a pass or anything well tell them to leave you alone he pulled at the chrome handle and the door swung open mind how you go the streets are so treacherous arent they because of the snow night the cups had been specially designed bar kino in white letters on the black ground of some mm negative that went right round the rim prosze o rachunek half an hour was fair enough she made out the pay check with the indifference of fatigue her thigh against the edge of the table as she took the weight off one foot a lot of them took two jobs merrick had said to earn enough to buy clothes western jazz of the thirties pumped from the walls it had been a waste of time the fiat thing someone should have been here at nine and it was half past now and i was going because i didnt want to sit here thinking about what they were doing to her dziekuje or what they were doing to me they had me in a bottle ill see you in my dreams one of the big bands new orleans another world and another time but you wont get far if you spend your life in a museum the thing was to avoid the attractions of the idee fixe it can throw you so were hoping youll be a sport he neednt have said that it had been quite enough to name the deal theyd leave me alone if id leave moczar alone that was all id asked for and id got it and alexandrovich bodkin was now persona grata and id been so glad to get off the hook that id fallen for an idee fixe that my threat to the minister of the interior had worked and worked even better than id expected theyd not only given me the freedom of the city but had shown concern that id be unsporting enough to tread on his face just for a giggle another thing to avoid is low blood sugar a bowl of stew wont last you twelve hours and you can get lightheaded and it wasnt until id had some food that id seen the bottle they had me in hed never received my note theyd opened it and turned it over to the kgb when they saw what it said a foreign national gets picked up and says hes lost his papers and instead of answering questions he threatens to kick the head of the police department off his perch if they wont play it his way an interesting case for investigation and theyd started to investigate it and they hadnt finished yet it had been for the englishman to make the decision they could transfer me to a top security prison and take me slowly to pieces and see what was left or they could let me go and let me run and see where i went classical russian thinking and often highly effective and that was why i didnt like it it had been unnerving getting out of the car and walking away remembering it could be a trap and even believing it was a trap the nape of the neck going cold western secret agent shot down in street the crusts of snow skittering in front of my shoes like sooty sugar the tram queue and the throb of the big saloon moving away the higher noted gearwhine of the van standing under the open sky where d prayed to the ikon to let me be free and alone the long night gone and the day beginning later id done some brain think the city was mine and i could go where i liked but if i tried to get on a plane or a train or an orbis coach or took a car too far id find out how free i was as free as a fly in a bottle weve got your name also my photograph but he hadnt mentioned that pictures like those are normally useful only when theyve pulled you in and start hunting you in the files instead of the streets but this was a special case and by now theyd have been processed lifesized blowups with a superimposed kepi pride of place on the notice boards in every mo station subject image assimilation by all patrols going on duty remarks report on movements and whereabouts do not question or ask to see papers the only point they hadnt covered was too clear to miss and this afternoon id started research on it because they couldnt have just left the cork out i put down three zlotys and edged between the small round tables to the swing doors then came back christ i told you to send someone didnt i it was over a mile from there and if theyd picked her up theyd have booked her for the trains my cup was still there but it wasnt the same place there wasnt anyone else you could have sent then i shut up she sat very still her dark eyes not really seeing me a nerve alive at the corner of her mouth i went over and said i wanted a cognac meaning i wanted it now she hadnt moved when did it happen alinka an hour ago viktor is dead i dont know where the others are how did they blow you how did they find out he said he would never let them take him how did they find out she began shaking and i shut up again pushing the glass against her hand where it lay like a dropped white glove it was a pointless bloody question anyway theyd been wiped out and that was that boots on the steps and the mirror smashed and the typolt giving shot for shot the dead eye of an eagle with the rage still in it trust an amateur to make a mess of things hed looked like a professional but hed been a professional suicide that was all the city was full of them i was afraid you would have gone she said you were actually there were you no i had gone for a walk and leo was with me he wouldnt let me go alone even in the little streets there were cars there when we went back and josef was running we all ran then and leo said we must separate she drank some of the cognac both her hands round the glass her eyes closing as she put it to her mouth he wouldnt have lived longer than wednesday he was going to do it then he was a born martyr i know she said i gave her the folded green card dont look at it now look at it later she put it into the side pocket of her coat theyd been a bit pressed but it looked all right thin cheap pasteboard and feint print the photograph peeled and backed and stuck on slightly offcentre not difficult but give them credit its the ageing process that takes most of the time because if you hurry the machine itll just shred the thing up instead of reproducing the right degree of wear and tear theyd even got cocky and put a lipstick smudge id told merrick to send out one of the female clerks with the package from london in case he was tagged again that was the reason id given him and it was partly true but more important than that was the danger of my exposing him to the kgb i was contagious now id used the girl as a cutout for protected contact if an mo patrol or a ub agent had seen us meet it wouldnt get them anywhere useful theyd know id made contact with the embassy and that was all it wouldnt expose merrick and theyd expect me to trade with the embassy because that was where theyd left the cork out the line had been safe so id told him to start the research for me i want you to vet the cypher room staff get the ambassador to give you plausible facilities and tell london what youre doing so they can lend a hand if you turn anything up you can hold it ready for me he said he wasnt quite sure what i wanted him to do you assume that the cypher room staff has been infiltrated and that incoming and outgoing signals are being copied and passed to the opposition either as a routine measure or as a special surveillance operation if you tell london to cover dossiers theyll turn up the last screening programmes and theyll automatically monitor all signals for evidence of tampering at this end you can give them the idea that youre in trouble because one of your signals was inaccurate or that you broke a security regulation and you want to check what you sent make it a recent one and give the impression that you know youve dropped a brick and that its not their fault in other words that they didnt make a duff transmission whats your code he said it was fourth series with firstdigit dupes all right send off a couple of signals using the ignore key and tell them theyre fully urgent and that theyve got to send them while youre there if they kick up rough because the teas getting cold tell them its on hes orders ask them to give you back your own originals and tell them you want their recorded originals and copies as well if they let you have them send another signal informing london theyve done that and for christs sake leave out the ignore key this time watch their reactions at every stage and see if they fit your idea of people whove got nothing to hide he said he understood he also asked what he should put in the ignore signals i suppose the poor little tick had never had to send one before tell them youve caught it in the zip again the frightening thing was that it could be important i wanted to know why theyd bottled me up in warsaw but hadnt cut my line of communication through the embassy i didnt need to go there if i wanted to send anything out within fifteen minutes of picking up the telephone in the bar kino the clerk in london could be decyphering and they wouldnt want me to do that correction theyd want me to do it but only if they could know what i was sending so id moved an untrained recruit into a highly sensitive area and it had felt like putting a match to a fuse because if merrick exposed an opposition agent actually installed in the cypher room of the british embassy it was going to make a nasty bang at a time when the eastwest delegates were sending each other roses merrick would be all right but id get the chopper i was out here to localcontrol his mission and his mission was circumscribed and didnt provide for my pitching him into an area with this much potential for blast thered been no choice the bureau doesnt like commandeering facilities in her majestys embassies unless theres something big in progress and even if london sent me a ticket for the warsaw cypher room i couldnt go in as young merrick could the image already established and the cover story dependent on it id have to go in as a stranger with inspectorate powers and if in fact the opposition had planted someone among the staff hed scare so fast that the next morning his desk would be empty and so would the filing cabinets i had to know their minds to know if theyd said let him run and well watch where he goes let him signal and well read what he sends the fifth series comes fairly high among the international unbreakables but a code only stays locked till someone finds the key her glass was empty and she was watching me the shock still dull in her stone blue eyes their quickness blunted are we useful to you she wanted to know why id gone to the trouble of getting her a new karta not really if we can be useful tell us all right she gave a little nod and was still again i could have learned something from this woman from her ability to sit like this her calm containing her anguish a brother for the camps and a friend for the grave and the known world falling away like a city going down i got the girl over and paid youve got somewhere safe you can go oh yes but she looked at me blankly because she hadnt thought of it yet that there had to be somewhere safe she could go perhaps there was nowhere now the people who had rebuilt this capital from the ruins of the war were being smoked out of it like rats dont take any risks keep low for a few days yes she said go to your parents they in warsaw she answered in polish because it was all she still remembered of them the language theyd spoken together there are friends you can go to she nodded and i said i dont mean people hi czyn forget wednesday its been called off forget the barricades there wont be any just save yourself alinka i got up and she lifted her head watching me as i sensed shed go on watching me when i left here until the door blotted me out and another bit of her known world broke away youll be all right now youve got your papers she nodded again standing over her i noticed her hand sliding towards the empty glass the palm flat on the table and the fingers parting and covering the round glass base as if to hold it down so that no one could knock it away and send its fragments dropping among all the other fragments of once familiar things papers werent any use to her now even her name had been taken away for pulping hi a destruction machine wanda rek was no one meant nothing i got a pencil if you need me you can phone this number just leave the message theyll know who its for then i left her and went through the swing door and crossed the street the wind blew from the north and the tall lamps swayed at the top of their stems sending shadows on the move i thought it would have been possible to keep on walking then i had to find a doorway and shelter there not from the wind from the idea of going on there werent any people about they didnt fancy being out in this killing cold the windows of the state supermarkets were bright with cheap goods to impress the visitors with the wealth of polish production the lamps kept the dark sky hidden and made it look as if the city were still alive or at least had once contained life but from here it seemed more like a fairground hit by plague a lone tram running blindly on its tracks into the distance as if there hadnt been time to switch it off the perspective of neon signs winking for no one for nothing what a bloody silly time id told merrick to open talks here but hed said they were expected to last for a good six months well into the summer then the movement quite a long way off of the only living thing that seemed to be left coming out of the bar she put her gloved hands to her face as she felt the cut of the wind at first moving away from me and then coming back not sure where to go in a world she no longer knew from where i lay the window made a blank parallelogram a screen where light came as a train went by fading in the intervals to the background glow of the city the glass had frosted over again covering the clear patch id scraped with my nails but it wasnt symbolic i could see even farther now than id seen then and i didnt like it there wasnt any light from the freight trucks only thennoise and the shake of the building the light came from the passenger trains though not from all of them because some had their blinds down those for the east i didnt like it because most of what i could see was based on missionfeel and i couldnt discount it assumptions were unreliable i assumed that there was an adverse party working the same field as merrick and i and feeding the polanski unit with doped info until its turn came to be wiped out and i assumed that the kgb had chosen to vet me and let me run and both these assumptions could be wrong missionfeel is never wrong its the specialised instinct you develop as you go forward into the dark like an old dog fox sniffing the wind and catching the scent of things it has smelled before and learned to distrust and in the concealing darkness the forefoot is sensitive poised and held still above the patch of unknown ground where in the next movement the trap can spring shut the feeling i had was close to that but a man being a more sophisticated beast is caught with traps of greater complexity and what i sensed was that behind all the logic i was trying to bring to the few facts available and all the attempts to make a pattern from random pieces the opposition had a programme running its engineering as smooth and massive as the iron wheels that rolled past here on their predestined rails and that i was in its path egerton didnt know what it was but he knew it was there and hed sent me to find it and blow it up is it morning no i dont want morning to come shed told me before in a different way saying she didnt want the night to end crying for a long time naked against me the saltiness on my face asking me to hurt her as if the minds hurt wasnt enough guilt for the dead the abandoned her leanness quivering and her mouth avid but far from love later she forgot and the body was enough her skin burning under my hands and her thighs alive she made love as if time was running out later still she told me about herself speaking in polish and half to someone else to the person who must one day find again and recognise these pieces of identity and try to make them whole they wanted jan and me to go with them but israel was only a place on the map and we had all poland where we were born they sent long letters at first saying what a solid future there was for us if wed go out there and how kind the people were and finally we got sick of reading their letters and just tore them up still in the envelopes to me it was a kind of not disloyalty exactly a rejection of all wed been as a family theyd turned their backs on everything wed known and loved and grown up with the music and the forests and the fires in winter and our friends but i missed them so did jan and when i got married it was partly to make a new home for him though i think i was in love for a time but michal she paused on the name finding an oddshaped piece that she knew would never fit michal started getting letters from my father the same kind my brother and i used to get and he said we were obviously missing a big chance and tried to convince me and couldnt so he went out there to join them thus it is in events that thy tribe shall forever wander finding in the shade of each tree a seeming haven till it be shewn that as the sun moves the shadow moves leaving thee unsheltered he said that since the russians had taken over our country a pole couldnt be a pole so he was going where at least a jew could be a jew i think he was sure id follow him but i threw his ring from the slaskodabrowski bridge then for a time she slept and so did i and when i woke towards dawn shed moved away a little and leaned watching me in the grey light from the city her face still stained from the tears that had dried her eyes dark in thought as she asked me again who i was who are you please no one youll remember i left her warmth breaking the thin film of ice in the big copper pan putting my things into the airline bag i remembered thinking somewhere in the night that shed have to stay here if she were to survive the next few days because the only friends she could go to were at risk themselves i need a contact in czyn someone i can phone any time between now and sroda this is a safe place you told me to let you know if i wanted any help you would like me to stay here yes i will stay have you got any money some youll have to buy a few things ask the man to get them for you take a walk when you need some air but dont go far i zipped the bag shut ill phone always at an even hour eight ten twelve so be here then if i dont phone dont worry im not sure how things will go i went to the bed and she raised herself kneeling and twisting against me biting gently at the pad of my hand her black hair hiding her face from me till i left her and looked back once at her stillness her arms crossed against her breasts and her hands clasping her shoulders head on one side as she said i shall see you again yes the first lie of sunday trap the few people in the street wore black and bells tolled hurrying them across the rutted snow to where a spire poked at the low grey sky the wind had died in the night leaving calm i walked southeast towards the river id given him some money let her have my room her papers are in order and you can put her name in the register give her whats left of this when she leaves she wouldnt find work again until there was an amnesty three patrols in two miles but they didnt stop me karl dollinger journalist born stuttgart the immigration franking tallied with my actual arrival on lot and theyd put in a slip showing bookingconfirmation west berlin january reason for visit to cover talks for der urheber leftwing weekly various letters and memos editorial recaps telex facilities pressclub card so forth nothing to fault security was important now but that wasnt why i was switching base if id needed to stay on at the alzacki i wouldnt have taken her there a new cover required a new address and the hotel i wanted now was the big stateowned kuznia nearly opposite the commissariat in the praga district that was where theyd been going yesterday morning from the distance id seen the security van keep up speed towards the next traffic lights but the big black moskwicz had pulled in again soon after dropping me off theyd gone into the building on the south side foster and the man from irkutsk i hadnt gone back because they could have slapped a tag on me but the map in the city library showed what the building was it might not be their base but if it wasnt id have to start my search from there id known yesterday what id got to do but i suppose id baulked it because it wasnt a thing you could do in a hurry and id have to hurry we stood three days from sroda and sroda was the deadline for czyn for the opposition and for me i knew now what egerton wanted and his tacit signal was clear define infiltrate and destroy and i couldnt do it by standing in the way of the programme they were running id have to get inside and blow it up from there a hundred and fifty rooms fifty with private bath and outside telephone connection via the desk this one had two windows facing the commissariat at something like thirtyfive degrees oblique good enough and close enough to observe without binoculars there was a spillover from the other big hotels nearer the hall where the talks were going to be held but i managed to get a secondfloor single and the timing estimate from the room to the street was fifteen seconds at a pace that wouldnt look hurried for three hours i drew blank some of the commissariat staff showed up before noon and lights were switched on so i began filling in the frontelevation sketch id made records general admin public interview mo liaison so forth not many of the public went in perhaps half a dozen most of them lostlooking one of them frightened they were given an upright chair fourth window left of central staircase third floor and a big furcoated woman spoke to them without a pause and they didnt interrupt her mouth was rectangular like a ventriloquists dummy opening and shutting at irregular intervals while they sat watching sometimes giving a nod there were two clerks in records both girls one of them slightly lame they plied between the desks and the filing cabinets stopping sometimes to laugh together their work routine and their thoughts on personal things six uniformed mos reported to the second room right of staircase first floor handing some papers to a civilian who sent them out with a messenger to a room at the back of the building the work of these people routine or not was important enough to bring them here on a sunday and it looked reasonably clear that the pressures driving towards sroda had opened the doors of every commissariat in the city i had the impression that if i could have persuaded the two girls to leave the room with the crowded shelves while i lobbed an incendiary bomb through the doorway a few hundred thousand citizens of warsaw would be better off it might even be worth doing once i was in there seventh mo reporting ninth interview lights out fourth right third floor and the corollary two clerks down the steps guard on the entrance relieved moskwicz it came in from the west from across the vistula foster and another man not the man from irkutsk but the political agent whod conducted the interrogation in the ochota precinct his pale hands lifting and dropping on the arms of the chair they got out and climbed the steps and this was very interesting because he must be high in echelon to travel with a top kick like foster in his turdshaped de luxe saloon i couldnt think about it now because i had to see where they went and they went to the doubledwindowed room at the left end of the third floor when id seen the lights go on i began thinking about it findings a routine mo patrol had picked up an unremarkable foreign visitor in the street and pulled him in for not having any papers but by the time he was inside the precinct bureau there was a highechelon agent sittingin to conduct the interrogation and by dawn the next day he was under discreet vetting by the kgb they took off their coats and fur hats and foster sat down and the agent took a folder from a cupboard dark green folder cupboard not locked working backwards id realised i was being vetted in the moskwicz and they hadnt tried to cover it the new material now coming in and making me sweat concerned the events that had led up to that at some time between being picked up as a routine measure by the mo patrol and my arrival at the ochota precinct fifteen minutes later thered been an alert situation someone had known without seeing me that i wasnt just one of the hundreds of foreign visitors in warsaw on private business or with an interest in the forthcoming talks theyd known who i was the moskwicz was still at the kerb and the driver and escort were still on board black leather coats and civilian kepis note this note everything and think fast in the intervals they couldnt have known who i was and make corrections the wire had burned out and id have to twist the ends together till it glowed again and the analogy came to mind because the mission was suddenly electrified and egerton was close to me egerton and his bloody lies everyone else has refused im really most grateful to you for helping me out foster christ had he sent me to bring in foster turn the coin foster had been sent to bring me in because hed been flown from moscow part of the alert situation that was why theyd kept me caged to give him time to get here he jived in moscow the sundays said a modest existence in a flat not far from the domes of the kremlin once an old etonian and now a hero of the soviet republic with an alloy medal somewhere in the top drawer with his handkerchiefs and cufflinks a rumour about a hungarian woman a simple daughter of the proletariat content to share his uneventful life until less than fortyeight hours ago hed been given the signal contact established warsaw please proceed the fly had hit the web and the web trembled they hadnt needed fullface and profile blowups for the patrols theyd known where to find me at any time that was why they could afford to let me go brain think stay on brain think because theres a lot coming up and its got to be looked at and theres not much time left now let him run and well see where he goes it still stood up it was based on missionfeel and missionfeel is never wrong but i could extend the certainty now they already knew where i was going to run because i was in warsaw to find things out and the only way to do it was to close in get near them as near as i was now just across the street observing and surveying and trying to work out how to close the gap and get right inside into the doublewindowed room over there where they were quietly running their programme let him run and hell run to us into the trap i came away from the window the light in the room was winter dim but there was nothing here i wanted to see the moves had to be made in the mind the next in my own because theyd already made theirs and they were waiting it didnt matter that at this moment at my security was total no one in warsaw knew that a british agent from a nonexistent bureau in london was at this tick of the clock holed up in room at the hotel kuznia under the cover of karl dollinger journalist born stuttgart no one not even the two men over there with the dark green folder on the desk between them but it didnt matter because they werent trying to find me they were prepared to wait for me they could have left me to rot in the ochota precinct or thrown me into grochew and left me to rot there instead or they could have put me under the lights and broken me open to see what was inside but the time hadnt been right they hadnt known enough they wanted to know more in any capital where international talks are being convened theres always a fierce light focused on the central assembly of delegates and the plenipotentiaries and secretaries and interpreters and in the peripheral glow there are shadows and in the shadows there are always the nameless the faceless the eyes and ears of the intelligence networks whose job is to peel away the laminations of diplomacy and protocol and deceit and counterdeceit until they can form a picture of the realities beneath the maquillage and pass it back to control for dataprocessing and onward transmission to the overt departments of government where policy is formed there is nothing adventurous about this its an art becoming so fine that a great deal of what is said at the conference table is indirectly dictated by those unseen in the shadows and in some countries the liaison between statesmanship and political intelligence is so closely linked that the first would fail to operate without recourse to the second this was exemplified in a coded cable from the elysee to whitehall during the fourth summit of and the decoded version is framed on the washroom wall at the bureau spent an hour in private discussion last night with the persian minister for foreign affairs please let me know what he said here in warsaw the talks were to be staged between the two halves of a divided world and the spotlights were thus blinding and the shadows by contrast darker the area by this situation rendered highly sensitive was charged with the explosive element of polish dissension in these circumstances moscow had been driven to devise two programmes aimed at the protection of its own interests and of the talks themselves one of these programmes was already running the streets were being cleared and the trains were moving east the other was also under way this was the one that egerton wanted me to destroy and i hoped to god he knew what he was doing because the talks were as vital to the west as to the east not my concern discount the shivering fit of the nerves the gooseflesh fear that somewhere id wandered into a minefield that even the bureau didnt know was there discount every consideration that had nothing to do with the mission itself to do with the implicit instructions define infiltrate and destroy do what youre bloody well told or at least try they didnt know enough about me but theyd know enough to damn me to kill me once id found my way inside all theyd need to know was that i was trying to blow up their programme the second one the silent one then theyd knock me off theyd set the trap and that was all theyd had to do they knew as i knew now that id have to spring it myself and hope to survive the main line station was three blocks from the hotel and i walked there id had to get free of the claustrophobic confines of room and id had to take a first step towards their base and this was it he was a thin quickeyed boy with a lot on his nerves and id have preferred an older man but there was only one rank and his beatenup twodoor wolga stood at the head of it and i didnt want to waste any time hotel kuznia the smell of burnt clutch linings filtered through the ripped carpet after two blocks i told him to pull in this isnt the kuznia its farther on he watched me in the cracked mirror you can leave your engine running we spoke in polish and i let my accent show how much would it cost to hire you for the rest of the day it didnt matter how much it would cost because that bloody woman was going to pay the bill anyway but i didnt want him to think i was a madman only a madman would commit himself to this land of expense without asking how many noughts there were that would be his point of view because he was half starved and i wanted to keep him with me im on the station run youll have to get one from orbis theyre shut today it was still there so we were all right i cant help that five hundred zlotys thats fair i havent got a licence only for station runs you can check in at intervals your friendsll cover you he twisted in the seat and looked at me theres rules and im not breaking them youll be breaking a few on wednesday his young mouth tightened we listened to the ragged beat of the engine he didnt look away i said put it this way if youll keep your car at my disposal youll be helping things along firing the first shot you shouldnt miss a chance like that i dont know what youre talking about you see that big moskwicz over there i want you to keep it in sight when it leaves the commissariat i want to know where it goes thats all youre lucky you know got a chance of being a hero of the revolution but youll have to do what i tell you go on past the kuznia and make a turn before the bridge and come back and stop when i say the word he licked his thin lips looking away looking back at me show me your papers they didnt mean anything except that i wasnt a russian but that was enough he took his time just for the look of the thing and i knew he was hooked they were dreaming of sroda those who were left and i was bringing it closer for him i put my passport away when you can do it without anyone seeing break another hole in the front of your drivingseat and put the gun in there if you leave it where it is now theyll find it without even trying and you havent got a licence for that either he stuffed the yellow duster on top of the bulge in the sidepocket and his quick eyes flicked to the mirror you dont miss much youre up against people a lot smarter man i am so youd better watch it thats all the smell of the clutch rose again there werent any chains on but we wouldnt need any the filthy snow was permanently rutted now along the major streets and the trick was to settle into them and find traction on the bare tarmac in the troughs he turned at the bridge and came back pull in here we waited nearly an hour they came down the steps together foster emptyhanded the agent with a full briefcase i couldnt see the guard at the entrance from here but i knew all i needed to know about him he was civil police not military revolver not rifle and his post was inside the main doors on the lefthand side going up there wouldnt be any trouble with him because when i went in there i wouldnt be alone at this time i didnt have an alternative operation worked out but thered have to be one because the thing was so sticky with risks not yet give them a minute it really was the most disgusting design the rear windows like nostrils and domed hubcaps protruding like warts now east and north at the first lights and then left again back towards the slaskodabrowski bridge there was more traffic than usual towards the city centre a lot of the people here for the talks were using their first sunday for sightseeing in taxis and orbis cars dont get too close i dont want to lose it you wont lose it its like a bloody elephant orbis was no use to me youd got to present your papers and let them record the details and that was how id blown the longstreet cover blow the dollinger and there wouldnt be time to get another one before sroda and sroda was the deadline three days from now fast driving didnt figure in the operation i was now setting up but if something came unstuck and i had to do some it would have to be in a private banger whatever i could pinch the bureau wouldnt like that you were aware of the strict standing orders that in all circumstances the property of private citizens must be considered inviolable memo to control since the private citizens of warsaw were filling the detention cells at the rate of a hundred per day a fair percentage of motor vehicles parked in the streets were going to stay there until their blocks froze so i respectfully suggest you go and commit a nuisance hotel cracow yes i said go on past it was an old building in the grand style not far from the river and the moskwicz had turned through massive gates into a courtyard as we came abreast i took a look and told him to pull in after the fumes inside the wolga the air was fresh the gates hadnt been shut for a long time the traffic going through had gradually spread the tarmac to the sides and against their rusted bolts half a dozen cars in the courtyard one of them abandoned the marks of birds feet across the thick snow on its roof and bonnet the block presumably frozen no one about no one on foot the hotel took up one entire wing of the building mullioned lattices and a hewn portico griffons rampant part of the fifteen per cent of the city that didnt have to be rebuilt after the bomb doors had closed again foster and the agent were going up the steps and the driver and escort were sitting behind the windscreen with nothing to do but watch people and in a routine situation i would have spent an hour doing this hanging about for cover and using the rules but there wasnt enough time and i had to rely on risky premises that the driver and escort were a relief shift or if they were the two who had driven me across the slaskodabrowski yesterday morning that they hadnt got a good look at me they were taking a good look at me now but they could have seen me actually coming through the gates and that had been the point beyond which i couldnt have turned and gone back so i kept on and made for the entrance with the image rearranged shoulders a little hunched and the pace shortened head down in thought one of the habitual clientele with no more interest in the aspect of the place they were going into one of the lifts and i turned to stamp the snow off my shoes and then went to the desk would you have a private suite for one week beginning next wednesday for two people a quick glance down it didnt matter how well trained they were mention that day and there was a reaction he was wondering how id manage to reach here through the barricades reading upside down is a fraction easier than mirrorreading because you dont have to dissociate from the familiar and the brain recognises that if you turn through a hundred and eighty degrees youll be out of the wood whereas mirrorwriting remains gibberish until youve done a mental switch all i could see was that his name wasnt among the thirty or so on the one and a half filled pages of the register unless of course he was now a voshyov or k voskarev the two possibles among the several russian entries he was on one of these open pages if hed booked in officially because they went back to january and hed been flown in to vet me on a night flight of the th on the third floor sir overlooking the court he added without any expression it will be quieter there it wasnt important i hadnt come to look at the register its just that the eye of a seasoned ferret notes the lie of every grassroot on its way through the warren voshyov or voskarev could be the agent and fosters base somewhere else the important thing was to expose as much data as possible in the short time left and my real concern was the obscenelooking moskwicz outside the courtyard was the area we could possibly work in facts needed collecting he hit the bell but i told him i didnt want to see the rooms now i would return and confirm the pivotal fact was that when the moskwicz dropped its passengers at the commissariat and at this hotel the driver and escort remained on board they were there when i walked down the steps backed up to the wall between the end window and one of the griffons the engine shut off and the louvres closed and their faces watching me from behind the reflected light on the windscreen on the way back to the hotel kuznia i stopped the taxi at a telephone kiosk and spoke to merrick by nightfall id gone over the whole thing again and it looked all right risky but all right most of it stood up so well that the one critically weak point seemed less of a hazard it was to do with the guard there was a single police guard on the commissariat but today was niedziela sunday and it could be that on weekdays when every department was functioning and there were more visitors it carried the normal double guard id seen on other official buildings if tomorrow they doubled the guard itd be no go signal poniedzialek monday they doubled the guard it was getting too close to the limit now to do anything except hack out a lastditch alternative operation and it took till midday to do it and when id done it i knew it would only work if the opposition movement patterns remained constant and if it worked at all the main objective would be gained but nothing more i would blow up their programme by springing the trap but thered be no hope of survival i dont like suicide missions theyre for the angels rethink findings the only other thing to do was to let the tune run out to sroda and get a plane when the heat came off and take merrick back to london where hed be safe and let them put it in the mission report at the bureau objective unaccomplished so out of sheer stinking pride i set the thing running one hours wait a lot of the major planning overlapped instead of throwing out the whole of the original operation id lopped the dead limbs and done some grafting when the hour was up i telephoned merrick and made an immediate rendezvous and then went down to the street where the taxi was parked id paid him a day in advance and he was filling the wolga with cheap russian tobacco smoke when they come back keep an eye open and follow them when they leave again find out where they go does that gauge work sometimes he tapped it fill up the firstchance you get you can lose people that way i walked on towards wilenska against a low wind the sky was blueblack in the north and they said there was heavy snow falling across the forrest land and that the city would get it before morning he was late of course trucks banged and the echoes rang under the great sooty roof a mail van was parked on the sliproad that ran parallel with this platform and they were slinging the bags in on the far side a shorthaul tender was butting at a line of freight a dozen people waiting their backs turned to the mo patrol no one else after twenty minutes he came in from the street and began looking for me among the group of people because the poor little bastard had only had two weeks training and he didnt know that when you make a protected rdv you dont use cover it wastes time when he finally saw me he started a halfrun towards me and the mo patrol turned their heads so i called out to him in polish its all right it hasnt come in yet they say theres snow on the line i waited till he got his breath im sorry he said he was always having to say that i took him into the buffet three men four women a kid with a red plastic guitar his fur hat over his eyes steaming urns a door to the street telephone i asked for czosnek soup what happened he sat opposite me at the table pulling his gloves off and blowing into his hands someone tried to get asylum just when i was leaving the embassy his eyes were in a stare behind the glasses still bright with shock they followed him up the steps and tried to drag him away but he got free and came inside there wasnt anything i could do none of us could help him but he didnt seem to believe it we just had to to kick him out he fished the thing from his pocket and covered it as best he could with his cold longfingered hands excuse me i gave him a minute because he wouldnt even know what i was saying listen merrick they didnt turn up when id phoned him last evening on the way back from the hotel cracow it was to ask for three men part of the original plan and still part of the new one i still had to have them they didnt he frightened so easily i waited for another hour they were properly briefed i told them theyve been picked up that was the risk we took ill recruit another three the ochota units still no there isnt the time looking down at his hands he said numbly i did my best it wasnt your fault because he was doing it again with his numbed words and his raw schoolboy hands and his pathetic eagerness to please and his utter inability ever to manage it uncovering something again that i thought had been long ago buried in me a sense of compassion he looked up with a slow blink and stared at me as if id surprised him and maybe i had i suppose it was the first civil thing id ever said to him what about the cypherroom staff you got any leads not yet but anything positive anything negative come on he drew back on his chair tender as a seaanemone i havent been given much time and theyre making it very difficult i think theyve taken offence christ the world was full of them then he was pulling something else out of his coat and i knew instinctively that hed forgotten it until now and was hoping i wouldnt realise this is from london i didnt open it straight away you told london to give you a hand well yes you said i must they given you any leads not yet because ive got to send signals and if you think the cypherrooms monitoring your stuff then ill have to risk a direct line carefully he said theres nothing positive thats all i can tell you i ripped the envelope it was fourth series with firstdigit dupes pkl was instructed to furnish full interim report and itemise all info on opposition activities i read it twice its always useful and sometimes essential to control nervous reaction when the mind within a hundredth of a second is galvanised but its difficult not to let something show just a fraction of the shock that has suddenly taken ever while the eyes must remain contemplative and the hands perfectly steady and the voice expressionless its hard not to blink when lightning strikes close i didnt want to scare merrick he had enough to deal with london wants a report i put the signal away yes his hands cupped the bowl of garlic soup and he finished it he looked less chilled now less frightened by what hed seen at the embassy theyll be lucky to get it dont they know weve enough to do i thought id better put something on record look dont worry about the czyn people i asked for i can try wont you ever bloody well listen he flinched his hands pulling away from the empty bowl but i didnt care i was fed up with them egerton and the others whod been scraping away at this poor little bastards nerves till i couldnt even tick him off without shocking him i said dont worry about it they were to give me support while i tried to break out of warsaw but theres no need now he nodded contritely i see looking at him across the table at his pale boys face at the misery that dulled the eyes and turned the ends of the mouth at the pain that held him still in case movement would aggravate it i decided to use his innocence for my own ends i might as well tell you so that you can stop worrying that im now in direct touch with london you know why he stared at me for a long time wanting to find the right answer because if he got it wrong i might hit him again you think the cypherroom isnt safe thats right he blinked slowly thankful i suppose you youve got a kind of instinct about these things im a ferret ive learned to see in the dark he smiled faintly at my little joke i said listen to me merrick im telling london to pull you out till you get their signal keep away from czyn theyre done for and theres nothing more we need to know ive had new orders and as soon as ive cleared the pitch ill be pulling out too at the moment youre all right you can sign off at the embassy and get on a plane just another second secretary being recalled for reasons of diplomatic expedience but if you go near czyn again and get caught in a raid by the polish secret police theyll make a fuss and youll be kicked out publicly for inadmissible conduct and itll look messy i see yes he was sitting very still i got a pencil and made out a slip fleou qoanptn skkmao plqcv mzoplexk tut this last signal through for me he took it and folded it through the cypherroom ive switched the code i see first series prefix and transposed dupes now going into red sector it was one of their bloody rules when you found a hole youd got to go into without any chance of getting out again they wanted to know among the riffraff rank and file of the shadow executives its known as the clammy handshake and we call it that to make fun of it because it scares us to death make sure it goes out with that fledgling courage of his he said you can rely on me i got up and paid for the soup and he followed me to the door we shant be in contact again i told him see you in london some time when we came on to the platform i saw four of them kgb types in civilian clothes standing in pairs two on the left and two op the right their hands in the pockets of their black coats facing towards me along the platform parked behind the mail van was a darkwindowed saloon i looked back through the glass doors of the buffet and saw that two other men had come in through the other door from the street then i looked at merrick he stood rather stiffly his face white and his head down a little and his eyes squeezed half shut as if he were expecting me to do something to him though he knew i could do nothing it wasnt much more than a whisper and i only just heard im sorry deadline this is bodkin oh hello old boy how are things going the line wasnt very good mustnt grumble thats the stuff i heard someone being sick outside it was probably merrick they watched me the whole time rather like crows when you cross a field they werent dangerous now they would have been dangerous if id tried to run or throw some of kimuras pet numbers at them but there wouldnt have been any point it would have been a waste of time and i had a lot to do i suppose they didnt expect me to pick up a telephone it had floored them a fraction and one of them had got excited showing me his gun guns are no bloody good they only make everyone jump this lines lousy i said can you hear me all right on and off give them credit they hadnt actually let me make the connection myself in case i was calling the navy in i gave the receiver to the thin one who looked as if he was in charge and said if he didnt get me comrade foster in double quick time hed lose his rank when they found out from me hed refused it was nice to realise that foster hadnt bothered to change his name though the nearest the thin man got to it was vorstor in london it had meant another cosy party with lots of booze but in moscow it made a much bigger noise that was where i was now right in the middle of them i might as well be standing in red square he wasnt at the commissariat he was at the hotel cracow a stray thought came theyd probably done it with photographs look i said youre rocking the boat sorry about that old boy you should be its your own boat ah he sounded quite interested the helpful thing was that i was talking into a brilliant brain that could add up things for itself once it was given the data if id had to talk to some coweyed clot they wouldnt have understood what i was saying and that would have been fatal let me know if you cant hear me foster because this is important to both of us loud and clear at the moment i assume you know your little lots just ganged up on me do you we thought it best considering you couldnt be more wrong you know what im doing out here do i im nosing around the czyn situation to see whats in it for john bollocks more than that he said i think the line crackled like someone frying what about the diplomatic support thats expected from the uk if oh for christs sake if im going to save us both a lot of trouble youll bloody well have to talk sense like i am he only wanted to find out how much i knew it was merrick spreading that guff around and you know it you gave him the orders now listen to me a minute ive been in direct contact with london since you chose to start blocking my signals through merrick and my orders are to drop everything and try to make sure there isnt a revolution here next wednesday in other words the reports weve been sending in have given them a nasty turn and theyre frightened the talks are going to come unstuck this means in effect that you and i are now on the same side and although quite frankly id rather work with a dead rat ive no option we were the only people in here now the men and women and the kid with the red plastic guitar had cleared out as soon as theyd seen what was happening the woman whod brought our soup was behind the counter again washing up her face was gentle and motherly reminding me of mrs khrushchevs i think she was quietly praying there wouldnt be any shooting because the place had just been redecorated any questions i asked him the silence went on for a bit and i let it my impression of him in the moskwicz saloon had been that he was a civilised person with a soft core of morality that wasnt giving him any peace hed be sensitive for a long time perhaps all his life about how the english thought of him and at this moment he was probably taking his time to swallow my last remark that was all right because id made it deliberately to persuade him i was in a position of strength and we could talk on equal terms but i didnt like it the silence on the line i had to sell him cold in the next couple of minutes or lose the whole thing a compromise wasnt possible because the setup id worked out would still function and the timing was a bit near the hairspring youd better come and see me he said theres no time pity about that youre not being very bright you know ill give it to you straight call your people off and let me go on doing my thing and as soon as i can ill hand you the lot those are my new orders from london or you can shove me in a cell and three days from now youll find out youve been losing your grip and you wont like that a bloke with your reputation in moscow incidentally youll cost the lives of quite a few of your own people and that wont go down so well either the line sizzled again and i began sweating badly itd be damned silly if i lost the mission just because the polish telephone system had got dry rot in the selector units my left eyelid had begun flickering to a rogue nerve i must be getting old perhaps youd just give me a clue old boy would you in my place think straight ive got too much on and bloody little time to do it in so for christs sake get off my neck youre being he said slowly a wee bit proud all right im rotten with it at least its something you can understand i represent an intelligence service whose present interests happen to line up with yours and if you want me to cooperate its got to be level pegging and if you think im going to start by licking your boots youve got another think coming he kept me waiting again then on the line i heard a faint sound that brought his face suddenly into my mind the puffy eyes in the crumpled tissuepaper skin the long thin mouth with its hint of private irony he was using his flask in a moment he said whats your field czyn same old thing i told you didnt i london wants me to do what i can to help keep the peace for the talks youve been clearing the streets as quick as you can but therell still be a nasty lot of tnt going up on wednesday because there are one or two units left intact and you wont ever find them when id counted up to five i said i know where they are something snapped near where i was standing the woman had broken the handle off a cup she was drying her nerves in her fingers making them clumsy she put the handle on to the zinc draining board it looked like a bit out of a puzzle picture oh well find them all right id expected him to say that he couldnt have said anything else id laid my ace and hed trumped it and the best of luck of course he said reasonably that doesnt mean we wouldnt be able to do it quicker with your help im not helping you foster so get it straight i dont trade with your type our interests are parallel thats all so youre in luck the line went fuzzy and the sweat came again this thread was so thin and it was all i had listen you can do something practical as a kickoff ten days ago the ub pulled in someone from czyn and were going to want him i gave him the name hes got a head full of essential info that you wont get out of him they grilled him and drew blank but hell tell me what sort of info old boy tone rather lazy dont be bloody silly put it this way were trying to open a safe and he knows the combination if they got him ten days ago hell be across the frontier by now of course get him back i know it sounds easy but hes just one of find him and fly him in use a snowpatrol chopper i dont care how you do it thats your headache hold him for me till im ready it was all i could do now but i believed he was hooked sorry old boy but it wont work its all so awfully vague you see if you could just give me the odd pointer the wooden boards under my feet started vibrating and the whistle came from the distance a muted shriek it would be small at first but it was coming fast and would grow gigantic a black mountain on the move towards me im ringing off now foster youve had your chance just the odd pointer the thunder gathered beating at the windows a glass on the shelf tinkled against another an express from the north from olsztyn running through to warsaw central wheres your pride i had to shout a bit above the noise youre asking an intelligence officer in the other camp to give you clues and pointers you know that christ youre far gone no wonder you got yourself blown he was saying something but i couldnt hear properly something about surveillance what wed have to keep you under surveillance i let my eyes close i wanted to sleep the train went through and smoke billowed against the windows dimming the light as my eyes came open as long as they dont get in my way tell them that tell them to keep their distance and no tricks for your own sake you get that i handed the receiver to the thin man the sound faded the floorboards were still again yes the thin man said yes he kept saying yes comrade colonel they were all standing to some kind of attention because they knew who was at the other end an honorary rank he must have hated that to have his brand of subtle and specialised intelligence brought by implication to the level of the bovine military mind but theyd thought it was a compliment and his courtesy wouldnt have let him refuse a private englishman colonel of the red army his own bloody fault yes the thin man said then he put down the telephone and turned away from me speaking to the others two of them left by the door to the street the rest didnt move i went out to the platform and noticed merrick on a bench sitting alone and crouched over his gloved hands staring at the ground he didnt look up he may not have heard me i walked past the darkwindowed saloon and came to the open street the first pair were already ahead of me looking back sometimes the other two had taken up station behind me it was a boxtag and we dont often meet with it especially towards the end of a mission because when the heats on theres no time for either side to formulate rules but this was a specific situation and the rule was that if i didnt try any tricks theyd leave me alone except for overt surveillance i led them to the hotel kuznia thus blowing my new cover i wouldnt need it again by the time id reached room they were checking the register at the desk and getting the passport number of the anglik whod just taken his key very well the west german yes karl dollinger this one by the time my shoes were off and i was propped on the bed they were passing my cover to foster that was all right he had to feel reassured until i was ready to start the thing moving it would have to be tomorrow and i didnt care for that but it was fragile and haste could break it i thought began streaming i couldnt signal egerton that the untrained novice hed sent me to look after was a double agent for the kgb because my only communications were through the embassy and through merrick himself there was nothing wrong with the cypherroom staff when foster had bottled me up he hadnt left the cork out the cork was merrick they would have been content to sit back and wait for me to spring the trap but when id asked merrick to get me three people from czyn as a backup team hed passed it on and foster had decided not to risk anything hed been afraid id got some kind of coup lined up fancy him thinking a thing like that merrick himself hadnt known they were going to pick me up or he wouldnt have bothered to give me the signal from london my hand moved and i stopped it have to do better than that the phone wouldnt be bugged theyd just put a man in the switchboard room and leave him there id have to do it from outside in forty minutes from now at she was there and all i said was that id phone her again tomorrow on the hour or the halfhour she sounded edgy about something you all right i asked her they watched me from the corner by the state supermarket the others were across the road yes but the police came here when not long ago an hour ago your papers were all right nothing could have happened because she was still there but i had to relax my hand on the receiver do it consciously yes shed been unnerved that was all yes they looked at them and went away they come to see you or was it just a routine check they checked everyone in the hotel fine you wont see them again you know its all right now you can rely on your karta they stood like penguins their arms hanging by their sides and their heads raised slightly they were damned good i knew that on the way to the phone kiosk id thrown a feint doubling and using a street repair gang for cover nothing too patent because it didnt have to look like a test and theyd closed in very fast and revealed a third pair on the flank across the road it was a sixbox and it wasnt going to be easy when the time came she said goodnight for me to take care and goodnight on the way back to the kuznia i slipped on a patch of packed snow just in front of a parked taxi and the driver got out to see if i was hurt where do they go to the hotel cracow nowhere else always to the hotel cracow i hit the dirty snow from my coat i wont need you again after id gone a dozen paces i heard the loose thrust of the starter the forecast had been right snow began falling on the city before midnight the wind bringing it from the forestlands in the north wtorek tuesday the streets had become altered the new whiteness covering the soot and making the sky seem lighter during the morning i went out twice and made a show of telephoning talking with the contact down and using the chance of thinking aloud going over the major points and looking for trips not finding any i couldnt give it much longer now and the nerves were playing up because once id hit the switch the pace was going to be fierce and there wouldnt be time to rethink id give it till noon the time factor didnt balance i had to go slow to keep him happy letting them observe and report letting him see that i was ostensibly in contact with czyn and i had to go fast bringing the deadline back as far as i dared to noon the waiting was unpleasant and i sensed being caught up in the feverishness that today had come to warsaw showing in peoples eyes in the sudden movement of their heads when they believed someone was near them in small accidents as the snow thickened and the traffic tried to keep up speed impatient with the conditions in the increasing efforts of the police to search out the last of the suspected hostile elements a man in the hotel kuznia itself going with them peaceably through the lobby and then making a bid at the doors glass smashing and shouts and a shoe wrenched off and slithering across the pavement and under the wheel of a bus as they crowded him and threw him limp into the back of the saloon the fever had a name sroda at i was in my room and used the phone to book a call to london so that the man in the switchboard room could confirm what id told foster that i was in direct contact the delay was estimated at two hours and that was well across the deadline so i made it the foreign office governmental communication headquarters and told them to give me what priority they could at i blanked off mentally and let the subconscious review the whole setup without disturbance while i thought of irrelevant subjects theyd probably done it with photographs and id have to deal with that it had been a light brown shoe with arrowhead indentations on the sole for better grip still lying there when theyd driven away would they find a pair his size foster hadnt telephoned me although he knew my room number id half expected him to get through how are things going old boy to remind me that i was entirely in his hands but perhaps hed found a bit of pride at last didnt want me to think hed started panicking afraid of losing me at i rang the switchboard and asked if they were giving my london call priority they said there was nothing they could do there were many visitors here for the coming conference and the pressure on the lines was heavy i asked for a precise timecheck and rang off and set my watch no point in packing anything washing tackle could stay where it was on the shelf over the basin a chance a thin chance of coming here again check shoe laces and making double knots couple of glucose tablets all sweating a lot stress reaction developing hypothalamic stimulation pituitary and adrenal cortex secretion of cortin pulse rising the organism responding to the brains warning of danger to come normal therefore reassuring at noon i left the room and took the stairs and handed the key in at the desk and went through the doors and down the steps into the street and began walking breakout they came with me two ahead and two behind keeping their distance i checked the flank and saw two more and it threw me a fraction because they wouldnt have left the rear of the hotel uncovered it was an eightbox he really didnt want me to do anything that he didnt know about the snow fell from an irongrey sky and in a lot of the windows the lights were on i took the yellow trabant at the head of the rank and told him the dworzec warszawa glowna and as we pulled out i saw a black making a u turn across the station gates it tucked in and waited and i leaned forward with my arms on the front squab so that i could square up with the mirror it was an eightbox with mobility we passed two of them walking back to the kuznia to cover the point of departure routine and predictable two others were using an mo telephone point to report movement you cant plan anything specific when you have to flush an overt surveillance complex but you cant rely on luck either the compromise is to watch for breaks and take them and play them as they develop the difficulty is builtin with a covert tagging operation the assumption is that you dont know theyre on to you and if you sense and start flushing they wont risk showing themselves but in an overt situation theyll close in and block your run the minute you start anything fancy because theyve nothing to lose you already know theyre working on you so it has to be done very fast and the danger is that when you choose a break its got to be the right one because its going to be the only one youll get in this case thered been a gentlemans agreement between a rat and a ferret and when i broke the rules and made my run theyd go for an immediate snatch those were their orders because foster was taking a chance and he knew it my offer was quite a big one or he wouldnt have listened they knew that even if they decimated the population of warsaw by midnight tonight thered still be a few isolated czyn groups ready to shed their blood across the barricades and id told him i knew where they were but he didnt trust me he wasnt a fool the risk hed taken was calculated and hed imposed a breakoff point the point where i rent out for a flush the slaskodabrowski was a mess a fivetonner was spreading sand and clinkerdust along the north side and the traffic was being diverted a man with a flag at each end of the bridge someone had spun a mercedes and put the tail through a gap in the balustrade arid a crowd was there but it had happened some time ago because a small boy had lost interest and was throwing snowballs lobbing them high so theyd burst on the roof of the car a crash truck was crawling through the diversion lane with its heavyduty chains throwing out clods of broken ice and we had to wait and my driver said it was very molowniczy the snow in warsaw very picturesque did i not find it so the public services had been briefed by orbis and tomorrow when visitors were running for cover theyd be told how exciting the city was how very animated did they not agree firstclass chance of a break here with the fivetonner available for cover and the crash truck turning through ninety degrees across our bows and if it had been the boy with the quick eyes in the beatenup wolga id have told him to get traction and beat the gap and keep going but this was the trabant and id have to do it on foot and we were standing halfway across the bridge so thered only be one direction i could use no go the had closed right up not chancing anything in the mirror i saw their faces and they could see part of mine and we looked at each other it would be quicker for you to walk i think perhaps it was tempting what time does the train go in twenty minutes let him go through the gap when the crash truck had pulled over and get out and walk and use it for cover a fair chance a respectable chance you could walk there in twenty minutes im not sure of the way ill stay with you because a fair chance wasnt good enough it had to be as close to a certainty as i could make it this was only the first step in the operation id spent twentyfour hours working out and the setup was so flexible that even the merrick thing had only called for a bit of tinkering and if i made a mistake as early as this id blow the whole lot get out here on a bridge in daylight and id be a rat in a rut we can go now theres no hurry at the end of the bridge i saw an mo patrol car coming away from the kerb along the wybrzeze gdanksie and going through the amber in front of us pulling in again while we stood idling at the red theyd used a radio somewhere probably at the commissariat three blocks from the station yellow trabant taxi registration moving west across slaskodabrowski survey and contain you couldnt say he wasnt the cautious type it was going to be difficult have you got some paper an old envelope or something he rummaged in the glove pocket will this do we cleared the lights the mo patrol was three cars ahead of us and the immediately behind it was a yearold leaflet jazz gala at the andrzej kurylowicz winecellar but the back was plain writing wasnt easy because we were meeting with cross ruts at the intersections but he wouldnt be fussy when id finished i folded it twice warsaw central station you only have five minutes theres time get your ticket at the other end it is permitted warsaw central was busier than wilenska and i began watching the breaks as soon as i was in the main hall aware of conflicting needs the need to make a quick flush because was running out and the need to protect the overall operation from the risk of a precipitate move two main entrances and three gates towards the platform area upwards of a hundred people and a lot of them in groups of three or more bookstall orbis kiosk island cafeteria static and mobile cover say seventyfive per cent in normal conditions but he was being so bloody windy wouldnt give me a chance there was another factor now coming into play my movements were surveyed and they didnt have to be aimless take a taxi to a station but i couldnt just loaf around and walk away again they wouldnt like that on the other hand i didnt have anywhere to go except to the unknown place where in a minute from now or an hour from now id try for the break purposetremor was setting up in the muscles normal but hazardous my feet felt light and i breathed as if id been running check and decide and in deciding remember that the whole of the mission hangs on this and that hes up there robbing his bloody chilblains waiting for the phone to ring so for christs sake dont go and muck it just because the nerves are overtuned two at each main entrance two splitting up and bracketing the cafeteria blind spot two going down to the ticket barriers at three and nine oclock from centre all minor exits covered this wasnt a box it was a net these were elite muscovites trained till they ticked like a clock they may have been hi force to this extent round the hotel kuznia or held back in reserve until the movement report had gone in the thing was that within ten paces of the entrance where id come in theyd deprived me of visual cover their specialised field overlapping a neighbouring discipline the observation of vips in public places the two jobs had various factors in common and the chief of these was geometry they moved to their stations as if instructed by the computed findings of compass and protractor they knew the distance id have to go before the island cafeteria obscured me from points a and b the angle subtended by the view of c and d the sector through which i could move under observation from e f and g before the a and b zones picked me up again they didnt see the cafeteria or the bookstall or the ticketgates they saw vectors diagonals tangents it amounted to this if each man were a spotlight i would have no shadow all i needed to do was get where just for ten seconds they couldnt see me and they knew it and they werent going to let me so i crossed to the bookstall and bought a noon edition of zycie warsawy and gave the woman the leaflet id folded in four would you be kind enough to keep this for a moment a friend of mine will ask you for it i offered ten zlotys but she shook her head putting the message in the inside pocket of her lambswool coat will he give his name no but hes a russian gentleman youll know him by his accent i didnt look back until id reached the cafeteria towards the far side of the hall one of them was already there at the bookstall kawa prosze the girl pulled a waxedpaper cup from the column they hadnt necessarily seen me pass it but theyd seen me talking to the woman and a station bookstall is one of the classic letterdrops i estimated that hed get it within ten minutes two birds my movements were surveyed and mustnt be aimless and this was what i could have come here for and it would keep him happy for a few more hours dziekuje i stirred it all going well youll be glad you cooperated i shall see you this evening either at the praga commissariat or the hotel cracow in time for you to take all necessary action they wouldnt know it was for foster but that was where theyd send it immediate attention he was crossing over to the row of telephone kiosks now and one of his team was shifting obliquely to cover his pov i sipped my coffee most of the time would be taken up in spelling the thing cut and if it had been something id wanted to hurry id have written it in russian but there was no hurry needed and i was damned if an exscholar of the basingstoke elementary was going to write a note to an old etonian in slavonic hieroglyphs the english are born snobs analyse the data make the decision act he was coming out of the phonebox but he wasnt resuming station and the pattern had changed i hadnt expected that absorb new data he was a short man with a small head and a sloping walk and his shoes were quiet as he came and he came looking at no one looking everywhere but at no one not at me panic tried getting in but i took a slow breath the answer to panic is prana immediate construction id misjudged the conditions foster had decided that i was leaving it too late id said this evening and that hed settle for the info id collected since hed let me run without mailing for the rest he was edgy about the hhour for sroda they all were theyd pulled in enough czyn people to know that sroda would begin at midnight plus one eleven hours and thirtyone minutes from now we have stockpiles strategically dispersed subguns grenades landmines you name it wednesday morning hours the three main generating stations hit the sky will you be here dont be here wednesday pal the station at tamka wouldnt go up because theyd wiped out the unit there but in other places other buildings thered be radiocontrolled detonators still set up and the ub knew it the ub the kgb and foster his problem was simple and it was acute hed got to balance the risk that i was working against him with the hope that i was working for him and as the time ran out hed be driven to a compromise the man with the sloping walk looked at me now as he came i heard the faint squeezed sound from his creperubber soles he stopped do you speak russian yes he pulled a cheap plasticcovered notebook out of his black leather coat finding the page his breath smelt of czosnek listen please good of you to get in touch but youre leaving it too late well have to meet earlier than this evening the orders are to immobilise you at four oclock so do what you can before then his small head lifted do you understand yes do you wish to send a reply no very well i watched him go back to his station seven minutes call it half that for the fieldtobase transmission including his walk to the bookstall and from there to the telephone it was good communication on the move in a capital city with a travel pattern that could take me five or six miles from receiverbase i could hand in a signal to anyone bookseller road sweeper barman or just drop it on the ground and within an average of three and a half minutes foster would be reading it he was as close to me as that time was and i made it an overt movement checking my watch with the station clock as i walked from the cafeteria to the ticketgate area of course it was logical blind instinct is a contradiction in terms there was more chance of a break of making a break in a mainline station than in the streets a fair percentage of the placefeel had reached the brain through the feet this was one of the few extensive areas in the city where a running man wouldnt slip on snow the rest had been visual and deductive the sight of blind spots obstacles ticketbarriers the awareness that patterns would change and provide opportunities as groups of people moved and the trains came hi and went out the trains particularly in half a minute theyd throw a wall across the scene and in half a minute knock it down again a street was static and its confines predictable four of them had moved pacing along the two flanks turning when i turned going back the express for rzeszow was scheduled at no ticketgate people were moving up visual cover story for the tags was that i was here to meet someone and theyd be coming in from bydgoszcz in the northwest it was important to show that i was here to meet a train and not to catch one and this was made easier because foster had sent his reply in russian not english hed accept that any agent sent to this side of the curtain would understand russian and hed used it for two reasons to save tune by using normal speech instead of having to spell cut and to let his operator commit the situation to memory as he wrote it down in his own language the operator thus knew that i was to be immobilised in approximately three and a half hours and would assume i was agreeable to this good of you and well have to meet were phrases indicating a certain amount of accord between foster and me i therefore wouldnt be expected to leave warsaw on a train with a first stop two hundred and fifty kilometres away also it had been seen that i hadnt bought a ticket though thered been plenty of time paradox the barrier was my best exit the first representatives of the bonn government began arriving in warsaw this morning among them were the protocol secretariat and the personal aides of herr otto reintz the state secretary for foreign affairs and herr siegfried meyer the west german coordinator for the talks they were greeted in english on their arrival at the polish foreign ministry in a brief formal discussion they confirmed that the recognition of the oderneisse frontier will be placed high on the agenda wieslaw waniolka the young student of the college of fine arts who a fortnight ago forced the pilot of an lot antonov b aircraft to alter course for vienna has been charged on three counts of extortion restricting personalid contravening the austrian firearms law it has now been established that although avowed rightist groups were responsible for inciting disorder in the city during the past month demonstrations were mainly staged by students dissatisfied with educational conditions which are now receiving attention with a view to revision calm has returned to the capital thanks to the courageous efforts of all police departments i dropped it into the litter basket by the orbis information kiosk and turned back to the barrier will it be on time perhaps a few minutes late its the local lines that suffer most you have your ticket no im meeting a friend from bydgoszcz ah hell have had a pleasant journey the forests are very beautiful under the snow the gates were double thin wrought iron and flat topped head high both locked back by ballweighted tumbling levers he was the only official guarding them fifty to fiftyfive twelve stone five nine slow moving the muscles unused to sudden demands i checked my watch and paced to the centre of the hall trebling the distance and taking an interest in the schedules board when i turned back i saw one of them at the barrier what did the foreigner say to you he asked if the train would be late which train the train from bydgoszcz his friend is coming from there what friend he didnt say the visual cover story had now come alive and been put into the spoken word and it was important to establish meet as distinct from catch because it would keep them on this side of the barrier he crossed to the man with the small head and spoke to him and resumed station none of the others moved thered been no signal to move because they believed in meet a few minutes late say three four but he could be wrong an official was moving some people away from the edge of platform no and in the far distance a whistle sounded its thin note drifting on the wind and tunneling into the arched mouth of the station fifteen seconds or so later i saw signal wires jerk on their pulleys but chronometric time was no longer useful a train was now on its run in and it was probably the express it was now a matter of sighting it and adapting my movements to its approach so that i would be nearing the barrier as it drew in nearing the barrier without changing my pace it would be perfectly normal to turn sooner hearing the train or to quicken my steps a little impatient to meet my friend but i preferred to keep the pattern unchanged because id now made them familiar with it similarly any train would do for my purposes since what i needed were the attendant confusion and the erection of the sliding wall it didnt have to be the express but the pattern had been established to focus on no barrier and i didnt want to use a new one a different one because even the most experienced tags are human and therefore fallible mentally predicting the actions of the target and basing their own on his the consequent lulling effect produces a subsequent shock when the actions become inconsistent with their prediction in the hocherl reaction test the electroencephalograph will shift critically when the conditioned subject sees the pointer change its motion after a mere twentyfive beats and this is always confirmed in verbal questioning i thought it moved to the left again and i saw a kind of phantom image for a fraction of a second the pattern was going to be changed on the other side of the barrier and the visual psychological shock would produce a time gain of much more than a fraction of a second i might never need it but that kind of reasoning is sloppy and can be fatal preparation for any important action has got to be one hundred per cent and the instructors at norfolk have a phrase for it a bull at a gates never yet got out of the field from here the snow looked grey a mottled and slanting veil covering the mouth of the station and through it came the outline its size increasing dark grey on light other people were moving towards the barrier their voices rising and i made a final turn and came back noting the groups disposition the narrow gap between the two men on the left and the people in the middle the wider gap towards right centre distance now closing obstacles registered big suitcase near the women on the right unattended baggage trolley halfway between the two men and the gates ticketcollectors stool close against barriers all train slowing coasting to a crawl conrods lazy snow caked on the front of the locomotive and thick along the carriage roofs someone moved at the edge of the vision field and i looked back at the clock and down again porter not one of them not one of fosters men three more paces and i stopped filling the gap the wider gap towards right centre the one i would use of course they might have put someone into the platform area and it was a risk but a calculated risk so discount discount and wait and dont muck it wait for the first door the first one not till then when it swung open i moved foxhole he shouted at me but that was anticipated and there was nothing he could do because he couldnt leave his post at the barrier and within the first ten seconds i was behind reliable cover as the passengers began filling the platform between the train and the ticketgate area and then i heard him again but the nearest official was two carriages away on the forward end and by now i was walking taking my time keeping to cover but nearing the midsection carriage where most of the passengers had got out shell be here she said she would meet us a woman wept a fat woman buried in her thick coat the tears bright on her face no she wont be here it said in the paper you saw the paper i tell you she couldnt telephone because the lines were down at inowroclaw and besides they dont arrest the students they know theres no harm in them snow on the wet platform where boots had dislodged it from the footboard i climbed and turned left away from the head of the train edging along the corridor with my back to the windows then a clear run for the length of half a carriage then people again and baggage but it was in the brown one i remember putting it in there i havent got the brown one then youve left it in the compartment well have to go back they were so slow so slow they moved slowly they had arrived but i was just starting somewhere behind me a guard was using his whistle assumption there were ten of them and theyd deploy in open formation with the flank men covering platforms and and the centre group concentrating on and working the narrow area limited by the trains length and the two adjacent lines estimation i had another ninety seconds and there were two more carriage lengths to go i would need to hurry now mind what youre sorry ive left something theres no need oh yes there was need sweating badly the limits so very fine calculated but hazardously fine the centre group through the barrier by now and working their way along one or more would check underneath the train and that would slow them a bit but it wasnt a bonus it was allowed for part of the ninety seconds eighty seventy baggage stacked in the coupling bay climb over it not so many here now one more carriage stifling the heat full on and the windows misted watch for the orangecoloured poster through the misted glass get a bearing on that bloody well think back the way id come five seconds the top bag from the stack in the coupling bay a big one with retaining strap two seconds forward again with a total loss of twelve seconds but with the advantage of an altered imagecomponent orange glow on the window fur kepi tilted to the back of the head coat unbuttoned and hanging open swing the bag down first on to the platform the breathing heavy and the gait shortened to a fat mans waddle look directly towards the barrier nowhere else from the main hall the acuteangle perspective had given something like a tenyard error and although id allowed for it i now found that the entrance to the subway was well beyond the orange poster but there was nothing i could do about it the last of the passengers from this end of the train were giving their tickets in and going down the steps and i waddled after them puffing a lot stopping halfway to drop the bag and change it to the other hand coat flapping open picking up the bag and going on impression of people near some would be passengers moving up the platform to this end of the train destination rzeszow one or more would be fosters men but discount proximity whole thing depended on the altered image it was a single gate concertina trellis and half open but with enough room to go through at a run i wasnt going to run i have come from bydgoszcz i have no ticket heavy berlin accent the bag made a thump as i put it down getting my breath didnt you have enough time please were you late for the train ah yes i found my wallet you are prepared to pay but yes of course he nodded a stocky man with his peaked cap set conservatively straight a man without imagination but with a sense of responsibility too old now to be stirred by the rumours of a fight for freedom in tomorrows streets a stolid man prepared to weather the strictures of a regime hed come to accept since middle youth a man to whom i didnt say the police are looking for me let me through quickly in the cause of sroda i must see your papers here they are he opened my passport at the first page his thumb misshapen by an old accident the nail split and clogged with the grime of years of trains how much is the fare we shall see i listened to the footsteps they had started hurrying the people who walk all the way to the rear of a train are people who like a compartment to themselves they hurried past me behind me you must pay one hundred and thirty zlotys he over his fares schedule reluctant to close it and put it away a priest devoted to his bible the single fare is one hundred and twenty zlotys and there is the obligatory supplement of ten zlotys for failing to purchase a ticket at the here are one hundred and forty please keep the change i lifted the bag i cannot do that i am an official of the polish state railways he turned towards his booth besides you will require a receipt i do not wish for one i am in a hurry just the same i have to make out a receipt if i pushed past him through the gate he probably wouldnt shout after me because hed be too surprised the notes lay on his fare schedule so there was no question of failure to pay but id still be committing a breach of the rules and he would try to stop me raising his voice it couldnt be risked they were behind me now directly behind or to the right or left concentrating on the train searching for a man in hiding they mustnt be distracted i put the bag down he had found his receiptpad point of departure bydgoszcz thats what you said yes they would make a thorough search delaying the train until they were satisfied they could take their time because they were certain i couldnt leave the station a call would have gone out not later than a minute after id made the break and the station police would have been told to phone for mo assistance and a net would already be extending around the area and your reason for not purchasing a ticket was because you had no time yes it was an oblong form with eight or nine blanks point of departure time of departure intended destination particulars of personal identification amount paid amount paid total amount paid remarks i watched him write the ballpoint pen sloping at an odd angle because of his thumb i must see your passport again i gave it to him they knew i would never get through the net it would remain in place until the reinforcements of civil police had searched the station and questioned everyone in it they would be ordered particularly to look for a man who might try to pass a barrier without a ticket this name here is it stuttgart yes the writing isnt very clear fosters men wouldnt check the barriers theyd be deployed in the immediate area of the bydgoszczwarsaw rzeszow express covering the north end of the station where i might be expected to run if i left cover the mo contingents would see to the barriers and one of their men would be on his way here now he would question the ticket collector who would report a passenger without a ticket and from that moment the search would focus on the sub way area these were the limits id have to work in and id known that but the timefactor was tightening and i began noting the aural character of the footsteps to the left side of the barrier the patrol would approach from that direction from the main hall it was difficult because theyd started getting some of the baggage off the train and there was the rattling of trolleywheels one hundred and forty he counted the notes and opened his cashbox so the change will be ten zlotys a soundrhythm was coming in gradually dominating the background it was to the left and there were two of them two men walking in step their heels metaltipped ten zlotys thank you i picked up the bag wait a minute he tore the form at the perforation youll want your receipt close now walking in step thank you i took the receipt enjoy your stay in warsaw yes i will i didnt think there was time but it had to be tried and went through the gate and one of them called out when was on the fourth or fifth stair down so i swung the bag forward and back and let go and heard the shout break to a grunt as the bag struck and then i dived with my weight taking me clear across the rest of the stairs and sending me on to the subway floor in a feetfirst slide that was stopped by the wall with one shoulder taking the stock and my shoes finding a grip again and pitching me forward into a very fast run police whistles the coat was a nuisance flapping from the main hall id seen that the subway had five double staircases giving access to the eight platforms and that the one blind spot was made by a central waiting room shared by platforms and but now that i was actually working the area it didnt seem safe to rely on the blind spot because at this stage i didnt know the observation vectors on this side of the tram the train gave me highwall cover from only three of the platforms so that the blindspot value of the waiting room was nil except for a fiveyard stretch of the train itself i would have to stay below ground this had been allowed for the toaleta signs had been visible from the hall and their arrows pointed downwards that was why i had turned to the right there were two smaller signs just beyond the centre staircases and the washroom had a wide entrance with no doors the line of handbasins facing it below mirrors there was a key on the outside of the cleaners cupboard and i took it in with me and locked the door they were young or sketchily trained or too used to working in pairs because they both came into the subway instead of splitting up one following me and the other staying on the platform to watch the subway exits or they thought i might be difficult their boots were ringing and making echoes along the glazedceramic walls so that it sounded as if more than two were there soon there would actually be more than two because of the whistles the cupboard was very small and i was standing on one end of a broomhead gripping the handle to make sure it didnt tap the wall or the door if i shifted my position acrid fumes of carbolic and hypochlorite and the smell of a damp rag they were splitting up now both had checked the stair cases id passed just before the toaleta signs but one of them had been quicker and he was here now clattering about and kicking open the cubicle doors then the handle within a few inches of my sleeve was rattled but he didnt persist because he knew i couldnt have got through a locked door he went away joining his partner and the echoes grew faint i unlocked the door and went to the line of handbasins drinking from my cupped hands and splashing my face time was eight minutes from when id made the break it wasnt possible to know how long theyd keep up the search but the moment would come when the officer in charge would call it off leaving a skeleton cadre manning key points while he extended the hunt citywide i buttoned my coat running would be easier and the image was no longer useful there would be slight confusion when the reports went in because fosters kgb men were looking for someone with normal build and no luggage and the mo section had gone after a fat man with a bag hed thrown at them but theyd check and find karl dollinger on the carbon copy of the receipt at the ticket barrier and that was the name theyd found in the register at the hotel kuznia room i tore up the receipt and dropped it into a pan and flushed it and waited and flushed it again because one of the pieces was still floating principle dont carry items of identification even if they tally with your passport as a mental exercise i could have worked out more than one situation involving a search of the person in circumstances where it would be acceptable to be karl dollinger but not to someone whod passed through warsaw central between noon and one oclock today the mirror showed the eyes still flickering a bit from the reaction otherwise fresh the fur kepi had come off when id cleared the stairs and they would have found it and reported the new image id have to get another one because on this day in this city there wouldnt be a single man bearheaded the ballcock was shutting off and there was quiet here the train hadnt moved i would have heard it rumbling i would give them an hour an hour and a half at the most then id have to get clear because there was a lot of work to do before i called on foster this evening a freight went through at on the line directly overhead and the vibration set up noise from the handle of the metal bucket two other trains had come in and when the passengers had filled the subway i went into a cubicle and shut the door and waited until there was quiet again the riskpattern was formal the cleaner must arrive and it could happen at any time and if he found the cupboard locked and the key gone from the outside of the door he would report it at once knowing the police were looking for someone therefore i had to be in a cubicle not the cupboard when he came but the second wave of the search must also arrive and similarly it could happen at any time and i would have to be in the cupboard with the door locked and the key on the inside because they would search the cubicles but i couldnt distinguish between the footsteps of the cleaner and the footsteps of a single police patrol and a decision would have to be made cubicle or cupboard there was nothing to be done about this until the time came the lowrisk periods were when a train arrived and the passengers came through the subway the police wouldnt make a search for one man with the field confused i had spent a fair amount of thought on merrick some of it was constructive at a convenient moment before the normal life of the city was disturbed by action in the streets i would have to deal with him some of it was retrospective the hindsight clarification of points that had foxed me before id known what he was but despite the attitudes id learned and come to recognise as valid i couldnt think about him impersonally as just another component of the eastwest intelligence machine his face kept coming in front of me pale nervy vulnerable his eyes incapable of hiding the misery that was breaking him down double agents dont last long the strain is killing the exceptions are people like sorge foster obermann but the strain on them is no less killing its just that theyre harder to kill for a boy like merrick to go double was simply an elaborate attempt at suicide it was irrelevant that hed tried to take me with him other thoughts intensive attempt to work out how to get the maximum amount of information into egertons hands before the possibility of my nonsurvival foster wanted me alive but captive and the risk lay in the actions id have to take to remain free intensive thinking on this too intervals of freeranging images disjointed unimportant cannot locate references in mission report to actual train journey bydgoszczwarsaw therefore question amount of zlotys paid at dworzec warszawa glowna hours tuesday silly bitch i heard them coming at first one man and i listened for clues the cleaner might be a woman her steps lighter but this was a man the cleaner would be older possiblythan an mo officer thus might shuffle could detect no shuffle then suddenly there were the others and within a minute the confines were sharp with echoes they came from all directions down the double staircases and from each end of the subway in a blanket operation designed to remove the risk inherent in a simple wave motion a wave coverage moving from one end of the subway to the other could drive the quarry in front of it and allow him a chance of finding an exit all the exits were simultaneously blocked they were civil police in uniform their boots metalled and their pace regular none of them spoke their sound filled the passage i had to be quick getting into the cupboard because some of them were coming down the twin staircases close to the washroom and they would be here in a few seconds the metal bucket was a hazard its sound alien to the background and i was careful the locking of the door gave no trouble since the tumblers came within the same aural range as footsteps on stonework the earlier patrol had smashed the hinges of three cubicle doors in kicking them open but id left the other five closed so that these people would find something to do that would take their attention from the cupboard the mind of one policeman becomes much like anothers theyre trained to work as a group and their imagination is corporate the earlier patrol had gone for the obvious the cubicles and had given the cupboard only token attention it was possible that these would do the same two of them came into the washroom the others went past one began on the cubicles his boot crashing at the doors he would be standing back as he kicked his gun out of its holster and prepared to shoot and to shoot first the aim would be low foster would have given orders that i was to be taken alive the other had noticed the cupboard he wrenched three times at the handle i felt its movement against my sleeve then he crossed to the cubicles and used his boot the noise of the doors crashing open was very loud overwhelming the sounds coming from the subway the smell of the cleansing fluid had become stronger because my sense of sight was frustrated and the others were compensating stimulated by a crisis situation they finished with the cubicles and turned and came past the cupboard on their way out what about that ive tried it is it locked yes the handle moved again well have to make sure the explosion made me think he was firing at the lock but it was his boot against the panels thats no good it opens outwards look have to force it then what with well have to find something shoot round it round what the lock wed bring the others what about it theyll think weve got him finish up looking silly how can anyone be in there if the doors locked weve got to make sure you know what the captain said turn every stone ask someone where the key is then take all day you stay here and ill fetch an axe or something the sound of his boots faded so there was only one of them but the conditions were zero because the instant i turned the key hed hear it and get ready and id run into closerange shots he crossed to the far side and urinated at the stalls the main groups were leaving the subway and when the last of the echoes died they left total silence he moved again passing the cupboard his feet idling going through the entrance and then halting looking along the subway i had already raised my palm upwards and with the fingertips leading and touched nothing now i felt for the damp rag and found it and folded it into an oblong and draped it across the end of the broomhandle and began raising it by degrees the risk was high because there was so little room to work in id removed the key after locking the door but the handle and the metal bucket remained dangerous in total darkness i had to steer the broomhead past them both and touch neither keeping my elbow clear of the doorhandle as the arm was extended i had to work quickly and it was impossible discount need for speed and concentrate on need for silence sweat had begun creeping close to my eyes heartbeat audible the pulse fast another inch raise it another inch the end of the rag brushed across my face clammy and smelling of mould another inch he kicked at something perhaps a cigarette end flicking it with the toe of his boot taking a pace stopping the broomhead passed my face i lifted it higher the sound was loud and came from below me and i froze all movement and stood with the nerves reacting it was certain that hed heard and would turn and come back into the washroom and stand listening but he didnt do that and it took a full second for the forebrain to bring logic to bear the rag was halfsaturated and the moisture had started draining towards the ends and the first drip had hit the bucket and the sound was magnified by the funnel acoustics and to my ears it had been startling but to his it had been a strictly normal sound associated with plumbing and cisterns raising the broom i tilted it bringing the rag directly over my head because any sound however closely associated with the environs would increase his alertness silence lacking aural stimulus is an overall sensedepressant in noncrisis conditions for him there was no crisis he moved again coming back into the washroom and pacing there turning halting possibly he was looking at himself in the mirror as sometimes we do when we are alone seeking a reaffirmation of our identity he had begun whistling through his teeth the broom was as high as i could raise it i began bringing it down the second drip fell hitting my shoulder it would take time lowering the broom it would take as long as it had taken to raise it because the hazards were the same i had made progress was nearer by a brooms length to completing the mission but that didnt allow me to hurry i couldnt know how many more minutes i had left three or with luck five but not more than that because theyd be as quick about this as they could their groupsense would be disturbing them since the others had gone ahead and left them isolated i didnt think i could do it in three minutes but i thought i could do it in five footsteps no go have you got something it would take thirty seconds with a crowbar sixty with an axe that wasnt enough no then what the hell have you theres a ganger on his way here with something hes fetching it from the tool store christ well be all day he wont be long down an inch another inch the rag dripped this time on to my head the thick coat was a hazard deadening the nerves of the skin thered be no warning before the folds at the elbow caught the doorhandle lower smell of the rag sponger see anything of the others up there theyre working towards the end of the platforms stop a soft sound had begun near my feet and when i stopped moving the sound stopped too i moved the broom again downwards a quarter of an inch and the sound came back it was the bristles touching the rim of the bucket i didnt know it was so close so dangerous down an inch keep it clear the nerves were reacting and suddenly anger came anger with him with what hed say told me they found you in the station lav old boy sorry about that theyve got no sense of privacy those chaps hed enjoy saying that my break would have frightened him and hed want to take it out on mo sweat inside my hands because of the anger the head of the broom touched the floor beats me you know eh first we get orders to take things quiet so as not to alarm the visitors next thing theres half a brigade of us turnin warsaw central upside down it would be easier with the coat off but i couldnt take it off without knocking against the doorhandle i stood the broom against the back wall whos that the ganger i heard the footsteps coming do it now or stand here like a bloody fool because you think there isnt tune sorry about that old boy dont let him say it do it now come on then were in a hurry been quick as i could lets have it then sweat on the palms wipe it off the cupboard was small but not small enough for me to use a foot on each side of the side walls and i had to brace them both against the wall in front of me with my back pressed to the one behind but the chimneying action would be just as efficient and i began when they put the end of the crowbar into the jamb and started prising with it soundfactor to my advantage their greater noise covering mine splinters were coming away unknown datum was the exact height of the ceiling but i knew it was at least thirteen feet shoulderheight plus arms length plus handle of broom and therefore six feet higher than the top of the door press slide press its coming give me a bit of room then the door was shaking but the sound was below me now a crackle of splitting timber backmuscles signalling strain ignore the body will do what you mean it to do when it senses you wont take refusal press press harder this time shoulders on fire nervelights flashing under the lids harder higher press explosion of sound as the lock went the door banging back stop flood of light below but here i was in gloom all right wasted our time no we had to make sure i listened to their boots to the echoes fading when it was silent i came down i gave them one hour the cadre left in place at key points would probably comprise special mo patrols with a handful of policia ubespieczenia manning the public exits civilian dress i must go but the hazard was critical they knew my image knew that i was now bareheaded a train had been through and some people had come into the washroom and it wouldnt have been difficult to talk one of them into selling he his kepi but that would have been fatal theyd have stopped him at the exit where is your hat i sold it to a man in the toaleta fatal but i had to go now and take the hazard with me it was quiet here distant sounds shunting in the freight area voice on the pa system background of street traffic i went into the subway and turned left for the nearest staircase and we met face to face at the corner because the sound of his footsteps had been covered by my own combat he was one of fosters men it worried me because he ought not to be down here in the subway an hour had been quite long enough for half a brigade to deal with the station area and the main search should have been called off by now leaving only the exits under observation he shouldnt be so close to the centre as this and i didnt like it i couldnt see where id made the mistake then i got the answer and it was very simple he was in fact manning one of the peripheral points but had needed to come down to the lavatory it was reassuring to know i hadnt made a mistake i knew he was one of fosters men because his face showed immediate recognition my image was the known image and he was responding by reflex his actual features didnt mean anything to me but he had a brown leather coat on and id seen that two of them had been wearing coats that colour he was going very fast for his gun but i had to wait because if i engaged right away the thing would have to stay where it was and hed be able to get at it later if i got into an awkward position and i didnt want that to happen he had the eyes of an alsatian in the instant of attack wide open and with the pupils dark and enlarged the gold irises glittering his teeth were bared and this too gave him the look of a trained killer dog even so he appeared to need his gun and i had to wait several fractions of a second before it was in his hand at close quarters a gun is highly dangerous the danger is present before it leaves the holster since it gives a feeling of power of superiority thus leading to false confidence and the impression that no serious effort has to be made that the conflict has already been won the danger increases tenfold once the gun is in the hand because only one hand is left free for useful work at the same time the psychological danger remains present it is felt that the mere sight of the gun will intimidate the opponent to the extent of rendering him powerless quite incapable of movement if at this stage the opponent decides to move the danger becomes so great that it dominates the situation and can no longer be averted the simple act of moving confounds the strongly held belief that no movement will in fact be made and the surprise has the proportions of severe psychological shock kimuras first rule is grilled into new trainees until theyre sick of it but later it saves their lives when threatened by an armed man do nothing until he comes into close quarters its usually easy enough because he likes to frisk you and then you can go to work in this case i was lucky because wed walked into each other and the distance was perfect the gun was in his hand but that was all his index hadnt settled inside the trigger guard and he was nowhere near horizontal aim in another tenth of a second i would have had to use the routine deflection drill designed to get the body clear of the bullet but i didnt wait for that because the noise would alert the nearest patrols i chopped upwards against the wristnerve and the force swung him partly round as the gun spun high and hit the glazed tiles of the ceiling and that was all right but he was already hooking for a kite blow and i knew id been wrong he hadnt been relying a hundred per cent on his gunhed just thought it might be the most convenient way i went down first and he dropped and tried for the throat so i used the knee and he rolled and corrected and i thought it was probably kaminari a bastardised form of kung fu because he got very busy and couldnt relax the tensions so it was easy until the speed of the blows began foxing me and i had to go for a straight classic handedge for the shoulder hoping to numb and not succeeding the first time and not getting the chance to do it again because he was on to it and pulling clear and coming in again with a series of horribly fast kites that burned at the muscles while i hooked at what i could reach windpipe groin plexus trying for blows and then for locks and not getting them as i should specialised disciplines are effective within their range but none of them are flexible enough their patterns are too formalised pure karate can stop any amateur attack because it has the answer to every move in the book but there are one or two others and some of the kaminari blows have never been fully understood hi the west so that an element of the unknown enters the conflict and theres no time to rethink on the established techniques because this form of attack is tense and fast and accumulative the aim is to break down the opponent before hes had time to work for any kind of finalising strike or lock thats why karate has never been taught at norfolk they teach something different there i still couldnt use it his energy was appalling and the blows came chopping wickedly fast for the vulnerable points and i knew that if i left only one of them unprotected for a halfsecond hed be in there and finish me his attack was animal i couldnt believe that this creature could ever short of killing it be tamed or that once tamed it could speak or write with a pen in a human hand his breathing was like a wolfs his frenzy producing grunts through the teeth and nostrils a bestial snuffling and somewhere in my mind there was surprise that these werent claws ripping at me that i touched no fur yet his blows were infinitely disciplined and suddenly i knew that if i didnt do something quickly hed break me down and id have to be taken to foster in an ambulance my arms were losing strength and their muscles burned i couldnt shift his weight from across my legs for a long time for two or three seconds i let myself relax bringing the strikes closer to give him confidence then twisted and freed an elbow and drove it hard enough to disturb his rhythm and he shifted his weight and i went for a yoshida and brought it off but couldnt hold the full lock because he slipped it enough to sap the leverage and come in again with neck strikes so that i had to roll back and parry them light had begun flashing in my head a hokku and it threw him and i followed with the second stage of the lock but wasnt fast enough and his weight came back and i had to protect again because if only one of his strikes got through it would leave me paralysed my head throbbed pulsing to the rhythm of the flashing light and breathing was difficult now he fluttered above me a vague dark shape whose weight increased and bore down and smothered my movements and its snuffling became excited as the strikes hammered at the crossed shield of my arms and shifted their aim and hammered again and found the target protected but only clumsily now as i lost strength and worse lost science time was going no more time i needed time sorry about that old boy but you shouldnt have chanced your arm these chaps wont put up with it relax and bring him closer get the breathing right or its no go relax but i was a torch a body burning my own light blinding his blows poured pain into me and the flames burst brighter there was no time then let it be done without time now twist but he was ready and i had to try again and it didnt work but his aim was shifted and i moved the other way and felt purchase available as we rolled with my knee rising hard but not hard enough it baulked his strikes but he went for a neck lock and i had to stop it because it was a musubi and we are frightened of that one all of us lock and counterlock and we lay still the muscles alone engaged contraction without kinetics the hiss of our breathing the only sign of life then i felt purchase again my foot had come into contact with the wall of the subway and when i used it he was surprised and the lock went slack and i had time and forced him over and we lay still again but the position was changed and i saw that there was a blow i could use if i worked very quickly but i hesitated morality came into this and the awareness of what i was going to do was holding me back this was the jungle but even in the jungle there are laws a male wolf in combat with another and sensing mortal defeat will pause and expose its neck and the jugular vein tokening submission and the victor will leave it here the law didnt apply a vulnerable point had been exposed by chance and morality was out of place because the organism was shouting it down squealing for survival and i put the last of my strength into the blow it wasnt very hard because i was weakened now but it was effective because it struck the point that kimura had told us about then i got up and leaned with my back to the wall dragging air into my lungs while the nervelight went on flashing in my head a sound was somewhere a rumbling and i remembered where i was hi the railway station of a modern city where men could speak and write with pens it seemed a long tune since i was here before an act so primitive had brought a tune shift and the past few minutes had been measured in millennia the rumbling became thunder overhead and its rhythm slowed a train was stopping i would have liked to rest but thered soon be people here in the washroom i took his coat and kepi putting them on he was piotr rashidov attached to the th division of the polish state information services on temporary duty and his credentials carried the facsimile of the communist party seal i sat him in the end cubicle where the hinges were still intact locking the door and climbing over the partition dropping and checking that his feet looked as they should then i bathed my face turning away from the mirror when i dried it theres always the feeling of personal failure because its an easy thing to do and even when theres no choice it still has the look of a cheap trick there were more than id expected the train had pulled out and no one was in the middle platforms except for station staff and the mo patrols two of them were posted at the north end and that was the way i had to go because there were no ticketbarriers i walked steadily in the brown leather coat and kepi my legs were all right the punishment had been taken by the arms because his technique had forced me to shield head still throbbing and the throat raw though id drunk some water at the basin i looked at my watch the glass was smashed and the dial twisted and the hands torn away and when i took it off there was its shape imprinted on my wrist a purple weal the clock over the main hall barriers showed and it was no longer a question of hurrying but of cutting down the whole schedule and running it closer and hoping not to wreck it the two mo patrols werent moving they stood facing towards me dark figures against the screen of drifting snow at the stations mouth they were fifty feet away and there was no one between us along this stretch of platform the snow looked easeful whirling on the wind and i felt a longing to walk in it and be lost in it this place was a trap theyd want a report at the bureau was it necessary what were the possible alternatives was the person armed so forth and the sweat came on me again because they wanted too bloody much they wanted you to go in and do the job and come out with your tie straight and your hair brushed and your hands clean it was rather embarrassing for them this kind of thing and you had to be careful not to shout at them yes i had to do it because i was losing consciousness and it was the last chance id get and it was his bad luck that the point hed exposed was that one not my fault can happen to the best of us what do you think things are like when a couple of ferrets go at it tooth and claw in a tunnel under the ground quite put them off their tea i was walking faster because of the anger and the distance had closed to thirty feet and when id gone another five i began calling out to them in russian pointing behind me whos meant to be manning the barriers down there is it you they didnt bloody well understand so i said it again in polish keeping the vowels flat and rounding the rs and one of them came towards me with his paces circumspect the two barriers this side of the hall you think you can survey them at this distance without a pair of binoculars he stood with his bright eyes hating me but all he could legitimately do was ask for identification showing that just for a moment he had the upper hand by virtue of his uniform i would even expect it of him it was said that dabrowski himself couldnt enter his own official residence without showing his papers i must ask to see your credentials piotr rashidov the red seal was sufficient and i didnt give him time to study the photograph answer my question our orders are to guard this end of the platform and leave the barriers uncontrolled who is your officer there is a patrol on the other side of the barriers we shall see i turned my back to him and began walking again the way i had come looking to my left and to my right watching for signs of inefficiency among the uniformed patrols at the flank exits my shoulders were stiffening and the glare of the lamps went through my eyes and ached inside my head walking in this direction back into the trap and away from the healing and liberating snow was retrogressive and irked me and to an increasing extent worried me because hed be expected back at his post or back in the area he was controlling say in five minutes ten at the most two station officials on the far side of the barriers an mo patrol and a man in plain clothes i stared at them and turned away and stood with my back to them looking to the left and to the right swinging again on my heel and pacing to the north end of the platform and what patrols are there beyond this point you would have to ask my captain there should be patrols out there or is it that youre afraid of the cold the muscovite elite is not afraid of the cold and i moved past them and down the slope to the drifts that in the last hour had covered the tarred pebbles the rails made dark skeins through the snow i came back you have another hour here dont relax your vigilance pay particular attention when a train comes in i paced away from them slowly now turning my head to demonstrate that the demands of efficient observation are unremitting one must never be still one must look here look there ones eyes must be everywhere i stopped halfway to the barriers and stood sideways on my head still turning my gaze sweeping along the flank areas thirst was increasing because the combat had dehydrated the system and there hadnt been time for more than a few gulps in the washroom blood from burst capillaries was filling the lacerated tissue along the forearms and the muscles were still half numbed i didnt know if there was facial bruising because i hadnt looked at the mirror but i would need to check on that movement left i looked along the platform and saw someone on this side of the barriers a man in plain clothes one of the policia ubespieczenia patrols id stared at just now when id gone down there he stood facing towards me he would want to know who i was or he believed i was rashidov in the brown leather coat but wanted to know what i was doing here when recently id been in a different area so i signalled him a brief movement of my hand yes i am rashidov and turned away without seeing if he acknowledged the pulse quickening made the throbbing worse in my head instant availability of adrenalin but i had no use for it i couldnt run in ten seconds i turned my back to him finding something under the sole of my shoe and fretting at it chewing gumrubbing my shoe across the edge of the platform to scrape it away walking back towards the north end of the platform deep breaths deep regular breathing prana the answer to most ills the answer to panic the two mo patrols were watching me they had been standing the whole time with their backs to the snow they would have seen the man down there by the barriers when i was within a dozen feet of them i turned again and saw he was still there standing quite still facing in this direction i signalled again more emphatically jabbing a finger towards one of the flank exits he turned his head but could see nothing of interest and looked back at me not making any sign i shrugged he didnt understand he was a fool they declined to look at me when i turned and walked slowly past them they looked pointedly away from me in detestation the slope was gentle under my feet and i walked as far as the end where the drifts had begun covering the tarred pebbles the snow whirled from the open sky mesmerically some of the flakes touching my face as i lifted it i would hear them if they moved and they hadnt moved then i walked on through the deeper drifts slowly at first and then making my way more quickly over the rough terrain when i knew that the screen had thickened behind me and i was obliterated it was malowniczy the snow in warsaw very picturesque did i not find it so cracow it smelt of mothballs from where i stood i could see the door and i didnt look away from it when in an hour all right do it by phone i dont want you to go out she said it might be dangerous to use the phone less dangerous than going into the streets i felt surprised that it worried me so much but i suppose it was because the whole thing was entering its final stages and itd be a shame if they caught her as late as this once theyd thrown her into a train shed be lost for years among the camps but if she stayed in the city until after sroda shed have a chance a general amnesty was certain because of the talks as witness to the bountiful mercy of the mother state it was black astrakhan a hat to match and a cheap wristwatch seventy zlotys plus the brown leather one plus the hat the last of piotr rashidov hanging flat on a hook in the comer with the macs and dufflejackets near the door where cooking smells came because when they found him theyd know who it was whod walked out into the snow dont leave where you are give me your word very well you can tell when a lines bugged yes then theres no risk before i hung up she asked if she were going to see me again and i said yes and this time it wasnt a lie the rendezvous was for a hundred yards north of the slaskodabrowski bridge along the west bank three czyn people if possible trained in unarmed combat this time id get them because this time i wasnt asking merrick but they didnt turn up i waited thirty minutes and by that time my scalp was creeping because it had been bloody merrick whod exposed every one of my moves and i hadnt known it and now i knew it and he couldnt do it any more neither he nor foster could possibly know the moves i was making now every patrol of every branch of the civil and secret police was in the hunt and if they found me theyd slam me straight into a cell there was no chance that foster was giving me rope again letting me run and the line hadnt been bugged when you make an rdv in a city where theres a dragnet out you take damned good care of that at i went into the bar at the corner of mostowa and got through again they werent there are you sure i was listening to her voice the tone of her voice because i was right in the middle of a red sector and pushing my luck and it was just about as safe as taking the pin out and hoping it wouldnt go off quite sure i dont know what happened her tone was quiet with worry they got picked up she said it must be that a black moskwicz was pulling up outside with big mo letters on it i watched it through the window get me three more the receiver was beginning to feel slippery yes tell them to take care the hours were running towards midnight and anyone could be picked up they were busting whole units ill tell them no one was getting out there were four of them and they sat with their heads turned watching the bar in half an hour the same place i trusted her because it was logical they would have caught me there otherwise at on the west bank all right the moskwicz was moving off and i remembered there re traffic lights at the corner theyd stopped for the lights id forgotten they were there i mustnt forget things will it be long enough half an hour the coffee machine roared and i lost what she said what was that i will do all i can remember that please the thought came after id paid for the call you grow sensitive at this stage of a mission shed said it with slow emphasis and it could have carried the undertone of a classic alertphrase all i can am under duress stomachthink discount this time they should be there they didnt come an hour ago the wind from the north had changed and it had stopped snowing beyond the balustrade the vistula was a desert of white untouched by the soot that would later darken it along the wybrzeze gdanskie the traffic was still running its sound deadened by the new fall ashen light flowed from the lamps above my head triplicating my shadow i had asked merrick for them and hed blocked me now i had asked alinka all i can patrol car and i went down the steps again into shadow the steps were a hundred yards from the bridge and that was why id made the rendezvous here there was no time now to phone and make another one this was where time ran out there was no usable alternative project this was already the alternative to the one that had been blown up when theyd doubled the guards on the praga commissariat i could switch and go in alone and do damage but it wouldnt be enough and the risk was prohibitive not only to me but to the bureau the risk to myself was acceptable because of professional vanity we know that one day therell be a mission we shant complete and that the chances are that we shall go in ignominy a slack shape spreadeagled below the window of an empty room something afloat in a river and that it will have been for nothing and sometimes we think of how it could be otherwise of how we might play the odds and go out winning and be remembered for it be granted at least an epitaph hunter he was bucharest went down with the ship but christ what an operation we all remembered hunter discount considerations of stinking pride thered be a risk to the bureau to the sacred bull the chains crumped rhythmically through the snow and from the city centre came the moan of trams if it had been a deliberate alertphrase meaning she was under duress i would have to go along there and do something about it at least do that i expected him to go past but he stopped and stood with his back to me to the steps looking both ways taking a pace and coming back watching the traffic decoy you get too sensitive i was behind him before he heard me when i spoke he swung round with his hands whipping into the guard posture where are the other two he relaxed with the car where along there we didnt want to come on were late the hotel cracow was busier than yesterday because thered been a couple of flights in and the foyer was crowded most of the atmospherecoverage journalists were hemming hi the dip corps people free vodkas and i recognised maitland of the sunday post one of the brightest of the iwasthere boys i showed my credentials at the desk and they said they hoped there was to be no trouble and i said none at all i just wanted to visit one of their guests and they gave me the number of the suite dont announce me it was on the first floor and i pressed the buzzer there were voices somewhere speaking in english he was a short square man with his jacket pulled permanently out of shape by the holster i told him my name and he came back in less than five seconds and opened the door wider for me this was the sittingroom and there were four people here with typical courtesy he left his armchair and came towards me hello old boy come along in kick foster went across to the trolley i hope youll have a drink there isnt time theres always time old boy his laugh wasnt quite in key but he was doing pretty well because he must have been upset when they told him id slipped their surveillance i was his personal responsibility london wants a report yes theyll be lucky to get it dont they know weve enough to do dont worry about the czyn people i asked for there was a clinking sound perhaps the woman washing a cup i can try wont you ever bloody well listen i said dont worry about it they were to give me support while i tried to break out of warsaw but theres no need now i see foster turned round with a drink in his hand switch that thing off theres a good chap merrick reached for the tape recorder and the voices stopped he wouldnt look at me he sat hunched in the armchair just as hed sat on the bench at the station i felt sorry for him he thought i was only just finding out that hed used audio surveillance in the buffet while wed sat with our bowls of soup that was all right it was what i wanted them to think you put a mike across me did you he didnt answer you know how it is old boy foster tilted his glass and drank we like to have things on record hed been much more than upset when theyd told him id slipped them it wasnt coincidence that the tape had been playing when i got here he must have run it a dozen times since hed got the bad news from warsaw central listening for clues as to what kind of op id got lined up clues to where id gone well i hope it was worth listening to soso most of the tape could be dangerous but it was too late to worry about that it was safe even valuable to me from the point where merrick had exposed himself because from then onwards id suspected a mike and used it for my own purposes it was the point where hed given me the signal he said was from london in that instant he was blown thered been three things wrong the code was fourth series with firstdigit dupes pkl was instructed to furnish a fully detailed interim report these instructions were sent during the final phase of the mission fourth series was merricks code not mine and london would have used my own code or if for any reason theyd changed it to a different series theyd have put a prefix to indicate express intention and there wasnt a prefix they would have sent the signal to kd for karl dollinger and not to pkl for p k longstreet because longstreet had ceased to exist when theyd given me the new cover they wouldnt have asked for a fully detailed report during the final phase of the mission because they know that at this stage of a mission youre lucky if you can hit the telex or the shortwave let alone draft a tenpage coverage with itemised refs and carbons they knew i was in the final phase because sroda was the deadline for all of us merrick had been given the signal by fosters group because they too knew the deadline was close and they wanted all available info from me before sroda broke and the confusion gave me a chance of getting out of warsaw so the poor little tick had blown himself but my immediate decision was not to scare him by telling him i knew maybe i could have tried saving him at that moment by breathing on the bit of compassion hed managed to find in me giving it warmth tell him to get out and hole up and pray but i could use him now and anyway i think he would have walked out of the buffet and across the platform and under the next train hed been usable because of the mike foster knew id asked for three czyn people because merrick had told him so id let foster know why i wanted them direct on the tape i told him two important things that they were to help me leave warsaw and that i no longer needed them these were things he could accept the first gave him a plausible reason for my asking czyn for support to get me out of the city not to mount an offensive operation the second gave strength to what i knew id be telling him later here in this room that i no longer needed them because id been in direct touch with london and had orders to work with foster and not against him and would therefore expect him to let me out of warsaw as a temporary ally it wouldnt have mattered if thered been no mike the gist of it would have been passed on to foster as routine info but the tape gave it substance i wasnt in fact sure there was a mike it was just that merrick had been sitting unnaturally still at the table and id put it down to chest pains the asthma until he gave me the duff signal then i knew it could be because he was trying not to fuzz up a mike with background noise the friction of his clothes when he moved he could never do anything right tripping on things and dropping things cocking things up even when he used a mike on me it kicked back and he didnt know i believe youve already met voskarev the man hi the other chair got up yes he was the man with pale hands and thyroid eyes whod directed my interrogation at the ochota precinct after theyd ordered merrick to have me pulled in he lowered his head in a token bow but his eyes stayed on me round and staring the eyes of a fish he didnt sit down again but turned slightly away and stood gazing into the middle distance as if listening for something but i wasnt ready yet i had to wait for foster i needed a cue from him and it had to be the right one because it depended on his next words whether i had to kill off the whole operation or jack it into gear hows london kick it ive just had my orders confirmed london was the key he believed what id told him on the phone or believed some of it enough of it to test me for slips otherwise he wouldnt have been replaying the tape wouldnt have been interested would have told the man at the door here to put me in a cell and make damned sure this tune i didnt get out thats good his tone was sleepy been on to them direct yes not from the hotel kuznia his tone hadnt changed there was too much delay oh yes of course they told me he took a sip of scotch so youre still on our side that it whats it look like foster you think id have come here under my own steam otherwise i had to work up some anger the whole thing had to sound exactly right and a show of anger would do that i suppose not on the other hand you gave those chaps a lot of trouble not very sporting i mean if youre meant to be on our side christ havent you got the picture yet i told you id got a lot to do before i could come here and hand you the full works and i couldnt do it with a bunch of thickeared clods treading all over my heels the whole time you put them there because you were shitscared id go off on some lunatic suicide mission and do some damage right i dont expect you to trust me but i expect you to trust your own judgement and see the sense in what i was telling you on the phone does this man understand english if not ill say it again in russian because i want the whole of your outfit to know that if you start blocking me again youll cost yourselves a good deal of valuable help and god knows you need it i looked at voskarev but he was staring at the wall better still tell him yourself your russians a bit more fluent than mine part of your contract foster was looking into his tumbler in a moment he said idly they found a man this afternoon in a lavatory he looked at me and i saw that a certain shine had come to his eyes under their puffy lids he didnt like what id said about his contract and he didnt like his people being found like that my anger was counterfeit but his was the real thing and i was going to keep working on it because in anger the judgement suffers that was your own fault i told you not to let them get in my way youre slipping you know that what are you by this time a bottleaday man they all go like that once theyre blown i went close to him and he didnt look away the trouble with you slavs is that you cant stand back far enough to get a world view the bonn proposals have opened up the chance of an eastwest detente that could wipe out a lot of the mutual fear thats keeping both camps with one hand on the hotline telephone and the other on the nuclear trigger and all you can worry about is a thug found dead in a lavatory i could hear movement behind me voskarev getting restless it was a fair bet he understood english and didnt like what he heard because comrade colonel foster was their blueeyed boy and i didnt sound too impressed they cant stand heresy foster was perfect give him that he took a sip of whisky and savoured it and said mildly all i mean is old boy that you must have been rather keen to go off on your own which makes it difficult for us to believe youve nothing to hide from us why did you have to listen foster i turned away and moved about so that i could keep them all in sight it wasnt the time for anyone to do something silly i told you there are one or two czyn units still intact and i had to go and talk to them and i didnt intend exposing them to your people so that you could give orders to have them wiped out they trust me and that might be a new idea to a man like you but its a fact of life if youve any more stupid bloody questions i dont want to hear them now because warsaws going to blow up if we dont do something to stop it and we havent got long i went over to the trolley and found some soda and hit the tit and drank a glassful it was very quiet in the room youd better be more specific now youre talking i turned back to him did you bring in ludwiczak for me hes on his way but i told you to fly him hi and that was thirty hours ago its not really the problem of transport there are always formalities how longs he going to be kept hanging around while theyre filling in forms hes our key man and we cant do much without him cant you phone someone he spoke to voskarev in russian and he stopped staring at the wall and picked up the telephone merrick had left his chair and stood with his back to us and i heard the atomiser pumping the guard was still by the door i had to do it now and the sweat was coming out because if it didnt work first time it wouldnt ever work at all and i watched voskarev at the phone as if it was important that ludwiczak was here he spoke to foster not to me they are bringing him through the airport foster nodded and looked at me to see if i understood we cant wait for him i said youd better leave orders that hes to be brought here and kept under close guard till we get back the pain in my head was starting again and the bruises along my arms felt like muscular fever were not foster said gently going anywhere i shrugged looking at my watch do it your way im easy but the praga commissariats due to go up in an hour from now i make it hours that about right to go up his tone was extra sleepy and that was all right he was absorbing reaction its detonated for hours he glanced at the gilt sunburst clock oh is it i saw voskarev transferring his stare to foster he understood english all right foster drained his tumbler and took it across to the trolley his steps short and with a slight spring to them he nodded as voskarev went to the telephone then turned back to me what sort of detonators are they ludwiczak could tell us that id imagine theyre radiocontrolled like the ones at the tamka powerstation i suppose the police found that stuff there did they they did yes he watched me attentively no smile now the eyes less sleepy fair enough tamka was for midnight he nodded yes they told us nobody told us about the commissariat then youre lucky voskarev was speaking in polish quite fast and with a lot of authority when hed put the phone down he got his coat and the heavy black briefcase that had been resting against the chair foster hesitated and i knew why the praga commissariat was his base and hed got to get hi there and out again while the walls were still standing then he got his coat i want you to come with us i want to talk to you on the way i thought maybe you would the courtyard was cobbled and the big saloon drifted a bit on the snow in spite of its chains foster took the occasional seat and sat hanging on to the looped strap as we turned east towards praga he spoke more quickly than usual and his eyes were alert you werent actually sent from london to take any kind of action against czyn i told you what had come up yes but keep on filling me in will you theres nothing new except that my people have started panicking at the last minute because the fos putting pressure on them first they told me to explore and report on the czyn situation and then they began chucking fully urgent signals for me to assist and advise the ub and now im apparently expected to keep the lid on warsaw singlehanded their usual bloody style i opted to cooperate with you off my own bat why should i skin my nose on the grindstone while you sit on your arse he gave a brief smile but the nerves still showed through it ive hardly been doing that i think weve quite a big problem here and i dont expect you to understand its proportions these urgent signals he said with polite interest didnt reach you through the british embassy i suppose oh christ i said and we both laughed it was a private joke we were two seasoned professionals and shared the understanding of our trade and our trade was deception so i knew what he was doing he was testing his own agent merrick of course they didnt he would have passed you the dupes i just wondered give the little bastard his due he did a firstclass op for you and if london hadnt sent me new orders it would have been chopchop and no flowers you know that surely thats worth at least a lancecorporalship in the red army he laughed again but it didnt have quite the same sound because he knew i was guying his colonelcy i wiped the steam off the window and looked out at the people along the pavements the reaction was starting to set in the delayed shock of what had happened in the station buffet one minute i was watching merrick and feeling glad that hed soon be back in london and safety and the next minute i was trying to absorb the realisation that his job in warsaw had been to cut me down and trap me for the kgb i hadnt thought about it since it had happened because there hadnt been time it had floated in my head like a nightmare you cant remember in detail but can remember having had i was thinking of egerton now rather than merrick egerton with his chilblains and his prim confidence in what he was doing hes been fully screened of course ive no intention of saddling you with a potential risk if i had the luck to see london again id have egerton out on his neck the least we expect of control is that they dont recruit an agent already recruited by moscow and then tell us to hold his hand i couldnt do it by signals my only communications were through merrick and the embassy because direct contact had been banned since coleman had used a phone in amsterdam and didnt hear the bugs the saloon gave a lurch and foster hung on to his strap a fireservice vehicle had been klaxoning for gangway and its amber rotating lamp went past as we tucked in to let it through i think we hit the kerb with a rear wheel before we pulled straight again the kerb or a drift of packed ice foster was looking at me rather sharply wed have heard it i said from this distance are you sure the basements crammed with the stuff he looked away nervous and physical courage dont always come in the same package for twenty years this man had run the most sensitive type of operation known to the trade watching his words and weighing them whenever he spoke wherever he was cold sober in his whitehall office or halfdrunk in a womans flat fabricating his lies and testing them detecting flaws and repairing them and listening all the time for a false note in the speech of others that would tell him of danger carrying for twenty years a bomb that ticked in his pocket but hed no stomach for the real thing for trinitrotoluene there are other places according to the czyn people i spoke to which places youre not thinking straight foster if i knew which places id tell you the only one im certain about is the praga commissariat and i told you as soon as i could my orders are to help you keep the peace in this fair city try getting it into your head the records office he said reflectively would be another place id say so what price an amnesty when you can blow up the evidence the records office stocked secret information on every single citizen its your own fault theres not much time left youve wiped out most of czyn and the diehard survivors are going to make sure theres some action before they join the rest praga was rigged for midnight originally the same as taraka youd have had more time he shut up for a bit i think he was working out the odds he was still a topline professional and he had a big operation running and he could only save it by going into his base and pulling the documentation out in time on the other hand he didnt like thinking about his skin plastered all over what was left of the ceiling voskarev hadnt spoken since wed got into the car i watched his reflection on the glass of the division between the dark shapes of the driver and escort in a moment foster said if they find the explosive and defuse it wed better have ludwiczak brought along to talk to us hell talk to me he wont talk to you gently the same thing surely since your instructions are to help me prevent disorder i just mean dont scare him off we dont want to scare anybody old boy the thing is that well need to put some calls out as soon as we know which are the other places evacuate the night staffs and so on youre not worried about the night staffs you dont want one and a half million dossiers to go up in smoke because you cant run a slave state without big brother there was another lurch and he steadied himself on the tipup seat through the clear patch hed made on the window i could see the arc of lamps hi the distance the slaskodabrowski bridge then we began a nasty wobble and i could see the wheel jerking in the drivers hands foster held on to his strap the wobble got worse and we slowed pulling alongside the kerb whats happening it looks like a flat the car stopped and the driver got out and tapped at the window calling something we couldnt hear voskarev opened the door asking in polish what the matter was i regret that we have a puncture you must get us a taxi foster told him quickly the driver pulled the door wide open and chopped for voskarevs wrist to paralyse it in case there was a gun apparently there was because the left hand went for the pocket of the coat but the driver got there first so it was all right i told foster dont do anything silly i didnt bother to look for a gun on him he wasnt the type to carry one the only thing you could say for the bloody man document i told voskarev i wanted his keys and his papers he stared around him as if looking for a street number through the clouded glass as if lost in a place hed thought familiar i said ill get them otherwise dont embarrass yourself he opened his astrakhan coat fumbling like an old man fast i said very fast indeed the driver said hed get them for me and i told him to shut up the driver wanted to kill him i knew that six all cylindertype two on a separate ring series numbers in sequence tapers the engine was still running exhaust gas came through the open door yellow light flooded the snow and went out oh come on i said sweat was on his white face glazing it like a toffeeapple foster spoke to him quietly in russian telling him not to worry he would retrieve the situation such a windy phrase that n k n voskarev deputy chief controller coordinated information services foreign division seals and frankings ub liaison all facilities requested up to ministerial privilege level big fish i kept the passport and gave the identity card to the driver theres a man under escort arriving at the cracow within the next half an hour show this to his guards and tell them youre taking him over voskarevs orders get him to base understood a red card had dropped out of the folder and i picked it up and looked at it wheres your insulin here voskarev tapped his case get it the air came in freezing against our legs the driver stood impatiently his breath clouding the escort had shifted behind the wheel in case we had to take off suddenly look you want that insulin give you five seconds stuff was flashing us no parking here only wanted a patrol red very red sector i looked at the driver right the briefcase was still open and voskarev was trying to zip it he clutched the hypodermic kit in one hand the case stays here he tried to take it with him and the driver did the wrist thing and papers hit the floor then he was pulled out bloody well calm down will you he can keep the insulin and use it when he wants to hes no good to us in a coma you beat him up and ill have you kicked into the camps i can do that now get moving i dragged the door shut the man at the wheel got into gear and i slapped the division and told him to wait it doesnt foster said look too well organised best you can do with hired labour i wound the division down the handle was loose and took a bit more off the veneered panel foster sat with his hand still in the looped strap his eyes were almost closed two slits glinting in the baggy flesh youre making it worse for yourself he said police klaxons were piping a seesaw note somewhere on the far side of the river doors slammed much closer behind us dont do that i had to kick upwards before he could reach the handle hed seen it done on the telly or somewhere this wasnt his type of field at all he was politicalintellectual the big moves over a glass of bubbly then a man came past from the other car and got into the front and shut the door and i said hurry but dont crash foster showed his expertise the top off onehanded still strap hanging calm the nerves trick after trick down the drain he should have smashed it into my face not his field i said information theyre poles and proud of it and voskarevs been responsible for filling the trams with their own brothers and they know that im going to phone them in fifteen minutes failing which theyre going to kill him theyre hoping i wont be able to phone dont make it easy for them will you i got the loose papers and stuffed them into the briefcase and zipped it and sat back and watched foster he screwed the top on and put it away if you think about it he said earnestly you really havent the ghost of a chance right in the middle of warsaw i do wish youd try to be reasonable i didnt feel like answering i was fed up because he was probably right the two in front were talking but we couldnt hear much something about sroda they sounded pleased with themselves thought wed captured the city between us what happened to the other chaps foster asked me what other chaps i was trying to think ahead about the photographs and things my driver and his mate were they russian or polish russian i think i didnt really know them then youre too late now they were no use as hostages and i hadnt given any specific instructions about what should be done with them afterwards happened in the courtyard youve got a flat tyre and theyd got out to look a night for flats but we were still running all right making good time i can get you a reduced sentence you know ive quite a lot of influence oh balls the bridge was clear stuff crawling in both directions a hole in the balustrade where the mercedes had spun the gravel making dirty brown streaks on the late snow foster said something ought to be sure what i was doing something like that but i wasnt listening because there was so much to think about and i didnt want to make a mistake although with a setup this sensitive a mistake was almost guaranteed and it wouldnt have to be a big one just a slip and shed blow there were some police cars when we reached the commissariat and the steps were cordoned off just before we pulled up i said dont forget the situation will you he didnt answer but sat there squinting at me and i got a bit worried that hed do something awkward simply because this wasnt his kind of terrain for instance you cant stop a charging bull by pointing a gun at it because it doesnt know what the thing is youve got to look after voskarev and the only way you can do it is to look after me he leaned forward the alcohol on his breath there are so many aspects you havent considered they make it all so dangerous for you so impossible just be careful for his sake i opened the door and he followed me out get those bods out of here tell them it was a false alarm he stood perfectly still was it of course he looked so relieved that i think he would have done whatever i asked just from gratitude one of them came up to us captains insignia and foster showed him his card absolute assurance incorrectly informed no explosives personal responsibility so forth then we passed through the cordon and went into the building and the contusions started throbbing again because the very acute fear that he might chance it and hand me over had dominated physical pain when we were going up in the lift i heard the bombdisposal team in the basement being told to pull out foster stood idly watching the wall sliding downwards on the other side of the gates his breathing had become heavy the only sign that he was disturbed there was a citywide search going on and hed just passed me through a cordon and he hadnt liked that it was the big doublewindowed room at the end of the third floor and he used his key and i told him to go in first then i followed define infiltrate destroy i had defined and was now infiltrating i picked up the phone and told them the situation was in hand and that id be phoning at fifteenminute intervals foster got his keys out but i took them from him there could be a gun in a drawer and i was going to be too busy to stop him playing about we really ought to discuss the position youre in old boy youd thank me later take that chair over there and sit on it three reasons for utmost haste given enough time i knew that foster could outthink me the sector was still bright red until i could get him to my own base merrick or the guard at the hotel cracow might telephone the commissariat to ask ft things were all right and if i answered their call theyd want to speak to foster and id have to let them or theyd know things werent all right and hed use an alertphrase and i wouldnt be able to stop him the safe came open with the two keys on the separate ring of voskarevs bunch and i began with the top metal drawer because it was logical to file recent and current material highest most of the stuff was in russian but none of it encoded and i went for main headings and serialnumbered collations and found one specific document summarising the whole of the operation under sections preliminary evidence prima facie integration of testimonies dossier of accused summary of charges the name n k n voskarev appeared throughout with the title of chief of enquiry and the name of colonel a s foster began appearing on the reports dated later than january which was the day hed flown in from moscow two other names were featured my senses were atrophying to a slight degree the sound of the traffic seemed muffled and the light in here was keyed lower quite normal the effect of sudden concentration as the typed symbols jumped and the mind span incapable of containing this scale of significance movement and my eyes nicked but he was only crossing his legs in reflex i said softly sit still i was looking again at the document so here it was the programme id sensed was running in the silence and in the dark smooth and massive and perfectly engineered designed to protect the eastwest talks from abortive collapse in the event of insurgence by the people of poland and subsequent control of the capital by armed force under the provisions of the warsaw pact precis a special tribunal to be convened in moscow for the immediate trial of a western agent sent into warsaw for the express purpose of activating the interests of an international imperialist conspiracy indictment inciting dissension and revolt providing clandestine liaison with western factions conveying assurances of diplomatic support from capitalist powers the trial to be attended by international correspondents with all facilities required to make manifest the guilt of the accused and the gravity of his acts a show trial on the garry powers scale with a scapegoat dragged into the limelight and butchered on the block of political expedience a man with two names p k longstreet alias karl dollinger theres nothing i heard foster saying you can do about it because you cant leave poland i went through the rest of the drawers he was standing behind me get over there and sit down damn you angry because id let him move without my seeing him postpone all thoughts about the document until the sector was green otherwise highly dangerous im not going to do anything old boy but he couldnt get his tone right were alone here and there might not be another chance like this we can talk the whole thing over and do a deal on the quiet ill accept your word and you can accept mine give me a brief confession and i can arrange that you wont get more than three years good conduct special remission you know the drift otherwise its for life now do be sensible i tugged at the last drawer but it was locked and i had to open it with one of voskarevs keys then they were in my hand mm strip of negs and a set of prints id always thought it was how theyd done it with photographs the streets looked different but not because of the new snowfall there werent so many people about and the traffic was thinning between praga and the city centre there was a darkened car standing at almost every intersection those who didnt want to be involved were keeping indoors and those who were waiting for midnight were lying low no one stopped us the car carried policeplates thered been a briefcase hi the office and id cleared it out and refilled it with the stuff i wanted and it was on the carpeted floor with voskarevs the main document was on my lap and i leafed through it because there might be a chance to summarise the key facts in signals before i had a go at breaking a frontier that would be when theyd get me if i reached that far voskarev was working satisfactorily as a hostage but there was a deadline on that he and foster werent officially involved in the counterinsurgent operations but they were in liaison with the police divisions and theyd be reported as missing any tune now after all we only need to prove our point that the uprising was incited by the west weve nothing against you personally his smile had great charm in it and his tone was patient once youve been convicted youll be of no further use to us sorry to put it that way but im sure you understand so therell be no point in taking it out on you afterwards were not spiteful you know he was on the tipup seat he seemed to like it there i remembered something about backtrouble a slipped disc or something at parties he always chose an upright chair i said you couldnt have used merrick didnt you know that on the relevant pages of the document merricks name had been crossed out and longstreet written above it by hand hes got diplomatic immunity the most you could have done was kick him out of the country generally speaking yes but wed have made sure hed elect to go on trial thats why we chose him instead of a known agent like browning of mi hes piddling about at the embassy i expect youre aware of that i never know anything about mi he gave a soft laugh same old thing the departments in london dont hit it off do they never have but young merrick was just the job you see we wanted to create an inexperienced man and groom him for stardom someone we could rely on to say the right things at the trial then you turned up supposing you can ever get me inside a tribunal you think ill say all the right things you dont need to youve been incriminating yourself since the day you flew in and its all down there in the reports sent in by merrick it wont really matter what you say lights reflected in the glass division and i watched them and they steadied and followed for two blocks through the central area past ogrod saski park and i began sweating because the minute foster was reported missing the moskwicz would become a trap i dont think its a police car old boy but it will be sooner or later he leaned towards me and said with absolute sincerity youll have to accept my little offer so you ought to do it now because dont you see youre only adding to the charges playing right into their hands ill try telling them i went with you to the commissariat of my own free will but old voskys going to bleat out the whole story you must see youre making things difficult for me basic brainwash technique the operator allies himself with the subject without any pretence of switching loyalties their hands friendly attitude old vosky not such a bad chap if you treat him right what dyou think the chances are foster he wouldnt tell the truth unless it suited him but itd give me an idea of what else he wanted to sell me the puffy lids opened wider in surprise theyre a hundred per cent i give you my word that the maximum will be three years providing you the chances of moscow sending tanks in he looked away i hadnt done it deliberately but for a moment hed thought i was hooked it depends how far things go that could be the truth for the past three days thered been careful announcements about tank regiments carrying out winder manoeuvres ten miles outside the city to test the efficacy of mobile armoured units in snow conditions how far dyou think thingsll go he spread his hands in appeal weve done all we can as you know to weed out the rowdy elements if those remaining decide to make a nuisance of themselves then well just have to keep order surely thats reasonable we had to do it in prague page paragraph the proven guilt of the accused will not only make it clear that incitement to disturbance was wholly motivated by foreign capitalist powers but also that similar motivation led to similar events in czechoslovakia a fact that hitherto other nations have shown the most obdurate reluctance to accept it was different there in prague there werent any talks set up itll make you think twice this time actually no his eyes had gone sleepy again in prague we lacked evidence of foreign conspiracy any necessity to keep order in warsaw tomorrow will be seen to be fully justified as a matter of fact unofficially of course well be rather in your debt the hotel alzacki was in a side street of the station district and a commissarstyle saloon would attract attention there but we couldnt get out and walk the last hundred yards because the mo patrols were stopping everyone and checking papers and we could be past the deadline by now they might be looking for foster as well as for me take it east of the river and leave it in the dark and make your way back separately i got foster across the pavement and inside he recognised me the man with the bismarck head and the weathered face he said they were upstairs it was a billiardroom on the first floor and the guns came out when they heard us and i hold them to put the bloody things away strain was setting in and i tended to sweat too easily and resented it because there wasnt time for the nerves to start playing up voskarev was on the floor with his back to a leg of the billiardtable a thin boy with a torn coat and a shocked face was huddled in a leather armchair and alinka was crouched near him rubbing his blue hands to warm them the three czyn people stayed near the door after wed come in one of them was the driver whod brought voskarev here voskarev looked numbed his face waxy in the flat hard light from the lamps over the table he was clutching his handkerchief in a stained ball who bit him i did medium weight gymnastic type the small eyes close together the head lowered a fraction as he came across to me typical boxers pose for the local sports page his hands came up much too late and he spun once and smashed into the rack of cues and sent a chair over and hit the wall and slid down it and didnt move any more the other two looked at him i told you to leave that man alone the same thing goes for this one god help you if you forget again throw some water on him a lot of noise came and the shaded lamps began swinging throughtrain alinka moved across to me stopping halfway her feet together her dark eyes quiet she looked younger from behind her jan ludwiczak watched me not sure of me not sure of anyone after the bright lights and the rubber coshes and the blindwindowed train to the east why was he brought back she asked me he was the only one with a name i knew i went over and looked at the man on the floor in case it was anything serious but there was only a scalp lesion the cues had taken the initial impact come on wheres that water and put voskarev in a chair get him a drink ask the patron for some vodka up here they had to help him and i went across did they take the insulin away no can you do it yourself yes youll need food afterwards he stared up at me i wish to speak with colonel foster i cant allow that typical police thinking show them a shred of humanity and they think youre a bloody fool there was a tap running i had to know the meaning of all sounds this one was all right a pole had gone into the next room for water i told the other to watch the briefcases and see that voskarev and foster didnt talk then i went downstairs to the reception desk he asked straight away where i was i listened for bugs and said im still with foster and voskarev and everythings under control is the guard there yes his tone was bleak this was the first time hed spoken to me since hed said he was sorry tell him we want you to meet us at the praga commissariat immediately is that clear yes but what the bomb has been located and its all right now listen carefully tell the guard youre going to the commissariat but go to the british embassy instead to the chancery not the residence get the cypherroom staff back on duty as soon as you arrive tell the embassy guard to expect me in half an hour my papers re in the name of karl dollinger and ill speak to him in german i shall ask to see you have you got that for a moment he didnt answer and i knew why he was being crucified then his voice came faintly yes but i cant listen merrick stay in the embassy and dont contact anyone except for the signals crew youll be safe there the silence drew out again no i wont theyll only but he couldnt finish in those words i heard all human desolation they cant do anything more to you now ive got the photographs silence merrick did you hear what i said in a moment yes he began sobbing and i rang off ashes at hours i crossed into british territory it had seemed a long way from the hotel to the embassy though it was only a couple of miles id brought the mercedes the car theyd used to switch voskarev from the commissariat saloon it had seemed a long way because the coordinated police divisions had been searching the city for me since id made my break from warsaw central and by now the hunt would have become intensified i hadnt asked merrick if hed tried to contact foster at the commissariat but he would have done that when ludwiczak was taken over at the hotel craeow it would have worried him dangerous not to assume that both foster and voskarev were now reported missing last seen in company of dollinger i left the mercedes in the yard parked broadsideon to the main entrance as a point of routine the plates would have been noted by the police observationpost in the street outside but might not have gone on record no one else could see them now unless they came right into the yard only two of the windows showed light merrick was in a small room on the first floor there was a change in him he looked much the same but the tension was gone he reminded me of a man id seen just pulling out of a killing trip on one of the amphetamines physically weak deathly pale the handmovements uncertain but the eyes calm perfectly calm he said this is webster signals yes small alert cheerful man knitted tie and rotarian badge breastpocket stuffed with pens hes okay now he looked at merrick again okay now yes i asked what had happened eh he saw someone run over turns you up merrick went and stood at the window his back to us is that the cypherroom an inner door was ajar thats right with his pert gaze he tried to see who i was what i was a redeyed man with stubble and a german name and no trace of accent something urgent to send open up transmission okay hed put a pad ready for me on the desk you got a pen im giving it to you direct ill have to have it written its rules just open it up dyou mind i dumped the briefcases on to a chair and got one open and took out the envelope and dropped it flat on the desk so merrick could hear it theyre yours i pulled the door open webster had half closed it behind him a cypherroom is sacred ground you cant come in here i heard merrick in the other room opening the envelope do they ever jam you i sat on the nearest stool i mean by accident on purpose not often get crowboroughs acknowledgement on a wordcount for each sending what codeve you got standard he just meant bugger off dont send standard the cowled lamps threw a lot of backglare and i could feel needles in my eyes it wasnt exactly fatigue the organism that started panicking because some of the brainthink had filtered through and it was squealing to know what i intended to do about its survival and there wasnt an answer send priority it didnt want to stay trapped in this dark winter city where people would try to kill it webster wasnt touching the knobs id been vouched for by a second secretary but it wasnt enough ill want some kind of authority by approximate reckoning itd take five minutes to give it in fifth series and another five minutes for him to reencode it wouldnt matter if anyone was tuned in i was destroying their operation and they couldnt stop me they could only stop me if i gave them enough time these are to bl extension no copies and no repeats you ready for me first kgb operation mounted to stage rigged showtrial as proof that hold on a minute hed found bl e on his list for the curtain embassies it approximates to the hotline and i suppose hed never had to use it before he threw a couple of switches and dialled for pips and got them and said okay kgb operation mounted to stage rigged showtrial as evidence of evidence or proof proof i let my eyes close against the glare proof of western conspiracy to incite polish uprising he was on automatic encode but i didnt want to rush this so i gave him tune justification thus established in event of subjugation by warsaw pact forces primary aim protection of imminent eastwest talks i heard him making an interval receptioncheck this operation now defused since candidate for trial no longer available but suggest all western agencies warsaw receive immediate warning to retrench in case effort made to provide substitute my foot slipped off the rung of the stool and i sat up and opened my eyes bloody little organism trying to flake out and forget its problems relevant documents by qm next run dollinger i found him in a room at the end of the passage putting the lid back on the castiron stove even though he knew id come in he stood for a minute listening to the dyingaway of the flames then he looked at me i know exactly how he saw me exactly what i represented to him id become a composite creature the object of his hate for my having seen the photographs gratitude for having vouchsafed him their destruction guilt for what he had done to me and fear for what i might now do to him how did you find them i knew where to look he went to the door and shut it the building was quiet and webster was still in the cypherroom waiting for an answer to my second signal there wont be any others will there no the negs had been the middle ten in a roll of thirtysix and the rest were blank automatic exposure with a dummy run and timed cutoff the prints tallying he stood uncertainly his raw hands hanging from his sleeves and his feet neither together nor astride the calm that had come to his eyes was also hi his voice he could speak abstractly about things that had been for him so recently a crucifixion it was horrible of them to do that just routine they do it to anyone they can get hold of embassy staffs businessmen didnt you know its the classic hellodearie i didnt want to ask but i had to because someone else might be glad to know he was off the hook who was the boyfriend his eyes squeezed shut behind the spectacles and he couldnt say anything for a second or two then it was over someone i met in a bar i didnt see him again because if it was anyone here in the embassy wed have to fix things no the door clicked open there was a draught somewhere and the catch hadnt quite sprung home when hed shut it he could never do anything properly he pressed it harder this time they told you theyd send those to your father yes and to a sunday paper sir walford merrick kcmg obe equerry to the queens household an initialled spoon beside the silver eggcup the paperknife arranged beside the mail and in the mail a letter with a polish stamp and in the newspaper the headline first thing you did was to throw yourself under that tram yes never anything properly i hooked a chair from the desk and sat on it and the organism woke up and squealed that wed got no shelter here because there wasnt any diplomatic immunity british territory or not and no hope of a plane and no frontier that didnt border a russiancontrolled state but there were some things i needed to know and only merrick could tell me they asked you to give them information on czyn what else suddenly he said why did they choose me you were in prague in august so they were going to pin that one on you too youd already got friends in czyn so you could develop your access to information on their programme youve got personal tendencies so they could take pictures to entrap you your fathers position was their guarantee that youd obey orders and it also gave you great value as an exchangemonkey if there was no uprising and therefore no invasion and therefore no trial he was only taking some of it in the first time hed known he was being groomed as a star turn in the moscow circus was a few minutes ago when hed heard my signal through the open doorway of the cypherroom and he was having to look back over the recent past and see it in this new light i was thinking suddenly of egerton again sitting up there rubbing the bloody ointment in while both merrick and i were headed for perdition it was a case of murderous incompetence and id have him roasted for it the worst hazard of them all is a mission formulated on false concepts and in this case it was his belief that merrick was just another second secretary willing to do a little bit on the side for the uk secret services hes been fully screened of course i had to stop thinking about it egerton was done for anyway the document included references to merricks recruitment by the kgb prior to his sickleave in london what are you going to do with me his eyes watched me vulnerable submissive send you home he nodded howhow long will they give me whats that mean for what ive done you think youve done anything that matters i worked for them for moscow dont get any illusions of grandeur you made a mess and ive cleared it up thats all the poor little bastard was trying to get rid of some of the guilt by picturing a stretch in the scrubs youll be declared persona non grata for having engaged in inadmissible activities and put on a plane they might try fixing you up with a bad smash on the way to the airport because youve been witness to their operation but im going to stop that one then suddenly i saw what he meant listen merrick once youre in london the whole things over for you in a case like this there wont be any muckraking because it wont suit anyones book weve bust their project wide open and the press handouts are going to be strictly propagandist even the fo wont know the full story and it wont ask any questions because theyll be too busy putting the flags out youll leave the diplomatic service and go into some other ministry with firstclass recommendations and thatll be that so if youre thinking of trying another trick with a tram you can forget it slowly i said your father will know absolutely nothing nothing about the photographs nothing about your involvement with the kgb nothing his face was perfectly blank i couldnt tell if it had got through to him then i knew it had im just going to be let off christ havent you paid enough stop thinking about crime and bloody punishment will you its old hat you got caught in the works youre not the only one and youve been lucky so settle for that i was fed up with his chocolatebox morality with his inability to know that in the intelligence services youve got to wrench your sense of values round till they face the other way look i want to know some things what were they after specifically when they told you to volunteer for a uk espionage job while you were on sickleave in london im sorry i dont quite oh come on merrick he was still lost in his dreams of atonement the kgb recruited you and you tried to kill yourself and it didnt come off so you went on leave and while you were in london they told you to fish around for a job in one of the hush services and im asking you why they did it because i couldnt make it fit theyd picked him for the show trial not for infiltrating the opposition it wasnt their idea my head seemed to freeze and thought went cold after a bit i said whose was it mine youd better tell me then he had to get the bloody thing out and pump it excuse me get a chair yes right when i was on leave i told mr frazer about whos he head of personnel at the foreign office we all like him because he takes a lot of real interest in us and all right dutch uncle well i told him about the photographs and asked him what i could do he was very worried oh my god the whole picture began coming up the one i hadnt been able to see when id stood at the window scratching the ice away with my nails at that time i didnt have the facts i had one now egerton had known whats the matter he was worried what did he do he said hed get someones advice frazer could have gone to someone he knew in mi or the oib or the security service but it had happened to be egerton frazer was in a bad spot because the press wouldnt have any mercy on him if it came out that yet another homosexual had been posted to a curtain embassy a high security risk because of his susceptiblity to being compromised since the vassall case the public had lost patience and this time there were added dangers the person of sir walford merrick increased the menace of the photographs and at the same time brought the risk of explosive scandal close to the throne he didnt say whos advice he was going to get no he just said it was someone who knew about things like that then the bastards did a deal im not sure never mind cosily over a glass of sherry well what dyou expect me to do about it i dont know but id be grateful for any advice think hed be willing to do a bit of work for us id imagine so hes in a pretty awful state about those damned snapshots all right then send him along and well find a little job for him then you can both stop worrying the time had been right things looked like getting rough in the polish republic and the uk was interested in what the chances were of revolt and subsequent invasion and what the effect would be on the eastwest talks merrick could keep his ear to the ground and at the same time pass back info on the kgb their orders to him would be analysed in london to provide an insight into the way moscow was thinking a bargains a bargain however foul a word in the ear of sir walford across the coffeetable or in the calidarium or on the eighteenth green if he should hear anything or receive any kind of evidence to the detriment of his son he should discount it totally since certain duties of high value to his country might expose him to false accusations it was horrible of them to do that and those bastards in london no better i suppose you told them you doubted your capabilities no experience in hush operations so forth he watched me from above his hands his hands were cupped against his face as if he were trying to hide hed get over that given time given peace yes i did but they said id be among friends at the embassy and theyd send someone out here to look after me who directed you hed only met egerton once and id been there i never knew his name there was a question he wanted to ask but he knew it might sound naive and make him look silly hed had enough humiliation i did it for him he said i wasnt to be told youd been entrapped by the kgb i wasnt to know he nodded his hands sliding away from his face because egerton had seen the risk that merrick was doubling for moscow and his coverstory was the photographs and his job was to infiltrate the bureau and hed wanted me to find out if a control director knows his executive in the field knows his style and potential he can do things with him that would otherwise be impossible the directorexecutive relationship is peculiar to the trade and has immense value for both parties but especially for control egerton had selected me for a mission that i didnt even know was being given me a little trip abroad only a few days and hed sent me in blind knowing that if i worked to form id find the target for myself sniffing out the directions and scratching away at the earth like a good little ferret until i reached what he knew must be there somewhere east of the oder and made my kill he had known essentially that most of us would have refused to take on a job as diffuse as this with no local control no communications except through the embassy and no positive leadingin data to work on and hed selected me because he knew id want to go in deeper the minute i sensed the field simply because i like being left alone when ive found something to play with it had been the only way to rope me in the mission had been to make contact with the kgb discover their project and inactivate it define infiltrate and destroy that was now accomplished this operation now defused the risk hadnt been high hed known i wouldnt go nearer merrick than id go to a rabid dog until id got the scent of the field and located its hazards and if i tripped a snare hed expect me to cut loose you were told not to expose me to the kgb that right his hands went to his face again and he didnt answer and i got up and kicked the chair clear and said for christs sake give yourself a break will you london knew there was the risk but i dont blame them and i dont blame you im still here arent i and im in bloody sight better shape than you are so stop picking your nits about it all im after is plain information exposed me by accident did you he nodded into his hands well im not surprised when youre doubling there comes a point when you dont know which way youre facing that was on friday was it come on im pushed for time yes he got up and tried to face me and couldnt and just stood there with his head down and i turned away and looked at the picture on the wall donkeys in clovelly far cry from here friday the bar the rendezvous at the roxana thats why hed been worse than usual ill with nerves he knew hed blown me thered been no tags or id have seen them or sensed them theyd wanted to pull me in without my suspecting merrick or id never contact him again so theyd used window surveillance in relay and passed me from street to street till i was more than a mile from the roxana and then theyd rigged the pickup with ordinary patrols just asking for papers for dokumenty then theyd sent for foster have a look at me and let me go see where id run that was when they did the switch and started preparing me for the tribunal instead of merrick i tried not to give you away i did try civil of you you dont believe that oh yes but hed had no chance driven by both sides till he broke didnt you trust their word in london at first he knew what i meant he was straight on to it because for weeks hed lived in terror then when i was out here again they began reminding me asking me again for my fathers correct address you know what theyre yes so thats all i kept thinking about my father actually looking at them even though hed been told not to take any notice i heard him using the thing and then he said i wanted to warn you but i thought you might leave warsaw if i did and then theyd have known they couldnt trust me any more so theyd have sent the get it out of your mind i turned back to him and it was all right now he wasnt looking so bloody abject there was only one more thing i wanted to know our last rendezvous in the station buffet did you know they were going to come for me there yes i only just heard it then what made them tell you to pass on that fake signal what did they want a full interim report for when i was booked for grilling his face went loose and he lost contact completely because these things had stopped meaning anything to him i said its important merrick he nodded and made an effort and i waited i was meant to give it to you earlier but i forgot i think he saved himself then from any grudge i might ever have held against him webster was getting something through when i went along to the cypher room there was a phone in the annexe and i picked it up he came through the doorway while i was trying the buttons how does this thing work want an outside line i he pressed the one with the worn sellotape tag and i dialled for the hotel cracow we looked up whats that sounds like a chopper hed put the signalslip on the desk in front of me hamilton quay end crane did you do a wordcount check thats right he was trying to clip another pen into his breast pocket but there wasnt room hotel krakow tak jest i asked for maitland the helicopter was still nosing about and a flush of light passed across the window anything to send asked webster no he went to shut down the console maitland whos that listen tomorrow morning theres a second secretary leaving the embassy for london and the ub might arrange an accident on the route to the airport so why dont you turn up and follow the embassy car let everyone know youre the press take plenty of rollies you get the drift well well youll need some kind of excuse human angle while the pinstripe elite of the dip set come flocking into the flashlights here goes one unassuming second sec on his lone way home so lets give him a cheer lads a natural for the mums dont leave him till he gets on the plane roger thing is i can beat the street with a nice faked smash thatll only happen if im not there to cover it what dyou do in the coffee break make up crosswords the light flooded the rooftops again slanting off the snow i asked him if he could hear a chopper what yes theyre getting fidgety midnight curfew for all polish nationals leave cancelled for the police and the army foreign residents prone to a slight loosening of the bowels what shall i do with my poor fido they wont let him on a plane and im not going to leave him behind who are you anyway the ambassador word in your ear you never had this call didnt i were being bugged didnt you hear the click i thought it was your teeth he rang off smartly there was nothing they could do if they wanted to fake a crump theyd have to do it in front of a western camera someone was talking in russian then a lot of splurge came i went into the cypher room what stations that voice of america webster cut the treble and the whole range sank into the porridge they often jam it theyve not done it since prague he changed the wavelength and there was more porridge radio free europe then he flicked the band and got a girl in slow emphatic polish one of the warsaw stations hidden up somewhere been to the point if minister podhal had explained the presence tonight of more than five hundred medium tanks and one quarter million motorised troops standing by along motorroute e within twelve kilometres of the capital if we ace to conclude that these forces are more no think theyll come in no because theyd lost their licence to occupy the city the document in the other room well i cant see whos going to stop them do some things for me will you he followed me through the doorway put those two briefcases into the dip bag and seal it i cant do that can merrick not officially till the morning i shut my eyes again because of the light because of having to think of small important details because of the worry about what i had to do next the bloody little organism snivelling for what it knew we couldnt get a quick plane home look phone he get him along here and give him the pitch the what oh christ the picture ask merrick he knows hes got to leave warsaw by the next plane waive all formalities hes not safe here and that bags got to reach london highest priority tell the queens messenger whats on youve got a rough idea very far away an emergency klaxon sounded and then the buildings muted it i bent over the briefcases to check the zips and a muscular spasm gripped my chest and i had to wait till it passed listen i want you to stay with merrick dont take him to the residence keep him here okay fetch the doc along shall i can do and dont let him go near windows watch him for aspirins hes depressed you okay yourself are you yes just look after him for me i savvy book that call did you call the local rules see theyre red hot on expenses ill take care of it dont worry he unclipped one of his pens i went along the passage and past the room with the castiron stove and its red curling ashes then down the stairs and into the bitter night air it was a clear run back to the hotel alzacki the streets were deserted the curfew was for thirty minutes from now and people didnt want to be caught out because their watch had stopped a few taxis theyd be journalists covering the scene the hotel was halfway along the street and they came in from the far end while i was switching the engine off a darkcoloured mobile patrol slowing on sidelights and a couple of seconds later my mirror went bright i knew the mercedes was all right so it was the hotel itself they were closing on i threw the door shut and crossed the brittle snow on the pavement and went inside sroda the staircase curved and i caught at the banister rail pulling myself up one of them was guarding the door and i told him to get inside a tin tray on the billiardtable dirty bowls and spoons and the smell of czosnek the ludwiczak boy asleep nothing else different alinka it couldnt be said in front of foster because there was a last chance he might not see the vulnerable point that could finish me as she came quickly the slamming of metal doors sounded from below and in the halflit passage her eyes glittered police listen im takingthe englishman and not coming back get control of them if you can tell them voskarevs no good as a hostage if they kill him make them see sense for your own sakes the door below came open and we heard their boots she turned her head to listen contempt on her shadowed mouth then looked up at me thank you for my brother they watched me as i went back through the doorway and foster was standing up and on his face i saw fear and knew it was for voskarev a man tried to get past me with his rifle and i pushed him back stay here and keep quiet foster i want you he looked once at the russian and may have said something to him then he followed me out and i shut the door through the banisters i could see the cap of the man guarding the main entrance while the search spread through the ground floor theyll kill him i said you know that he looked at me without enmity his mind too disciplined for abstraction im not sure he said that i can do it we went down the stairs together a lieutenant was at the desk throwing questions at the patron and swung round when he saw us foster showed him his credentials and i heard him trying to get authority into his tone what were they doing here the commissar saloon had been reported as having been seen outside this hotel yes it had brought us here what was the trouble the comrade colonel and the deputy chief controller were said to be missing some fool foster told him with a flash of impatience is spreading confusion comrade deputy chief voskarev has gone to the najwyzsza izba kontroli now get your men out of here i turned to the patron and apologised formally for the disturbance as the orders were shouted along the passage the tramp of boots gathered at the entrance and an engine started up outside the lieutenants salute to foster was perfunctory the polish mo branch was at present under control of the coordinated information services foreign division and the position was one of sufferance foster was standing perfectly still i think he was waiting for the sound of a shot from the billiardroom in hostage situations the death rate is highest when a search comes close the rhythm of snowchains passed the building and then it was quiet all right i took his arm because he was turning towards the stairs the street smelt of exhaust gas where are we going the ignition and oilpressure lights dimmed out and i turned by gunning up and bouncing the rear off the kerb because there wasnt room for the lock i didnt answer him he sat without a word until we were into zawisza square and it occurred to me that he knew what i was going to do with him sidelights came into the mirror and i noted them the square was heavily patrolled and the white beam of a lamp swung from somewhere above us a rooftop command post a long way off i heard the chopping of rotors again then there was firing of some kind nearer to us and i checked my watch it was midnight minus one a minute to sroda will you be here dont be here wednesday pal the shape was still in the mirror i dont know if foster had caught a reflection or heard the chains but he looked round and then sat facing forward again youre going to have a crack at getting out then im taking you to london he didnt say anything immediately but i heard him suck his breath in his fear was in the car like a smell he didnt want to go to london there were people there whod believed they were his friends and he had something in common with all shabby men he couldnt face his creditors throw me to the pack eh no formal trial i brought the speed up another few kph and no faked evidence i was taking the odd chance with the unpredictable surface but they didnt drop back one of my eyelids had started flickering because hed had time to think about things and there was the vulnerable point that could finish me and i no longer believed hed miss it revenge is sweet that old lark oh balls you dont mean anything more to me than something on a doorstep and its mutual there was a soft area in him that i hadnt suspected an inability not to emote it felt sticky a fullscale trials going to tell us a lot more about you and your network im just taking some goods home its my trade we crossed jerozolimskie and headed north and heard firing again then youve had it old boy without you in control of those nervy idiots your hostage is as good as finished i felt my scalp go tight not necessarily suddenly his discipline broke and his voice became very bright if theres another police raid theyll shoot him before theyre taken otherwise theyll shoot him in any case when hes no more use he was a good man you know that he was my one friend the only man who ever understood bloody shame what chance did you give the others to understand he made me sick the street lamps flickered and steadied again i took the next set of lights on the red and the shape closed right in filling the mirror when he spoke again hed got the control back thats a patrol car behind as i suppose you know they werent satisfied thatd be it wouldnt it theyre checking to see where we go better pull in you know the score now they began flashing and i tipped the mirror when the trap closes you shake at the bars its a reflex all animals do it their klaxon started up and i took an intersection and hit piled snow and got her back and swung left and saw id blown it because there were barriers across the street and the lights flickered again and went right out one of the power stations gone up no help to me dark figures moving among lamps the shadows alive and something waving red and white stripes then flashes poppling the dark and i spun the wheel and felt the front end go foster calling something the bodywork taking a shock and then another one rapid rifle fire still spinning and then the rear hit a kerb and we bounced and some feel came back into the steering and i used it sudden brilliance striking across my eyes the patrol car coming at us with the heads full on and then glass smashed behind me and i sat low and found a gear and got traction again as the patrol glanced off and the scene went black in contrast coming up again as i hit the heads on and kicked the switch to full a repeater starting a rattat from the barricade a side window going and my arm jerking to the force pain flaring then some stability as the chains bit and we closed on the intersection the sound of the engine taking over from the noise back there the fusillade fading as i drifted the rightangle and sped up settling along the streets perspective check gauge tankstrike possible the slipstream rushed backpressure flowing through the smashed rear glass the frozen air from the side window setting up turbulence the dead street lamps hung above us foster was leaning against me and i gave him a nudge but he didnt sit up straight a few kilometres out of the city i passed through the humped shades of tanks harboured in line at the roadside their engines were silent and the troops standing about looked idle some of them smoking a cigarette a lamp flashed but that was all they werent interested in normal traffic i dropped him off soon afterwards it was only a ditch where the wind had scooped a shallow in the lee of thorn but better from his point of view than london on my way back to the car i saw a jewel lying on the snows southward bluegreen and as brilliant in the winter night as sirius above me from here it had lost the look of a city of anywhere id ever been but when later my lights rushed north the fragments of memory came and went like a far lamp winking out a curl of hair a shadowed mouth who are you please the hamilton had steam up but i wasnt overdue my signal had allowed for ice conditions and id avoided towns taking my time so as to reach danzig by dark i ran the mercedes into the truck park on quay and walked to the crane at the end i wasnt there long it was in sight of the starboard lookout and a boat came slopping through the flotsam and took me on there was ice on the deck and i nearly did a pratfall but they grabbed me and i shook them off small thanks i was fed up because one arm wouldnt work any more and with the two windows smashed the cold had been paralysing ive sent for the ships doctor first thing he said oh christ what are you doing here i wasnt in he mood to talk and hed want me to do that we were worried about you i couldnt get him into focus things looked dim here touch of snowblindness all that way behind the shifting lights he said i thought id come along well it wont do your chilblains any good is he all right someone asked gold braid i supposed this was his cabin im bloody tired dont you ever get tired they were trying to pull the glove off but it was stuck listen what happened the only stations i could find on the car thing had been jammed were waiting for news ourselves its all rather confused still but we know the tanks didnt go in well they couldnt could they whole idea wasnt it someone said well have to cut it away i could smell ether sleeve as well they said very dim in here lying on something now back right i didnt quite catch that leaning over me effort come on i want to know did merrick get back all right ah yes indeed we met the plane you looked after him splendidly im really most grateful most grateful the end
