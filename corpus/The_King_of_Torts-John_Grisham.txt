 chapter one tequila watson the shots that fired the bullets that entered pumpkins head were heard by eight people three immediately closed their windows locked their doors and withdrew to the safety of their small apartments two others with previous experience of incidents like this ran away faster than the gunman himself another who was digging through some garbage for cans jumped behind a pile of boxes until the shooting stopped two saw almost everything they were sitting at the corner of georgia street and lamont street in front of a grocery store halfhidden by a parked car so that the gunman who glanced around briefly before following pumpkin into the alley didnt see them both told the police that they saw the boy with the gun reach into his pocket and pull it out a second later they heard the shots though they didnt actually see pumpkin get hit but they did see the boy with the gun rush out of the alley and run straight in their direction he ran bent at the waist with a scared and guilty look on his face when he passed them he was still holding the gun which for one terrifying second he seemed to point at them keeping their heads down both of them crawled as quickly as they could into the grocery store and shouted for someone to call the police there had been a shooting thirty minutes later the police received a call that a young man matching the description of pumpkins killer had been seen carrying a gun in open view on ninth street and acting very strangely the police found their man an hour later his name was tequila watson a black male age twenty with the usual drugrelated police record no family no address the last place he had been sleeping was a rehab unit on w street he had thrown away the gun and had also thrown away the cash or drugs he must have stolen from pumpkin because his pockets were empty the police were certain that tequila hadnt been affected by drink or drugs when he shot pumpkin after a few quick rough questions he was handcuffed pushed into the back seat of the police car and taken back to the alley near lamont street where he had killed pumpkin ever been here before one policeman asked tequila said nothing just stared at the pool of fresh blood on the dirty ground after the two witnesses from outside the grocery store had identified him tequila was pushed into the car once again and taken to jail he was charged with murder and sat quietly in a crowded cell saying nothing to anyone just staring at the floor pumpkins mother adelfa pumphrey was sitting behind a desk just inside the basement entrance of a large office building on new york avenue watching the security screens she was a large woman in a tight brown uniform a gun on her waist an empty look on her face the policemen who approached her had visited her many times before they gave her the news then found her boss in a city where young people killed each other every day every mother knew many others who had lost their children and every mother knew that she could lose hers at any time the mothers had watched the other mothers survive with horror as adelfa pumphrey sat at her desk with her face in her hands she thought of her son and his lifeless body being inspected by strangers somewhere in the city at that moment she cried for her baby and swore revenge on whoever had killed him adelfa went to court to watch her sons killer being formally charged the police told her that it would be a quick routine matter the killer would plead not guilty and ask for a lawyer she was in the back row with her brother on one side and a neighbor on the other crying into a damp handkerchief she wanted to see the boy she also wanted to ask him why but she knew she would never get the chance they brought the criminals into the courtroom like cattle at a market all were black all wore orange prison suits and handcuffs and all of them were young in addition to his handcuffs tequila had chains on his wrists and ankles because his crime had been especially violent though he looked fairly harmless now adelfa stared at the thin boy in the orange prison suit and wondered where his mother was how she had raised him if he had a father and most important why he had killed her son the police had told her that drugs werent involved in the killing but she knew better drugs were involved in every layer of street life tequila watson a court official announced at last the prisoner was helped to his feet by another official and moved slowly forward mr watson you are charged with murder the judge said loudly how old are you twenty tequila said looking down after the reading of the charge the courtroom had gone quiet the other criminals looked at tequila with admiration the lawyers and policemen were curious can you afford a lawyer no i didnt think you could the judge said quietly to himself and looked at the defense table where usually many pds the badlypaid lawyers from the office of the public defender were waiting to defend the poor at that moment however there was only one clay carter he had come into the courtroom to pick up a few papers and realized with horror that the judge was looking at him mr carter the judge said clay swallowed hard a week earlier he had finished a murder case which had lasted for almost three years and he didnt want to defend another one but he was the only pd in the room and he couldnt show weakness and refuse to accept a case especially with policemen and prosecuting lawyers watching he walked calmly to the bench took the file from the judge quickly looked through it and said well plead not guilty your honor thank you mr carter and youll be this mans lawyer for now yes clay was already planning to unload this case on someone else at the opd the judge thanked him again and began looking for the next file clay meanwhile sat next to tequila watson at the defense table and got as much information from him as the young man was willing to give which was very little clay promised to visit the jail the next day for a longer interview then grabbing his old scratched briefcase he hurried away if clay carter had ever been attracted to a career in the opd he couldnt now remember why he had been a pd for almost exactly five years and at the age of thirtyone he felt tired and exhausted he was trapped in an office that he was ashamed to show his friends wanted to leave but didnt know how and now had another senseless murder case to defend in the elevator he cursed himself for his bad luck and stupidity and promised himself that he would leave and find a better job as soon as he could the same promise that he had made to himself every day for the last five years the opd had eighty lawyers all working in two small airless floors of the district of columbia public services building on mass avenue there were about forty lowpaid secretaries and three dozen paralegals scattered around the jungle of tiny offices the director was a woman named glenda who spent most of her time locked in her office because she felt safe in there the beginning salary for an opd lawyer was raises were small and infrequent the workloads were enormous because the city was losing its war on crime like most of the other pds clay carter had never planned to work for the opd when he had been in college and then law school his father had had a law firm in washington dc clay had worked there parttime for years and had had his own office the future had looked wonderful in those days father and son litigating together as the money poured in but the firm had gone bankrupt during clays last year at law school his father had left town and clay had become a public defender five years later he still wondered what had gone wrong he threw the tequila watson file onto the neat desk in his tiny windowless office and wondered how he might unload it onto someone else he was tired of the tough cases and all the other garbage that was thrown at him as an underpaid pd he decided to call rebecca his longtime girlfriend who reminded him that the following day was her mothers birthday my parents have invited us both to dinner at the club she informed him seven oclock coat and tie a bad day just got worse after the short phone call he stared miserably at rebeccas photo on his desk and thought he would rather have dinner with tequila watson at the jail as he was thinking about his fouryear romance with rebecca and how much he hated her rich aggressive parents his closest friend at the opd paulette tullos appeared in the doorway bad luck she said smiling in the direction of the file on his desk another murder case what are my chances of getting rid of it he said almost impossible who are you going to give it to i was thinking of you sorry i have two murder cases already i heard the prosecutors talking another street killing but no apparent motive theres always a motive cash sex drugs a new pair of nikes but the kid has no history of violence first impressions are seldom true paulette you know that jermaine got a very similar case two days ago also no apparent motive i hadnt heard you might try him hes new and ambitious and who knows you might be able to unload it on him ill do it right now jermaine wasnt in but glendas door for some reason was slightly open clay went in and asked glenda if she could assign the tequila watson case to another pd who do you want to give it to mr carter she asked him i dont really care i just need a break she leaned back in her chair and began chewing the end of her pen wed all love a break mr carter wouldnt we yes or no move it if you can but im not going to reassign it ok but what about a higher salary next year mr carter next year clay returned to his office to look again at the tequila watson file they called it the criminal justice center but it was really just a big jail a guard led clay down a hall to a long room divided by a thick sheet of unbreakable glass he pointed to a chair and clay sat down and waited for tequila watson to appear on the other side of the glass as he was looking through his papers the guard whispered in his ear your boy had a bad night he jumped on a kid at two oclock this morning and almost beat him to death it took six of our guys to pull him away hes a mess tequila carter was surprised watson thats him he put the other boy in the hospital expect additional charges are you sure clay asked its all on video they both looked up as tequila was brought to his seat on the other side of the glass by two guards each holding an elbow he was handcuffed and although prisoners usually had their handcuffs removed when they talked to their lawyers tequilas handcuffs werent taken off he sat down the guards moved away but remained close tequilas left eye was swollen shut with dried blood in both corners the right one was open but it was bright red there was a bandage around his head and some sticky tape on his chin his lips and jaw were so swollen that clay wondered at first whether he had the right client he picked up the black phone receiver and motioned for tequila to do the same the police tell me you started a fight with another kid last night and put him in the hospital is that true tequila nodded did you know the kid no so why did you attack him i dont know tequila answered the words slow and painful further questions revealed that the other boy had been asleep when tequila attacked him for no reason clay wrote a few things down in his notebook and looked up again they say you killed a boy shot him five times in the head the swollen head nodded slightly his name was ramon pumphrey also known as pumpkin did you know the guy yes i used to buy drugs from him how long ago a couple of years did you shoot him clays voice was almost a whisper the guards were asleep but this wasnt a question that lawyers usually asked their clients especially not at the jail i did tequila said softly five times i thought it was six why did you do it was it a drug deal no girl trouble no clay took a deep breath do you fight a lot not anymore i had a fight once with pumpkin when i was twelve years old did you see pumpkin often not much maybe twice a year when you saw him two days ago did you argue help me here tequila im working too hard for details we didnt argue why did you go into the alley tequila put down the receiver and began moving his head backward and forward very slowly he was obviously in some pain when he picked up the receiver again he said ill tell you the truth i had a gun and i wanted to shoot somebody anybody it didnt matter i left the camp and just started walking going nowhere looking for somebody to shoot when i saw pumpkin i took him into an alley and shot him i dont know why i just wanted to kill somebody what is the camp clay asked a rehab place thats where i was staying how long had you been there a hundred and fifteen days no drugs or anything for a hundred and fifteen days thats right not even when you shot pumpkin not then not now did you ever shoot anybody before no where did you get the gun stole it from my cousins house how did you get out of the camp after a hundred days they let you out for two hours so you walked out of the camp went to your cousins house stole a gun and shot pumpkin for no reason thats exactly what happened tequila nodded then while clay was pulling some papers out of his briefcase he asked whats going to happen to me well talk about it later when can i get out it might be a long time chapter two the van horns two hours after his conversation with tequila watson clay parked his honda accord directly in front of deliverance camp an old building in a dangerous part of the city just opposite an old gas station where drug dealers regularly did business he got out and trying to ignore the curious stares from the young toughs in the sidewalk gangs walked toward the door theres not another white face within two miles of here he thought as he pushed the bell after a long wait during which the young people in the street crowded around him staring and laughing at him the door opened and clay found himself in a large windowless reception area of cement floors stone walls and metal doors the receptionist showed him into the small disorganized office of talmadge x tequila watsons counselor at deliverance camp clay showed talmadge x the documents relating to tequila watsons case did you know about the shooting clay asked when talmadge x had finished looking at them not until you called an hour ago we knew he left on tuesday and didnt come back we knew something was wrong but then we expect things to go wrong tell me what happened clay gave talmadge x the details of what tequila had told him two hours earlier when clay had finished talmadge x calmly asked what can i do id like to see his file hes given me his permission the file was already lying on the desk later talmadge x replied putting his hand on top of the file i need to look at it first but tell me what you want to know clay wanted to know about tequila watsons background and talmadge x told him about the boys mother who had died when he was three and his life on the streets in and out of court and homes for young offenders he then told clay about deliverance camp we get the hard cases the serious addicts we lock them up for months there are eight counselors here and we were all drug addicts in the past four of us are now church ministers i served thirteen years for drugs and robbery then i found jesus tequila was on drugs for years at eighteen he went to jail for four months for stealing from a shop another three months last year for possessing dangerous drugs not a bad record for one of us nothing violent but is there anything we can do to help him this time im told there were at least two eyewitnesses im not optimistic sounds like life imprisonment but thats not the end of the world for us you know mr carter in many ways life in prison is better than life on these streets the sad thing is tequila was one of the few who might have succeeded in life why is that the kid has a brain when we got him off drugs and he was healthy again he felt so good about himself he learned to read and he liked to draw i dont understand his motive for this killing mr clay tell me why i cant you tell me youve known him for the last four months no history of violence or guns no love of fighting he sounds like the perfect patient youve seen it all you tell me why ive seen everything talmadge x said his eyes even sadder than before but ive never seen this the boy was afraid of violence tequila was one of the weak ones here i cant believe hed shoot someone for no reason and i cant believe hed jump on a guy in jail and send him to the hospital i just cant understand it there was a long pause and clay stood up ill be back tomorrow for the file he said what time after ten oclock talmadge x said ill walk you to your car its not necessary clay replied but he was privately delighted with the counselors offer when talmadge x appeared at the door with clay the gang of youths scattered in all directions and clay was able to drive away unharmed but secretly fearing his return the following day clay parked his old honda accord in a distant lot behind some tennis courts and walked toward the clubhouse of the potomac country club straightening his tie and complaining angrily to himself he hated the place hated it for all the stupid people who were members hated it because he couldnt join and hated it because the van horns loved it and they wanted him to feel like an outsider for the hundredth time that day as every day he asked himself why he had fallen in love with a girl whose parents were so unbearable if he had a plan it was to run away with rebecca and move to new zealand far from the opd and as far away as possible from her family bennett van horn was absent clay said hello to mrs van horn wished her a happy birthday and gave rebecca a nervous kiss on the cheek wheres mr van horn he asked hoping he was stuck out of town or even better in the hospital with a serious illness hes on his way rebecca said he spent the day in richmond meeting with the governor added mrs van horn clay felt like saying you win you win youre more important than i am whats he working on he asked politely trying to sound interested political stuff barbara said she probably didnt know what her husband and the governor had been discussing she probably didnt even know how much her husband had in the bank she knew what day she played cards with her friends and she knew how little money clay earned but most other details were left to bennett a few minutes later bennett arrived in a rush full of insincere apologies for being late he gave clay a friendly pat on the back and kissed his girls on the cheeks hows the governor barbara asked loud enough for the diners across the room to hear great he sends his best wishes the president of korea is in town next week and weve been invited to a blacktie party at the governors house this too was offered at full volume he pulled a collection of cell phones from his pocket lined them up on the table turned to his daughter and said you look tired honey a tough day not bad rebeccas tiredness was a favorite topic between her parents they felt she worked too hard they felt she shouldnt work at all she was almost thirty and it was time to marry a fine young man with a wellpaid job and a bright future so she could have their grandchildren and spend the rest of her life at the potomac country club over dinner bennett said with his mouth full while i was down in richmond i had lunch with my close friend senator ian ludkin youd really like the guy clay hes a perfect virginia gentleman anyway i told him about you a hardworking bright young lawyer georgetown law school a handsome young man with real character and he said he was always looking for new talent he said he has an opening for a staff attorney i said that maybe youd be interested and id tell you about it what do you think i think im being trapped clay thought rebecca was staring at him watching closely for the first reaction thats interesting he said with some sincerity its a great position fascinating work never a dull moment lots of long hours but i told ian you could do it easily do what exactly clay asked oh i dont know about all that lawyer stuff but if youre interested ian said hed be happy to arrange an interview but youll have to move quickly a lot of young lawyers like you would really love that job richmonds not far away barbara said a lot closer than new zealand clay thought barbara was already planning the wedding he couldnt understand rebecca sometimes she felt trapped by her parents but she rarely showed any desire to get away from them bennett used his money as a bribe to keep both his daughters close to home well uh thanks i guess clay said the starting salary is a year bennett said lowering his voice for the first time so the other diners couldnt hear that was more than double clays salary at the opd and the van horns all knew it they loved money and never stopped thinking about how to get more of it thats a nice salary clay admitted not a bad start bennett said ian says youll meet the big lawyers in town contacts are everything in a few years youll be working in corporate law thats where all the money is you know clay didnt reply he wasnt happy with the idea that bennett van horn was already planning this life for him how can you say no barbara said excitedly dont push mother rebecca replied think about it bennett said clay and rebecca ignored each other for the rest of the meal the fight would come later after dinner clay thanked bennett and barbara for the food and promised to decide quickly on the job in richmond when he was certain they were gone he asked rebecca to step into the bar for a minute i didnt know about the job in richmond she began i find that hard to believe it seems to me the whole family has been planning this my fathers worried about you thats all your fathers a fool he wanted to say no hes worried about you he doesnt want you marrying a guy with no future so hes going to manage our future for us maybe hes just trying to help why does he assume i need his help maybe you do i see finally the truth you cant work at the opd forever clay youve been there for five years maybe its time to move on maybe i dont want to live in richmond maybe i prefer working in dc and dont want to be surrounded by a lot of local politicians in richmond rebecca sat quietly thinking for a minute the truth was she did want to stop working she wanted a husband and family but she couldnt admit that to clay i dont care clay she said say no if you want to now id like to go clay followed her out of the club helped her into her bmw and watched her drive away the next day clay returned to d camp to look at tequila watsons file accompanied by rodney a career paralegal in the opd he felt safer with rodney who had grown up on the streets of dc and knew them well tequilas story was familiar and depressing drugs robberies burglaries homes for young offenders but there was a remarkable absence of violence in it he had never used a weapon to commit a crime one of talmadge xs notes in the file read he avoids physical violence he seems afraid of the bigger boys and most of the small ones too according to the file tequila behaved well during his stay in d camp he seemed to be getting better but the final entry day read allowed out for two hours did not return back in the opd clay visited jermaine vance another lawyer in his small office and compared notes jermaines client was a twentyfouryearold career criminal named washad porter who unlike tequila had a long and frightening history of violence as a member of dcs largest gang washad had been badly wounded twice in gun battles and had been convicted once of attempted murder seven of his twentyfour years had been spent in jail he had shown little interest in changing his way of life his only attempt at rehab had been unsuccessful he was accused of shooting two people four days before the ramon pumphrey killing one of the two was killed immediately the other was seriously wounded washad had spent six months at clean streets a rehab center similar to d camp jermaines conversation with washads counselor had been very similar to clays with talmadge x washad had improved was a perfect patient was in good health was doing well without any drugs and hadnt had any problems for four months he was released from clean streets in april and the next day he shot two men with a stolen gun jermaine had talked to washad once very briefly in the courtroom while he was being formally charged he was in a state of shock jermaine told clay he had a blank look on his face and kept telling me that he couldnt believe hed shoot anybody he said that was the old washad not the new one later that same day bennett van horn answered one of his cell phones he was in the mens lounge at the potomac country club whiskey in his hand playing a game of cards with his friends clay how are you he said as if they hadnt seen each other for months fine mr van horn and you great i enjoyed dinner last night oh yes it was really nice always a pleasure clay lied what can i do for you son well i want you to understand that i appreciate your efforts to get me that job in richmond a pause as clay swallowed hard but truthfully mr van horn i dont really want to move to richmond ive always lived in dc and this is home you cant be serious van horn said yes im very serious thanks but no thanks a big mistake son you just dont see the big picture do you maybe i dont but im not sure you do either you have a lot of pride clay i like that but youre making a big mistake one that could have serious consequences what kind of consequences this could really affect your future well its my future not yours ill choose my next job and the one after that right now im happy where i am youre turning your back on a huge increase in salary clay more money better work wake up boy im not going to argue mr van horn i called to say no youre a loser clay you know that ive known it for some time youre a coward with no ambition no intelligence clay put the phone down with a smile proud that he had made the great bennett van horn so angry he had given him a clear message that he wouldnt be pushed around by stupid rich people like him he would deal with rebecca later and it wouldnt be pleasant after an unsuccessful day of trying to discover more about tequila watson and washad porter clay met rebecca for a drink at abes place the bar in dc where they had first met four years earlier rebecca was quiet but coldly determined i talked to my father she began why didnt you tell me you werent taking the job in richmond your father called me a loser is that what you think too i have my doubts clay took another drink this was in his opinion almost certainly the end of their relationship but he didnt want to say anything to hurt her what do you want rebecca do you want to end it i think so she said and her eyes immediately filled with tears is there someone else no its just that youre going nowhere clay she said youre smart and talented but you have no ambition thats nice to know a few hours ago according to your father i was a cowardly loser are you trying to be funny why not rebecca why not have a laugh its finished lets face it we love each other but im a loser whos going nowhere thats your problem my problem is your parents theyll destroy the poor guy you eventually marry the poor guy i marry rebeccas eyes flashed angrily calm down listen ill make you an offer lets get married now well leave our jobs have a quick secret wedding sell everything and fly somewhere far away from here like the west coast and live on love then what then well find jobs and start a family we wont tell your parents anything but if they find us well change our names and move to canada they both laughed but the lighthearted moment passed quickly briefly they were reminded of why they loved each other and of how much they enjoyed their time together there had always been much more laughter than sadness but things were changing now rebecca finished her drink then she leaned forward and stared clay directly in the eyes clay i really need a break lets meet in thirty days and discuss it again ok well meet in a month but i dont expect a change this is the end clay you go your way and ill go mine with those words rebecca picked up her purse and jumped to her feet clay didnt watch her leave and rebecca didnt look back chapter three tarvan clay shared a small twobedroom apartment with jonah an old friend from law school who now sold computers parttime but still earned more money than clay the morning after the breakup with rebecca clay was having breakfast and reading the newspaper when the phone rang he smiled and thought its her she wants me back already but it wasnt rebecca mr clay carter a strange male voice said speaking mr carter my name is max pace i work for law firms in washington and new york your name has caught our attention and i have two very attractive offers that might interest you could we meet today uh sure clay agreed speechless with surprise good lets meet at the willard hotel at noon noons fine clay said staring at a pile of dirty dishes in the sink clay put down the phone wondering whether someone was playing a joke on him or maybe it was his father he had once been a successful lawyer and although he no longer practiced law he still had contacts maybe he was trying to help his son clay left at eleven thirty and at the willard hotel was shown up to a room on the ninth floor the door opened and max pace said hello with a businesslike smile he was in his midforties and everything about him his wavy hair mustache jeans tshirt boots was black it wasnt exactly the normal business look that clay had been expecting thanks for coming max said as they walked into a large bright luxuriouslydecorated room after admiring the view from the window and discussing the economy and sports results for a few minutes clay said tell me something about these two firms they dont exist max said i admit i lied to you but i promise that i wont lie to you again who are you i get hired by big companies to solve difficult problems for them if they make a big mistake and realize their mistake before the lawyers do they hire me to quietly clean up their mess and hopefully save them a lot of money a large company has made a big mistake and ive been hired to help them which company i cant tell you my clients name im afraid if we reach an agreement i can tell you much more heres the story my client is a multinational company that sells pharmaceuticals youll recognize the name its an old wellrespected company that makes a wide range of products from ordinary medicines to complex drugs that will fight cancer and other serious illnesses about two years ago it produced a drug that might cure serious drug addiction lets call this wonder drug tarvan it was discovered by mistake and was quickly used on animals in laboratories the results were amazing but it wasnt enough to test it only on animals they needed humans clay said yes tarvan seemed an important discovery and the business people in the company were getting very excited imagine if you take one pill a day for ninety days your addiction to dangerous drugs disappears completely after that if you take tarvan once every two days youre free of the desire for dangerous drugs for life almost an immediate cure for millions of addicts think of the profits think of the lives that would be saved the crimes that would not be committed the families that would stay together the business people wanted tarvan on the market as soon as possible but first they had to test it on humans they made a big mistake they chose three places mexico city singapore and belgrade and pretending to be an international aid organization they built rehab centers which were really secure places where the addicts could be completely controlled they chose the worst addicts they could find and began using tarvan on them human laboratories clay said far away from the american tort system and the american newspapers it was an excellent plan and the drug performed beautifully after thirty days tarvan killed the desire for dangerous drugs after sixty days the addicts seemed happy and after ninety days they had no fear of returning to the streets ninety percent stayed on tarvan and were cured of the need for dangerous drugs only two percent became addicts again and the other eight percent they became a big problem but my client didnt know how serious it would be the company could smell billions of dollars in profit and there was no competition its big mistake was to bring the experiments here my client wanted to test tarvan on people in the us and in about eight percent of the patients something goes wrong tarvan makes them killers after about a hundred days something happens in their brain and they feel a mysterious but irresistible desire to kill it makes no difference if they have a violent history or not tarvan turns eight percent of the patients into murderers they stopped using tarvan in rehab centers here six days ago the centers in mexico city singapore and belgrade were closed down immediately all experiments have been forgotten all papers have been destroyed my client has never heard of tarvan wed like to keep it that way how many murders have there been because of tarvan here in dc clay wanted to know thinking about tequila watson and washad porter five people in dc have been killed by addicts on tarvan possibly six if washad porters second victim dies we know who they are how they died who killed them everything we want you to represent their families if you can persuade them to sign their names well pay them money in this way things can be dealt with quickly quietly with no lawsuits no publicity and no more problems for my client why would the families hire me because they dont know that they have a legal case they think that their loved ones were ordinary victims of street violence theyll hire you because youll go to them tell them that they have a case and say you can get million in a very quick secret settlement also youre the only lawyer who is getting close to discovering the truth about tarvan if another lawyer finds out about it there could be a trial if that happened my client would lose much more money and the bad publicity would probably destroy the company believe me clay the company knows its done something bad it wants to correct it but it also wants to limit its damages it would be easy to take your client to court and get more money the case would be very hard to prove clay because theres no evidence the counselors at d camp and clean streets didnt know they were using tarvan all the paperworks been destroyed the authorities have never heard of tarvan and the company would hire the best lawyers in town to defend itself litigation would be war because my client is so guilty four million dollars for each victim clay said thoughtfully thats million add million for the lawyer clay that would be you ten million you must be joking were serious clay a total of million and i can write the checks immediately i need to go for a walk would you like some lunch no thanks clay walked the streets of washington dc thinking about the offer one minute he hated the big pharmaceutical company for doing dangerous experiments on the weakest people it could find the next minute he thought about the money with million he could marry rebecca and be free of her family forever after two hours thinking about things he walked into a cafe and saw max pace sitting alone drinking lemonade waiting did you follow me of course would you like something to drink no what would happen if i represented the pumphrey family that case would be worth more than million max seemed ready for the questions first you dont know who to file a lawsuit against you dont know who made tarvan second you dont have the money to fight with my client third youd lose the opportunity to represent all the other known plaintiffs if you dont say yes quickly ill go to the next lawyer on my list with the same offer i want this whole business finished in thirty days i could go to a big tort firm yes but that would give you more problems first youd lose half your fee second the whole business would take five years third theres no guarantee that even the biggest tort firm in the country would win the case the truth may never be known it should be known maybe but i dont care my job is to silence this thing to compensate the victims and then forget all about it but im defending tequila watson how do i suddenly change sides and represent the victim as soon as you resign from the opd youre free to open your own office and start accepting other cases i dont like that answer its the best i have listen clay tequila watsons guilty ramon pumphrey is dead you have to forget about watson clay drank his iced water and thought quietly for a minute he wasnt happy in his opinion big corporations should go to jail for crimes the same as ordinary criminals but if he didnt take the case another lawyer would ok he said eventually whats your plan pace pushed his lemonade to one side and leaned forward eagerly you leave your job and start your own law firm rent a place and put nice furniture in it youll need to impress your clients weve found you a place on connecticut avenue would you like to see it the office was on the fourth floor of a high modern glass and metal building on connecticut avenue an expensive high class area of washington dc expensive carpet was being put down and the walls were being painted the office can be finished in a few days pace said as he and clay stood at a window and watched the traffic below you can open your new business in less than an hour choose a bank open your accounts by next wednesday you can be sitting here behind an expensive desk running your own law firm what about my staff ill need other lawyers your friends rodney and paulette they know the city and its people hire them pay them three times what theyre earning now and give them nice offices down the hall they can talk to the families well help a short time later clay said goodbye to max and went for another long walk after that he returned to his office locked his door and spent the last hour of the workday thinking about max paces offer trying to make up his mind later that evening he met max pace for the third time that day max talked to him about other work after the tarvan case finished something much bigger max said he told clay about another pharmaceutical company which had put a bad drug on the market no one knows it yet their drug is doing better than my clients drug but my client now has reliable proof that the bad drug causes cancer my client has been waiting for the perfect moment to attack theyre planning a classaction lawsuit brought by an aggressive young attorney who possesses the right evidence after you finish the tarvan case in thirty days well give you the file on this new case it will be worth millions much more than tarvan clay looked at pace with a mixture of surprise and disbelief why me he asked quietly you were smart enough to suspect something strange about the tequila watson case eventually you might have found out about tarvan by yourself we need a bright young lawyer like you a man that we can trust say yes and you will become a very big lawyer say no and youll miss the biggest opportunity of your life i understand but i still need time to think you have until next monday the next monday clay met max pace in a different hotel and sat down to talk business pace looked tired clay noticed and more anxious his smile was gone the pressure of the tarvan case was obviously affecting him washad porters second victim died in a hospital last night pace said so we have six deaths caused by tarvan seven there was another killing on saturday morning are you sure its a tarvan case were certain clay made a few calculations in his notebook then he looked up and said i think million for each death caused by tarvan is a better figure agreed surprised by paces calm acceptance of the new figure clay continued and i think the attorneys fees are too low really pace smiled for the first time ten million isnt enough no ill need at least million thats million altogether that should be enough pace smiled and shook clays hand agreed he said congratulations now theres a contract and a few rules for you to follow max was reaching into his briefcase what kinds of rules first you can never mention tarvan to tequila watson his new lawyer or to any of the other criminal defendants involved in this affair you have to forget about the murderers you now represent the families of their victims if you mention tarvan to anyone the deal ends and youll lose everything im offering you clay nodded and stared at the thick contract now on the table this is basically a secrecy agreement max continued patting the documents its filled with dark secrets most of which you wont even be able to tell your secretary my clients name is never mentioned your new clients are getting the money so they wont be able to ask any questions we dont think this will be a problem and we dont expect any moral judgement from you just take your money finish the job and everybody will be happy except tequila watson clay briefly thought but soon the only thing that he thought about was the money by the end of the day clay had signed the paperwork opened a new bank account signed a contract for his new offices on connecticut avenue registered as a law firm resigned from the opd persuaded rodney to join him and received his first payment from max pace million he was already a multimillionaire chapter four clays first clients rodney albritton chief paralegal of the law offices of j clay carter visited adelfa pumphrey who was sitting behind her basement office desk on new york avenue staring expressionlessly at the wall of security screens in front of her her son had been dead for ten days id like to talk to you for a couple of minutes rodney said showing her one of his new business cards about what she asked looking at him with suspicion about your son ramon i know some things about his death that you dont im sorry to be talking about it but youll like what i have to say and ill be quick adelfa looked at him quietly for a minute rodney wasnt like other lawyers she had known he was smooth smart and black and she wanted to talk to someone meet me in the cafe upstairs in twenty minutes she said twenty minutes later rodney was sitting over a coffee talking to adelfa i work for a lawyer here in town a young guy very smart hes discovered something about your sons death that can get you some big money adelfa showed no reaction so rodney continued the boy that killed ramon had just walked out of a drug treatment center where hed been locked up for four months theyd been giving him some drugs as part of his treatment we think one of the drugs made him crazy enough to kill your son for no reason adelfas eyes filled with tears and for a moment rodney thought she was going to cry but then she looked at him and said big money how much more than a million dollars he said calmly youre joking why would i do that i dont know you theres money on offer big money big corporate drug money that somebody wants you to take and be quiet what big company look ive told you everything i know my job is to meet you tell you whats happening and to invite you to see mr carter the lawyer i work for a white guy yes and a good guy too ive worked with him for five years youll like him and youll like what he has to say ok she agreed one important thing rodney said handing her his card and talking almost in a whisper this will work only if you keep quiet its a big secret if you do what mr carter advises you to do youll get more money than you ever dreamed of but if people hear about it youll get nothing clay had persuaded two more people from the opd to join him in his new law firm miss glick the very efficient secretary and his old friend paulette tullos who was happy to be earning a year instead of only in addition to these he had also hired his roommate jonah who had passed his law exam at the fifth attempt but had never practiced law after a long discussion with paulette adelfa pumphrey the new law firms very first client was led down a long hall that smelled of fresh paint to meet clay who greeted her warmly and welcomed her into his large new office his tie was loose his sleeves were rolled up and his desk was covered with files and papers giving the impression that he had many other cases to deal with i recognize you adelfa said yes i was in court when your sons murderer was formally charged the judge wanted me to defend him but i didnt want to i got rid of the case and now im working for the other side youre probably confused by all this but its actually quite simple he sat on the corner of his desk and told her his version of the big bad drug company adelfa listened quietly not sure what to believe clay finished his story by saying they want to pay you a lot of money immediately who exactly is they the drug company but youll never know its true identity thats part of the deal you and i lawyer and client must agree to keep everything a secret adelfa thought for a moment then asked softly how much money five million dollars she covered her eyes and began to cry paces list of victims stopped at seven the first on his list ramon pumphrey was sixth had been a college kid from bluefield west virginia who had been shot dead as he was walking out of a starbucks coffee shop clay made the fivehour journey there in his brand new black porsche carrera and parked in front of a small sadlooking onefloor house the dead students mother let him in and offered him tea and cookies clay sat on a sofa in a room with pictures of the dead son everywhere and waited for the father an insurance salesman to arrive home he then presented his case to them as much of it as possible they asked him several questions how many others died because of this drug why cant we go to the authorities shouldnt we tell the newspapers but clay was ready for them all if you cant tell me the real name of the company then i wont accept the money the father said at one point i dont know the real name clay replied like all victims they had a choice they could get angry ask questions demand justice or they could quietly take the money the parents were very confused during the afternoon and into the evening they experienced all kinds of emotions but just after pm clay finally persuaded them to sign the paperwork the last tarvan clients to sign the documents were the parents of a twentyyearold student who had left university and had been murdered one week later they sat in clays office for an hour holding hands tightly crying as they talked about their daughter eventually they signed the paperwork and paulette and miss glick accompanied them out of the office and to the elevators where after a tearful goodbye the doors closed clays little team met in the conference room and talked quietly for a moment grateful that there were no more widows and grieffilled parents to interview some very expensive drink had been iced for the occasion and clay began pouring during the second bottle clay rose to speak i have some announcements he said tapping his glass first the tylenol cases are now complete congratulations and thanks to you all he had used tylenol as a code for tarvan a name they would never hear nor would they ever know the amount of his fees obviously clay was being paid a lot of money but they had no idea how much second we begin the celebration tonight with dinner at citronelle everybody laughed and cheered third in two weeks we leave for seven days in paris firstclass flights luxury hotel all expenses paid there was more wild cheering and laughter seven nights in paris no one could believe it a month earlier they had all been working long hours for little money at the opd apart from jonah who had been selling computers parttime chapter five dyloft the next day max pace visited clay in the office which was closed for the day after the previous nights long celebrations you did good work clay he said ill transfer the rest of the money into your bank today youre doing a great job of looking rich but be careful dont create too much attention lets talk about the next case pace sat down the drug is dyloft manufactured by ackerman labs its used by sufferers of severe arthritis its a new drug it works very well and patients love it but it has two problems first its made by a competitor of my client second its been linked to the creation of small tumors in the bladder my client the same client as tarvan makes a similar drug that was popular until twelve months ago when dyloft became available dyloft is growing fast its already number two in the market and will soon be number one a few months ago my client discovered documents that prove that ackerman labs has known about the possible problems with dyloft for six months are you following me yes how many people have taken dyloft probably a million what percentage get the tumors about five percent you want me to sue ackerman labs the truth about dyloft will be public knowledge very soon there hasnt been any litigation yet but ackerman is getting ready its busy counting its money and saving it to pay the lawyers the company has a real problem because its borrowed too much and now it needs cash the value of the company is already falling and the news about dyloft will probably destroy it completely which is exactly what my client wants from inside the company we have proof that dyloft is bad and it will have to settle it will have no choice but theres one small problem for us in all this most of the tumors dont seem to be dangerous and theyre very small theres no real damage to the bladder so the litigation will be used to shock the market yes and of course to compensate the victims heres my plan you put together a group of fifty plaintiffs and file a big lawsuit on behalf of all dyloft patients at the same time you put out a series of tv advertisements soliciting more cases if you move quickly youll get thousands of cases people will be scared and will phone your free number here in dc where youll have at least half a dozen paralegals answering the calls it will cost you a lot of money but if you get for example five thousand cases at each thats million and your share is one third thats terrible no clay thats mass tort litigation at its finest thats how the system works pace slid a thick file across clays desk there are the names and addresses of at least a thousand possible plaintiffs in here i also have the name of a company that can prepare a television advertisement which will bring you thousands of extra clients the whole thing will cost you a couple of million dollars but you can afford it first you get the clients to sign contracts with your firm which will take about two weeks it will take three days to finish the tv advertisement and a few days to buy the television time youll need to hire paralegals and put them in a rented space out in the suburbs its too expensive here the lawsuit has to be prepared you have a good staff everything should be done in about thirty days my client wants the lawsuit filed in less than a month clay stood up and walked anxiously around the room he didnt like the idea of soliciting clients with tv advertisements it was unprofessional in addition he had never handled a lawsuit like this before but million in fees he couldnt possibly refuse we have work to do clay began the meeting in the conference room he told paulette rodney and jonah about dyloft and its disastrous side effects nobodys filed a lawsuit yet but were going to change that on july nd we start the war by filing a class action here in dc on behalf of all the patients harmed by the drug we have some names and addresses and we start signing up those clients today paulette and rodney youll be in charge of that jonah youll be in charge of employing half a dozen paralegals and finding space out in the suburbs for them to take calls from possible new clients how much is each dyloft case worth paulette asked as much as ackerman labs will pay it could be anything from to depending on the extent of damage to the bladder and how many cases might we get after the series of advertisements well be putting on tv it could be several thousand and how much are the attorneys fees paulette asked the other two were watching clay very carefully one third he said so if we have three thousand clients for example the firm will get million yes and were going to share the fees ten percent to each of you so that could mean million each at least clay replied they thought about that figure in silence for a very long time each one imagining how they would be spending the money for rodney it meant college for the kids for paulette it meant a divorce from the greek husband she had only seen once in the past year for jonah it meant life on a sailboat clay was the first to break the silence if we work really hard for the next year theres a good chance well have the option of early retirement who told you about dyloft rodney wanted to know i can never answer that question rodney sorry just trust me and at that moment clay hoped that his blind trust in max pace wasnt foolish on the third floor of his new town house clay made his first entry into the world of mass tort solicitation he delayed the call until almost pm an hour when some people went to bed especially older people and maybe those suffering with arthritis after a strong drink to give him courage he dialed a number the phone was answered on the other end by mrs ted worley of upper marlboro maryland clay introduced himself pleasantly as a lawyer and asked to speak to mr worley clay heard some voices in the background the sound of a baseball game on tv then finally a mans voice on the phone who is this ted worley angrily demanded i dont like being interrupted when im watching baseball im an attorney here in dc and i specialize in lawsuits against companies that manufacture harmful drugs ok what do you want we found your name on the internet as a possible user of the arthritis drug dyloft can you tell me if you use this drug maybe i dont want to tell you of course you dont have to mr worley but the only way to discover if youre entitled to a settlement is to tell me if youre using the drug what kind of settlement well talk about that in a minute first i need to know if youre using dyloft if not youre a lucky man yeah ive been taking dyloft for how long maybe a year it works great any side effects such as blood in your urine a burning sensation when you urinate no why the drug has been found to cause bladder tumors in some people who use it ackerman labs the company that makes dyloft has been trying to keep this secret my firm represents a lot of dyloft users i think you should consider being tested what kind of test a urine test we have a doctor who can do it tomorrow it wont cost you anything what if he finds something wrong then we can discuss your options when the news of dyloft comes out in a few days time there will be many lawsuits my firm will lead the attack on ackerman labs id like to have you as a client should i stop taking the drug lets do the test first dyloft will probably be pulled off the market later this summer where do i do the test clay gave him the name and address of a doctor that max pace had chosen for him when the details were finished clay apologized for interrupting the baseball game and said goodbye it was only then that he realized that his forehead was covered in sweat soliciting clients by phone what kind of lawyer have i become a rich one he kept telling himself two days later clay visited ted worley the urine test had revealed unusual cells in the urine a clear sign that there were tumors in the bladder although the operation to remove them would not be complicated ted worley and his wife were extremely worried clay wanted to tell them that the tumors werent dangerous but decided to let the doctor tell them that after the operation after clay had explained the contract and answered their questions about litigation ted worley signed the papers and became the first dyloft plaintiff in the country by the end of the week clay had signed up three clients with unusual cells in their urine rodney and paulette working as a team had seven more under contract the dyloft class action was ready for war on july st everyone gathered in front of the television in the conference room to watch the fifteensecond advertisement advising dyloft users to call the firm and arrange a free medical test two hours later all six paralegals employed for this job were busy answering calls at nine the next morning clay received an urgent phone call from the ackerman labs attorney he ordered clay to stop running the advertisements immediately the conversation was short and angry and when it was ended clay sent rodney to the attorneys office with a copy of the twentypage lawsuit against ackerman labs later that day max pace visited clay ive filed the lawsuit clay told him weve created a lot of excitement their lawyers have already called and i sent them a copy of the lawsuit good they know theyre in big trouble this is a lawyers dream clay enjoy the moment if you were ackermans lawyer clay asked what would you do next id deny everything blame it on the greedy trial lawyers defend my drug my first aim would be to protect the price of shares in the company id get the chief executive officer on television to say all the right things id get the lawyers to prepare an organized defense id get the sales people to persuade the doctors that the drug is ok then id have a serious talk with ackerman labs if i found out there were real problems with the drug id calculate how much a settlement would cost you never go to trial with a bad drug because you cant control the costs so if i were ackermans lawyer id settle for about a billion dollars and id do it fast will ackerman do it fast they havent hired me so theyre not very bright they prefer to do it the oldfashioned way they rely on lawyers who of course have no interest in quick settlements so no quick settlement you filed the lawsuit less than an hour ago relax i know but all that money you just gave me is going very quickly relax in a years time youll be even richer the following morning the times and the post printed brief stories of the dyloft class action on the front pages of their business sections both mentioned clays name both noted that the price of ackerman labs shares was falling fast a photograph of clay and his team appeared in the wall street journal in the same newspaper under the headline young lawyer fights powerful ackerman labs there was an article about clay and his amazing rise to the top as an important successful tort lawyer clay gave a copy of the article to jonah put this on the internet he said our clients will love it chapter six the lawsuit against ackerman labs tequila watson pleaded guilty to the murder of ramon pumphrey and was given life imprisonment clay saw the story and felt a little guilty he owed something to tequila but he wasnt sure what there was no way of compensating his former client he tried to tell himself that tequila would probably have spent the rest of his life in prison anyway with or without tarvan but this didnt make clay feel any better the truth was he had taken the cash and buried the truth at that moment miss glick rang his office with a message that soon made clay forget his guilty feelings over tequila watson patton french the most successful tort lawyer in the country wanted to talk to him later that day clay was on board patton frenchs private jet at reagan national airport clay was extremely impressed the inside of the jet was more like a fivestar hotel french shook clays hand and invited him to sit as the plane took off for new york i was thinking about suing ackerman two months ago french informed him but you did it first however i think we can do business together theres a lot of money out there then noticing clays undisguised admiration for the inside of the plane he said do you have a jet yet no clay replied feeling suddenly inadequate it wont be long son a top lawyer cant live without his own jet after congratulating clay again on his lawsuit against dyloft french made him an offer soon ill have as many dyloft cases as you now that youve opened the door there will be hundreds of lawyers chasing these cases you and i can control the litigation if we move your lawsuit from dc to my home territory in mississippi if we join your cases with mine in one enormous class action ackerman labs will be frightened beyond all imagination clays head was spinning with doubts and questions im listening he said quietly you keep your cases ill keep mine as more cases come in well form a plaintiffs guidance committee ill be the chairman youll be on the committee because you filed your lawsuit first well keep the dyloft litigation organized ive done it dozens of times the committee gives us control well start discussing things with ackerman very soon i know their lawyers if your inside information is as strong as you say well push hard for an early settlement how early that depends on several things how many cases are really out there how quickly can we sign them up how many other lawyers file lawsuits and very important how severe is the damage to our clients not very severe very few of the tumors are dangerous french thought for a moment then said thats good its better for our clients because theyre not as sick as they could be and better for us because the settlements will come faster the important thing is for us to get as many cases as we can the more cases we get the more control we have over the class action more cases more fees i understand clay said after further discussions with french in new york about the financial details of the lawsuit french was going to provide another million dollars for medical tests clay was going to double his spending on advertising both agreed that they would take forty percent of the final settlement plus expenses clay telephoned max pace for his advice max was enthusiastic do it he said and read the new york times tomorrow morning theres a big story about dyloft the first medical report has been published ackerman labs wont be happy at all clay met french for dinner in a top manhattan restaurant signed the contract that french had prepared and agreed to let french file the class action against ackerman labs in biloxi mississippi the next day the next morning clay got up early and read the news of the first medical reports on dyloft bladder tumors had been found in six percent of those who had used dyloft for more than a year some doctors had already decided to stop using the drug ackerman labs offered a weak denial blaming greedy trial lawyers for exaggerating the news ackermans shares had fallen to by the time clay returned to his office later that day ackerman shares were at the first person he met in his office was jonah we were here until midnight last night jonah said its crazy its going to get crazier clay replied were doubling the tv ads hire some more paralegals jonah started to leave but stopped at the door what is it clay asked do you know what youre doing youre spending money faster than anyone can count it what if something goes wrong are you worried were all a little worried ok ill be honest with you clay said sitting on the corner of his desk were taking a huge gamble and ive never done this kind of thing before if we win we make a lot of money if we lose were still in business we wont be rich thats all patton french called late in the afternoon and reported that the class action against ackerman labs which had been changed to include his mississippi plaintiffs had been filed in a state court in biloxi ill close the lawsuit here tomorrow clay said hoping that he was doing the right thing ackerman labs shares fell to clay who on max paces advice had sold his own ackerman shares a few days earlier before they had started to fall would make a profit of if he bought them back now but he decided to wait after news of the biloxi lawsuit reached the papers ackerman shares would be even cheaper as more medical studies about dyloft were published the government drugs agency finally ordered that the drug should be taken off the market the threat of tumors had persuaded almost all dyloft users to contact a lawyer patton french had never seen a mass tort class action come together so beautifully he succeeded in persuading other lawyers who were filing lawsuits against ackerman labs to join his lawsuit in biloxi in midaugust french chaired a meeting of the dyloft plaintiffs guidance committee at his enormous ranch in idaho there clay met some of the richest lawyers in america and they were all eager to meet him they wanted to know how he had discovered the dyloft case but he refused to tell them french told everybody that he had had private meetings with ackerman labs lawyers and they had told him that ackerman wanted to settle quickly otherwise the company wouldnt survive all frenchs talk centered on how much money ackerman were willing to pay and how much all the lawyers would receive he said nothing clay noticed about the clients in sixty days time there would be a settlement conference with ackerman labs dyloft looked as if it would be the quickest settlement in mass tort history and the lawyers could already smell the money clays firm had hired two more lawyers and now had ten paralegals none of whom had more than three months experience except for rodney there were new dyloft cases each of which needed immediate attention they want someone to talk to jonah complained and we dont have enough people to talk to them im afraid well be losing clients very soon how many more staff do we need clay asked at least ten jonah said maybe more later and we also need to hire a doctor for a year someone to organize the tests and medical evidence and we need one fulltime person producing and mailing a newsletter to clients who dont use the internet paulette added get it done clay agreed paulette looked at jonah with a worried look jonah put down his notebook and looked at clay clay were spending huge amounts of money he said are you sure you know what youre doing no but i think so just trust me ok were all going to make some serious money but to do that we have to spend some cash and you have the cash asked paulette who like the others knew nothing about the details of clays arrangement with patton french we do clay assured her max pace wanted a late drink with clay in a bar in georgetown not far from clays town house halfway through the first beer pace started talking about dyloft and advised clay to buy back the shares in ackerman labs that he had sold a few days earlier buy back as many shares as you can he said and wait for their value to double at am the next morning clay bought back his ackerman shares at making a profit of million with this profit he bought another two hundred thousand shares he watched the market on the internet all morning but there was no movement in the price of the shares at pm a company called philo products announced that it would buy the rest of ackerman shares as he watched the news alone on the big screen in his conference room clay had many questions he wanted to ask was philo paces secret client was it the company that had made tarvan were the dyloft cases just an excuse to weaken ackerman labs so that philo could buy it at a low price what would happen to ackerman labs and the case against dyloft now patton french told clay on the phone not to worry this is good news if philo buys ackerman labs theyll settle the dyloft cases quickly and quietly philo hates going to court that sounds like tarvan clay thought rex crittle clays accountant was worried your firm is six months old he said looking up from a pile of reports on his desk but youre already spending half a million dollars a month you have to spend it to make it clay said calmly drinking his coffee and enjoying his accountants discomfort but no money has come in for three months crittle complained its been a good year oh yes million in fees makes a wonderful year but the moneys going fast you used last month on private jet travel that reminds me clay said im thinking of buying a jet you cant afford one well soon have more money i assume youre talking about the dyloft cases million for advertising a month each for the dyloft internet site and newsletter all these new paralegals and lawyers id prefer a gulfstream clay wasnt interested in crittles anxieties its the finest jet in the world it would cost about million you dont have million youre right but maybe ill rent one crittle shook his head with a sigh of disapproval its your money i guess the meeting between the dyloft plaintiffs guidance committee and ackerman labs took place in new york city in the dance hall of an old hotel near central park one week earlier the government had approved of philo products purchase of ackerman which meant that clay had made another profit of million patton french did most of the talking the biloxi classaction lawsuit had plaintiffs a group of lawyers in georgia had another clients and were threatening another class action but french wasnt worried about them because they didnt have the important documents that he had clay listened but was bored by all the figures the only number that interested him was which was his share of the dyloft cases he still had more than any single lawyer although french himself was close with just over after three hours of nonstop figures everyone agreed on a onehour lunch break after a couple of sandwiches and a glass of water clay went for a walk up fifth avenue accompanied by wes saulsberry another member of the guidance committee ive found out about another little mass tort that you might be interested in saulsberry informed him im too busy im listening clay replied the company is in reedsburg pennsylvania and it makes the cement used by bricklayers in new home construction it seems theyre having problems with their cement after about three years it begins to break down and when it does the bricks start falling it affects about two thousand homes in the baltimore area and its just beginning to get noticed what are the damages it costs about to fix each house thirtythree percent of multiplied by two thousand equaled million clay was getting quick with his figures the proof will be easy saulsberry said the company knows its made a mistake settlement shouldnt be a problem id like to look at it ill send you the file but dont tell anyone i told you why are you telling me about it its my way of saying thank you for dyloft of course if you get the chance to return the favor some day then it will be appreciated thats how we tort lawyers work clay were all greedy and competitive but a few of us try to help each other late in the afternoon ackerman labs agreed to a minimum of for each of the forty thousand dyloft plaintiffs and the money would be available immediately not a bad days work french smiled at the end of the meeting handing clay a printed summary of his cases and anticipated fees million as soon as he was alone clay called paulette at his office in dc youve just made million he told her after talking to jonah and rodney he sat on his bed for a long time sad with the realization that he had no one else to talk to he thought of rebecca and decided to call her she answered the phone after three rings its clay he said trying to sound casual hello stranger she said politely how are you fine busy as always i hear things are going well for you i cant complain hows your job im finishing in six more days im getting married you know yes i heard whens the wedding december th i havent received an invitation i didnt send you one i didnt think youd want to come probably not are you sure you want to get married lets talk about something else dont do it rebecca dont marry him the line went dead clay stretched out on the bed and stared at the ceiling still hearing rebeccas voice hit hard with the realization of how much he still missed her when ted worley received a thick envelope from the law offices of j clay carter he immediately opened it he had seen various news reports about the dyloft settlement and had been waiting to collect his money from ackerman labs the letter began dear mr worley congratulations your classaction claim against ackerman labs has been settled in the us district court for the southern district of mississippi your portion of the settlement is according to the contract signed by you with this firm twentyeight percent of this settlement will go on attorneys fees in addition will go on litigation expenses approved by the court you will therefore receive as a final settlement a total of please sign the enclosed agreement and return it immediately in the enclosed envelope was that all he would receive from that criminal pharmaceutical company that deliberately sold a drug that had caused four tumors to grow in his bladder for months of fear and anxiety about living or dying for the painful surgery to remove the four tumors and three days of lumps and blood in his urine he called clays law firm six times and left six angry messages on the answer machine finally one of clays lawyers called him back this settlement is a joke mr worley said fortythree thousand dollars is criminal your settlement is sixtytwo thousand mr worley the young attorney said im getting fortythree no youre getting sixtytwo you agreed to give one third to your attorney without whom you would be getting nothing that figure has been reduced to twentyeight percent by the settlement most lawyers charge fortyfive or fifty percent well im not accepting it if the settlements were bigger ackerman labs would go bankrupt and that would leave you with even less im still not accepting the settlement you have no choice look at the contract for legal services mr worley page eleven paragraph eight youll see that you gave this firm authority to settle for anything above i remember that but i was told that that was a starting point i was expecting much more your settlement has already been approved by the court sir thats the way class actions work if you dont sign the acceptance form your portion will eventually go to someone else youre a lot of criminals you know that i dont know whos worse the company that made the drug or the lawyers who are robbing me of a fair settlement im sorry you feel that way youre not sorry about anything the newspaper says youre getting million thieves mr worley put down the phone angrily and threw the papers across his kitchen chapter seven the wedding party the december cover of capitol magazine featured clay carter looking rich and handsome in his expensive armani suit inside there were pictures of him playing with a dog borrowed from rodney standing proudly in empty courtrooms washing his new porsche and standing on board his new boat in the bahamas near the back of the same magazine were pictures of brides followed by announcements of future weddings there was a picture of rebecca van horn looking beautiful sitting on a bench next to her future husband an insignificant but richlooking man called jason schubert myers clay smiled to himself at the misery the magazine must at that moment be causing in the van horn home bennett and barbara van horn wanted the whole world to be impressed by their daughters wedding but who was on the front cover of the same magazine clay carter the man who bennett had called a loser revenge was sweet but his revenge wasnt finished yet im looking for a young woman preferably a blonde clay said to jonah after work that wednesday evening jonah was surprised the richest young bachelor in town is having trouble finding a woman im going to rebeccas wedding and i need a beautiful young woman to go with me jonah knew hundreds of beautiful women and he showed clay a photograph in a magazine of a girl called ridley a twentyfiveyearold fashion model from russia who had come to america as a student and who had never gone back clay met ridley for dinner in a japanese restaurant and was amazed to see that she looked even more beautiful in person than she did in her photographs conversation wasnt easy she spoke five languages but her english was poor but clay didnt mind dinner now rebeccas wedding later then its thank you and goodbye clay thought on the day of rebeccas wedding as he turned into the drive of the potomac country club clay remembered his last visit to the same place seven months earlier then he had hidden his old honda behind the tennis courts but now he was proudly driving a brand new porsche they were an hour late which was perfect timing the dance hall was crowded and a jazz band played at one end heads began turning immediately as ridley entered the room and many men who in normal circumstances would have ignored clay suddenly wanted to shake his hand ridley squeezed clays arm tightly as a crowd of clays old friends pressed in on all sides wanting to say hello laughing at everything clay said as if he were the funniest man in the world but all the time looking at ridley an announcement was being made onstage and the room became quieter the bride and groom were going to dance and the crowd gathered round to watch rebecca looked very beautiful as she slowly danced with her husband around the dance floor and clay felt jealous and angry you still love her dont you ridley whispered not now he whispered back you do i can tell no it was painful to watch rebecca dancing with her husband and clay had to remind himself why he was there he wanted rebecca to see him with a beautiful girl and to know that he was doing very well without her he took ridley by the hand and led her to the dance floor where a lot of other people were now already dancing ridley was a natural dancer and groups of men soon gathered round to watch her carefully rebecca too noticed her and then saw to her surprise that this beautiful sexy blonde woman was dancing with clay the music ended and just as a slow song was beginning rebecca stepped between clay and ridley hello clay she said ignoring ridley how about a dance sure he said ridley moved away but she wasnt alone for long within seconds she was surrounded by dozens of men she chose the tallest one threw her arms around him and began to dance i dont remember inviting you rebecca said with an arm over clays shoulder do you want me to leave he said pulling her as close to him as her wedding dress would allow people are watching she said smiling for their benefit why are you here to celebrate your wedding and to see your lovely new husband dont be unpleasant clay youre just jealous im more than jealous id like to break his neck jasons not bad i dont want to hear about it just promise me you wont get pregnant ok thats not your business tell me that you still love me i dont youre lying it might be best if you left now rebecca pulled away from him then looking at ridley dancing added and take her with you just wait a year ok clay ignored her request by then ill have million we can jump on my jet leave this boring little place and spend the rest of our lives on my boat your parents will never find us she stood in front of him not moving and said goodbye clay ill wait he said then got knocked to one side by bennett who grabbed his daughter and rescued her by leading her to the other side of the floor barbara was next she took clays hand and flashed him an artificial smile dont cause any trouble clay she said without moving her lips she pretended to dance with him leading him toward the door and how are you mrs van horn clay said his politeness as artificial as her smile fine until i saw you im sure you werent invited to this party i was just leaving good id hate to call security that wont be necessary the music stopped and clay pulled away from mrs van horn marched across the dance floor pulled ridley away from her crowd of admiring men and led her toward the bar as he was ordering a drink a big man in a rented suit approached him and whispered im security im leaving clay whispered in reply driving away from the great potomac country club with ridley wrapped around him clay privately told himself that this was one of the finest moments of his life chapter eight maxatil clay jonah paulette and rodney were spending less and less time at the office trying to avoid the angry phone calls from dyloft clients who were unhappy with their small settlements several clients had actually come to the office in person demanding to see clay but miss glick always told them that he was away on business usually clay was hiding in his office with the door locked after one particularly bad day he called patton french for advice be brave french told him its all part of the job youre making a fortune in mass torts but this is the negative side clay took ridley to spend christmas with him in his new house on the caribbean island of mustique two days after christmas max pace arrived wanting to talk business theres another drug out there pace said and its a big one but the plan is a little different this time i want a share of the profits who are you working for me and you i want twentyfive percent of the attorneys fees this could be bigger than dyloft agreed clay said without hesitation and shook paces hand now give me the details theres a female hormone drug called maxatil its used by at least million women aged between fortyfive and seventyfive it came out five years ago and it gives them relief from discomfort caused by menopause its very effective and is supposed to preserve bone strength the company is goffman goffman razor blades and mouthwash thats right twentyone billion dollars in sales last year very little debt good management a perfect example of a successful american company but they were in too much of a hurry with maxatil the typical story the profits looked huge the drug looked safe they managed to get quick approval from the government drugs agency and for the first few years everybody was happy doctors loved it and women are crazy about it because it works so beautifully but but there are problems huge problems a government study has been looking carefully at twenty thousand of these women its report will be published in a few weeks and the news for these women and for goffman is not good for about eight percent of the women the drug greatly increases the risk of breast cancer and heart disease very few people know about the report but i have a copy of it one lawsuit has already been filed in flagstaff arizona but its not a class action its just an oldfashioned individual tort case how boring not really the lawyer is a man named dale mooneyham from tucson he tries his cases one at a time and he never loses his case against goffman will go to trial before any other lawsuits can be filed if he succeeds then the way is clear for you to make a fortune with a class action against the same company the important thing is to file your class action first you learned that from patton french we can file first clay said and you can do it alone without french file it in dc then put a lot of ads out on tv itll be huge just like dyloft except this time youre in charge ill be helping in the background doing the dirty work i know a lot of important people itll be our lawsuit and with your name on it goffman will be very frightened a quick settlement probably not as quick as dyloft but that was unusually fast youll have to push hard for the first trial persuade goffman that youre not interested in a settlement that you want a trial a huge public trial there are no hidden problems although it will cost you millions in advertising and preparations for the trial and id like an advance payment of a million dollars clay was puzzled by paces request for money however with the chance of another big moneymaking tort case and their shared tarvan secret he couldnt say no january was a very busy month for clay jonah and paulette finally left the firm jonah wanted to spend his life sailing on his new boat paulette had gone to london for a vacation and emailed clay to say that she didnt want to work any more but clay was busy hiring plenty of new staff to replace them soon after christmas he assigned three lawyers two paralegals and three secretaries to the maxatil litigation he also assigned two lawyers and a paralegal to prepare a class action against the company in reedsburg pennsylvania that was making poor quality cement he was invited to an official state dinner honoring the president of argentina at the white house where he and ridley had their picture taken with the president of the united states and to the horror of rex crittle he bought a snowwhite private jet a gulfstream for million goffman meanwhile was enjoying excellent sales profits were up and the price of its shares was the highest for two years at the beginning of january it had started an unusual series of advertisements promoting not just its products but the company itself goffman has always been there the advertisements proudly announced all their previous advertising had been about one particular product and clay was sure that these new advertisements were goffmans way of preparing its investors and customers for the shock of maxatil his opinion was shared by max pace who was now staying at the hayadams hotel he seemed anxious when clay visited for a late dinner impatient for the class action against goffman to begin whats the plan pace wanted to know ignoring the food and wine clay wasnt ignoring his the ads start at eight in the morning coast to coast the telephone lines and internet site are ready ill walk over to the courthouse at about ten oclock and file the lawsuit myself sounds good weve done it before the law offices of j clay carter are now an experienced tort machine you havent told patton french or the other lawyers have you of course not why would i tell them we helped each other over dyloft but those guys are my competitors too ive shocked them before ill shock them again i cant wait this isnt dyloft remember that you were lucky before because you caught a weak company at a bad moment goffman will be much tougher but they made a bad drug clay replied and you dont go to trial with a bad drug not in a class action my sources tell me that goffman might want to litigate the case in flagstaff since thats a single plaintiff the mooneyham case thats it if they lose theyll want to reach an early settlement but if they win this could be a long fight you said mooneyham never loses he hasnt lost for twenty years juries love him he wears cowboy hats and red boots oldfashioned maybe but a real character you should go and meet him youd learn a lot ill put that on my list clay replied excited about using his new gulfstream jet at eight oclock the next morning everybody crowded into the conference room and stared at the widescreen tv waiting for the first ad to appear an attractive woman in her early sixties was sitting at a small kitchen table staring sadly out of a window a voice said if youve been taking the female hormone drug maxatil you may have an increased risk of breast cancer or heart disease the camera moved in on the womans hands on the table next to them was a bottle with the word maxatil on the label the voice continued please consult your doctor immediately maxatil may seriously threaten your health the camera showed a closeup of the womans face even sadder than before the voice said for more information call the maxatil emergency line the number of clays law firm appeared across the bottom of the screen the woman wiped a tear away from her eyes everybody in the conference room clapped and cheered then clay sent them away to sit by their phones and start collecting clients within minutes the calls started coming in at nine oclock as scheduled copies of the lawsuit were sent to newspapers and tv news channels at ten oclock clay was photographed by the press as he filed the lawsuit in the courthouse by midday goffman shares had fallen to the company hurriedly released a statement to the press denying that maxatil was dangerous and saying that it would defend the case energetically patton french called at lunchtime clay was eating a sandwich while standing behind his desk and watching the phone messages pile up i hope you know what youre doing french warned him i hope so too patton how are you fine we took a long hard look at maxatil about six months ago but decided not to proceed proving the link between the drug and cancer could be a real problem clay dropped his sandwich and tried to breathe he couldnt believe that patton french had decided not to file a classaction lawsuit against one of the wealthiest companies in the country why well uh patton we see things differently he finally said falling back into his chair in fact everybody decided to let it go until you a guy up in chicago has a few cases but he hasnt filed them yet i dont know maybe youre right we werent sure thats all we have evidence against them clay said remembering the copy of the government report that max pace had said he had youd better be careful clay goffman are very good they make ackerman labs look like children you sound scared patton im surprised at you not scared at all but if you make the smallest mistake theyll eat you alive and dont even think about a quick settlement will you join me in this lawsuit no i didnt like it six months ago and i dont like it now besides i have too many other cases to deal with good luck clay put down the phone and locked his office door he walked to his window and stood for at least five minutes looking down at the traffic rubbing the sweat from his forehead chapter nine dale mooneyham there was a lot of criticism of clay in the next days newspapers they said that he was trying to bankrupt goffman one of americas finest companies just to make more money for himself they talked a lot about the million he had already earned from mass tort cases the previous year and demanded that the government should change the law to protect companies from highearning lawyers like him clay pretended to be amused by these stories a year ago no one was talking about me he laughed to his colleagues now they cant talk about me enough but behind his locked office door he felt anxious about the newspaper stories and worried about the speed of the lawsuit he couldnt understand why no other lawyers seemed interested in suing goffman six days after the lawsuit had been filed max pace telephoned from california tomorrow is the big day he said i need some good news clay said the government report i cant say pace replied and no more phone calls someone might be listening ill explain when im next in town someone might be listening who why clay felt even more nervous and lost another nights sleep the following morning the government report on maxatil was published it said that women who took maxatil had a thirtythree percent higher risk of breast cancer and twentyone percent higher risk of heart disease than women who didnt it predicted that for every hundred thousand women using maxatil for four years or more four hundred would develop breast cancer and three hundred would suffer from heart disease goffmans shares fell immediately to but there was no public response from the company to clays relief the next days newspapers dropped their attacks on him but he also felt ignored by them because they didnt support him either he was delighted however to see the huge increase in phone calls from worried maxatil patients a week later after spending two nights in las vegas with ridley clay flew in his new gulfstream jet to tucson arizona to discuss the maxatil case with dale mooneyham mooneyhams offices were in an old redecorated train station in the reception area the old station waiting room two secretaries in their seventies sat quietly at their desks one of them led clay down a wide hall its walls covered with framed newspaper reports of famous dale mooneyham courtroom victories and into an enormous office where dale mooneyham himself was waiting behind a large desk mooneyhams handshake was cold and unfriendly clay wasnt welcome there and he was confused by his reception mooneyham was at least seventy a big man with a thick chest and large stomach a long wide face and the swollen eyes of a drinker he had colored his gray hair black and wore blue jeans bright red boots and a cowboy shirt with no necktie nice office clay smiled trying to be friendly i bought it forty years ago for mooneyham replied i saw all your newspaper cuttings outside ive done all right son i havent lost a jury trial in twenty years clay glanced around and tried to relax in the low leather armchair the office was at least five times bigger than his with animal heads on the walls no phones ringing and no computers at all i guess im here to talk about maxatil clay eventually said mooneyham narrowed his eyes slightly but was otherwise expressionless its a bad drug he said simply i filed a lawsuit about five months ago in flagstaff so we should have a trial here by early fall unlike you i dont file lawsuits until my case has been thoroughly investigated and prepared and im ready to go to trial if you do it that way you always win your case ive written a book about lawsuit preparation you should read it what about your client clay asked i just have one i dont like class actions at least not the way you and your friends handle them mass torts are a fraud a form of robbery fueled by greed that one day will harm us all uncontroled greed will lead to the introduction of tighter laws and you boys will be out of business but you wont care because youll have all the money the people wholl get harmed are all the future plaintiffs out there all the little people who wont be able to sue for bad products because you boys have been too greedy i asked about your client sixtysixyearold white female nonsmoker took maxatil for four years i met her a year ago we take our time around here we do our homework before we start shooting clay had intended to talk about maxatil in greater detail but mooneyhams attitude had instead made him want to leave as soon as possible youre not expecting a settlement he asked managing to sound interested i dont settle son my clients know that about me i take three cases a year all carefully selected by me i like different cases products and theories ive never tried before courthouses ive never seen i get my choice because lawyers call me every day and i always go to trial i know that when i take a case it wont be settled i tell all my clients that immediately so thats good news for you son isnt it if im successful all of you can then advertise for more clients settle them cheap and make yourselves a fortune id like to go to trial clay said youve never worked in a big money trial before i can learn mooneyham shook his head and smiled you probably wont have to when ive finished with goffman theyll run away from every jury i dont have to settle but you will youll have thousands of cases you wont be brave enough to go to trial he slowly stood reached out a hand and said i have work to do clay hurried from the office down the hall through the reception area and outside into the fierce desert heat chapter ten the hanna portland cement company the hanna portland cement company was started in reedsburg pennsylvania in and immediately became the largest employer in the small town the hanna brothers were strict employers but they were fair to their workers who were their neighbors as well when business was good the company was generous to its workers when business was slow everybody survived with less money it was unusual for people to lose their jobs and the contented workers never joined a union all profits went back into the business and the community the hanna brothers built a hospital a theater and the nicest high school football field in the area over the years they had received many attractive offers to buy the company but they could never be sure that their factory would remain in reedsburg so they kept it after fifty years of good management the company employed four thousand of the eleven thousand residents in the town on the day the lawsuit arrived marcus hanna the boss of the company was at a meeting with his cousin joel hanna the company lawyer joel read the lawsuit carefully and explained to his cousin that a number of homeowners were claiming damages over the poor quality cement that the company had manufactured three years earlier bricks were now falling off the houses that had been built with the cement marcus and joel had already inspected several of the homes they had calculated the number of possible claimants at five hundred and the cost of repairing each home at they hadnt been too worried because their insurance would cover the first million of any claim but according to the lawsuit that joel was now reading two thousand homeowners were suing the company for each their attorney was clay carter thats million marcus said with disbelief and their lawyer will take forty percent of it added joel he cant do that marcus said they do it every day on may st rex crittle left the accounting firm where he had worked for eighteen years and became clays business manager with the offer of a huge increase in salary and benefits he simply couldnt say no the day after crittle moved in rodney moved out although the two events werent related rodney had had enough of the pressure at work and wanted to spend more time with his family with million in his bank account he could afford to clay was sad to see him go but the truth was that he no longer needed someone like rodney the firm needed energetic highlyeducated young lawyers not ordinary paralegals like rodney later that month patton french ordered a meeting of the dyloft plaintiffs guidance committee and clay flew down to biloxi with ridley in his new jet patton french welcomed them both onto his twohundredfoot luxury boat in shorts while ridley and the other wives and girlfriends relaxed in the sun the conversation among the lawyers soon turned to maxatil and clays lawsuit against goffman i have a thousand maxatil cases carlos one of the lawyers said but im not sure what to do with them i havent filed them yet proving the link between the drug and cancer could be almost impossible i still dont like it french added i was talking to a friend of mine in dallas he has two thousand cases and isnt sure what to do with them either the problem carlos said is that the diseases caused by maxatil have many other possible causes as well ive had four experts study this drug they all say that when a woman is taking maxatil and gets breast cancer its impossible to link the disease to the drug have you had any reaction from goffman french asked clay who wasnt enjoying this conversation nothing he said i think were all waiting for mooneyham i talked to him yesterday said wes saulsberry the lawyer who had told clay about the hanna portland cement company i know mooneyham very well we tried some cases together years ago hes very good everybodys watching mooneyham even goffman the trial is set for sometime in september if mooneyham can prove the link between maxatil and breast cancer goffman will almost certainly set up a national compensation plan but if the jury agrees with goffman then it will be war because the company wont pay a cent to anybody thats what mooneyham says french said shaking his head dismissively the mans all show and no substance no ive heard it too carlos said i have a source who says exactly the same thing as wes ive never heard of a defendant wanting a trial french said goffmans tough a third lawyer added i sued them fifteen years ago if you can prove your case theyll pay a fair settlement but if you cant youre in big trouble clay was feeling worse and worse but fortunately for him maxatil was immediately forgotten when the conversation turned to the guidance committees latest fee schedule clay would soon be receiving another million from the dyloft settlement good news it would stop rex crittle his firms business manager complaining at least for a few more weeks for several days joel hanna had considered working alone he would present the companys survival plan he really needed no help doing this since it was his own original idea but babcock the attorney for their insurance company insisted on being present his client had insured the hanna portland cement company for million so joel couldnt stop him together they walked into clays luxurious law offices clay kept them waiting for a short time before rushing into the conference room jacket over his shoulder showing everyone that he was a very busy man joel hanna was impressed and couldnt help thinking this guy made million last year babcock had the same thought but he also remembered that despite all his money clay had never tried a civil lawsuit and had never asked a jury for a cent he was sure that he saw signs of nervousness beneath clays surface confidence you said you had a plan clay said lets hear it the survival plan was simple the company was willing to admit for the purposes of this meeting only that it had manufactured some bad cement and that because of this a number of new homes in baltimore would have to be rebricked they were willing to compensate the homeowners but they had no intention of bankrupting their own company the company was short of cash but was willing to borrow heavily to compensate the victims this is our mistake and we intend to correct it joel hanna said more than once do you know how many homes need compensating clay asked nine hundred and twentytwo joel said clay wrote some figures in his note book then looked up and said so if we assume a cost of for each client were looking at just over million were sure that it will cost a lot less than that to fix each house joel said we have statements from four building firms in the howard county area clay replied the average estimate for repair to the damage is id like to see those estimates joel said maybe later plus there are other damages these homeowners need to be compensated for inconvenience loss of enjoyment and the effect on their health one of our clients is suffering from severe headaches over this another lost a profitable sale on his home because the bricks were falling off we have estimates closer to twelve thousand joel said were not going to settle these cases for clay said fifteen thousand dollars was a fair figure and would get new bricks on every house but such a settlement left only for the client after clay had taken his thirtythree percent ten thousand dollars would not be enough to finish the job clay did the math quickly at for each claim hanna would need about million million would come from its insurance it could borrow the rest but this was only the first meeting this wasnt the time to make any decisions the final result would all depend on how much money clay wanted to make if he reduced his percentage he would still make several million dollars protect his clients and allow hanna portland cement a fine old company to survive or if he insisted on his thirtythree percent everybody would suffer chapter eleven reasons to be anxious miss glick sounded a little nervous there are two of them clay she said almost in a whisper fbi clays first reaction was surprise but then he relaxed and laughed to himself he had certainly done nothing wrong he asked the two policemen to come into his office do you know a man by the name of martin grace the first man agent spooner began no mike packer asked the second man agent lohse no max pace yes theyre all the same person spooner said have you any idea where we can find him no when did you last see him clay considered his answer for a long time he needed time to organize his thoughts he didnt have to answer their questions he could ask them to leave and come back when he had a lawyer present if they mentioned tarvan he would end the meeting immediately im not sure he said its been several months some time in midfebruary where did you meet him spooner asked while lohse made notes dinner in his hotel which hotel i dont remember why are you interested in max pace pace has a history of fraud and dishonest dealing in shares were interviewing witnesses we know he spent some time in dc we know he visited you on mustique last christmas we know that in january he sold a lot of goffman shares at the day before you filed your big lawsuit and bought them back at making himself a profit of several million we think he had a secret government report on a goffman drug called maxatil and he used that information to commit serious fraud anything else did you sell any goffman shares before you filed your lawsuit against them i did not have you ever owned goffman shares no lohse put his pen in his pocket and the two policemen stood and headed for the door if you hear from pace wed like to know about it spooner said dont be too optimistic clay said he could never betray pace because of all the secrets they shared were always optimistic mr clay on our next visit well talk about ackerman labs goodbye just as clay was leaving his office one night rex crittle walked in with a sour look on his face and said our insurance company has informed us that theyre canceling their cover for this firm what clay shouted why they dont like what they see twentyfour thousand maxatil cases scares them their million wont be enough to cover the losses if something goes wrong so theyre canceling the contract can they do that of course they can an insurance company can cancel its contract whenever it wants were in danger clay we have no insurance we dont need insurance im still worried you were also worried about dyloft as i recall and i was wrong well rex youre wrong about maxatil too after mr mooneyham has finished with goffman in flagstaff theyll be anxious to settle our twentyfour thousand cases are worth a billion dollars rex and goffman can afford it what if something goes wrong stop worrying after the mooneyham trial in september the money will soon come pouring in again with those words clay smiled picked up his jacket gave crittle a friendly pat on the shoulder and left for dinner clay had arranged to have dinner with an old college friend but while he was waiting at the bar the friend called him on his cell phone to say he was unable to come as clay was leaving he glanced into the restaurant and saw rebecca having dinner with two other women he stepped back and ordered another beer he wanted desperately to talk to rebecca but he was determined not to be a nuisance a trip to the rest room would work fine as he walked by her table she looked up and immediately smiled rebecca introduced clay to her two friends and he explained that he was waiting for an old college friend for dinner the guy was late he might have to wait for a long time and he apologized for the interruption fifteen minutes later rebecca appeared in the crowded bar and stood close beside him i just have a minute she said theyre waiting she nodded toward her friends in the restaurant you look great clay told her you too wheres your husband working she sighed hes always working hows married life very lonely she said looking away clay took a drink if she hadnt been in a crowded bar with friends waiting for her clay knew she would have told him a lot more the marriage isnt working clay struggled to hide a smile im still waiting he said her eyes were wet when she leaned over and kissed him on the cheek then she was gone without another word one afternoon sitting in front of the baseball on tv ted worley fell asleep in his armchair which wasnt unusual for him what was unusual was that he woke up after one hour instead of the usual two and that he felt a desperate need for the toilet he walked to the small guest bathroom down the hall closed the door behind him unzipped his pants and began to urinate a very slight burning sensation caused him to glance down and when he did he almost fainted his urine was the color of rust a dark red liquid he leaned one hand against the wall to stop himself from falling when he finished he sat on the toilet seat for a few minutes to collect his thoughts what are you doing in there his wife called from the bedroom next door none of your business he shouted angrily are you ok ted im fine but he wasnt fine he lifted the lid looked again at the bloody urine in the bowl pulled the handle and walked slowly back to his armchair in front of the tv but he couldnt concentrate on the baseball twenty minutes later after three glasses of water he went down to the basement and urinated in a small bathroom as far away from his wife as possible it was blood he decided the tumors were back and they were far more serious than they had been before he told his wife the truth the next morning over breakfast and she immediately made an appointment for him at the hospital four days later malignant tumors were found in mr worleys bladder during five hours of surgery the doctors removed all the tumors they could find the senior specialist at the hospital was watching mr worley very carefully a colleague at a hospital in kansas city had reported a similar case a month earlier the appearance of malignant tumors in the bladder of a former dyloft plaintiff the patient in kansas city was having treatment but he didnt have much longer to live the same could be expected for mr worley although the specialist tried to sound optimistic on his first visit after the operation mr worley would be allowed out of the hospital in a weeks time and as soon as he was strong enough they would begin aggressively treating his cancer later the specialist learned of another similar case in another hospital all three patients had been dyloft plaintiffs now they were dying a lawyers name was mentioned the kansas city patient was represented by a small firm in new york city it was a rare and rewarding experience for a doctor to be able to pass along the name of one lawyer who would sue another mr worleys specialist was determined to enjoy the moment he entered mr worleys room and talked to him about the dyloft case and the small settlement i was against the settlement mr worley said i wrote two angry letters to the lawyer who filed the lawsuit against ackerman labs mr clay carter but got no reply i guess its too late now mrs worley added tearfully maybe not the doctor said he told them about the kansas city patient a man very similar to ted worley hes hired a lawyer to sue his lawyer the doctor said ive had enough of lawyers mr worley said do you have his number mrs worley asked she was thinking much more clearly than her husband sadly she was already thinking about the future after her husband had gone the specialist had the number helen warshaw was a lawyer who specialized in suing mass tort lawyers for bad settlements it was her job to threaten them with court unless they settled quickly and guilty lawyers always settled quickly no one avoided a courtroom with as much energy as a tort lawyer caught making too much money for himself and not enough for his client helen already had four dyloft cases in her new york office when she received the call from mrs worley her firm had a small file on clay carter and a much thicker one on patton french after a few minutes on the phone with mrs worley helen knew exactly what had happened ill be there by five oclock she said helen flew to dulles then rented a car no private jets for her to drive to the hospital in bethesda mrs worley had collected their papers which helen studied carefully while mr worley slept when he woke up he didnt want to talk he didnt trust lawyers especially aggressive female new york lawyers however his wife had plenty of time and found it easier to talk to a woman the two went to the lounge for coffee and a long discussion during which helen told mrs worley that although she couldnt sue ackerman labs or the doctor who supplied her husband with dyloft she could still sue the attorney who had agreed the final settlement between the plaintiffs and the company a week later helen warshaw filed a lawsuit against j clay carter f patton french m wesley saulsberry and all the other known and unknown attorneys who had agreed inadequate settlements with ackerman labs the principal plaintiff was again mr ted worley fifteen minutes after the lawsuit was filed helen sent copies of it to a dozen important newspapers chapter twelve sued and investigated the reporters were already calling by the time clay finished reading the class action ive never heard of this he said quietly to oscar mulrooney a young ambitious lawyer who had become his closest friend at the firm since jonah rodney and paulette had left he was aware that there was much he didnt know about the mass tort game he had had no idea that ted worley was sick again there hadnt been a sign of trouble anywhere in the country it just wasnt fair oscar was too shocked to speak miss glick called through to say that a reporter from the washington post was waiting to speak to him tell him im not here and call security clay shouted angrily clay and oscar discussed the problem for a long time but couldnt decide what to do finally oscar volunteered to break the news to the rest of the staff if im wrong ill pay the claim clay said lets hope mr worley is the only one suing this firm thats the big question oscar how many ted worleys are out there that night clay couldnt sleep his thoughts were on ted worley he wasnt angry his former client wouldnt be claiming to have malignant tumors if they didnt actually exist mr worleys cancer was caused by a bad drug not a bad lawyer but who could blame the man for being angry with him to settle a case hurriedly for when it was really worth millions showed a mixture of bad professional practice and greed clay tried to think about other things but all thoughts eventually came back to mr worley a client who had not been protected by his lawyer the sense of guilt was so heavy that he felt like calling the man and apologizing maybe he would write him a letter he clearly remembered the two letters that mr worley had written him he and jonah had laughed about them soon after am clay made a pot of coffee and read the news on the internet one of the headlines was mass tort lawyer is sued by the masses clay read the report and other similar reports all celebrating the fact that a rich tort lawyer was in serious trouble and felt sick realizing that he could expect no sympathy no defenders an unknown source estimated the number of plaintiffs at a dozen many more plaintiffs were expected to follow how many clay asked himself as he made more coffee how many ted worleys are out there at seven oclock clay was at work pretending to be cheerful laughing and joking with the staff but miss glick spoiled his good humor by stepping into his office and saying clay those two fbi agents are back wonderful he said with a big but very false smile spooner and lohse looked serious and they didnt shake his hand clay closed the door with the same false smile and told himself to keep performing but the strain and constant fear was beginning to tire him any news of your friend pace lohse began no are you sure are you deaf clay replied sharply i said no we think he was in the city last week i havent seen him you filed a lawsuit against ackerman on july nd of last year correct yes did you own any shares in the company before you filed the lawsuit no did you sell the shares for a high price then buy them back at a lower price of course he had his good friend max pace had advised him to they knew the answer to the question they had the data he was sure of that since their first visit he had been thoroughly investigated for fraud and dishonest trading he was in trouble he shouldnt have dealt the shares am i under investigation for something he asked yes lohse nodded then this meeting is at an end my attorney will be in touch with you clay was on his feet and heading for the door the atmosphere at the next meeting of the dyloft plaintiffs guidance committee was very tense as soon as clay entered the room the lawyers were scared and with good reason new people are joining the class action against us all the time one of the lawyers said seven of my dyloft plaintiffs are suffering from malignant tumors already and warshaw is a dangerous woman wes saulsberry added the others nodding in agreement everybody apart from clay seemed to know about her she never settles she always wants trials big exciting trials that fill the front pages of all the newspapers you now have seven plaintiffs suing you french said handing clay a list of names im told by my source at ackerman that we can expect the list to grow clay looked at the list of names apart from ted worley he didnt recognize any of them is there any hope that we can prove this cancer isnt linked to dyloft saulsberry asked no were in big trouble french replied sharply if the medical information is accurate theres no way we can defend these cases saulsberry said saying what was already obvious the discussion continued but clay wasnt listening he was working out how much he would have to pay to compensate the seven plaintiffs on his list if he gave them million each he would have to pay over million which he could manage but if the list kept growing clay had interviewed hundreds of nervous clients in his time as a lawyer at opd but now it was his turn to feel nervous when he walked into the office of zack battle his defense lawyer at an hour clay wanted the meeting to be as short as possible clay told him the dyloft story beginning with max pace and ending with the fbi he didnt talk about tarvan but he would if it became necessary strangely battle took no notes he just listened frowning and smoking his pipe sometimes staring into the distance but never betraying what he thought eventually he asked did you have the information that max pace had stolen when you sold your ackerman shares and filed the lawsuit of course i had to know that i could prove the connection between dyloft and the development of tumors if we went to trial then thats dishonest trading youre guilty five years in jail tell me though how the fbi can prove it max pace can tell them i guess who else has the secret information patton french maybe one or two of the other guys does patton french know that you had this information before you filed the lawsuit i dont know i never told him when i got it so if the fbi cant find max pace youre safe if they dont know you had this secret information when you sold your ackerman shares they cant arrest you for dishonest trading they know when and for how much you sold them but thats not enough they have to prove you had the knowledge i suggest you go and see patton french make sure the secret information on dyloft cant be traced back to you dont talk to anyone else about this case the fbi are probably watching you very carefully and most importantly pray that max pace is either dead or hiding in europe the letter had been sent from a prison although he had many former clients behind bars clay couldnt remember one called paul watson he opened the envelope and pulled out a onepage letter very neatly typed it read dear mr carter you may remember me as tequila watson ive changed my name because i dont like the old one any more i read the bible every day and my favorite guy in it is called paul so ive borrowed his name i need a favor could you contact pumpkins family and tell them that im very sorry for what happened ive prayed to god and he has forgiven me i would feel much better if pumpkins family could do the same i still cant believe i killed him like that it wasnt me doing the shooting but the devil i guess but i have no excuses im still not taking drugs it would be great if you could write to me i dont get much mail sorry you had to stop being my lawyer i liked you best wishes paul watson be patient clay smiled to himself as he put down the letter if things continue like this ill be joining you in prison very soon chapter thirteen more angry plaintiffs the next day clay was in the newspapers again there were pictures of him under the headline king of torts under fbi investigation clay was beginning to feel lonely he received only one call from an old college friend trying to make him feel better he appreciated the call but it did little to help his mood where were his other friends he tried not to but he couldnt stop thinking about rebecca and the van horns what were they thinking about him now he didnt care he told himself again and again but if he didnt care why couldnt he stop thinking about them the next meeting between joel hanna and clay would be the last although neither clay nor anyone on his side of the table realized it joel hanna brought his cousin marcus the companys boss with him and left behind babcock the attorney for their insurance company weve found an additional eighteen homes that should be added to the list joel began the discussion that makes a total of nine hundred and forty we feel very confident that there wont be any more thats good clay smiled a longer list meant more clients for him more compensation to be paid by the hanna company ninety percent of the homeowners were clays clients his team had assured them that they would get more money because mr carter was an expert at mass litigation during the last meeting clay had reduced his demands from per claim to a settlement that would bring in fees of million the hanna company was only willing to pay which was its maximum borrowing capacity at per home clay would earn about million in fees if he insisted on taking thirty percent of the settlement if however he cut his share to twenty percent each of his clients would make this would reduce his fees by million marcus hanna had found a builder who would agree to repair every home for however since the last meeting there had been several stories about clay in the newspapers and none of them were good in addition to this clays firm wasnt bringing in any money he had stopped advertising for new maxatil clients rex crittle was trying to cut costs and the number of former dyloft clients joining helen warshaw in suing him was growing a reduction in fees therefore wasnt something that his firm was prepared to discuss any change in your position clay asked instead of just saying no joel explained the financial difficulties that his company was facing so theres no change clay asked when joel had finished no per person is as high as we can go we want clay said calmly if youre not moving then neither are we his voice was as hard as steel his staff were impressed by his toughness but also anxious for him to moderate his demands but clay was thinking of how patton french had behaved in the discussions with the men from ackerman labs he firmly believed that if he kept pushing hanna would surrender to his demands but he was wrong without warning marcus hanna said well then its time to go he and his cousin collected their papers and walked angrily out of the conference room two hours later the hanna portland cement company formally declared itself bankrupt unable to pay any of its debts the plaintiffs in the class action filed against it by j clay carter of washington dc would now not be receiving any money at all the baltimore press published a long detailed story about the bankruptcy and the immediate reaction by the homeowners evidence that someone very close to the settlement discussions was whispering to the reporter the company had offered per plaintiff repairs to each home were estimated at the lawsuit could have been fairly settled if the attorneys fees hadnt been so high the plaintiffs were extremely unhappy we shouldve dealt directly with hanna one of them complained to the reporter can we sue the lawyer i tried calling him but the lines are busy said another we didnt want the company to go bankrupt said a third the reporter continued by giving information about clay carters background including his involvement with the dyloft fees things got worse from there three photographs helped tell the story the first was a homeowner pointing to the bricks falling out of her house the second was a group meeting of homeowners in a garage the third was clay and ridley standing in front of the white house before the state dinner underneath it were the words mr carter seen above at a white house dinner could not be reached for comment yes thats right clay thought throwing the paper onto his desk im not talking to anyone clay spent the day locked in his office avoiding all calls then in the afternoon the sound of shouting reached him from the hallway where the security guard was trying to control a very angry man where is clay carter the man shouted here clay shouted back coming out of his office what do you want im one of your clients the man said breathing heavily the security guard gripping his arms let him go clay told the guard id like a conference with my attorney the man said this is not the way to schedule one clay replied calmly yeah well i tried the other way but all the lines are busy you robbed us of a good settlement with the cement company we want to know why not enough money for you i guess you believe everything you read in the newspapers clay said i believe weve been robbed by our own lawyer and were not accepting it without a fight you need to relax and stop worrying were still working on the settlement clay lied cut your fees and get us some money the man said angrily ill get you a settlement clay said with a false smile just relax when the man had left clay turned to the rest of his staff and clapped his hands back to work everybody he said cheerfully an hour later clay had a surprise visitor rebecca clay eagerly invited her into his office where they sat for a long time without talking finally rebecca said clay are you ok theres so much bad publicity about you im worried about you so you havent forgotten all about me no i havent i still think about you all the time yes more and more hows the worm clay asked referring to her husband hes ok she replied not angry with his question you dont seem very happy with him clay said looking at her hopefully rebecca avoided answering by asking clay a question of her own hows your girlfriend clay i think she prefers girls to men they both laughed for a long time and then they were silent again because there was so much to say are you going to survive rebecca finally asked lets not talk about me lets talk about us im married she said but a relationship would be fun wouldnt it maybe but im not going to live like that im not either rebecca im not sharing ill wait until youre single again but would you hurry up and leave him that might not happen clay yes it will chapter fourteen under attack the day before the trial inside the coconino county courthouse in flagstaff the atmosphere was tense on one side of the room sat dale mooneyham and his team on the other sat the huge goffman team led by a wellknown experienced lawyer from la roger redding he was known as roger the rocket because he struck fast and hard clay and oscar mulrooney watched from the back of the courtroom as the lawyers argued with each other over technical details mooneyham moved slowly around the courtroom leaning heavily on a stick and shouting at the judge and roger redding in his rich deep voice redding in contrast was calm and relaxed speaking quietly in beautifullystructured sentences making even the most complex arguments easy to understand he wasnt afraid of dale mooneyham during a fifteenminute break clay went outside to find something cold to drink on his way back to the courtroom a reporter stepped in front of him he was derek somebody from the financial weekly and he wanted a quick word or two can i ask you what youre doing here derek said i guess you can clay said with suspicion he knew the financial weekly it hated all lawyers especially masstort lawyers like him what are you doing here the same thing youre doing here and that is enjoying the heat is it true you have twentyfive thousand maxatil cases no how many twentysix thousand how much are they worth somewhere between zero and a couple of billion dollars unknown to clay the judge had banned the lawyers from both sides from talking to the media until the end of the trial clay attracted a large crowd because of his willingness to talk he was surprised to see himself surrounded by reporters he answered a few more questions without saying much at all the next day the arizona ledger quoted him as claiming his cases could be worth billion it had a photograph of clay outside the courtroom microphones in his face with the words king of torts in town underneath it the accompanying report gave a brief summary of clays visit and a few words about the big trial itself the reporter didnt directly call him a greedy moneyloving lawyer who made a fortune out of peoples suffering but he implied it at am the courtroom was crowded with people but there was no sign of the lawyers or the judge a young man in a suit stopped in front of where clay was sitting leaned forward and whispered are you mr carter clay nodded with surprise the judge would like to see you the newspaper was in the middle of the judges desk dale mooneyham was in one corner of the large office roger redding was leaning on a table by the window the judge was rocking in his chair none of the three looked happy very awkward introductions were made mooneyham refused to step forward and shake clays hand are you aware that i have banned lawyers from talking to the media mr carter asked the judge no sir well i have im not one of the attorneys in this case we work hard at having fair trials in arizona mr carter both sides want a fairminded jury now thanks to you the people on the jury know that there are at least twentysix thousand similar cases out there clay had no intention of appearing weak or apologizing in front of roger redding whom he might have to fight in future legal battles maybe it was unavoidable he said why dont you just leave arizona mooneyham shouted from the corner i really dont have to clay replied sharply you want me to lose clay had heard enough he wasnt sure how his presence might harm mooneyhams case but he didnt want to take any unnecessary risks he looked at roger redding and said see you in dc redding smiled politely but slowly shook his head oscar mulrooney agreed to remain in flagstaff and watch the trial clay boarded his private jet and flew home in reedsburg the news that twelve hundred workers were losing their jobs at hanna brought the town to a halt in a letter to all his employees marcus hanna explained why the company had gone bankrupt the failure to reach a settlement in the classaction lawsuit the company had tried to reach a fair honest agreement but a greedy law firm in dc had made unreasonable demands the baltimore press reported the story and openly blamed clay for all of reedsburgs misery the company would not have gone bankrupt if he had not demanded such high fees when clay read the report he wanted to sue the newspaper however he soon had bigger problems to worry about there was a twopage article in newsweek about helen warshaw clay had never seen ms warshaw before when he saw the photo of her standing in front of an empty jury box somewhere looking attractive and successful he hoped that he never would the article described how ms warshaw was one of three partners in a new york firm that specialized in dishonest legal practice now she was ready to do battle with some of the biggest and richest lawyers in the country and she wasnt going to settle she had fifty dyloft clients all dying all suing there was an interview with mr ted worley who gave the magazine his full story i didnt want to settle he said more than once for newsweek ted worley produced all his paperwork including copies of the two letters of protest he had written to clay carter and to which he had never received a reply according to his doctors ted worley had less than six months to live slowly reading each awful word of the story clay felt as if he was responsible for the cancer he threw the magazine across the floor he wished that he had never met ted worley never met max pace never even thought about going to law school he called his pilots and told them to get his private jet ready where to sir biloxi mississippi one person or two just me he hadnt seen ridley for two days and he had no desire to take her with him he needed time away from the city and anything that reminded him of it he spent two days on frenchs boat from which he followed the maxatil trial with the help of emails from oscar mulrooney choosing the jury had taken one whole day and dale mooneyham was now slowly presenting the plaintiffs case against the drug the government study was powerful evidence the jury was extremely interested in it things are going well oscar wrote mooneyham is an excellent performer but redding has better courtroom skills late on the second afternoon after a couple of drinks on the deck french asked clay how much cash do you have left i dont know million maybe and how much insurance ten million they canceled it but theyre still insuring me for dyloft french sucked on a lemon and said im not sure million is enough for you you have twentyone dyloft claims now and the number can only go up well be lucky if we can settle them for million each how many cases do you have nineteen and how much cash do you have two hundred million ill be all right after a long silence clay asked what happens if goffman wins in flagstaff i have all these cases youll be in big trouble how much have you spent on maxatil eight million just in advertising i suggest you think positive mooneyham hasnt lost a case for a long time if he wins easily goffman will have to think about settling if he wins narrowly theyll probably want to take you to court and try again you can hire a top lawyer and still beat them you wouldnt advise me to try it myself no you dont have the experience it takes years in the courtroom before youre ready for a big trial like this at eight thirty on saturday evening clay was getting ready to meet jonah who was back in town for dinner when the telephone rang is this clay carter a male voice asked yes clay replied as he was buttoning his shirt who is this im from reedsburg pennsylvania and i have some valuable information about the hanna company clays blood ran cold he sat on the edge of his bed trying to think clearly ok im listening he said at last we cant talk over the phone the voice said its a long story there are some papers where are you im in the city ill meet you inside the entrance of the four seasons hotel we can talk there when clay asked ill be there in five minutes how long will it take you ten minutes good im wearing jeans and a black baseball cap ill find you clay said then hung up he finished dressing and hurried out of his town house walking rapidly along dumbarton he tried to imagine what information he could need or even want from the hanna company he turned south on thirtyfirst street lost in thought a lady passed with a small dog a young man in a black jacket with a cigarette hanging from his mouth approached although clay barely noticed him as the man passed him in front of a poorly lit town house and under the branches of an old tree he suddenly with perfect timing and accuracy lifted his fist and hit clay on the chin clay never saw it he remembered a sudden pain in his face and his head crashing into an iron fence another man joined the first and they both started hitting and kicking clay as he lay on the ground clay rolled onto his side and managed to get to his knees then a heavy stick landed like a gunshot on the back of his head he heard a womans voice in the distance then he lost consciousness the lady who had been walking her dog saw two men in black jackets hitting a man lying on the ground with large black sticks and screamed the men ran away and she dialled on her cell phone she tried to assist the young man on the ground who was unconscious and bleeding badly clay was taken to george washington university hospital where initial examination revealed two large head wounds and several other cuts and bruises a bone in his right leg was cracked neatly in two his left kneecap was in pieces and the left ankle was broken eightyone stitches were required to close two large cuts in his head after smaller cuts in his cheek and ear had been stitched he was taken into surgery to have his legs put back together jonah began calling after waiting impatiently for thirty minutes he left the restaurant after an hour and walked angrily to clays town house he knocked on the door rang the bell and was ready to leave when he saw clays car parked in the street he walked slowly toward it something was wrong although he wasnt sure what it was a black porsche carrera but it was covered with white dust he called the police a torn and empty hanna portland cement bag was found under the porsche someone seemed to have covered the car with cement then thrown water at it after a long computer search jonah found clays name and hurried to the hospital clay was in surgery when he arrived but it was only broken bones his injuries didnt seem to be lifethreatening at am a doctor reported to jonah that the surgery had gone smoothly he looks awful she warned him jonah finally managed to see clay two hours later in a private room that he had arranged clay was covered from head to foot in thick bandages his legs held six inches above the bed by a complex series of cables he was still unconscious and his eyes chin and lips were blue and swollen blood had dried on his neck jonah watched him quietly for several minutes and then started to smile look at him he said to himself there lies the king of torts and to the horror of the nurses he shook with laughter chapter fifteen the goffman case the story was in all the newspapers on monday morning and later that same day ridley arrived she showed great affection for a few minutes and tried to interest clay in details of how she was having the house on mustique decorated clay soon had a terrible headache and asked for a pill a few minutes later he fell asleep and when he awoke she was gone over the next few days the swelling began to go down and he was able to think more clearly he stopped taking pain pills so that he could concentrate more on running the office by phone and email on the laptop computer that jonah had brought him he was also finally able to pay attention to oscar mulrooneys news about mooneyhams court case against goffman mooneyham ended his case on saturday morning oscar informed him he presented it perfectly the goffman boys were confident at the beginning but now theyre scared mooneyham destroyed their chief witness a scientist who claimed that there is no direct link between maxatil and the plaintiffs breast cancer by producing evidence of bad work hed done twenty years ago ive never seen a witness so thoroughly humbled beautiful beautiful clay kept saying heres the best part oscar continued ive moved into the hotel where the goffman people are staying and i see them at breakfast and in the bar late at night they know who i am and their lawyer a man named fleet offered to buy me a drink soon after their chief witness had been destroyed by mooneyham he told me that goffman was thinking about settling with mooneyham theyre sure that the jury is on mooneyhams side and theyre very frightened fleet wanted to know whether we would be ready to settle for for each of our twentysix thousand plaintiffs think about it clay thats billion it wasnt an offer but its a first step as we have the biggest class action lawsuit against them goffman sent fleet to talk to me if were willing to settle for each then goffman can predict their total future costs when do you see him again we agreed to meet outside the courtroom in an hours time just before the trial starts again call me as soon as you can dont worry chief how are the broken bones much better now just before midday rebecca phoned clay to say that she was on her way up to see him minutes later she walked into his room and appeared shocked at the sight of him she kissed him on the cheek between bruises you look awful she said her eyes were filled with tears can i ask you a question clay said of course where is your husband right now im not sure san paulo or hong kong maybe does he know youre here of course not what would he do if he knew you were here hed be upset im sure wed fight would that be unusual it happens all the time im afraid our marriage isnt working clay i want to leave him despite his wounds clay was having a wonderful day mooneyhams case against goffman was going well and now rebecca wanted to leave her husband the door to his room opened quietly and ridley entered she was at the foot of the bed unnoticed when she said sorry to interrupt hi ridley clay said weakly the women gave each other looks more poisonous than snakebites ridley moved to the other side of the bed directly opposite rebecca who kept her hand on clays bruised arm ridley this is rebecca rebecca this is ridley clay said then gave serious consideration to pulling the sheets over his head and pretending to be dead neither smiled ridley reached over a few inches and began gently rubbing clays right arm as there was nothing anybody could say for a few seconds clay nodded to his left and said shes an old friend then to his right and said shes a new friend both women at that moment felt annoyed at being referred to as just a friend i believe we were at your wedding reception ridley said finally to rebecca uninvited if i remember correctly rebecca replied both women stared at each other neither of them moving an inch and clay was praying for a nurse to arrive he didnt want a catfight to start over his bed but the halls were silent and both women were stroking his arms rebecca looked away first she had no choice she did have a husband i guess ill be going she sighed she left the room slowly not wishing to give ridley the idea that she was surrendering any territory as soon as the door was closed ridley moved away to the window where she stood for a long time staring at nothing clay looked through a newspaper completely unconcerned with her or what she might be feeling you love her dont you ridley said still looking out of the window trying to appear wounded who rebecca no shes just an old friend she turned to him suddenly im not stupid clay i didnt say you were clay calmly replied not taking his eyes from the newspaper she grabbed her purse and marched angrily out of the room a few minutes later oscar called on his cell phone outside the courtroom ive heard a rumor that mooneyham turned down an offer of million this morning he said did fleet tell you this no we didnt meet whats happening at the moment another goffman witness is being questioned a female professor whos criticizing the government study on maxatil mooneyham is sharpening his knives it should be ugly do you believe the rumor im not sure what to believe the wall street boys seem excited about it they want a settlement because they think thats the best way to predict costs ill call you back later there were three possible results in flagstaff and the first two would make clay a very rich man again if mooneyham won goffman would have to settle with all the other plaintiffs to avoid years of lawsuits and bad publicity alternatively a midtrial settlement would probably mean a national compensation plan for all plaintiffs thinking about the third possibility brought back the sharp pains in clays head and legs if mooneyham lost his case clay would have to prepare for his own trial in dc a nurse closed the curtains and turned off the lights and the tv when she was gone clay rested the phone on his stomach pulled the sheets over his head and waited the next morning clay was taken back to surgery for some minor adjustments to the pins and screws in his legs he returned to his room just after noon and slept for three hours paulette who had heard from jonah about clays situation and had flown back from london to see him was waiting when he finally woke up any word from mulrooney clay asked with a thick tongue he called to say the trial was going well paulette reported she adjusted his bed and pillow gave him water and just before she left handed clay an overnight envelope unopened it was from patton french a handwritten note expressed his best wishes for a speedy recovery the attached letter was from helen warshaw there were now even more people on the list of people suing the members of the dyloft plaintiffs guidance committee ridley finally came in on her way home from the gym she brought him some books and magazines and tried to look concerned after a few minutes she said clay the decorator called i need to return to mustique when he asked tomorrow maybe if the plane is available sure ill call the pilots clay felt pleased getting ridley out of town would make his life easier she was of no benefit around the hospital thanks she said then sat in the chair and began reading a magazine after thirty minutes she stood up kissed clay on the forehead and disappeared the detective was next three men from reedsburg had been arrested early sunday morning outside a bar in hagerstown maryland he showed clay color photos of the men all roughlooking characters but clay couldnt identify any of them oscar mulrooney called at pm mooneyham had had another good day in court and everybody was exhausted will goffman ask again for a settlement clay asked no but it should be a long night theres a rumor that goffman might try one last expert witness tomorrow mooneyham refuses to talk to them he seems confident of winning the case at am the next morning roger redding surprised the court by announcing that the defense had no more witnesses mooneyham slowly got to his feet scratched his head frowned at redding and said to the judge if theyve finished then so are we the judge explained to the jurors that there would be a onehour break while he discussed matters with the two lawyers when they returned they would hear the closing arguments and then at lunchtime they the jury could go away and start discussing the case with everyone else oscar mulrooney ran into the hallway cell phone in his hand clay was asleep when oscar called there was no answer in clays hospital room clay had been taken away to another department and had left his cell phone on his bed oscar finally managed to contact clay a few hours later where have you been he demanded dont ask clay replied with annoyance at having been away from his phone for so long goffman surrendered this morning oscar said they tried to settle but mooneyham refused to listen everything happened real fast after that closing arguments began around ten i guess the jury left to consider the case at exactly noon the jury already has the case clay asked shouting with excitement they had the case what they had the case its done they considered it for three hours and found in favor of goffman im sorry clay everybody here is in shock no im afraid so tell me youre lying oscar i wish i were i dont know what happened nobody does redding made a very good closing speech but i watched the jurors i still thought they were on mooneyhams side dale mooneyham lost a case not just any case clay he lost our case but how i dont know i would have bet all my money on mooneyham we just did im sorry listen oscar im lying here in bed all alone im closing my eyes now and i want you to just talk to me tell me something after the trial fleet and a couple of other guys from goffman came up to me and told me that they were looking forward to the next trial which would be in dc against mr clay carter the king of the torts who as we all know has never tried a tort case in his life what could i say they had just beaten an experienced lawyer like mooneyham our cases are worthless oscar they certainly think so they told me they wouldnt offer a single cent for any maxatil case anywhere in the country they want trials clay kept oscar on the phone for over an hour as his unlit room grew dark oscar explained in detail the closing arguments he described the high tension of waiting for the jurys decision and the shock on the plaintiffs face a dying woman whose lawyer wouldnt take the million that goffman was rumored to be offering mooneyham who hadnt lost a case for so long that he had forgotten how to lose demanded that the jury explain in writing how they had reached their decision and there was the shock on the goffman side when they heard the jurys final decision oscar ended his story by saying im going to the bar now clay called a nurse and asked for a sleeping pill chapter sixteen return to sanity eleven days later clay was finally released from the hospital paulette pushed his wheelchair out of the hospital to a rented van driven by oscar fifteen minutes later they rolled him into his town house and locked the door paulette and miss glick had turned the downstairs into a temporary bedroom his phones and computer had been moved to a folding table near his bed his clothes were piled neatly on plastic shelves by the fireplace for the first two hours he was home he read mail and financial reports but only what paulette allowed him to see most of what had been printed about clay was kept away from him later after a short sleep he sat at the kitchen table with paulette and oscar and announced that it was time for serious discussion two days earlier oscar had unwillingly agreed to go to new york to meet with helen warshaw and basically to beg for her mercy his boss didnt want to file for bankruptcy but if pushed too hard by ms warshaw he would have no choice she had been unimpressed clay was a member of a group of lawyers with a combined value in her opinion of billion she could not allow him to pay less compensation than the other lawyers in the group plus she wasnt in a settling mood the trial would be an important one and she planned to enjoy every moment of it gradually over the past few weeks the word bankruptcy had been used more and more until among clays staff it had become part of everyones vocabulary if the firm went bankrupt clay would lose his office his car his boat his private jet and his house on mustique however he would not have to fight goffman in court the unhappy hanna plaintiffs would be forced to settle and most importantly helen warshaw would not be able to take him to court after discussing bankruptcy for a few hours oscar left for the office and paulette wheeled clay outside for a cup of green tea with honey i have two things to say she said sitting very close and staring at him first im going to give you some of my money no youre not yes i am you made me rich when you didnt have to its not my fault youre a stupid white boy whos lost everything but i still love you im going to help you clay can you believe all this paulette no its beyond belief but its true its happened and things will get much worse before they get better dont read the papers clay please promise me that dont worry im going to help you if you lose everything ill be around to make sure youre ok i dont know what to say say nothing they held hands and clay fought back tears a moment passed number two she said ive been talking to rebecca shes afraid to see you because she might get caught she has a new cell phone which her husband knows nothing about she gave me the number she wants you to call her this afternoon her husbands out of town ill leave in a few minutes rebecca and jason myers had decided to end their marriage at first he had wanted to delay the divorce but he also preferred to work eighteen hours a day whether he was in dc new york or hong kong his firm had offices in thirtytwo cities and he had clients around the world work was more important than anything else he had simply left her with no apologies and with no plans to change his ways the divorce papers would be filed in two days rebecca was already packing her bags jason would keep their property she didnt know where she was going to live in less than a year of marriage they had saved little money he earned a year but she wanted none of his salary according to rebecca her parents had not caused any problems they hadnt had the chance myers didnt like them which was no surprise and clay suspected that one reason why he preferred to work in hong kong was because it was so far away from the van horns both had a reason to run clay wouldnt under any circumstances remain in dc he wanted to go somewhere where people didnt know him for the first time in her life rebecca just wanted to get away away from a bad marriage away from her family away from the country club and the awful people who went there away from the pressures of making money and acquiring possessions rebecca spent the night with clay and decided not to leave over coffee the next morning clay began with tequila watson and tarvan and told her everything paulette and oscar returned from the office with more bad news the homeowners in reedsburg were being encouraged to file a lawsuit against clay for mishandling the hanna case in total six lawsuits had been filed against clay all by the same attorney who was actively looking for more clays office was organizing a settlement plan to be put in front of the judge in the hanna bankruptcy in addition to this helen warshaw wanted to record the evidence of several of the dyloft plaintiffs urgency was required because they were dying and their video evidence would be important to the trial which was expected in about a year clay agreed to the schedule suggested by ms warshaw although he had no plans to attend the recording of evidence himself under pressure from oscar clay finally agreed to reduce the number of staff at his firm a letter to the maxatil clients was also planned and written in which clay explained that after the mooneyham trial in flagstaff it would be almost impossible to prove a link between the drug and cancer goffman wasnt willing to consider an outofcourt settlement and clay wasnt well enough to prepare for a long trial he was therefore releasing each client from their contract and wished them luck in any future fight against goffman with another law firm there were a hundred other details on oscars checklist but clay was tired do you want me to stay tonight paulette asked no rebeccas here you love trouble dont you shes filing for divorce tomorrow what about the russian girl ive finished with her for the next week clay never left his town house rebecca packed all of ridleys things away in the basement and moved in some of her own stuff although clay warned her that he was soon going to lose the house she cooked him wonderful meals and nursed him whenever he needed it they watched old movies until midnight then slept late every morning the last lawyer to enter clays life was mark munson a bankruptcy expert whom crittle had found clay discovered that in the seventeen months since he had left opd he had earned million in fees but most of this had been spent he had also earned million trading in ackerman shares but this would all have to be paid back if you hide money you go to jail munson warned him clay was left with approximately million however he now had twentysix former clients suing him over dyloft the hanna classaction plaintiffs were getting organized and the consequences of maxatil would be nasty and expensive none of these expenses could be accurately predicted when it ends munson said youll have no money but at least you wont owe anything thanks clay said with a bitter smile after two hours with munson and crittle the kitchen table was covered with paper all that was left of the past seventeen months of his life he was ashamed of his greed and his stupidity it was sickening what the money had done to him the thought of leaving helped him survive each day ridley called from mustique with the alarming news that a for sale sign had appeared in front of their house thats because its now for sale clay said i dont understand come home and ill explain it to you is there trouble there is after a long pause she said i prefer to stay here fine stay in the house until it sells i dont care rodney found his old friend sitting by the window how are the bones he asked sitting beside him healing nicely hows your head no additional brain damage hows your soul surviving paulette says youre leaving for some time anyway ill file for bankruptcy next week and i wont be around here when it happens paulette has a flat in london that i can use for a few months well hide there you cant avoid a bankruptcy no there are too many good claims against us remember our first dyloft plaintiff ted worley sure he died yesterday i didnt kill him but i didnt protect him either his case in front of a jury is worth million there are twentysix other cases similar to his im going to london clay i want to help im not taking your money ive had this conversation twice with paulette and once with jonah you made your money and you were smart enough to get out at the right time i wasnt you didnt have to give us million were giving some back no yes the three of us have talked about it well wait until the bankruptcy is over then each of us will transfer money to your account a gift you earned that money rodney keep it nobody earns million in six months clay you might win it steal it or see it drop out of the sky but nobody earns money like that its ridiculous im giving some back so are paulette and jonah how are the kids youre changing the subject yes im changing the subject so they talked about kids and old friends at opd and old clients and cases there they sat on the front steps until after dark when rebecca arrived and it was time for dinner paulette and rodney drove clay and rebecca to reagan national airport where clays gulfstream jet sat very close to the spot where he had first seen it as they were leaving for at least six months there was a lot of luggage especially rebeccas clay who had sold most of his possessions was traveling light he could walk fairly easily but he was still too weak to carry anything rodney acted as his porter clay climbed the steps of his jet for one last journey said goodbye to paulette and rodney thanked them both and promised to call within days when the door was shut clay pulled the shades down over the windows so that he would see none of washington when they lifted off to rebecca the jet was a terrible symbol of the destructive power of greed she was looking forward to the tiny flat in london where no one knew them and no one cared what they wore drove bought ate or where they worked shopped or went on vacation she wasnt coming home she had fought with her parents for the last time clay wanted nothing more than two good legs and a fresh start he was surviving one of the biggest disasters in the history of american law and it was further and further behind him he had rebecca now and nothing else mattered somewhere over newfoundland they unfolded the sofa and fell asleep under the covers the end
