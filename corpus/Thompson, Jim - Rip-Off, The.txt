the ripoff by jim thompson copyright i didnt hear her until she was actually inside the room locking the door shut behind her because that kind of place the better type of that kind of place and this was the better type has its taproot in quiet anonymity so whatever is required for it is provided thick walls thick rugs welloiled hardware whatever is required but no more no bath only a sink firmly anchored to the wall no easy chairs since you are not there to sit no radio or television since the most glorious of diversions is in yourself your two selves she was scowling agitatedly literally dancing from foot to foot as she flung off her clothes tossing them onto the single wooden chair where mine were draped i laughed and sat up have to pee i said why do you always hold in until youre about to wet your pants i dont always just when im meeting you and i dont want to take time to oops whoops help me darn it she said trying to boost herself up on the sink hallup i helped her holding her on her porcelain perch until she had finished then i carried her to the bed and lowered her to it looked wonderingly at the tiny immensity the breathtaking miracle of her body she wasnt quite five feet tall she weighed no more than ninetyfive pounds and i could almost encompass her waist with one hand but somehow there was no skimpiness about her somehow her flesh flowed and curved and burgeoned extravagantly deliciously lush manny i said softly marvelling for as often as i had seen this miracle it remained new to me manuela aloe present she said now come to bed you goodlooking darling sonofabitch you know something manny my love if i threw away your tits and your ass god forbid there wouldnt be anything left her eyes flashed her hand darted and swung slapping me smartly on the cheek dont you talk that way to me not ever what the hell i said you talk pretty rough yourself she didnt say anything simply stared at me her eyes steady and unblinking telling me without telling me that how she talked had no bearing on how i should talk i lay down with her kissed her and held the kiss and suddenly her arms tightened convulsively and i was drawn onto and into her and then there was a fierce muted sobbing a delirious exulting a frantic hysterical whispering oh you dirty darling bastard you sweet sonofabitch you dearest preciousest motherloving sugarpie manny manuela aloe i wondered how i could love her so deeply and be so much afraid of her so downright terrified and i damned well knew why after a while and after we had rested awhile she placed her hands against my chest and pushed me upward so that she could look into my face that was good britt she said really wonderful ive never enjoyed anything so much manny i said you have just said the finest the most exciting thing a woman can say to a man ive never said it to anyone else but of course theres never been anyone else except your husband you mean i never said it to him you dont lie to people about things like this i shifted my gaze afraid of the guilt she might read in my eyes she laughed softly on a submerged note of teasing it bothers you doesnt it britt the fact that there was a man before you dont be silly a girl like you would just about have to have other men in her life not men only the one man my husband well it doesnt bother me he doesnt i mean uh just how did he die anyway suddenly she said very suddenly let me up now will you please i helped her to use the sink and then i used it it couldnt have taken more than a minute or two but when i turned around she had finished dressing i was startled although i shouldnt have been she had the quick sure movements characteristic of so many small women acting and reacting with lightninglike swiftness getting things done while i was still thinking about them running off mad i said and then comprehending or thinking that i did well dont fall in honey ive got some plans for you she frowned at me reprovingly and still playing it light i said she couldnt be going to take a bath id swear she didnt need a bath and who would know better than i that got me another frown so i knocked off the kidding i like your dress manny paris job is it dallas niemanmarcus tsk tsk such extravagance i said and you were right there in italy anyway to pick up your shoes she laughed relenting close but no cigar she said pirouetting in the tiny spikeheeled pumps i pinna you like like come here and ill show you how much gotta go now but just wait she said sliding me a sultry glance and leave the door unlocked youll have some company very soon i said i wondered who the company could be and she said archly that i should just wait and see id really be surprised then she was gone down the hall to the bathroom i supposed and i stretched out on the bed pulling the sheet up over me and waited for her to return the door was not only unlocked but eversoslightly ajar but that was all right no problem in a place like this the lurking terror sank deeper and deeper into my mind and disappeared and i yawned luxuriously and closed my eyes apparently i dozed for i suddenly sat up to glance at my wristwatch automatically obeying a whispered command which had penetrated my subconscious watch i said i sat up thats wrong i only started to had barely lifted my head from the pillows when there was a short snarlinggrowl a threat and a warning as unmistakable as it was deadly and slowly ever so slowly i sank back on the bed there was a softer growl a kind of gruff whimper approval i lay perfectly still for a time scarcely breathing and it is easy to stop breathing when one is scared stiff then without moving my head i slanted my eyes to the side directly into the unblinking stare of a huge german shepherd his massive snout was only inches from my face the grayishblack lips were curled back from his teeth and i remember thinking peevishly that he had too many that no dog could possibly have this many teeth our eyes met and held for a moment but dogs members of the wolf family regard such an encounter as a challenge and a rising growl jerked my gaze back to the ceiling there was that gruff whimper again approval then nothing nothing but the wild beating of my heart that and the dogs warm breath on my face as he stood poised so close to me ready to move decisively if i should move watch he had been given an order and until that order was revoked he would stay where he was which would force me to stay where i was lying very very still as of course i would not be able to do much longer any moment now i would start yawning accumulated tension would force me to at almost any moment my legs would jerk an involuntary and uncontrollable reaction to prolonged inactivity and when that happened the dog growled again differently from any of his previous growls with the sound was another the brief thudthud of a tail against the carpet a friend or perhaps an acquaintance had come into the room i was afraid to move my head as the intruder was obviously aware so she came around to the foot of the bed where i could see her without moving it was the mulatto slattern who sat behind the desk in the dimly lit lobby the manager of the place i had always assumed the mock concern on her face didnt quite conceal her malicious grin and there was spiteful laughter in her normally servile voice well jus looky heah now mistah britton rainstar with a doggy in his room how you doin mistah highanmighty rainstar ggoddam you i choked with fear and fury get that dog out of here call him off she said shuh man she wasnt

get some rest dont i begged dont do this to me if you cant do anything else at least stay with me i cant move and i cant lie still any longer and and that dog will kill me hes trained to kill s so so please i gulped swallowing an incipient sob blinking the tears from my eyes stay with me please stay until miss manny comes back my eyes cleared the woman was gone moved out of my line of vision i started to turn my head and the dog warned me to desist then from somewhere near the door the woman spoke again just stay until miss manny come back thats what you said mistah rainstar yes please just until then but what if she don come back what about that mistah rainstar an ugly laugh then a laugh of mean merriment and then she was gone closing the door firmly this time and locking it the terror had begun three months before it began at three oclock in the morning with mrs olmstead shaking me into wakefulness mrs olmstead is my housekeeper insofar as i have one an old age pensioner she occupies a downstairs bedroom in what in better times was called the rainstar mansion she does little else but occupy it very little in the way of housekeeping but fortunately i require little and necessarily pay little so one hand washes the other she wasnt a very bright woman at best and she was far from her best at three in the morning but i gathered from her gabbling and gesturing that there was an emergency somewhere below so i pulled on some clothes over my pajamas and hurried downstairs a mr jason was waiting for me a stout apoplecticlooking man who was dressed pretty much as i was he snapped out that he just couldnt have this sort of thing yknow it was a god damn imposition and i had a hell of a lot of guts giving out his phone number and so forth and so on now look i said finally managing to break in on him listen to me i didnt give out your number to anyone i dont know what the hell it is for christs sake and i dont want to know and i dont know what youre talking about yeah ydont huh he seemed somewhat mollified well better hurry up fellow said it was an emergency matter of life and death he lived in an elaborate summer home about three miles from mine in an area that was still very good he stopped his car under the porte cochere and preceded me into the entrance hall then withdrew a few feet while i picked up the telephone i couldnt think who would be making a call to me under such circumstances there just wasnt anyone no one at the foundation would do it except for the check which they sent me monthly i had virtually no contact with the hemisphere foundation as for constance my wife now a resident an apparently permanent one at her fathers home in the midwest constance had no reason to call except for being maimed and crippled constance was in quite good health she would doubtless die in bed thirty or forty years from now sweetly smiling her forgiveness for the accident i had caused so she would not call and her father would not conversation with me was something he did his best to avoid oh he had been scrupulously fair far more than i would have been in his place he had publicly exonerated me of blame stoutly maintaining to the authorities that there was no real evidence pointing to my culpability but without saying so he had let me know that he would be just as happy without my company or conversation so yes i spoke into the phone britton rainstar here rainstar a husky semiwhisper a disguised voice get this you deadbeat fuckoff pay up or youll die cryin pay up or else huh wh aat i almost dropped the phone what who is this i kid you not rainstar decorate the deck or youll be trailing turds from here to texas i was still sputtering when the wire went dead jason glanced at me and looked away bet you could use a drink always helps at a time like this thanks but i guess not i said if youll be kind enough to drive me home he did so mumbling vague words of sympathy at my house with its crumbling veranda and untended lawn he pressed a fifty dollar bill into my hand get your phone reconnected okay no i insist and im sorry things are so bad for you damned shame i thanked him humbly assuring him that i would do as he said by the time mrs olmstead arose and began preparing breakfast i had had two more callers both crankily sympathetic as like jason they brought word of a dire emergency i went with them of course how could i refuse or explain and what if there actually was an emergency there was always a chance a milliontoone chance that my caller might have a message of compelling importance so it was simply impossible impossible for me at least to ignore the summons the result was the same each time an abusive demand to pay up or to suffer the ugly consequences i accepted some weak lukewarm coffee from mrs olmstead i even ate a piece of her incredible toast and a bite or two of the scrambled eggs she prepared which preposterous as it seems were halfraw but overcooked ignoring mrs olmsteads inquiries about my emergency calls i went up to my room and surrendered to a few hours of troubled rest i came back downstairs shortly after noon advised mrs olmstead that i would fix my own lunch and that she should do as she pleased she trudged down the road to the bus stop going i knew not where nor cared i cleaned myself up and dressed not knowing what i was going to do either and not caring much from the nottoodistant distance came a steady rumbling and clattering and rattling the toandfro passage of an almost unbroken parade of trucks through the many gabled windows their shutters opened to the spring breeze came the sicklypungent perfume of what the trucks were carrying i laughed softly sadly wonderingly i jumped up slamming a fist into my palm i sat back down and got up again aimlessly left the room to wander aimlessly through the house through the library with its threadbare carpet and its long virtually empty bookshelves through the lofty drawing room its faded tapestry peeling in tatters from the walls the grand ballroom its parquet floor inclining imperceptibly but ominously with the vast weight of its rustruined pipe organ i came out onto the rear veranda where glass from shattered windows splattered over the few unsaleable items of furniture that remained expensively stained glass bright with color i stood looking off into that previously mentioned nottoodistant distance it was coming closer it had come quite a bit closer since yesterday it seemed to me and why not anyway as rapidly as those trucks were dumping their burden at present i was merely merely in the environs of a garbage dump but soon it would be right up to my back door soon i would be right in the middle of the stinking ratinfested horror and maybe that was as it should be hmm what better place for the unwanted unneeded and worthless jesus i closed my eyes shivering i went back through the house and up to my bedroom i glanced at myself in a floorlength mirror and i doubt that i looked as bad as my warped and splotched reflection but still i cursed and groaned out loud i flung off my clothes and showered vigorously i shaved again doing it right instead of halfassed and then i began rummaging through my closets digging far back in them and uncovering items that i had forgotten an hour later after some work with mrs olmsteads steam iron some shoe polish and a buffing brush i again looked at myself and warped as it was the mirror told me my efforts were wellspent indeed the handmade shoes were eternally new evermagnificent despite their chronological age the cambric shirt from sulka and the wateredsilk countess mara tie were new longago christmas presents which i had only glanced at and returned to their gift box and a decade had been wonderfully kind to the bond street suit swinging full circle through fads and freakishness and bringing it back in style again i frowned studying my hair the shagginess was not too bad not unacceptable but a trim was certainly in order the gray temples and the gray streak down the centei were also okay a distinguished contrast for the jet blackness however that yellowish tinge which gray hair shittily acquires was not all right i needed to see a truly good hair man a stylist not the barbercollege cruds that i customarily went to i examined my wallet twelve dollars plus the fifty jason had given me so i could properly finish the job i had started hair and all and the wonders it would do for my frazzled morale to look decent again the way britton rainstar had to look having so little else but looks but if i did that if i didnt make at least a token payment to amicable finance the phone rang it had not been disconnected as jason bad assumed calling me at other numbers was simply part of the treatment i picked up the phone and identified myself a cheery mans voice said that he was mr bradley amicable comptroller you have quite a large balance with us mr rainstar i assume youll be dropping in today to settle up i started to say that i was sorry that i simply couldnt pay the entire amount as much as i desired to but ill pay something thats a promise mr bradley and ill have the rest within a week i swear i will j just dont do anything d dont hurt me please mr bradley yes mr rainstar what time can i expect you in today you cant i said hows that his voice crackled like a whip not today or any other day you took my car i repaid your loan in full and you still took my car now late charges rainstar interest penalties repossession costs nothing more than your contract called for i told him he could go fuck what the contract called for he could blow it out his ass and if you bastards pull any more crap on me any more of this calling me to the phone in the middle of the night call you to the phone he was laughing at me fake emergency calls what makes you think we were responsible i told him why i thought it why i knew it because only amicable finance was lousy enough to pull such tricks others might screw their own mothers with syphilitic cocks or pimp their sisters at a nickel a throw but they werent up to amicables stunts so heres some advice for you you liverlipped asshole you fuck with me any more and itll be shit in the fan before im through with you youll think lightning struck a crapper i continued a minute or two longer growing more elaborate in my cursing and not surprisingly i had quite a vocabulary of curses nothing is sacred to children just as anything unusual is an affront to them a challenge which cannot be ignored and when you have a name like britton rainstar you are accepted only after much fighting and cursing i slammed up the phone frightened stiff by what i had done yet somehow pleased with myself i had struck back for a change for once in a very long time i had faced up to the ominous instead of ignoring or running from it i fixed the one drink i had in the house a large drink of vodka sipping it feeling the dullness go out of my heart i decided that i would by god get the needful done with my hair i would look like a man by god not the jolly green giant when amicable finance started giving me hell before i could weaken and change my mind i made an appointment with a hair stylist then i finished my drink dragging it out as long as i could and stood up and the phone rang i almost didnt answer it certain that it would get me nothing but a bad time but few men are strong enough to ignore a ringing telephone and i am not one of them a booming infectiously goodnatured voice blasted into my ear mr rainstar britt how the hell are you kid i said i was fine and how the hell was he he said he was just as fine as i was laughing uproariously and i found myself smiling in spite of myself this is pat aloe britt patrick xavier aloe if youre going to be fussy another roar of laughter look kid id come out there but im tied up tighter than a popcorn fart sos how about you dropping by my office in about an hour well two hours then but well why i said why do you want to see me mr uh pat because i owe you britt baby want to make it up to you for those pissants at amicable dont know whats the matter with the stupid bastards anyway but amicable i hesitated you have something to do with them a final roar of laughter apparently i had said something hilariously funny then good humor flooding his voice he declared that he not only wanted to see me but i also wanted to see him even though i didnt know it yet thus the vote for seeing each other was practically unanimous by his account so how about it britt baby see you in a couple of hours okay who am i to buck a majority vote i said ill see you pat uh baby i got out of the car at a downtown office building i entered its travertinemarbie lobby and studied the large office directory affixed to one wall it was glassedin a long oblong of white plastic lettering against a blackfelt background the top line read pxa holding corporation beneath it in substantially smaller letters were the names of sixteen companies including that of amicable finance the final listing in small red letters read p x aloe p h m francesca aloe allo aloe i thought stepping into the elevator patrick xavier and m francesca and britt baby makes three or something but whereof and why for gods sake i punched the button marked ph and was zoomed forty floors upward to the penthouse floor as i debarked into its richly furnished reception area a muscular young man with gleaming black hair stepped in front of me he looked sharply into my face then smiled and stepped back how are you mr rainstar nice day how are you i said for i am nothing if not polite a nice day so far at least a truly beautiful beautifully dressed woman came forward and urgently squeezed my hand such a pleasure to meet you mr rainstar do come with me please i followed her across a hundred feet or so of carpet to an unmarked door she started to knock then jerked her hand back turned to me still smiling but rather whitishly if youll wait just a moment please she started to shoo me away then froze at the sound from within the room a sound that could only be made by a palm swung against a face swung hard again again like the stuttering staccato crackling of an automatic rifle it went on for all of a minute a very long time to get slapped abruptly as though a gag had been removed a woman screamed n no d dont please ill never do the scream ended with the suddenness of its beginning the slapping also the beautiful beautifully dressed young woman waited about ten seconds then she knocked on the door and ushered me inside miss manuela aloe she said mr britton rainstar a young woman came toward me smiling rubbing her hand her right hand against her dress before extending it to me thank you sydney she said dismissing the receptionist with a nod mr rainstar lets just sit here on the lounge we sat down on the long velour lounge she crossed one leg over the other rested an elbow on her knee and looked at me smiling her chin propped in the palm of her hand i looked at her the silverblond hair the startlingly black eyes and lashes the flawlessly creamy complexion i looked around and found it impossible to believe that such a delicious bon bon of a girl would do harm to anyone couldnt i have heard a recording and if there had been another woman where was she the only door in the room was the one i had entered by and no one had passed me on the way out you look just like him manuela was saying weell almost just you dont have your hair in braids i said what and then i said oh for several questions in my mind had been answered you mean chief britton rainstar i said the remington portrait of him in the metropolitan she said no shed missed that one darn it i was talking about the one in the royal museum by james mcneill whistler but tell me isnt britton a kind of funny name for an indian chief hilarious i said i guess we got it from the nutty whites the rainstars intermarried with early and often now if you want a real honest to hannah jumpin by jesus indian name well how does george strike you george she laughed george george creekmore inventor of the cherokee alphabet and publisher of the first newspaper west of the mississippi and i guess thatll teach me she smiled coloring slightly but anyway you certainly bear a strong resemblance to the chief of course id heard that all the rainstar men did but were hard to tell apart i agreed the only significant difference is in the pockets of later generations the pockets theyre empty i said and tapped myself on the chest meet lo the poor indian hi lo she said laughing and i said hi and then we were silent for a time but it was not an uncomfortable silence we smiled and looked at each other without selfconsciousness both of us liking what we saw when she spoke it was to ask more questions about the rainstar family and while i didnt mind talking about it having little else to be proud of there were things i wanted to know too so after rambling on awhile i got down to them like when and why the heck i said am i seeing p x aloe i dont think youll be able to see uncle pat today she said some last minute business came up but theres nothing sinister afoot she gave me a reassuring little pat on the arm now unless youre in a hurry well i am due in washington to address the cabinet i said i thought it was already addressed but i guess someone left off the zone number you dear she laughed delightedly you absolute dear lets go have some drinks and dinner and talk and talk and talk o o o she got her hat and purse from a mahogany cabinet the hat was a sailor with a turnedup brim and she cocked it over one eye giving me an impish look then she grinned and righted it and the last faint traces of apprehension washed out of my mind give another woman a vicious slapping this darling diminutive child rainstar you are nuts we took the elevator down to pxas executive dining room in a subbasement of the building a smiling maitre d with a large menu under his arm came out of the shadows and bowed to us graciously a pleasure to see you miss aloe and you too sir needless to say not at all i said my pleasure he looked at me a little startled i am inclined to gag it up and talk too much when i am uneasy or unsure of myself which means that i am almost always gagging it up and talking too much this is mr britton rainstai albert manuela aloe said i hope youll be seeing him often my own hope will you have a drink at the bar while your table is being readied she said we would and we did in fact we had a couple since the night employees were just arriving at this early hour and there was some delay in preparing our table very nice i said taking an icy sip of martini a very nice place miss aloe or is it mrs she said it was miss she had taken her own name after her husband died and i could call her manny if i liked but yes she glanced around casually it is nice isnt it not that it shouldnt be considering uhhuh i said or should i say ahha im afraid im going to have to rush right off to geneva manny whaaat just as soon as i pay for these drinks unless you insist on going dutch on them silly she wriggled deliciously youre with me and everythings complimentary but you said considering i pointed out a word hinting at the dread unknown in my case at least to wit money oh well she shrugged dismissing the subject money isnt everything with an operation as large and multifaceted as pxa one with so many employees and interests it was impossible to maintain supervision and surveillance in every place it might be required it would have been impossible even if pxas activities were all utterly legitimate instead of borderline with personnel which figuratively cried out to be spied upon pat aloe had handed the problem to his niece manny a graduate student in psychology after months of consultation with behaviorists and recording experts she had come up with the bugging system used throughout the pxa complex it was activated by tones and was uncannily accurate in deciding when a persons voice tone was not what it should be thus bradley the man who had called me this morning had been revealed as a switcher one who diverted business to competitors so all of his calls were completely recorded instead of receiving a sporadic spot check i see i nodded to manny as we dawdled over coffee and liqueurs about as clearly as i see through mud everything is completely opaque to me oh now why do you say that she said id seen that portrait when i was a little girl and id never gotten it out of my mind so when i found out that the last of the rainstars was right here in town recalling part of the conversation i said you must have felt that the last of the rainstars needed his mouth washed out with soap she laughed and said nope cursing out bradley had been a plus that was just about the clincher for you with pat someone of impeccable background and breeding who could still get tough if he had to manny i said exactly what is this all about anyway why pxas interest in me well before you answer maybe id better set you straight on something ive never been mixed up in anything shady and pxa seems to be mixed up in nothing else but oh i know youre not doing anything illegal nothing you can go to prison for but still well pxa is right out in the open manny said firmly anyone that wants to try can take a crack at us we dont rewrite any laws and we dont ask any to be written for us we dont own any big politicians id say that for every dollar we make with our socalled shady operations theres a thousand being stolen by some highly respectable cartel well i nodded uncomfortably theres no disputing that of course but i dont feel that one wrong justifies another if youll pardon an unpardonable cliche pardoned she grinned at me openly we dont try to justify it no justifications no apologies and this bugging business i shook my head it seems like something right out of nineteen eightyfour its sneaky and big brotherish and it scares the hell out of me manny shrugged remarking that it was probably everything i said but bugging wasnt an invention of pxa and it didnt and wouldnt affect me were on your side britt were against the people whove been against your people my people i said and i grimaced a little wryly i doubt that any of us can be bracketed so neatly any more we may be more of one race than we are another but i suspect were all a little of everything white yellow black and red oh well she glanced at her wristwatch youre saying that there are no minorities i said that i wasnt sure what i was saying or rather what the point to it was but i dont believe that a man whos being pushed around has a right to push anyone but the person pushing him if you can untangle that his license to push is particulai not general if he starts lashing out at everyone and anyone hes asking for it and he ought to get it it was all very highsounding and noble and it also had the virtue fortunately or otherwise of being what i believed what i had been bred to believe and now i was sorry i had said it for i seemed to be hopelessly out of step with the only world i had and again i was about to be left alone and afraid in that world which i had had no hand in making this lovely child manny the one person to be kind to me or show interest in me for so very long was getting ready to leave she was looking at me brows raised quizzically she was patting her mouth with her napkin then crumpling it to the table she was glancing at herself in the mirror in her purse then snapping the purse shut and starting to rise and then praise be glory to the great mixedblood father she sat back down all right she said crisply lets say that pxa is interested in using the rainstar name lets say that it would be pretty stupid of us to dirty up that name now wouldnt it well yes i suppose it would i said and look im sorry if i said anything to offend you i always kid around and talk a lot whenever im forget it how old are you thirtysix youre forty or so you stated on your loanapplication blank what do you do for a living if you can call it that i said why ask me something she already knew that informations also on the application along with practically everything else about me except the number and location of my dimples you mean you have some i cant see she smiled her voice friendlier almost tender but what i meant to ask was what do you write for this hemisphere foundation studies indepth monographs on this region from various aspects ecological etiological ethological ethnological that sort of thing sometimes one of them is published in hemispheres quarterly reports but they usually go in the fileandforget department mmmhmm she said thoughtfully musingly very interesting i think something could be worked out there something satisfactory to both of us if you could tell me just what you have in mind well ill have to clear it with pat of course but thirtyfive thousand a year thats not what i meant i what i gasped did you say thirtyfive thousand plus expenses and certain fringe benefits thirtyfive thousand i said running a finger around my collar uh how much change do you want back she threw back her head and laughed hugging herself ecstatically ah britt britt she said brushing mirth tears from her eyes everythings going to be wonderful for you ill make it wonderful you funnysweet man now do me a small favor hmm practically anything i said if youll laugh like that again please dont worry about silly things like our bugging system everyone knows we have it were out in the open on that as we are with everything else if someone thinks he can beat it well it isnt as if he hadnt been warned is it i see what you mean i said although i actually didnt i was just being agreeable what happens when someone is caught pulling a fast one well naturally she said we have to remove him from the payroll i see i said again lying again when i said it because of course there are many ways to remove a man from the payroll my immediate concern however as it so often is was me specifically the details of my employment but i was not allowed to inquire into them before i could frame another question she had moved with a kind of unhurried haste with the quick little movements which typified her rising from her chair tucking her purse under her arm gesturing me back when i also started to rise all in one swiftsmooth uninterrupted action stay where you are britt she smiled have a drink or something ill have someone pick you up and drive you home well i settled back into my chair shall i call you tomorrow ill call you pat or i will goodnight now she left the table her tinily full figure with its crown of thick blond hair quickly losing itself in the dining rooms dimness i waited i had another liqueur and more coffee and continued to wait an hour passed a waiter brushed by the table and when he had gone i saw a check lying in front of me i picked it up a nervous lump clotting in my stomach my eyes blurred and i rubbed them at last managing to read the total sixtythree dollars and thirty cents sixtythree dollars and i dont know how you are in such situations but i always feel guilty the mere need to explain that such and such is a mistake et cetera stiffens my smile exaggeratedly and sets me to sweating profusely and causes my voice to go tremulous and shaky so that i not only feel guilty as hell but also look it it is really pretty terrible it is no wonder that i was suspected of the attempted murder of my wife the wonder is that i wasnt lynched albert the maitre d approached as i always do i overexplained apologizing when i should have demanded apologies sweating and shaking and squeakily stammering and acting like nine kinds of a damned fool when i was completely selfdemolished albert cut me off with a knifing gesture of his hand no he said coldly miss aloe did not introduce you to me if she had i would have remembered it and he said no she made no arrangement about the check obviously the check is to be paid by you then he leaned down and forward resting his hands on the table so that his face was only inches from mine and i remember thinking that i had known this was going to happen not exactly this perhaps but something that would clearly expose the vicious potential of pxa a taste of what could happen if i incurred the aloe displeasure for she had said remember that they did not pretend or apologize you were warned you knew exactly what to expect if you deadbeat bastard albert said pay your check or well drag you back in the kitchen and beat the shit out of you i was on an aimless tour of the country when i met my wifetobe connie id gotten together some money through borrowing and peddling the few remaining rainstar valuables so id bought a car and taken off no particular no clear objective in mind i simply didnt like it where i was and i wanted to find a place where i would like it which of course was impossible because the reason i disliked places i was in and the disheartening knowledge was growing on me was my being in them i disliked me me myself and i as kids used to say and far and fast as i ran i could not escape the bastardly trio late one afternoon i strayed off the highway and wound up in a homey little town nestled among rolling green hills i also wound up with a broken spring from a plunge into a deep rut and a broken cylinder and corollary damage from getting out of the rut the towns only garage was the blacksmith shop or to put it another way the blacksmith did auto repairs except for those who could drive a hundredplus miles to the nearest city the blacksmithmechanic quoted a very reasonable price for repairing my car but he would have to send away for parts and what with one thing and another he couldnt promise to have the work done in less than a week there was one small restaurant in the town sharing space with the post office but there was no hotel motel or boarding house the blacksmithmechanic suggested that i check with the real estate dealer to see if some private family would take me in for a few days without much hope i did so the sign on the window read luther bannerman real estate insurance inside a young woman was disinterestedly pecking away at an ancient typewriter with a threerow keyboard she was a little on the scrawny side with mousecolored hair but she laughed wildly when i asked if she was luther bannerman and otherwise endeared herself to me by childish eagerness to be of help smiling and bobbing her head sympathetically as i explained my situation when i had finished however she seemed to draw back a bit becoming cautiously reserved well i just dont know mr britton is it rainstar britt for britton rainstar i was going to say mr oh ill make it britt okay i was just going to say britt were kind of out of the mainstream here and im afraid youd find it hard to keep in touch and carry on your business affairs and she bared her teeth in a smile and so forth and so on i explained that i had no pressing business affairs not a single so forth let alone a so on i was just travelling seeing the country and gathering material for a book i also explained when she raised the question of accommodations for my wife and family that i had none with me or elsewhere and that my needs were solely for myself at this she insisted on pouring me coffee from the pot on a oneburner heater then having made me comfy also nauseous the coffee was lousy she hurried back to a small partitionedoff private office after several minutes of closeddoor conversation she returned with her father luther bannerman of course he and she collectively insisted that i stay at their house of course i accepted their invitation and of course i was in her pants the very first night or rather i was in what was in her pants or to be absolutely accurate she was in my pants she charged into my room as soon as the light went out and i did not resist her despite her considerable resistibility i felt that it was the very least i could do for her although quite a few others had obviously done as much i doubt that they had fought for it either since it simply wasnt the sort of thing for which men do battle frankly if it had been tendered as inspiration for the launching of a thousand ships not a one would have hoisted anchor ah well who am i to kid around about poor connie and her overstretched snatch or to kid about anyone for that matter it is one of fates saddest pranks to imbue the least sexually appetizing of us with the hugest sexual appetites to atone for that joke i feel is the obligation of all who are better endowed and in keeping that obligation i have had many sorrier screws than connie i have received little gratitude for my efforts on the contrary i invariably wind up with a worse fucking than the fucking i got for it is also one of fates jokes to dower superiority complexes on girls with the worst fornicating furniture and they seem to feel justified in figuratively giving you something as bad as they have given you literally of course connies father discovered us in coitus before the week was out and of course i agreed to do the right thing by his little girl which characteristically was the easiest thing for me to do or so it seemed at the time i may struggle a little bit but i almost always do the easiest thing or what seems to be and never is at the time i was born promising was the word for rainstar prospects thus i was placed on the path of least resistance early in life and i remained on it despite my growing awareness that promise was not synonymous with delivery i had gathered too much speed to get off and i could find no better path to be on anyway im sure youve seen people like me if i stumbled over an occasional rock i might curse and kick out at it but only briefly and not very often at all i was so unused to having my course unimpeded that normally i figuratively fell apart when it was it was the only recourse for a man made defenseless by breeding and habit both connie and her father were provoked to find that my prosperousness was exactly one hundred per cent more apparent than real they whined that i had deceived them maintaining that since i was nothing but a welldressed personable bum i should have said so which to me seemed unreasonable after all why do your utmost not to look like a bum if you are going to announce that you are one obviously there were basic philosophical differences between me and the bannermans but they finally seemed resigned to me if not to my way of thinking in fact i was given their rather grim assurance that i would come around to their viewpoint eventually and be much the better man for it meanwhile mr bannerman would not only provide me with a job but would give connie and me iooooo life insurance policies as a wedding present i felt that it was money wasted since connie like all noxious growths had a builtin resistance to scourge and i had grown skilled in the art of selfpreservation having devoted a lifetime to it however it was mr bannermans money and i doubted that it would amount to much since he was in the insurance business as well as real estate so he wrote the policies on connie and me with each of us the beneficiary of the other connies policy was approved mine was rejected not on grounds of health my fatherinlaw advised me my health was excellent for a man wholly unaddicted to healthful hard work the reason for my rejection was not spelled out to mr bannerman but he had a pretty good idea as to its nature and so did i it was a matter of character a man with a decidedly truncated work history me that is who played around whenever he had the money for playing around again me was apt to come to an early end and possibly a bad one or so statistics indicated and the insurance company was not betting a potential double indemnity on my longevity when their own statistics branded me a nono with unusual generosity mr bannerman conceded that there were probably a great many decadent bums in the world and that i was no worse than the worst of them the best course for me was to reapply for the policy after i had proved myself with a few years of steady and diligent employment to this end he hired me as a commission salesman it proved nothing except what i already knew that i was no more qualified to sell than i apparently was for any other gainful occupation i continued to be nagged by papa and daughter bannerman but i was given up on after a few weeks grimly allowed to play around with my typewriter while they other people worked for a living neither would hear of a divorce or the suggestion that i get the hell out of their lives i was to come to my senses and be a man or do something surely i could do something well though the fact was that i couldnt do something the something that i could do did not count as something with them and they were keeping the score thus matters stood at the time of the accident which left me unscathed but almost killed connie i an unemployed bum living on my fatherinlaws bounty was driving the car when the accident happened and while i carried no insurance my wife was heavily insured in my favor o o o dig this character albert the maitre d jerked a thumb at me addressing the circle of onlooking diners these bums are getting fancier every day but this one takes the brass ring what did you say your name was bum rainstar a reassuring hand dropped on my shoulder he said it was and i say it is any other questions oh well certainly not sir a stupid mistake on my part sir and im sure that come on britt lets get out of here we stood waiting for the elevator albert and i and my friend whoever he was albert was begging seemingly almost on the point of tears a terrible mistake believe me gentlemen i cant think how i could have been guilty of it i recall mr rainstar perfectly now everything was exactly as he says but but it slipped your mind you completely forgot exactly so you treated me like any other deadbeat you were just following orders then you do understand sir i understand i said we took the elevator up to the street my friend and i i accompanied him to his car trying to remember who he was knowing that i had had far more than a passing acquaintance with him at one time at last as we passed under a streetlight it came to me mr claggett jeff claggett i wrung his hand how could i ever have forgotten oh well its been a long time he grinned deprecatingly youre looking good britt not exactly a barometer of my true condition i said but how about you still with the university police department detective sergeant he nodded toward the lighted window of a nearby restaurant lets have some coffee and a talk he was in his early sixties a graying squareshouldered man with startlingly blue eyes he had been chief of campus security when my father was on the university faculty i left shortly after your dad did he said the coldblooded way they dumped him was a little more than i could stomach it wasnt very nice i admitted but what else could they do jeff you know how he was drinking there at the last you were always having to bring him home i wish i could have done more i would have drunk more than he did if id had his problems but he brought them all on himself i pointed out he was slandered sure but if hed just ignored it instead of trying to get the unamerican activities committee abolished it would all have been forgotten as it was well whats the use talking not much claggett said not any more i said oh for gods sake it sounded like i was knocking the old man and of course i didnt mean to i didnt mind his drinking per se it was just that it left him vulnerable to being kicked around by people who werent fit to wipe his ass jeff claggett nodded saying that a lot of nominally good people seemed to have a crappy streak in them give them any sort of excuse and they trot it out yeah and theyre virtuous as all hell about it soandso drinks so that cleans the slate they dont even owe him common decency he put down his coffee cup with a bang and signaled for a refill he sipped from it sighed and grimaced tiredly well no use hashing over the past i guess how come you were in that place i got you out of tonight britt through a misunderstanding i said firmly a mistake that isnt going to be repeated yeah he waited a moment well youre smart to steer clear of em we havent been able to hang anything on them but by god we will with my blessings i said you were on official business tonight sort of just letting them know we were on the job well he glanced at his watch and started to rise guess i better run can i drop you someplace i declined with thanks saying that i had a little business to take care of he said well in that case by the way i drove past the old rainstar place a while back britt looks like someone is still living there yes i said i guess someone is in a dump the city garbage dump but his voice trailed away comprehension slowly dawning in his eyes finally he said hang around a minute britt ive got to make a few phone calls and then well have a good talk o o o we sat in claggetts car in the driveway of the rainstar mansion and he frowned in the darkness looking at me curiously i dont see how they can do this to you britt grab your property while youre out of the state well they paid me for it i said around three thousand dollars after the bank loan was paid and they gave me the privilege of staying in the house as long as i want to oh shit claggett snorted angrily how long is that going to be youve been swindled britt but you sure as hell dont have to hold still for it i dont know i said i dont see that theres much i can do about it of course theres something you can do this place was deeded taxfree to the rainstars in perpetuity in recognition of the thousands of acres the family had given to the state its not subject to mortgage or the laws of eminent domain why ill tell you britt you go into court with this deal and i listened to him without really listening there was nothing he could tell me that i hadnt told myself id argued it all out with myself visualizing the newspaper stories the courtroom scenes the endless questions and id said to hell with it i knew myself and i knew i couldnt do it for any amount of money i cant do it jeff i cut in on him at last i dont want to go into the details but i have a wife in another state an invalid wife i was suspected of trying to kill her i didnt of course but of course you didnt jeff said warmly murder just isnt in you anyway you wouldnt be here if there was any real case against you the case is still open i said im not so sure im in the clear yet at any rate the story would be bound to come out if i made waves over this condemnation deal so im not making any i the family and i have had nothing but trouble as far back as i remember i dont want any more no one wants trouble dammit claggett scowled but you dont avoid it by turning your back on it the more you run the more you have chasing you im sure youre right i said but just the same your father would fight britt he did fight they didnt get away with piling garbage on him they didnt i said well well we said goodnight he drove off gravel spinning angrily from the wheels of his car i entered the house catching up the phone on its first ring i said hello putting a lot of ice into the word i started to say a lot more believing that the caller was manuela aloe but fortunately i didnt fortunately since the call was from connie my wife britt where have you been out trying to make some money i said i wasnt successful but im still trying she said that she certainly hoped so all her terrible expenses were awfully hard on her daddy and it did seem like a grown healthy man like me with a good education should be able to do a little something if you could just send me a little money britt just a teensyweensy bit goddammit i yelled whats with this teensyweensy crap i send you practically everything i get from the foundation and you know i do because you wrote them and found out how much they pay me you had to embarrass me like a goddamned twobit shyster she began to cry she said it wasnt her fault that she was crippled and that she was worried out of her mind about money i should just be in the fix she was in for a while and see how i liked it and so forth and so on ad infinitum ad nauseum and i apologized and apologized and apologized and i swore that i would somehow someway get more money to her than i had been sending and then i apologized three or four hundred additional times and at last when i was hoarse from apologies and promises she wished me sweet dreams and hung up sweet dreams i was so soaked with sweat that you would have thought id had a wet dream which was not the kind of dream one had about connie mrs olmstead set breakfast before me the next morning remarking doubtless by way of whetting my appetite that we would probably have rat dew in the food before long i seen some chasin around the backyard yesterday so theyll be in the house next cant be this close to a garbage dump without havin rats i see i said absently well well face the problem when it comes time tface it now she asserted be too late when the rats is facin us i closed my ears to her gabbling finishing what little breakfast i was able to eat as i left the table mrs olmstead handed me a letter to mail when i went to town if i didnt mind o course but i was going to work at home today i said i hadnt really planned on going to town how come youre all fixed up then she demanded you dont never fix yourself up unless youre going somewheres i promised to mail the letter if and when i tucked it into my pocket as i went into the living room noting that it was addressed to the oldage pension bureau more than a year ago her monthly check had been three dollars short by her calculations that is she had been writing them ever since sometimes three times a week demanding reimbursement i had pointed out that she had spent far more than three dollars in postage but she still stubbornly persisted without any notion of actually working i went into the small room at one time a serving pantry which does duty as my study i sat down at my typewriter wrote a few exercise sentences and various versions of my name after about thirty minutes of such fiddling around i jumped up and fled to my bedroom fretfully examined myself in the warped fulllength mirror and i thought all dressed up and no place to go there would be no call from pxa if there was one i couldnt respond to it not after the ordeal i had been put through last night no one who was serious about giving me worthwhile employment would have done such a thing to me and it had to have been done deliberately an outfit as cruelly efficient as pxa didnt allow things like that to come about accidentally i closed my eyes clenched my mind to the incident unable to live through it again even in memory wondering why it was that i seemed constantly called upon to face things that i couldnt i went back down to my study but not to my typewriter for what was there to write who would want anything written by me i sat down on a small loveseat a spiny tuft of horsehair burst through the upholstery and stabbed me in the butt something that seemed to typify the hysterically hilarious tragedy of my life i was pining away of a broken heart or something but instead of being allowed a little dignity and gravity i got my ass tickled determinedly i stayed where i was and as i was bent forward with my head in my hands sourly resisting the urge to squirm or snicker poor lo poor lo i chuckled wryly poking fun at myself well screw it i said they may kill me but they cant eat me there was a light patter of applause hand clapping i sat up startled and manuela aloe laughed and sat down at my side im sorry she said i spoke to you a couple of times but you didnt hear me b but but i began to get hold of myself what are you doing here your housekeeper showed me in i came out here because i was afraid you wouldnt come to the office after the terrible time you must have had last night you were right i said i wouldnt have gone down to your office and there really wasnt much point to your coming out here i did send a car to pick you up last night britt i dont blame you for being angry but i did do it whatever you say i said i dont know what happened to the driver no ones seen him since our people arent ordinarily so irresponsible but its not unheard of but anyway i am sorry so much for the driver i said now what about albert albert she grimaced i dont know whether it was booze or dope or just plain stupidity that made him do what he did i dont care either but hes out of a job as of this morning and hell be a long time in getting another one she nodded to me earnestly the dark eyes warm with concern i hesitated wanting to swallow my pride how could i afford pride remembering connies demands for money there was something else i said something that came to me when i was outside your office yesterday yes she smiled encouragingly what was that britt i hesitated again trying to find some amiable euphemism for what was virtually an accusation and finding excuses instead after all her office would logically have sound equipment in it devices for auditing the tapes and why when i was so strongly drawn to this girl and when i needed money so badly should i continue to squeeze her for apologies and explanations yes britt nothing i said no i mean it thinking it over i seem to have found the answer to my own question that wasnt true aside from the womans being slapped there was something else the fact that pxa had milked me for all kinds of personal information as a condition for granting my loan my likes and dislikes my habits and weaknesses information that could be used to drive me up a figurative wall should they take the notion but i meant to give them no cause to take such a notion and i am an incurable optimist always hoping for the best despite the many times i have gotten the worst manny was studying me her dark eyes boring into mine seemingly boring into my mind and a sudden shadow blighted the room and i was chilled with a sickening sense of premonition then she laughed gaily gave herself a little shake and assumed a businesslike manner well now she said briskly ive had a long talk with uncle pat and hes left everything to me so how about a series of pamphlets on the kind of subjects you deal with for the foundation it sounds fine i said just well fine the pamphlets will be distributed free to schools libraries and other institutions they wont carry any advertising just a line to the effect that they are sponsored by pxa as a public service i said that was fine too just fine she opened her blond leather purse took out a check and handed it to me a check for thirtyfive hundred dollars approximately twentynine hundred for the first months work with the rest for expenses well she looked at me pertly all right any questions i let out a deep breath my god i breathed fervently of course its all right and no no questions she smiled and stood up a lushly diminutive figure in her fawncolored pantsuit her breasts and her bottom bulged deliciously against the material seemed to strain for release and i thought thoughts that brought a flush to my face come on she wiggled her fingers show me around hmm ive heard so much about this place im dying to see it im afraid its not much to see any more i said but if youre really interested in ruins i showed her through the house or much of it she murmured appreciatively over the decaying evidence of past grandeur and regretfully at the ravages of time we finished our tour of the house and manny again became businesslike well have a lot of conferring to do to get this project operating britt do you want an office or will you work here here if its agreeable to you i said i have a great deal of research material here and im used to the place of course if its inconvenient for you oh well work it out she promised now if youll drive me back to town the car she had driven out in was mine she explained pointing to the gleaming new vehicle which stood in the driveway obviously i would need a car and pxa owed me one and she did hope i wouldnt be stuffy about it i said i never got stuffy over girls or single cars only fleets of them and not always then manny laughed and gave me a playful punch on the arm silly now come on will you we have a lot to do today we did have a lot to do as it turned out at least we did a lot far more than i anticipated but thats getting ahead of the story to take events in their proper order i drove into town manny sitting carelessly close to me i deposited the check in my bank drew some cash and returned to the car my car it was lunchtime by then so we lunched and talked i talked mostly since i have a knack for talk if little else and manny seemed to enjoy listening to me we came out of the restaurant into midafternoon and talking i drove around until sunset by which time needless to say it was time for a drink we had it rather we had them and eventually we had dinner when twilight fell we were far out on the outskirts of town parked by the lake which formed the bulwark of the citys water system mannys legs were tucked up in the seat her head rested on my shoulder and my arm was around her it was really a very nice way to be britt she murmured breaking the drowsy comfortable silence ive enjoyed myself so much today i think its been the very best day in my life youre a thief manuela aloe i said youve stolen the very speech i was going to make tell me something britt how does anyone as nice as you are as attractive and intelligent and bubbling over with charm how does he why does he wind up as i have i said because i never found a sellers market for those things until i met you it was a pretty blunt thing to say she sat up with a start glaring at me coldly but i smiled at her determinedly and said i meant no offense but lets face it manny the rainstar name isnt worth much any more and my talent never was so the good looks and the charm etcetera is what ive sold isnt it no it isnt she snapped and then hesitating biting her lip well not entirely you wouldnt have got the job if you hadnt been like you are but neither would you have got it if you hadnt been qualified so it was half one half the other i said and whats wrong with fiftyfifty nothing and dont you act like there is either not even a little bit no all right i wont i said providing you smile real pretty for me and then lie down with your head in my lap she did so although the smile was just a trifle weak i bent down and kissed her gently and was kissed in return i put a hand on her breast gave it a gentle squeeze she shivered delicately eyes clouding im not an easy lay britt i dont sleep around what am i to do with you manny i said you are now twice a thief i guess ive been waiting for you it had to be someone like you and there wasnt anyone like that but you i know i said i also have been waiting you can see why i said it why i just about had to say it she was my munificent benefactor and she was gorgeous beyond my wildest dreams and she obviously wanted to and needed to be screwed so what the hell else could i do britt she wiggled restlessly i have a livein maid at my apartment unfortunate i said my housekeeper also lives in well well britt dear well i know of a place i broke off carefully amended the statement i mean ive heard of one its nothing fancy i understand no private baths or similar niceties but its clean and comfortable and safe or so im reliably told well she said well i said she didnt say anything simply reached out and turned on the ignition more than a month went by before i met patrick xavier aloe it was at a party at his house and manny and i went to it together judging by his voice the one telephone conversation i had had with him i supposed him to be a towering giant of a man but while he was broad shouldered and powerfullooking he was little taller than manny glad to finally meet up with you britt baby he beamed at me out of his broad darkly irish face what have you got under your arm there one of mannys pizzas he has the complete manuscript of a pamphlet manny said proudly and its darned good too it is huh what dya say britt is she telling the truth or not well i hesitated modestly im sure theres room for improvement but well see well see he broke in laughing you two grab a drink and come on we followed him through the small crowd of guests all polite and respectableappearing but perhaps a little on the watchful side we went into the library and pat aloe waved us to chairs then sat down behind the desk carefully removed my manuscript from its envelope and began to read he read rapidly but intently with no skimming or skipping i could tell that by his occasional questions in fact he was so long in reading that manny asked crossly if he was trying to memorize the script adding that we didnt have the whole goddamned evening to spend at his stupid house pat aloe told her mildly to shut her goddamned mouth and went back to his reading i had long since become used to mannys occasionally salty talk and learned that i was not privileged to respond in kind but pat clearly was not taking orders from her despite his air of easygoing geniality he was very much in command of aloe activities and i was to find he tolerated no violation of his authority when he had finished the last page of my manuscript he put it with the others and returned them all to their envelope then he removed his reading glasses thoughtfully massaged the bridge of his nose and at last turned to me with a sober nod youre a good man britt its a good job thank you i said thank you very much manny said words were cheap how about a bonus for me but pat winked at her and waved her to silence yknow britt i thought this deal would turn out the same kind of frammis that mannys husband pulled banging the bjesus out of her and pissing off the work but im glad to admit i was wrong youre a ok baby and ill swear to it on a stack of bibles fortunately i didnt have to acknowledge the compliment such as it was since manny had begun cursing him luridly with his overripe appraisal of her late husband pats booming laugh drowned out her protest aint she a terror though britt just like the rest of her family when she had a family her folks didnt speak to mine for years just because my pop married an irisher just dont you forget that bonus manny said you do and itll be your big red ass hell take care of it yourself pat said make her come across heavy britt baby hear me i mumbled that i would do it grinning stiffly feeling awkward and embarrassed to a degree i had never known before he walked out of the library between the two of us a hand on each of our shoulders then when we were at the door and had said our goodnight he laughingly roared that he expected me to collect heavy loot from manny make her mind britt s only kind of wife to have tell her you wont marry her until she comes through with your bonus marry her marry her well what did i expect i tottered out of the house with manny clinging possessively to my arm and there was a coldish lump in my throat a numbing chill in my spine we got in the car and i drove away manny looked at me speculatively and asked why i was so quiet and i said i wasnt being quiet and then i said what was wrong with being quiet did i have to talk every damned minute to keep her happy ordinarily poppingoff to her like that would have gotten me a chewing out or maybe a sharp slap but tonight she said soothingly that of course i could be silent whenever i chose because whatever i chose was also her choice after all were a team darling not two people but a couple maybe we have out little spats but there cant be any serious division between us i groaned i said oh my god manny oh mary and jesus and his brother james whats the matter britt isnt that the way you feel what i felt was that i was about to do something wholly irrelevant and unconstructive like soiling my clothes for i was being edged closer and closer to the impossible i mumbled something indistinguishable something noncommittally agreeable because i knew now that i had to keep talking only in talk light talk lay safety luckily manny indirectly threw me a cue by pushing the stole back from her shoulders and stretching her legs out in front of her an action which tantalizingly exhibited her gold lame evening gown very short very low cut very tightseeming on her small ultrafull body it looks like it was painted on you i said how in the world did you get into it maybe youll find out giving me a look after all you have to take it off of me we shall see i said desperate for words for any kind of light talk we shall certainly see about this well hurry up for gosh sake ive got to pee oh my god i said why didnt you go before we left the house because i needed help with my dress darn it i got her to the place the place that had become our place i got her up to the room and out of her clothes and onto the sink with no time to spare either she cut loose and continued to let go at length sighing happily with the simple pleasure of relieving herself she was such an earthy little thing and i suppose few things are as good as a good leak when one has held it to the bursting point when she had finished she reached a towel from the rack and handed it to me wipe please wipe what i said you know what and where it is too i will if youll promise to give me a tip talking talking even after we were in bed and she was pressed tightly against me in epigrammatic surgings o o o what kind of tip are you giving me guess something very soft and very firm mmm possessing an elastic quality mmm almost painfully but wonderfully tight mmm selflubricating mmm mmm now what in the world could it be i was physically ill by the time i got home that night sick with fear that the subject of marriage would be raised again that it would be tossed to me like a ball and that i would not be allowed to bat it aside or let it drop repeatedly staggered out of my bed and went to the bathroom over and over i went down on my knees and vomited into the bowl gagging up the bile of fear as i shivered and sweated with its burning chill i tried to blame it on an overactive imagination but i couldnt lie to myself id lied once too often when i lied to manny about the one thing i should never have lied about and the fact that the lie was one of omission rather than commission and that lying was more or less a way of life with me would not lift me off the hook a fraction of an inch not with manuela aloe she would regard my lie as inexcusable as of course it was in saying that i was unmarried on my pxa loan application i hadnt meant to harm anyone it was just a way of avoiding troublesome questions re the status of my marriage were my wife and i living together and if not why not and so on but i knew that manny depended on that application for her information about me and i could have and should have set her straight for i knew must have known that i was not being treated with such extravagant generosity to buy manny a passing relationship she wanted a husband one with good looks good breeding and a good name the kind not easily found in her world or any world then she had found me and ohsoclearly demonstrated the advantages of marriage to her and i tacitly had agreed to the marriage she had been completely honest with me and i had been just as completely dishonest with her and now by god now but a man can be afraid just so much when he reaches that limit he can fear no more and so at last my pajamas wet with cold sweat i returned to bed and fell into restless sleep in the morning mrs olmstead brought me toast and coffee and asked suspiciously if i had mailed a letter she had given me yesterday i said that i had for she was always giving me letters to mail and i always remembered to mail or almost always she nagged me with increasing vehemence about the imminent peril of rats and i swore i would do something about them too and mumbling and grumbling she at last left me alone i lay back down and closed my eyes and manny came into my room a deceptive smile on her lovely face for naturally although she had learned that i was married she showed no sign of displeasure but its all right darling and i understand perfectly you needed the money and you were dying to sleep with me and here have a drink of this nice coffee i fixed for you no its poisoned and yahh oh im so sorry dear i wouldnt have spilled it on you for the world let me just wipe it off yeeow youre scratching my eyes out get away go away my eyes snapped open i sat up with a start mrs olmstead was bent over me my goodness goodness me she exclaimed whats the matter mr rainstar nothing mustve been having a nightmare i said sheepishly was i making a lot of racket were you ever sounded like you was scared to death shaking her head grumpily she turned toward the door oh yeah your girlfriend wants you what i said reckon shes your girlfriend the way youre always pawing at each other but you mean miss aloe i stammered shes here course shes not here dont see her do you she gestured exasperatedly answer the phone afore she hangs up i threw on a robe and ran downstairs i grabbed up the phone and said hello boo you pretty man manny laughed teasingly whats the matter with you anyway matter i said uh what makes you think anythings the matter i thought you sounded gruff and strained but never mind i want to see you be at our place in about an hour okay i swallowed heavily had she decided that something was wrong that i was hiding something britt why i said what did you want to see me about what i could almost see her frown what did i want to see you about i apologized hastily i said id just gone to sleep after tossing and turning all night and i seemed to be coming down with the flu id love to see you manny child but i think it would be bad for you the way im feeling the farther you keep away from me the better she said oh disappointedly but agreed that it was probably best not to see me she was leaving town for a couple of weeks some business for uncle pat naturally she would have liked a session with me before departing but since i seemed to be coming down with something and it wouldnt do for her to catch it you just take care of yourself britt get to feeling hale and hearty again because youll have to be when i get back ill look forward to it i said have a good trip baby and britt i put a twothousanddollar bonus check in the mail to you oh thats too much i said im really overpaid as it is and you just shut up she said sternly then laughed bye now darling i gotta run bye to you i said and we hung up i had sent connie three thousand dollars out of my first pxa check and another three out of the second explaining that id gotten on to something good though probably temporary and that id send her all i could as long as it lasted after all i hadnt sent much before lacking much to send and it was sort of a conscience salve for my affair with manny when my bonus arrived i mailed connie a check for the full two thousand then after waiting a few days until i was sure she had got it i called her britt rainstar stupe de luxe figured that getting so much scratch seven grand in less than two months would put her in a fine mood bonehead britt sometimes known as the peabrain pollyanna reasoned that all that loot would buy reasonableness and tolerance from connie which just goes to show you yessir that shows you and it shows something about him too for she was verbally leaping all over me almost before i had asked her how she was feeling i want to know where you got that money britt i want to know how much more you got a full and complete accounting as daddy says and dont tell me that you got it from hemisphere because weve already talked to them and they said you didnt they said that you had severed your association with them so you tell me where youre getting the money and exactly how much youre getting or by golly youll wish you had i see i said numbly surprised though god knows i should not have been i was always surprised when being stupid that people thought i was stupid i think i really see for the first time namely that you and your daddy are a couple of miserable piles of shit who from and how much i either find out from you mister britton rainstar or what what did you say to me never mind i said i tell you the source of the money and you check to see if im telling the truth as to the quantity that is thats your plan isnt it well she hesitated but i have a right to know im your wife do you and are you i said a wife usually trusts her husband when he treats her as generously as ive been treating you well all right she said at last grudgingly defensive i certainly dont want to make you lose your job and and well hemisphere had no right to get huffy about it anyway just look at what you did to me i didnt do anything to you connie it was an accident well anyway she said just the same i didnt say anything simply waited after a long silence i heard her take a deep breath and she spoke with an incipient sob i ssuppose you want a divorce now you wouldnt talk to me this way if you didnt divorce makes sense connie youll get just as much money as if we were married and i know you cant feel any great love for me then you do want a divorce yes its the best thing for both of us and well you just try and get one she yelled ill have you in jail for attempted murder so fast itll make your head swim you arranged that accident that almost killed me and the case isnt closed yet theyre ready to reopen it any time daddy and i say the word and golly you try and get a divorce and by gosh connie i said you surely cant mean that youll see youll see if i dont just let me hear one more word out of you about a divorce and and ill show you whos a pile of shit she slammed up the phone completing any damage to my eardrum that had not been accomplished by her banshee scream of course id hardly expected her to bedeck me with a crown of olive leaves or to release a covey of white doves to flutter about my head but a threat to have me prosecuted for attempted murder was considerably much more than i had expected at any rate a divorce was impossible unless she agreed to it which mean that it was impossible period which meant that i could not marry manny which meant she manny was back in town two weeks later and she called me immediately upon her arrival she suggested that i pick her up at the airport and go immediately to our place i suggested that we have dinner and talk before we did anything else so a little puzzled and reluctant she agreed to that the restaurant was near the lake i have mentioned earlier the city waterworks lake there was only a handful of patrons in it this early evening hour and they gradually drifted out as i talked to manny apologizing and explaining explaining the inexplicable and apologizing for the inexcusable manny said not a word throughout my recital merely stared at me expressionlessly over her untouched dinner at last i had nothing more to say if i had ever had anything to say and then finally she spoke pulling a fringedsilk shawl around her shoulders and rising to her feet pay the check and get out of here what oh well sure i said dropping bills on the table as i also stood up and manny i want you to know that get march yourself out to the car we got out of the restaurant with manny clinging to my arm virtually propelling me by it she helped me into the car instead of vice versa then she got in into the rear sitting immediately behind me i heard her purse snap open she said ive got a gun on you britt so you get out of line just a little bit and you wont like what happens to you mmanny i quavered pplease dont do you know where i went while i was out of town nno do you want to know what i did uh nno i said i dont think i do start driving you know where but you mean our place wwhy do you want to drive i drove we reached the place she made me walk ahead of her inside and up the stairs and into our room i heard the click of the door lock and then manny asked if id heard a woman being slapped on the first day i went to her office i said that i had or rather a recording of same i had grown calmer by now with a sense of fatalism you heard her britt she left the office by my private elevator i nodded without turning around you wanted me to hear her it was arranged like the scene with albert after youd left that night i was being warned that id better fly straight or else you admit you were warned then yes i tried to kid myself that it was all an unfortunate accident but i knew better but you went right ahead and deceived and cheated me did you really think id let you get away with it i shook my head miserably said i wanted to make things right insofar as i could id give the car back and what little money i had left and id sell everything i owned clothes typewriter books everything to raise the rest anything she or pxa had given me id give back and and what about all the screwing i gave you i suppose youll give that back too no i said im afraid i cant do anything about that oh sure you can she said you can give me a good one right now and i whirled around and she collapsed in my arms laughing ahhh britt darling if you could have seen your face you were really frightened werent you you really thought i was angry with you didnt you of course i thought it i said and hugging her kissing her i swatted her bottom my god the way you were talking and waving that gun around gun look no gun she held her purse open for examination i couldnt be angry with you britt what reason would i have you were married and you couldnt get unmarried but you just about had to have the job and you wanted me so you did the only thing you could i understand perfectly and dont you give it another thought because nothing is changed well go on just like we were and everythings all right it was hard to believe that things would be all right knowing her as well as i did i didnt see how they could be as the weeks passed however my suspicions were lulled almost almost leaving me for there was nothing whatsoever to justify them i even found the courage to criticize her about her language pointing out that it was hardly suitable to one with two college degrees i cant say that it changed anything but she acknowledged the criticism with seeming humility and solemnly promised to mend her ways so everything was all right ostensibly the work went on and went well ditto for my relationship with manny no one could have been more loving or understanding certainly no one no other woman had ever been as exciting over and over i told myself how lucky i was to have such a woman a wildly sensuous highly intelligent woman who also had money and was generous with it thus freeing me from the niggling and nagging and guilt feelings which had heretofore hindered and inhibited me it is a fallacy that people who do not obtain the finer things in life have no appreciation for them actually no one likes good things more than a bum and i say this knowing whereof i speak i truly appreciated manny after all the sorry baxes which had previously been my lot i truly appreciated everything she gave me all the creature comforts she made possible for me in addition to herself everything wasnt just all right as she had promised hell everything was beautiful until today the day of the dog o o o i lay on my back bracing myself against any movement which would cause him to attack i ached hideously then grew numb from lack of movement and shadows fell on the blinded windows it was late afternoon the sun was going down and now my legs jerked convulsively they jerked again even as i was trying to brace them and now i heard a faint rustling sound the dog tensing himself getting ready to spring ddont please dont laughter vicious maliciously amused laughter i rubbed my eyes with a trembling hand brushed the blinding sweat from them the dog was gone the manager of the place the mulatto woman stood at the foot of the bed she jerked a thumb over her shoulder in a contemptuous gesture of dismissal all right prick beat it wwhat i sat up shakily what did you say get out grab your rags and drag ass now listen you you cant i cant what nothing i said if youll just leave so that i can get dressed she said id get dressed while she was there by god because she wanted to look at the bed before i left she figured a yellow bastard like me had probably shit in it jus so damned scared she jeered probly shit the bed like a fucking baby you did im gonna make you clean it up i got dressed with her watching i waited head hanging like a whipped animal while she jerked the sheets back examined them and then sniffed them okay she said at last reckon you got all your shit in you still full of it like always i turned and started for the door dont you never come back hear i see your skinny ass again i lays a belt on it i got out of the place so fast that i fell rather than walked down the stairs almost crashed through the street door in attempting to open it the wrong way after the dog i had thought nothing more could be done to me that i was as demoralized as a man could get but i was wrong the vicious abuse of the mulatto woman had shaken me in a way that fear could not or perhaps it was the fear and the abuse together i drove blindly for several minutes oblivious to the hysterical hornblasts of other cars the outraged shouts of their drivers and the squealing of brakes finally however when i barely escaped a headon collision with a truck i managed to pull myself together sufficiently to turn into the curb and park i was on an unfamiliar street one that i could not remember i was stopped in front of a small cocktail lounge wiping my face and hands dry of sweat i combed my hair and went inside yes sir the bartender beamed in greeting pushing a bowl of pretzels toward me whatll it be sir i think ill have a i broke off at the sudden insistent jangling from a rear telephone booth the bartender nodded toward it apologetically and said if youll excuse me sir and i told him to go ahead he hurried from behind the bar and back to the booth he entered and closed the door he remained inside for some two or three minutes then he came back again stood in front of me yes sir a martini i said very dry twist instead of olive he mixed the drink poured it with a flourish he punched the numbers on the tabulating cash register extended a check as he placed the glass before me onefifty sir you pay now well i hesitated shrugged why not i handed him two dollar bills he said exact change sir and he picked up the drink and threw it in my face he was a lucky man as i have said my general easygoing attitude an ahtohellwithit attitude is marred by an occasional brief but violent flareup and if i had not been so completely beaten down by the dog and the mulatto woman he would have gotten a broken arm but of course he had known i had nothing to strike back with manny or the person who had made the call for her had convinced him of the fact convinced him that he could pick up a nice piece of change without the slightest danger to himself i ran a sleeve across my face i got up from my stool turned and started to leave then i stopped and turned back around gave the bartender a long hard stare i wasnt capable of punching him but there was something that i could do i could make sure that there was a connection between the thrown drink and the afternoons other unpleasantries that briefly his action was motivated and not mere coincidence well his eyes flickered nervously want somethin people shouldnt tell you to do things i said that theyre afraid to do themselves huh whatre you drivin at you mean that was your own idea you werent paid to do it do what i dont know what youre talkin about all right i said ill tell some friends of mine what a nice guy you are i nodded coldly again turned toward the door wait he said wait a minute uh sir it was a joke see just a joke i wasnt sposed ttell ya an i cant tell ya nothin else i just cant but but its all right i said you dont need to i left the bar i drove home i parked in the driveway near the porch another car wheeled up behind mine and manny got out smiling gaily as she came trotting up to me and hooked an arm through mine guess what ive got for you darling give you three guesses a cobra i said and two stink bombs silly lets go inside and ill show you lets i said grimly and ill show you we went up the steps and across the porch manny hugging my arm smiling up into my face the very picture of a woman with her love mrs olmstead heard us enter the house and hurried in from the kitchen my my she chortled beaming at manny i swear you get prettier every day miss aloe oh now manny laughed i couldnt look half as nice as your dinner smells were you inviting me to stay i hope course im inviting you you betcha mrs olmstead nodded vigorously you an mr rainstar just set yourselves right down an im not sure ill be here for dinner i said i suspect that miss aloe wont be either please come upstairs manuela but looky here now mrs olmstead protested how come you aint eatin dinner how come you let me go to all the trouble o fixin it if you wasnt going to eat ill explain later kindly get up those stairs manuela i pointed sternly manny preceded me up the stairs and i stood aside waving her into my bedroom ahead of me then i closed and locked the door i was trembling a little shaking with the days pentup fear and frustration its fury and worry inwardly i screamed to strike out at something the most tempting target being mannys plump little bottom so i wheeled around my palm literally itching to connect with her flesh but instead mannys soft mouth connected with mine she had been waiting on tiptoe waiting for me to turn and now having kissed me soundly she urged me down on the bed and sat down at my side i dont blame you for being miffed with me honey but i really couldnt help it i honestly couldnt britt you couldnt hmm i said you own the place and that orangecolored bitch works for you but you couldnt whaat she stared at me incredulously own it our place you mean why thats crazy of course i dont own it and that woman certainly does not work for me but dammit to hell wait a minute i said what did you mean when you said you didnt blame me for being miffed with you well i thought that was why you were angry because i didnt come back from the bathroom oh i said oh yeah why didnt you anyway because i couldnt thats why i had a little problem one of those girl things and it had to be taken care of in a hurry so shed hailed a cab and headed for the nearest drugstore but it didnt have what she needed and shed had to visit two other stores before she found one that did and by the time shed returned to our place and taken care of the problem you might have waited britt if youd only waited and given me a chance to explain but never mind she took a threethousanddollar check from her purse and handed it to me another bonus for you dear she smiled placatingly isnt that nice very i said folding it and tucking it in my pocket im going to keep it keep it why of course you are i im keeping the car too i said why not its your car but my employment with pxa is finished as of right now and if you want to know why as if you didnt already know ill tell you i said and if i catch any more crap like i caught today ill tell you what ill do about that too i told her in detail the why and the what with suitable embellishments and flourishes i told her in more detail than i had planned and with considerable ornamentation for a while she heard me out in silence and without change of expression i had a strong hunch that she was laughing at me when i had at last finished out of breath and vituperation she looked at me silently for several moments then she shrugged and stood up ill run along now goodbye and good luck i hadnt expected that i dont know what i had expected but not that well look i said arent you going to say anything i said goodbye and good luck i see no point in saying anything else but dammit well all right i said goodbye and good luck to you and take your stinking bonus check with you i thrust it on her shoved it into her hand and folded her fingers around it she left the room and i hesitated feeling foolish and helpless that i had made a botch of everything then i started after her stopping short as i heard her talking with mrs olmstead loved to have dinner with you mrs olmstead but in view of mr rainstars attitude just mean he is accused me of bein sloppy says im always sprinklin rat poison on everything course i dont do nothin of the kind he should be grateful to you most women would leave at the sight of a rat well just a minute miss aloe ill walk you to your car it was several minutes before mrs olmstead came back into the house i waited until i heard her banging around in the kitchen then went cautiously down the stairs and moved on tiptoe toward the front door uhhah her voice arrested me whatcha sneakin out for ashamed because you was so nasty to miss aloe she had been lurking at the side of the staircase out of sight from upstairs apparently she had rushed in and hidden here after making the racket in the kitchen well she grinned at me with mocking accusation hands on her skinny old hips whatcha got to say for yourself what am i sneaking out for i said what have i got to say for myself why goddammit i stormed toward the door cursing and fuming more shamed and furious at myself than i was with her and another thing i yelled another thing mrs olmstead youd better remember what your position is in this house if you want to keep it now youre threatenin me she began to sob noisily threatenin a poor old woman just as mean as you can be thats what you are im not either mean i said i dont know how to be mean and i wouldnt be if i did know how i dont like mean people and goddammit will you stop that goddam bawling if you wasnt mean you wouldnt always forget to mail my letters i found another one this mornin when i was sending your clothes to the cleaners i told you it was real important an oh god i am sorry i said please forgive me mrs olmstead i ran out the door and down the steps but she was calling to me before i could get out of earshot your dinner mr rainstar its all ready and waiting thank you very much i said im not hungry now but ill eat some later itll be all cold you better eat now im not hungry now ive had a bad day and i want to take a walk before i eat there was more argument much more but she finally slammed the door not that i ever felt much like eating mrs olmsteads cooking but i certainly had no appetite for it tonight and of course i felt guilty for not wanting to eat and having to tell her that i didnt regardless of whether something is my fault and why should i have to eat if i didnt want to i always feel that i am in the wrong along with feeling guilty i was worried about what manny had done or had arranged to have done its implications of shrewdness and power and the fact that i had figuratively flung three thousand dollars in her face as well as cutting myself off from all further income at the time i had felt that i had to do it but what about the other categorical imperative which faced me what about the absolute necessity to send money to connie to do it or else well balls to it i thought mentally throwing up my hands i had told mrs olmstead that i wanted to take a walk so i had better be doing it i took a stroll up and down the road a matter of a hundred yards or so then i walked around to the rear of the house and the weedgrown disarray of the backyard a couple of uprights of the gazebo had rotted away allowing the roof to topple until it was standing almost on edge the striped awning of the lawn swing hung in faded tatters and the seats of the swing lay splintered in the weeds where the wind had tossed them the statuary the little that hadnt been sold was now merely fragmented trash gleaming whitely in the night the fountain at the extreme rear of the yard had long since ceased to spout but in the days when water poured from it the everthirsting weeds and other rank growths had flourished into a minuscule jungle and the jungle still endured all but obscuring the elaborate masonry and piping of the fountain i walked toward it absently somehow reminded of goldsmiths the deserted village reaching the periphery of the ugly overgrowth i thought i heard the gurgling trickle of water and curiously i parted the dank and dying tangle with my hands and peered through the opening inches from my face eyeless eyes peered back at me the bleached skull of skeleton we stared at each other each seemingly frozen in shock then the skeleton raised a bony hand and levelled a gun at me i suddenly came alive i let out a yell and flung myself to one side the overgrowth closed in front of the skeleton with my letting go of it and as he pawed through it i scrambled around to the rear of the fountain there was cover that way a shield from my frightful pursuer but that way was also a trap the skeleton was between me and the house looming behind me in the moonlit dimness was the labyrinthine mass the twisting hills and valleys of the garbage dump i reached toward it knowing that it was a bad move that i was running away from possible help but i continued to run running fleeing was a way of life with me buying temporary safety regardless of its longterm cost nearing the immediate environs of the garbage mounds i began to trip and stumble over discarded bottles and cans and other refuse once my foot came down hard on a huge rat and he leaped at me screaming with pain and rage once when i fell a rat scampered inside of my coat clawing and scratching as he raced over my chest and back and i screamed and beat at myself long after i was rid of him there was a deafening roar in my ears the thunder of my overexerted heart and lungs i began to weep and sob wildly in fearcrazed hysteria but the sound of it was lost to me i crawledclawedclimbed up a small mountain of refuse and fell tumbling and stumbling down the other side broken bottles and rotting newspapers and stinking blobs of food came down on top of me along with the hideously bloated body of a dead rat and i swarmed up out of the mess and continued my staggering wobblelegged run i ran down the littered lanes between the garbage hillocks i ran back up the lanes up down down up zigzagging repeatedly falling and getting to my feet and going on and on and on fleeing through this lonely stinking planet this lost world of garbage i dared not stop for i was pursued and my pursuer was gaining on me getting closer and closer with every passing moment thoroughly in the thrall of hysteria i couldnt actually see or hear him not in the literal meaning of the words it was more a matter of being made aware of certain things of having them thrust upon my consciousness a discarded bottle rolling down a garbage heap or a heavy shadow falling over my own or hurrying footsteps splashing up a spray of filth at last i tottered to the top of a long hummock and down the other side and there he it was grabbing me from behind wrapping strong arms around me and holding me helpless i screamed screams that i could not hear i struggled violently fear giving me superhuman strength and i managed to break free but for only a split second then an arm went around my head holding it motionless a target and then a heavy fist came up swung in a short swift arc and collided numbingly with my chin and i went down down down into darkness at the time of the accident connie and i had been married about six months i had been at work all day on an article for a teachers magazine and i came down into the kitchen that evening tired and hungry to find connie clearing away the dirty dishes she said she and her father had already eaten and hed gone back to his office she said there were some people in this world who had to work for a living even if i didnt know it ive been working i said ive almost finished my article never mind she said do you want some pancakes or something there isnt any of the stew left im sorry i didnt hear you call me for dinner i would have been glad to join you will you kindly tell me whether you want something to eat she yelled im worn out and i dont feel like arguing its just been work work work from the time i got up this morning cooking and sewing and cleaning and and i even washed the car on top of everything else i said that she should never wash a car on top of anything let alone everything then i said sorry i would have washed the car i told you i would she said oh sure a lot i would do just look at you you cant even shine your shoes you dont see my daddy going around without his shoes shined and he works i looked at her the spitefully glaring eyes the shrewish thrust of her chin and i thought what the hell gives here anyway she and her papa had been increasingly nasty to me almost from the day we were married but tonights performance beat anything i had previously been subjected to you and your daddy i said are very very lovely people strange as it may seem however your unfailing courtesy and consideration have not made a diet of pancakes and table scraps palatable to me so ill go into town and get something to eat and you and your daddy can go burp in your bibs i was heading for the door as i spoke for connie had a vile temper and was not above throwing things at me or striking me with them i flung the door open and and there was a sickening thud and a pained scream from connie a scream that ended almost as soon as it began i turned around suddenly numb with fear connie lay crumpled on the floor a deep crease oozing slow drops of blackish blood stretched jaggedly across her forehead she had been hit by the sharp edge of the door when i threw it open she was very still as pale as death i grabbed her up and raced out to the car with her i placed her on the back seat and slid under the wheel and i sent the car roaring down the lane from the house and into the road that ran in front of it or rather across the road for i was going too fast to make the turn the turn was sharp one that was dangerous even at relatively low speeds i knew it was as did everyone else in the area and i could never satisfactorily explain why i was traveling as fast as i was i was unnerved of course and of course i had lost my head as i habitually did when confronted with an emergency but still kind of strange for a man to do something when he danged well knew he shouldnt kind of suspicious the road skirted a steep cliff it was almost three hundred feet from the top of the cliff to the bottom the car went over it and down it i dont know why i didnt go over with it as connie did i couldnt explain no more than i could explain why i was speeding when i hit the turn nor could i prove that i had hit connie with the door accidentally instead of deliberately i was an outsider in a clannish little community and it was known that i constantly bickered with my wife and i was the beneficiary of her life insurance policy double indemnity if connies father hadnt stoutly proclaimed me innocent connie also defending me as soon as she was able i suspect that i would have been convicted of attempted murder as i still might be unless i myself was murdered the night of the skeleton of my chase through the garbage dump i was kept under sedation for the rest of that night and much of the next day and night i had to be so great was the damage to my nervous system early the following afternoon after i had gotten some thirtysix hours of rest and treatment detective sergeant jeff claggett was admitted to my hospital room it was jeff who had followed me into the garbage dump subsequently knocking me out when i could not be reasoned with he had taken up the chase after hearing my yell and seeing my flight away from the house but he had seen no one pursuing me i suppose no one was i admitted a little sheepishly i know he started around the fountain after me but i was so damned sure that he was right on my tail that i didnt turn around to see if he was cant say that i blame you claggett nodded mustve given you a hell of a shock to come up against something like that pointing a gun at you any idea who it was no way of telling i shook my head just someone in a skeleton costume youve probably seen them a luminous skeleton painted on black cloth not much of a lead couldve been picked up anywhere in the country claggett said tell me britt do you walk around in your backyard as a regular thing i mean could the guy have known youd be there at about such and such a time no way i said i havent been in the backyard in the last five years then he was just hiding there in the weeds dont you suppose keeping out of sight say until he could safely come into the house come into the house i laughed shakily why would he want to do that well jeff claggett gave me a deadpan look possibly he was after your money and valuables after all everyone knows youre a very wealthy man youre kidding i said anyone who knows anything about me knows that i dont have a pot to right he cut me off so what the guy was after was you hed have you pinned down in the house youd probably wake up hed wake you of course to find him bending over your bed a skeleton grinning at you in the dark you couldnt get away from him and yes something wrong britt something wrong i shuddered what are you trying to do to me jeff who hates you that much britt and dont tell me you dont know but but i dont i stammered ive probably rubbed a lot of people the wrong way but i broke off for he was holding something in front of me then dropping it on the bed with a grimace a pamphlet bylined by me with a line attributing sponsorship to pxa thats why i came out to see you the other night britt i ran across it in the library and i was sure the use of your name was unauthorized but i guess i was wrong wasnt i i hesitated unable to meet his straightforward blue eyes their uncompromising honesty i took a sip of water through a glass straw mumbled a kind of defiant apology for my employment with pxa its nothing to be ashamed of jeff it was a public service thing nothing to do with the companys other activities no claggett said wryly those activities paid for your work didnt they a lot more than it was worth too unless my information is all wrong three thousand dollars a month plus bonuses plus a car plus an expense account plus lets see what else was included in the deal a very juicy and willing young widow look i said redfaced whats this got to do with what happened to me dont kid me britt ive talked to her her and her uncle both its normal procedure to inform a mans employers when hes had a mishap so i had a nice little chat with them and you know what i think i think youre going to tell me what you think i think that patrick xavier aloe had been expecting manuela to visit some unpleasantness upon you and is now sure that she did i think he gave her plenty of hell as soon as i left the office i thought the same although i didnt say so claggett went on to reveal that he had talked with mrs olmstead learning of course that we were much more than employer and employee she put out a lot of money for you my friend or arranged to have it put out she also put out something far more important to a girl like that i imagine she only did it in the belief that you were going to marry her he waited studying me i nodded reluctantly i should have known what was expected of me i said hell maybe i did know but wouldnt admit it at any rate it was a lousy thing to do and i probably deserve whatever she hands out oh well claggett shrugged you werent very nice to your wife either probably not but shes an entirely different case manny was good to me i never got anything from connie and her old man but a hard time you say so and i believe you said claggett warmly any damage you do i imagine is the result of not doing just letting things slide you dont have the initiative to deliberately hurt anyone thanks i said i guess he chuckled goodnaturedly tell me about connie and her father tell me how you happened to marry her since it obviously wasnt exactly a love match i gave him a brief history of my meeting and association with the bannermans then since he seemed genuinely interested i gave him a quick rundown on britton rainstar after fortune had ceased to smile upon him and he had become lo the poor indian jeff claggett listened attentively laughing frowning exclaiming wincing and shaking his head by turns when i had finished he said that i was obviously much tougher than he had supposed i must be to survive the many messes i had got myself into just one damned thing after another he swore i dont know how the hell you could do it join the crowd i said nobody has ever known how i did it including me well getting back to the present miss aloe expected you to marry her how did she take the news that you couldnt a lot better than i had any right to expect i said she was just too good about it to be true if you know what i mean everything was beautiful for around six weeks just as nice as it had been from the beginning then a couple of days ago the day of the evening i jumped this character in the skeleton suit hold it a minute i want to write this down he took a notebook and pencil from his pocket then nodded for me to proceed i did so telling him of the dog and the mulatto woman and the bartender who had thrown the drink in my face jeff made a few notations to his notes when i had finished then returned the book and pencil to his coat leaning back in his chair he stared up at the ceiling meditatively hands locked behind his head three separate acts he said musingly four counting the skeleton routine but theres a connection between them the tiein is in the result of those acts to give you a hard jolt when you least expect it yes i said uneasily they certainly did that all right i wonder i just wonder if thats how her husband died you know about him an icy nil tingled down my spine she told me he died very suddenly but i just assumed it was from a heart attack claggett said that all deaths were ultimately attributable to heart failure adding that he had no very sound grounds for regarding the death of mannys husband as murder they were at this little seacoast when it was hit by a hurricane wiped out almost half the town her husband was one of the dead wait now he held up his hand as i started to speak naturally she couldnt have arranged the hurricane but she could have used it to cover his murder id say she had plenty of reason to want him out of the way i gather that he wasnt much good i said but she dropped out of sight right after the funeral disappeared without a trace and she didnt show up again for about a year well i said i still dont see well neither do i claggett said easily his manner suddenly changing what are you going to do now britt that youve quit the pamphlet writing i said that i wished to god i knew i wouldnt have any money to live on and none to send connie which would surely cause all hell to pop i was beginning to regret that id quit the job even though id had no choice in the matter claggett said i didnt have one now either i had to go back on the job youll be safer than if you didnt britt so far miss aloes only given you a bad shaking up but she might try for a knockout if she thinks youre getting away from her we dont actually know that shes done anything i said we think shes responsible but were certainly not sure right and we never will be if you break completely with her not until its too late but ive already quit and i made it pretty damned clear that i meant it but she didnt tell her uncle apparently probably afraid of catching more hell than hes already given her he stood up dusting at his trousers ill be having a little chat with both of them today and ill tip her off privately first let her know that youre keeping the job you can bet shell be tickled pink to hear it the door opened and a brightfaced young nurse came in she gave me a quick smile then said something to jeff that was too low for me to hear he nodded dismissing her and turned back to me have to run i guess he said okay everything all right absolutely perfect i said bitterly how else could it be for a guy with a schizoid wife and a paranoid girlfriend if one of them cant send me to prison or the electric chair the other will put me in the nuthouse or the morgue well screw it i plopped back on the pillows what are you chatting with the aloes about oh this and that he shrugged about you mainly i suppose theyre very concerned about you and anxious to see you of course of course so if its all right with you ill have them drop in around five there is something utterly unnerving about an absolutely honest man a man like sergeant jeff claggett you rationalize and lie to him until your supply of deceit is exhausted and his questions and comments are never brutal or blunt he simply persists when you have already had your say looking at you when you can no longer look at him and finally though nothing has been admitted you know you have been in the fight of your life so i dont know what jeff said that afternoon to manuela and patrick xavier aloe it is likely that he was quite offhand and casual that he said nothing at all of intrinsic significance but they came into my room a tinge of strain to their expressions and mannys lips seemed a little stiff as she stooped to kiss me i shook hands with pat and stated that i was fine just fine they stated that that was fine just fine and that i was looking fine just fine there was an awkward moment of silence after that while i smiled at them and was smiled back at manny shattered the tension by bursting into giggles they made her very nice to look at shaking and shivering her in all her shakable shivery parts pulse pounding i tentatively joined in her laughter but pat saw no cause for amusement whats with you he glared at her we got a sick man here he gets a damned stupid joke pulled on him and it puts him in the hospital you think thats funny now uncle pat manny gestured placatingly britt lands in the hospital and we get cops nosing all around maybe you like that huh you think cops are funny there was only one pat just sergeant claggett and hes a family friend isnt he britt a very old friend i said jeff sergeant claggett that is would be concerned regardless of why i was in the hospital well pat aloe was somewhat reassured anything else happen to you recently britt i mean any little jokes like this last one i hesitated feeling mannys eyes on me wondering what jeff would consider the best answer pats gaze moved from me to manny and she smiled at him sunnily of course nothing else has happened to him pat this is his first time in the hospital isnt it thats right i said and gave him the qualified truth theres been nothing like this before he relaxed at that his mapofireland face creasing in a grin he said he was damned glad to hear it because theyd been getting aok reactions to the pamphlets and hed hate to see them loused up and wed hate to lose the tax writeoff manny said dont forget that uncle pat shut up pat said and to me then everythings copacetic right britt youre gonna go right on working for us id like to i said i understand that ill be under medical supervision for a while have to take things kind of easy but if thats all right with you he boomed that of course it was all right and dont you worry about the hospital and doctor bills we got kind of a private insurance plan that takes care of everything in the medical line thats great i said im obliged to you forget it whatever makes you happy makes us happy right manny anything thats jake with britt britt and his friend sergeant claggett is jake with us manny said emphatically right uncle pat right on and pat shot her a warning look one more thing britt baby i was way out of line saying anything about you and manny getting married what the hell thats your business not mine right said manny you want a bat in the chops he halfraised his hand keep askin and youre gonna get it i broke in to say quite truthfully that i would have been glad to marry manny if i had been free to do pat said sure sure so who was kicking its okay with me and its okay with her she dont like it she can shove it up her ass right back at you you sawedoff sonofabitch said manny and she made an upward jabbing motion with one finger pat leaped he grabbed her by the shoulders shook her so vigorously that he head seemed to oscillate her hair flying out from it in a golden blur he released her with a shove that slammed her into the wall and the noise of his angry breathing almost filled the room i felt a little sick savagery like this was something i had never seen before as for manny something undefinable happened to her face a flickering of expressions that wiped it free of expression then caused it to crinkle joyously to wreathe itself in a cherubic smile pat looked away gruffly abashed lets go he jerked a thumb over his shoulder get out of here and let britt get some rest you go ahead she said i want to kiss britt goodnight whos stopping you you kissed him in front of me before huhuh not this way i didnt he gave me an embarrassed glance then shrugged and said he could stand it if i could he told me to take it easy and left and manny crossed to the door locked it and came back to the bed she looked down then bent down so close that her breasts brushed against me go ahead she whispered grab a handful now dammit manny i tried to sit up listen to me manny look edging her blouse down look how nice they are i said listen to me oh all right she said poutingly im listening youve got to stop it i said well forget whats already happened just say i had it coming and call it quits but there cant be any more understand and dont ask me any more what any more what please i said im trying to help you if youll just stop now but i really dont know what you mean darling if youll just tell me what you want me to stop what else i shouldnt do all right i said ive done my best she studied me a moment the tip of her finger in her mouth then she nodded became pseudobusinesslike declared that she knew just what i needed and it so happened that she had brought a supply with her as i have noted previously she moved very very quickly when she chose so she was on the bed on top of me before i knew what was happening smothering me with softness moving against me sensuously there was an abrupt metallic squeal from the bed then a grating and a scraping and a crash instinctively i jerked my head up so it did not smash against the hard hospital floor but my neck snapped painfully and manny helped me to my feet murmuring apologies someone was pounding on the door noisily working at the lock it opened suddenly and the nurse came in almost at a run it was the nurse i had seen earlier the brightfaced young woman nonetoogently she brushed manny aside and seated me comfortably in a chair she felt my pulse and forehead gave me a few fussy little pats then she turned on manny who was casually adjusting her clothes just what happened here miss why was that door locked manny grinned at her impudently a brokendown bed and a locked door and you ask me what happened how long have you been a woman dear the nurse turned brick red her arm shot out the finger at its end pointing sternly toward the door i want you out of here miss right this minute oh all right manny said unless i can do something else for britt no i said please do as the nurse says manny she did so lushly compact hips swinging provocatively the nurse looked after her a little downcast i thought as though doing some comparative weighing and finding herself sadly wanting an orderly removed the collapsed bed and wheeled in another i was put into it and a doctor examined me and pronounced me indestructible just the same he said winking at me lewdly you lay off the doublesacking with types like that pocket venus that was in here id say she could spot you a taiiwind and still beat you into port oh she could not the nurse said reddening gloriously the moment the words were out of her mouth how would you know anyway well he gave her a wisely laconic grin how would you he slapped unsuccessfully at her bottom on the way out she jerked away greatly flustered and darted a glance at me and of course found nothing in my expression but earnest goodwill she was much prettier than i had thought at first glance she had superb bone structure and her hair too austerely coiffed beneath her nurses cap was deep auburn i dont believe ive seen you before today i said are you new on this floor well she hesitated i guess im new on all of them i mean im a substitute nurse i see i said well i think youre a fine nurse and im sure youll have regular duty before long she twitched pleasurably like a petted puppy then her scrubbedclean face fell and she sighed heavily i thought i was going to have steady work starting tomorrow she said steady for a while anyway but after what happened today well ill be held responsible the bed wouldnt have been brokendown if i hadnt allowed the door to be locked you could have been seriously injured and its all my fault and wait i held up a hand hold it a minute it wasnt your fault it was mine and i wont allow the hospital to blame you for it you just have your supervisor talk to me and ill straighten her out fast thank you mr rainstar but the supervisor has already reported the matter to sergeant claggett she had to you know her orders were to report anything unusual that happened to you so i was the regular duty the nurse had hoped to have the doctors felt that for a time at least when i returned home i should have a fulltime nurse available and she had seemed a likely candidate for the job but jeff claggett would never approve of her now i really blew it she said with unconscious humor ill bet the sergeant is really disgusted with me i said loftily that she was to forget the sergeant after all i was the one who had to be satisfied and she satisfied me in every respect so she could consider herself hired oh thats wonderful just wonderful she wriggled delightedly youre sure sergeant claggett will approve if he doesnt hell have me to deal with i said but im sure itll be fine with him but i wasnt sure of course and of course it wasnt fine with him he returned to the hospital shortly after i had finished my dinner that evening he had been busy since leaving me checking at the cocktail lounge where i had gotten a drink in my face and with the mulatto woman who managed the quiet little hotel in neither case had his investigation come to aught but naught the bartender had quit his job and departed town for parts unknown to the lounge owner or so at least the latter said the hotel had the same owners it had always had a large eastern realty company which was the absentee landlord for literally hundreds of properties the manageress owned no dog denied any knowledge of one also denying that she had done anything but rent me and my wife a room so thats that claggett said if you like i can put out a john doe warrant on the bartender but i dont think its worth the trouble assuming we could run him down which i doubt throwing a drink on you wouldnt add up to more than a misdemeanor by itself i nodded but when you add it onto the business with the dog and how are you going to add it on youre a married man but you register into this hotel with another woman as mr and mrs phoneyname and you tied your hands right there the manageress was lying sure but try to prove it and youll look like a jerk he seemed rather cross and out of sorts i suggested as much adding that i hoped i wasnt the cause of same he gave me a look seemed on the point of saying something intemperate then he sighed wearily and shook his head i guess you just cant help it he said tiredly you seem incapable of learning from experience you know or should know that miss aloe is out to harm you you dont know how far she intends to go which makes her all the more dangerous to you but you let her get rid of pat you let her lock the door you let her come back to the bed and make certain adjustments to it look i protested she didnt do all those things separately with a time lapse between them shes a very quickmoving little girl and she did everything in a matter of seconds before i knew what was happening she i broke off uh what do you mean certain adjustments i said the bed goes up and down right depending on whether you want to sit up or sleep or whatever and here right here where im pointing he pointed do you see it that little lever i see it i said well thats the safety it locks the bed into the position you put it in i know i said they explained that to me the first day i was here thats good claggett said grimly thats real good well if miss aloe was out to fracture your skull she couldnt have had a more cooperative subject you let her flip the safety and use her weight to give you an extrahard bang against the floor you didnt let her tie a rocket to you but i imagine you would if shed asked you my mouth was suddenly very dry i took a sip or two of water then raised the glass and drained it i thought it was just a silly accident i said it never occurred to me that shed try anything here in the hospital well watch yourself from now on claggett said youre going to be thrown together a lot i understand in the course of doing these pamphlets or am i correct about that well i shrugged that depends largely on manny shes calling the turns the amount of time we spend together depends on her better count on more time with her than less then he said this little stunt she pulled today well i doubt that it was really a try for a knockout whenever shes ready for that if she ever is ready i think shell stay in the background and have someone else do it i said yes i supposed he was right he made an impatient little gesture as though i had said something annoying but we cant be sure britt we cant say what she might do since she probably doesnt know herself look at whats happened to you so far she couldnt have planned those things theyve just been spurofthemoment pulled out of her hat as she went along i made no comment this time he went on to say that hed done some heavy thinking about mannys vanishing for a year after her husbands death and there was only one logical answer as to where she had been and why a private sanitarium britt a place where she could get psychiatric help her mind started bending with the trouble her husband gave her and it finally broke when he died or when she killed him id say that your telling her you were married was more than she could take and its started her on another mental breakdown well i laughed nervously thats not a very comforting thought youll be all right as long as youre careful just watch yourself and her think now everything thats happened to you so far has been at least partly your own fault in a sense youve set yourself up i gave that a moments thought and then i said all right he was right i would be very very careful from now on since i had but one life to live i would do everything in my power to go on living it you have my solemn promise jeff i shall do everything in my power to keep myself alive and unmaimed now just what are you doing along that line ive done certain things inside your house he said if theres ever any trouble just let out a yell and youll have help within a minute how i said you mean you have the place bugged dont try to find out he said if you dont know miss aloe wont and if you did she would youre really pretty transparent britt oh now i dont know about that i said i well i do know youre not only just about incapable of deceiving anyone for any length of time but youre also very easy to deceive so take my word for it that youll be all right just yell and youll have help i dont like it i said suppose i couldnt yell that i didnt have time or i wasnt allowed to claggett laughed shook his head chidingly now britt be reasonable youll have a fulltime nurse right in the house with you and shell be checking on you periodically its inconceivable that you could need help and be unable to get it it wasnt inconceivable to me i could think of any number of situations in which i would need help and be unable to cry out for it and for the record one of those situations did come about it did happen the spinechilling hairraising occurrence i had most feared and just when i was feeling safest and most secure and i could see no way of hollering for help without hastening my already imminent demise all i could do was lie quiet as i was ordered to and listen to my hair turn grayer still wondering foolishly if i could ever get an acceptable tint job on it assuming that i lived long enough to need one but this is getting ahead of the story it is something that was yet to happen tonight the night of which i am writing claggett pointed out that he was only a detective sergeant and that as such there was a limit to what he could do for my protection and im sure the arrangements ive made are enough britt with you staying on the alert and with a good reliable nurse on hand im confident that he broke off giving me a sudden sharp look yes he said something on your mind well uh yes i said uncomfortably about the nurse id like to have the one whos on duty tonight that kind of pretty reddishhaired one i i uh i mean she needs the job and not a chance claggett said flatly not in a thousand years ive got another nurse in mind an older woman used to be a matron at the jail a few years back ill have her come in right now and you can be getting acquainted tonight he got up and started toward the door i said wait a minute and he paused and turned around well well id kind of like to have the reddishhaired girl she wants the job and im sure shed be just fine fine for what claggett said no dont tell me you just take care of goldenhaired miss aloe and forget about your pretty little redhead i said i didnt have anything like that in mind at all whatever it was he thought i had in mind my god with connie and manny to contend with id be crazy to start anything up with another girl so said claggett then cut me off with a knifing gesture of his hand as i began another protest i dont care if you did promise her the job you had no right to make such a promise and she knows it as well as you do he turned and stalked out of the room i expected him to be back almost immediately bringing the expolice matron with him but he was gone for almost a half an hour and he came back looking wearily resigned you win he said dropping heavily into a chair you get your redhaired nurse i do i said i mean why because she spread it all around that she had the job she was so positive about it that even the nurse i had in mind was convinced and she got sore and quit im sorry i said i really didnt mean to upset your plans jeff i know he shrugged i just wish i could feel better about the redhead im sure shell work out fine i said she got off to a bad start today by letting manny lock the door and pull the bed trick but what said claggett oh well that didnt bother me that could have happened regardless of who was on duty the thing that bothers me about miss redhead scrubbedclean is that i cant check her out i said oh not knowing quite why i said it or why the hair on the back of my neck had gone through the motions of attempting to rise raised on a farm jeff claggett was saying no neighbors for miles around no friends her parents were exteachers and they gave her her schooling they did a firstclass job of it too judging by her entrance exams at nursing school she scored an academic rating of highschool graduate plus two years of college she was an honors graduate in nursing and i cant turn up anything but good about her since she made rn still he shook his head troubledly i dont actually know anything about her for the first eighteen years of her life theres nothing i can check on not even a birth certificate from the time she was born until she entered nurses training a linen cart creaked noisily down the hallway from somewhere came the crash of a dinner tray look jeff i said in view of what youve told me and after much deliberation i think id better have a different nurse not possible jeff shook his head firmly you promised her the job i went along with your decision when i found that my matron friend wasnt and wouldnt be available try to back down on the deal now and wed have the union on us ill tell you something i said i find that ive undergone a very dramatic recovery my condition has improved at least a thousand percent and im not going to need a nurse at all claggett complained that i hadnt been listening to him id already engaged a nurse the redhead and the doctors said i did need one ive probably got the wind up over nothing anyway britt after all the fact that i cant check on her doesnt mean that shes hiding anything now does it yes i said i think its proof positive that she was up to no good during those lost years of her nonage and that she is planning more of the same for me claggett chuckled that i was kidding that i was always kidding i said not so that i only kidded when i was nervous or in mortal fear for my life as in the present instance its kind of a defense mechanism i explained i reason that i cant be murdered or maimed while wouldbe evildoers are laughing claggett said brusquely to knock off the nonsense he was confident that the nurse would work out fine if hed had any serious doubts about her hedve acted upon them ill have to go now britt have a good night and ill talk to you tomorrow wait i said what if im murdered in my sleep then i wont talk to you he said irritably and he left the room before i could say anything else i got up and went to the bathroom the constant dryness of my mouth had caused me to drink an overabundance of water i came out of the bathroom and climbed back into bed the hall door opened silently and the reddishhaired nurse came in she was wheeling a medicine cart in front of her a cart covered with a chaos of bottles and vials and hypodermic needles having gotten the job as my regular fulltime nurse seemed to have given her selfconfidence and she smiled at me brilliantly and introduced herself im miss nolton mr rainstar full name kate nolton but i prefer to be called kay well all right kay i said smiling stiffly it seems like a logical preference what she frowned curiously i dont understand i mean its reasonable to call you kay since your name is kate but it wouldnt seem right to call you kate if your name was kay i mean oh forget it i groaned my god do you play tennis kay i love tennis how about you yeah how about me i said well not very i said i mean do you play tennis no i said she sort of smilefrowned at me she picked up my wrist and tested my pulse very fast i thought so she said turn over on your side please she took a hypodermic needle from the sterilizer and began to draw liquid into it from a vial then she glanced at me and gestured with light impatience i said to turn on your side mr rainstar i am on my side i mean the other side turn your back to me but that wouldnt be polite mr rainstar she almost stamped her foot if you dont turn your back to me right this minute i turned as requested she jerked the string on my pajamas and started to lower them wait a minute i said what are you doing anyway she told me what she was doing adding that i was the silliest man she had ever seen in her life i told her i couldnt allow it it was the complete reversal of the normal order of things a girl doesnt take a mans pants down i said everyone knows that the correct procedure is for the man to take the girls ooowtch what the goddam hell are you trying to do woman shh hush the very idea making all that fuss over a teensy little hypo sergeant claggett told me you were just a big old baby thats why hes only a sergeant i said an upper echelon officer would have instructed you in the proper treatment of wounds namely to kiss them and make them well that got her her face turned as red as her hair why you you are you suggesting that i kiss your a double s i yawned prodigiously thats exactly what im suggesting i said and yawned again i might add that its probably the best o double f offer youll ever get in your career as an assassin all right she said i think ill just take you up on it just push it up here where i can get at it good and get away from me goddammit i said go scrub out a bedpan or something lets see now ahh there it is kitchycoo get go away you crazy broad kitchykitchycoo dammit if you dont get away from me im going to going to going my eyes snapped shut i drifted into sleep or rather halfsleep i was asleep but aware that she had dropped into a chair that she was shaking silently hugging herself then rocking back and forth helplessly and shrieking with laughter i was aware when other people came into the room to investigate other nurses and some orderlies and a couple of doctors the silly bastards were practically packed into my room a couple of them even sat down on my bed jouncing me up and down on it as they laughed i thought now dammit my thought ended there i lost all awareness and i fell into deep unknowing sleep i slept so soundly that i felt hung over and somewhat grouchy the next morning when kay nolton awakened me she looked positively asceptic all brighteyed and cleanscrubbed it depressed me to see anyone look that good in the early morning and it was particularly depressing in view of the way i looked which im sure was ghastly or shitty to use the polite term kay secured the usual matchbook size bar of hospital soap one wholly inadequate for lathering the ass of a sick gnat she secured a tiny wedge of threadbare washcloth suitable for scrubbing the aforementioned she dumped soap and washcloth into one of those shiny hospital basins which i suspect are used for puking in as well as spongebathing and she carried it into the bathroom to fill with water i jumped out of bed and flattened myself against the wall at one side of the bathroom door when she came out eyes fixed on the basin i slipped into the bathroom and into the shower i heard her say mr rainstar mr rainstar where in the world then i turned on the shower full and i heard no more i came back into my room with a towel wrapped around me kay popped a thermometer into my mouth now why did you do that anyway i had everything all ready to dont talk youll drop the thermometer give you a sponge bath you knew i did so why in the world did you i said dont talk mr rainstar i know you probably dont feel well and i appreciate your giving me a job but is that any reason to mr rainstar she relieved me of the thermometer at last frowned slightly as she examined it then shrugged apparently finding its verdict acceptable she checked my pulse and ditto ditto she asked if i needed any help in dressing and i said i didnt she said i should just go ahead then and she would bring in my breakfast and i said i would and i did and she did since she was now officially my employee rather than the hospitals she brought coffee for herself on the breakfast tray sat sipping it chatting companionably as i ate you know what im going to do for you today mr rainstar i mean i will if you want me to all i want you to do i said is shoot me with a silver bullet only thus will my tortured heart be at rest oh she said blankly i was going to say that id wash and tint your hair for you if you wanted me to that is i grinned then laughed out loud not at her but myself because how could anyone have behaved as idiotically as i had and with no real reason whatsoever i had stepped on jeff claggetts toes making a commitment without first consulting him he hadnt liked that naturally enough i had already stretched his patience to the breaking point so he had punished me warned me against any further intrusions upon his authority by expressing serious doubts about kay nolton when i overreacted to this he had hastily backwatered pointing out that he would not be leaving me in her care if he had had any reservations about her but i was off and running by then popping off every which way carrying on like a damned nut and getting wilder and wilder by the minute kay was looking at me uncertainly a lovely blush spreading over her face and neck and down into her cleavage so i stopped laughing and said she must pay no attention to me since i sad to say was a complete jackass im sorry as hell about last night i dont know why i get that way but if i do it again give me an enema in the ear or something okay now you were perfectly all right mr rainstar she said stoutly i was pretty far out of line myself i knew you were a highly nervous type but i teased you and made jokes when i should have when you should have given me that enema i said how are you at ear enemas anyway the technique is practically the same as if you were doing it youknow where just remember to start at the top instead of the bottom and youll have it made she had started giggling rosy face glowing eyes bright with mirth i said i was giving her life tenure at the task of futzing with my hair i said i would also give her a beating with a wet rope if she didnt start calling me britt instead of mr rainstar now that we have that settled i said i want you to get up back up and bend over bbend over oh ha ha wwhy britt so that i can climb on your shoulders of course i assume you are carrying me out of this joint piggyback she said ooops and jumped up be back in just a minute britt she hurried out of the room promptly hurrying back with a wheelchair it was a rule it seemed that all patients ambulatory or not had to be wheeled out of the hospital so i climbed into the conveyance and kay fastened the crossbar across my lap locking me into it the she wheeled me down to and into the elevator and subsequently out of the elevator and into the lobby she parked me there at a point near the admitting desk admitting also being the place where departing patients were checked out while she crossed to the desk and conferred with the registrar or unregistrar i sat gazing out through the buildings main entrance musing that the hospitals bills could be reduced to a level the average patient could pay if so much money had not been spent on inexcusable nonsense a particularly execrable example of such nonsense was this socalled main entrance of the hospital which was not so much an entrance main or otherwise as it was a purely decorative and downright silly integrant of the structures facade interiorly it consisted of four double doors electronically activated the exterior approach was via some thirty steep steps each some forty feet in length mounting to a ginmill gothic quadruple archway hardly anyone used this multimilliondollar monstrosity for entrance or egress how the hell could they people came and went by the completely plain but absolutely utilitarian side entrance which was flush with the abutting pavement and required neither stepping down from nor up to it was actually the only one the hospital needed the other was not only extravagantly impractical it also had a kind of vertigoish acrophobic quality staring out on its stupidly expensive expanse one became a little dizzy struck with the notion that he was being swept forward at a smoothly imperceptible but swiftly increasing speed even i a levelheaded unflappable guy like me was beginning to feel that way i rubbed my eyes looked away from the entrance toward kay but neither she nor the admitting desk were where i had left them the desk was far far behind me and so was kay she was sprinting toward me as fast as her lovely long legs could carry her and yet she was receding like a character in one of those oldtimey silent movies i waved at her exaggeratedly mouthing the words what gives she responded with a wild waving and flapping of both her arms simultaneously jumping up and down as though taken by a fit of hysterics ahha i thought shrewdly something exceedingly strange is going on here there was a loud swoosh as one of the double doors launched open there was a loud yike as i shot thought it there were mingled moans and groans yells and screams as i sped across the terrazzo esplanade to the dizzying brink of those steep seemingly endless stone steps i had the feeling that those steps were much harder than they looked and that they were even harder than they looked i had the feeling that i had no feeling then i shot over the brink and went down the steps with the sound of a stuttering offkey cannon or a very large frog with laryngitis bonkblonkbronk and i rode the chair and the chair rode me by turns about halfway down one of the steps reared up turned its sharp edge up and whacked me unconscious so only god knows whether i or the chair did the riding from then on i was back in my hospital room except for being dead i felt quite well oh i was riddled with aches and twinges and bruises but it is scientific fact that the dead cannot become so without having some pain all things are relative you know and i knew i was dead since no man could live or want to live with a nose the size of an eggplant i could barely see around it but i got a glimpse of kay sitting at the side of the door her attention was focused on the doctor and claggett who stood in the doorway talking quietly so i focused on them also relatively speaking that is a hell of a kickback on the sedatives sergeant a kind of cumulative kickback id say reoccurring over the last several days you may have noticed a rambling seriocomic speech pattern a tendency to express alarm and worry through preposterous philosophizing hmmmm he normally does a lot of that doctor yes an inability to cope i suspect but the sedatives seem to have carried the thing full circle defense became offense possibly in response to this mornings crisis it could have kept him from being killed by the accident my head suddenly cleared the gauzy fogginess which had hung over everyone and everything was ripped away and despite the enormous burden of my nose i sat up kay claggett and the doctor immediately converged on my bed i held up my hand and said please gentlemen and lady please do not ask me how i feel you might tell us the doctor chuckled and you dont want to see us cry second please i said and i again held up my hand please dont joke with me it might destroy the little sense of humor i have left also and believe you me im in no damned mood for jokes or kidding ive had my moments of that but thats passed and i contemplate no more of it for the foreseeable future i imagine youre in quite a bit of pain the doctor said quietly nurse will you no i said i can survive the pain what i want right now is a large pot of coffee have it after youre rested you really should rest mr ra in star i said i was sure he was right but id prefer rest that wasnt drug induced and i felt well enough to wait for it i want to talk to sergeant claggett too i said and i cant do it if im doped the doctor glanced at claggett and jeff nodded i wont let him overdo it doc good enough then the doctor said if he can make it on his own im all for it he left and kay got the coffee for me it did a little more for me than i needed doing making my overalerted nerves cry out for something to calm them but i fought the desire down indicating to claggett that i was ready to talk i dont think i can tell you anything though i said i didnt realize it at the time but i think i was in a kind of dream state i mean everything seemed to be out of kilter but not in a way that i couldnt accept it didnt jar you when you were shoved forward that seemed okay to you i wasnt aware that i had been shoved forward my feeling was that things had been shoved away from me not me from them i didnt begin to straighten out until i shot through those doors and i wasnt completely unfogged when i went down the steps damn claggett frowned at me but people were passing all around you you must no i said they werent almost no one comes and goes through that front entrance and im sure that no one did during the time i was there kay said quickly a little anxiously that my recollection was right i was out of the way of passersby which was why she had left me there in the entrance area claggett looked at her and his look was extremely cold kay seemed to wilt under it and claggett turned back to me yes britt something else nothing helpful im afraid i know that people passed behind me i could hear them and occasionally see their shadows but i never saw any of them claggett grimaced said that he apparently didnt live right or something everything points to the fact that someone tried to kill you or made a damned good stab at it but since no one saw anyone maybe there wasnt anyone maybe it was just an evil spirit or a malignant force or something of the kind isnt that what you think nolton no sir kay bit her lip what i think i know is that i should have taken mr rainstar with me when i went to the admitting desk you warned me not to leave him untended and i shouldnt have done it and im very sorry that i did did you see anyone go near mr rainstar no sir well yes i may have thats a pretty busy place the lobby and desk area and people would just about have to pass in mr rainstars vicinity but they made no impression on you you wouldnt remember what they looked like no i wouldnt kay said just a wee bit snappishly how could i anyway they were just a lot of people like you see anywhere one of em wasnt said claggett but let it go i believe i told you but ill tell you again since you seem pretty forgetful that mr rainstar has been seriously harassed and that an attempt might be made on his life i also told you but ill tell you again that miss aloe is not above suspicion in the matter we do not believe she would be directly responsible although she could be but rather as an employer of others do you think you can remember that miss nolton yes sir kay bobbed her head meekly ill remember i should hope so i certainly hope so claggett allowed a little warmth to come into his frosty blue eyes now you do understand nolton that you could get hurt on this job youd represent a danger or an obstacle to the people who are out to get him and you could get hurt bad you might even get killed yes sir said kay i understand that and you still want the job yes sir why sir you heard me nolton claggett leaned forward his eyes stabbing into her like blue icicles jobs arent that hard to get for a registered nurse they arent hard to get period so why are you so damned anxious to have this one a firstclass chance to screw yourself up well whats the answer why im trying to tell you sergeant if youll just you some kind of a bum or something a nut too dumb or shiftless to make out on a regular job or maybe youre working an angle hmmm youre a plant youre going to do a job on britt yourself kay was trembling all over her face had turned from white to red to a mixture of the two and now it was a beautiful combination flushed cream and reddishstreaked pastels her mouth opened and i braced myself for a yell but she spoke very quietly with only a slight shakiness hinting at the anger which she must have felt i want the job sergeant claggett for two reasons one is that i like mr rainstar i like him very much and i want to help him thank you kay i mumbled i had to say something didnt i stealing a glance at claggett i uh like you too thank you mr rainstar the second reason i want the job sergeant claggett is because im not sure i belong in nursing i want to find out whether i do or not before its too late to change to another field so so she wanted to take what would probably be the toughest job she would ever encounter as a nurse if she could measure up to it fine if not well that was also all right she would either make or break quickly her mind would be made up for her and without any prolonged wavering any mental seesawing those are my reasons for wanting the job sergeant claggett i hope theyre enough because i cant give you any others kay finished speaking sat very straight and dignified in her chair hands folded primly in her lap i wanted to take her in my arms and kiss her but i had felt that way before with results that were not always happy for me except for that pleasant weakness i would not be where i was now with a nose which i could barely see around claggett scrubbed his jaw thoughtfully then cocked a brow at me i cocked one at him making it tit for tat he grinned at me narrowly acknowledging my studiously equivocal position well now young woman he said a fine speech like that must have taken a lot out of you suppose you take a relief or have lunch and come back in about an hour well kay stood hesitantly i really dont mind waiting sergeant in fact i want to talk to mr rainstar privately some other business well settle this job matter when you get back i see well whatever you say sir kay nodded to us and left claggett stretched his legs in front of him and said he was glad to get that out of the way now to pick up on your accident just a minute jeff i said you said we had that out of the way youre referring to nurse noltons employment let it ride will you he gestured impatiently i was going to tell you that i dropped in on pxa this morning just a routine visit you know to tell them about the accident to their favorite employee well i said pat was pretty shook up about it reacted about the same as he did on my first visit kind of worried and angry you know like he might get hurt by a mess he wasnt responsible for then he turned sort of foxy and clammed up because as i read him he knew wed have a hell of time proving anything against his niece even though she had ordered the hit yes i frowned how do you mean shes in the hospital britt saint christophers shes been there since just before midnight last night two highly reputable doctors in attendance and theyre not giving out any information nor allowing any visitors i gulped blinked at him stupidly i moved my nose out of the way and had a small drink of water quite a coincidence wouldnt you say britt he winked at me narrowly kind of an unusual alibi but shes kind of an unusual girl maybe she really is sick i said she could be so she could claggett shrugged its practically a cinch that she is in that hospital with those doctors but that doesnt keep it from being a very convenient time to be sick she could set the deal up then put herself well out of the way of it with a nice legitimate sickness oh well yeah i nodded slowly a fake attempt at suicide or an appendicitis attack acute but simulated possibly but not necessarily claggett said and he pointed out that manny had been under a great deal of nervous stress she had concealed it but this itself had added to the tension finally after doing that which only she could do she collapsed with exhaustion its my guess that she did pretty much the same thing after her husbands death about the only difference is that she needed more time to recuperate then and she went into seclusion i said that killing her husband would certainly have put a lot of strain on her but where was the evidence that she had killed him he was only one of many who had died during the hurricane right said claggett but the other deaths were all from drowning or being buried under the wreckage her husband apparently was killed by flying timbers in other words he was out in the open at the time the hurricane struck of course he could have been and might have been but he broke off spread his hands expressively i wet my lips nervously then brushed a hand against them i see what you mean i said she could have battered the hell out of him beaten him to death then dragged his body outside thats what i mean said claggett from the hallway there came the muted clatter of dishes the faint aromas of the noon meal they were not exactly appetitestimulating and i had to swallow down nausea as claggett and i continued our conversation jeff i said at last i just dont see how i can go through with this how the hell can i under the circumstances you mean seeing miss aloe of course thats what i mean i cant do the pamphlets without seeing her ill have to confer with her more or less regularly well claggett sighed then shrugged if you cant you cant oh hell i said miserably naturally ill go through with it ive got no choice good good he said lets hope you can get out of here within the next few days the doctors tell me that aside from your nose and your nerves and theres nothing they can do for me here that cant be done at home i said and i want to get out of here no later than tomorrow morning this place is dangerous it makes me nervous a lot of people die in hospitals claggett chuckled knowingly here we go again hmm you just take it easy my friend calm down and pull yourself together i said i wasnt being nutty dammit the hospital was dangerous which had damn well been proved in my case there were too many people around and it was simply impossible to ward them off or to check on all of them at home i wont have more than two visitors at most manny and possibly pat aloe only those two only one of them actually will be all that have to be watched i say thats a hell of a lot better than the way it is here claggett deliberated briefly and agreed with me if its all right with the doctors its all right with me he said getting to his feet ill be going now but ill be in touch wait a minute i said what about the nurse what oh yes she almost slipped my mind hadnt decided about her yet had i no you hadnt you were going to talk to her when she came back from lunch uhhuh well he glanced at his watch im going to have to go now ill talk to her on the way out he left before i could ask what he was going to say to her but when she came in a few minutes later i learned that he had okayed her for the job but not very pleasantly the very idea she said indignantly saying hed go after my hide if anything happened to you id just like to see him try darn him dont say that i said bite your tongue kay she looked blank then caught my meaning and laughed i didnt think how that sounded britt naturally he isnt going to try because nothing is going to happen to you my lunch tray was brought in consomme with toast vanilla custard and tea it looked reasonably good to me but i ate almost none of it i couldnt after a couple of sips of tea i suddenly went to sleep claggett called me that night to say that i would be checking out of the hospital the next morning he told me the conditions under which i would be checking out and going from the hospital to my home i listened stunned then sputtered profane objections he laughed uproariously but you just think about it britt think it over and it doesnt sound so crazy does it sure its his own idea and i say its a good one you couldnt be any safer in your mothers arms i said that wasnt very safe my mother the first woman judge of the state circuit court had taken to the sauce harder than dad the poor old biddy dropped me on my head more times than she was overturned and believe me they didnt call her reversedecision rainstar for nothing aaah she wasnt that bad claggett chuckled but what do you think about this other its the safest way right right i said kay nolton and i left the hospital next morning in the company of pat aloe and two very toughlooking guards i dont know whether pat was armed or not but the guards carried shotguns a very large black limousine with a uniformed chauffeur was waiting at the side entrance for us i got into the back seat between the two guards kay rode in front between pat and the chauffeur pat jabbed a finger at him and nodded to me this is the character that was supposed to have picked you up at the restaurant that night two three months ago britt too damned stupid to do what hes told but who the hell aint these days the man grinned sheepishly pat scowled at him for a moment then turned his gaze on kay looked at her long and thoughtfully she jerked her head around suddenly and looked at him yes she said something wrong ive seen you before he said where was it nowhere youre mistaken you guys back there where have i seen her the guards leaned forward examined kay meticulously they made a big business out of squinting at her stroking their chins with pseudoshrewdness and the like a pantomime of great minds at work pat put an end to the charade with a rude order to knock it off for nellies sake what about you johnnie to the chauffeur and then disgustedly ahh why do i ask youre as stupid as these guys mister aloe kay heaved a sigh of exaggerated exasperation we have not met before i would certainly remember it if we had i murmured for her to take it easy also quietly suggesting to pat that the subject was hardly worth pursuing he glanced at me absently not seeming to hear what i had said i never forget a face britt baby ask anyone that knows me you sure dont mr aloe not never ever i dont know where or when it was but ive seen her and ill remember he let it go at that facing back around in the seat kay gave me a smile of thanks for my support in the rearview i smiled back at her then shifted my gaze what difference did it make whether he had or hadnt seen her and why should i be again starting to feel that creeping uneasiness in my stomach pat took an envelope from his pocket and handed it to me it was the bonus check i had so foolishly given back to manny and i accepted it gratefully the money would keep connie off my back indefinitely relieving me of at least one of my major worries we arrived at the house the guards and the chauffeur remained with the car while pat accompanied kay and me inside as she preceded us up the steps he told me sotto voce that i should have a salary check coming pretty soon and that he would see to it and anything else that needed taking care of in case manny wasnt available i said that was very nice of him and how was manny getting along i hope shes not seriously ill naah nothing like it he grunted just been working to hard i guess got herself run down and picked up a touch of flu well give her my best i said and thanks very much for seeing me safely home i held out my hand tentatively he said hed go in the house with me if i didnt mind reckon youll want to check in with the sergeant and let him know you got here all right ill do that i said and you can let him know that you got here all right he gave me a puzzled look and said huh and i said never mind to forget it and rang the doorbell i rang it several times but there was no response from mrs olmstead so finally i unlocked the door and we went in she was in the kitchen talking on the telephone hearing us enter the house she hurriedly concluded her call and came into the living room carrying the phone with her and almost becoming entangled in its long extension cord i took it from her introducing her to kay and pat as i dialed claggetts number they grimaced briefly at one another mumbling inconsequentialities and i reported in to jeff and then passed the phone to pat he did as i did and hung up the receiver i walked pat to the door as we stood there for a moment shaking hands and exchanging the usual polite pleasantries customary to departures and arrivals he looked past me to kay eyes narrowing reflectively he was obviously trying to remember where he had seen her before and was just as obviously disturbed at his inability to do so fortunately however he left without giving voice to his thoughts and i started back to the living room i stopped short of it in the entrance foyer listening to the repartee between kay nolton and mrs olmstead now mrs olmstead all i said was that the house needs a good airing out and it most certainly does doesnt neither whore you to be giving me orders anyway you know very well who i am ive told you several times my job is to help mr rainstar recover his health which means that he must have fresh air to breathe hes got fresh air clean wholesome wellprepared meals thats the only kind i fix and plenty of peace and quiet why dont you butt out then i turned quietly away and went silently up the stairs i went into my room stretched out on the bed and closed my eyes i kept them closed too breathing gently and otherwise simulating sleep when they came noisily up the steps to secure my services as arbitrator they left grudgingly without disturbing me each noisily shushing the other i got up visited the bathroom to dab cold water on my nose then stretched out on the bed again i suppose i should have known that there would be friction between any woman as stubbornly sloppy as mrs olmstead and one who was not only redhaired but as patently hygienic as scrubbedlooking kay nolton i suppose that i should also have known that i would be caught in the middle of the dispute since like the legendary hapless pierre unpleasantness was always catching me in the middle of it what i should not have supposed i suppose was that i would have known what the crud to do about it because about all i ever had known to do about something inevitably turned out to be the wrong thing so there you were and here i was and the air did smell pretty foul but then it never did smell very good and i was rather worn out from too much exercise following no exercise at all so i went to sleep i went to work on a pamphlet the next morning i kept at it at first turning out nothing but pointless drivel but then inspiration came to me and my interest rose higher and higher and the pages flowed from my typewriter it was a day over two weeks before i saw manny it was a friday her first day out of the hospital and she came out to the house as soon as she had gone to mass she had lost weight and it had been taken from her face but she had good color having sunned frequently in the hospitals solarium and the thinning of her face gave a quality of spirituality to her beauty it had lacked before she but hold it hold it right there i have gone way ahead of myself skimming over events which should certainly deserve telling to take things in reasonably proper order i worked i badly wanted to work and i am a very hard guy to distract when i am that way when i was distracted as of course i soon was i dealt with the distraction kay and mrs olmstead with exceptional shrewdness and diplomacy thus keeping my timewaste minimal i explained to mrs olmstead that it was only fair that kay should take over the cooking and certain other chores since she mrs olmstead was terribly overworked and certain changes in household routine were necessary due to my illness the doctors have forbidden me to leave the house and miss nolton is required to stay in the house with me at all times she cant order up a taxi as you can and go shopping and buy ice cream sodas and oh a lot of things like youll be doing for me i doubt if she could do it even if she was allowed to leave the house but i trust you mrs olmstead i know youll do the job right so im putting a supply of money in the telephonestand drawer and you can help yourself to whatever you need and if any problems do arise i know youll know how to handle them without any advice from me that disposed of mrs olmstead almost she could not quite accept what was a very good thing for her without a grumbled recital of complaints against me principally my occasional failure to mail her letters or to do something about a possible invasion by rats still i was sure she would cooperate since she had no good reason to do otherwise and i said as much to kay she said flatly that i didnt know what i was talking about then hastily apologized for the statement im here to help you britt to make things as easy for you as possible and im afraid ive added to the strain youve been under by letting mrs olmstead provoke me into quarreling with her i no wait now please she held up her hand as i started to interrupt ive been at least partly at fault and im sorry and ill try to do better from now on ill humor mrs olmstead ill consult her ill do what has to be done without being obtrusive about it making it seem like a rebuke to her but i dont think itll do any good ive seen too many other people like her they have a very keen sense of their privileges and rights but theyre blind to their obligations theyre constantly criticizing others but they never do anything wrong themselves not to hear them tell it i think she spells trouble britt regardless of what you do or i do for your own good i think you should fire her but i need her i said she has to do the shopping for us you can order whatever we need have it delivered well uh there are other things besides shopping anyway anyway yes well it wouldnt seem quite right for us to be alone in the house just the two of us i mean it just wouldnt be right now would it why not said kay and as i hesitated fumbling for words she said quietly all right britt youre too softhearted to get rid of her and i probably wouldnt like you as much as i do if you werent that way so ill say no more about it mrs olmstead stays and i just hope youre not sorry she left my office leaving me greatly relieved as i returned to my work glad that i had not had to explain why i did not want to live alone in the house with her i had no concrete reason to suspect her or rather to be afraid of her nothing at all but the uneasy doubts planted in my mind by claggett and pat aloe still i knew i would be more comfortable with a third person present and i was very happy to have managed it without a lot of fussing and fuming the pamphlet i was doing was on soil erosion a subject i had shied away from in the past i was afraid i would be inadequate to such an important topic with so many facets ie flood drought wind and irresponsible agricultural practices somehow however i had found the courage to plunge into the job and persist at it meeting its challenges instead of veering or backing away my customary reaction when confronted with the difficult and i had advanced to its approximate halfway point when i looked up one afternoon to find kay smiling at me from the doorway i stood up automatically and started to unbuckle my belt but she laughed and said we could dispense with the vitamin shot today just let me get your pulse and your temperature she said and proceeded to get them youre doing very well britt working hard and apparently enjoying it i agreed that i was doing both adding that i was going to be very irritated if i was finished off before the job was finished well then i do solemnly swear to keep you alive she said piously not that i know why its so important but i told her to sit down and i would give her a hint of its importance which she did and i did it was as important as life itself i said in fact it was life yet we sat around on our butts uncaring while it was slowly being stolen from us do you know that threefourths of this states topsoil has been washed away blown away or just bygod pooped away do you know that an immeasurable but dangerously tragic amount of its subsoil has gone the same route given a millennium and enough millionmillions you can replace the topsoil but once the subsoils gone its gone forever in other words youve got nothing to grow crops on and nothing i broke off paused a moment in other words i said it stinks thanks for being so graphic she looked at me absently nose crinkled with distaste then she suddenly came alive stammering embarrassed apologies please forgive me britt it sounds terribly interesting and you must tell me more but what is that awful smell it stinks like well i dont know what its worse than anything ive smelled before in this house and thats really saying something i said i had noticed nothing much worse than usual i also said i had a lot of work to do and that i was anxious to get back to it now britt she got to her feet im sorry and ill run right along can i do anything for you before i go mollified i said that as a matter of fact she could do something there were some usda brochures in the top drawer of my topmost filing cabinet and if she would hold a chair while i climbed up on it i would dance at her wedding or render any other small favor to her you just stay right where you are she said firmly ill do any climbing thats done around here she dragged a chair over to the stack of files hiked her skirt and stepped up on it standing on tiptoe she edged out the top file drawer and reached inside she fumbled blindly inside trying to grasp the documents inside and then suddenly she gasped and her face went livid for a moment i thought she was going to topple from the chair and i jumped up and started toward her but she motioned me back with a grim jerk of her head then jumped down from the chair whitefaced with anger she was holding a large dead rat by the tail without a word she marched out of the room and by the sound of things disposed of it in the rear porch garbage can she returned to my office stopping on the way to scrub her hands at the kitchen sink all right britt she confronted me again i hope youre going to do something now yes i am i said im going to go up to my room and lie down britt what are you going to do about that awful woman now kay i said that rat could have crawled in there and died you know it could why kay said she knew it could not the rats head had been smashed it had been killed then put in the file the shock of finding it could have killed you britt or if you were standing on a chair you could have fallen and broken your neck i just cant allow this kind of thing to go on britt im responsible and youve got to fire her i pointed out that i couldnt fire mrs olmstead not at least until she returned from shopping i pointed out rather piteously that i was not at all well this in the opinion of medical experts now please help me up to my bed i implore you kay nolton she did so though irritably then looking up at her from the counterpane i smiled at her and took one of her hands in mine i said that perhaps she would not mind discussing mrs olmstead when i was feeling better say tomorrow or the next day or perhaps the day after that and i gave her a small pinch on the thigh she drew back skittishly but not without a certain coyness which was all right with me i wanted only to avoid a problem mrs olmstead not to walk into another one but kay had her wants as well as i and to get one must give so when she said that she had to go to her room for a moment but would be right back i told her i would count on it ill hold your place for you i promised ill also move over on the bed in case you want to sit down in case you cannot think of a more comfortable position than sitting well when we heard mrs olmstead return an hour later we were locked together as the blissful beastwithtwoheads we sprang apart and she trotted into the bathroom ahead of me her white uniform drawn high upon her sweet nakedness i used the sink while she sat on the toilet tinkling pleasantly and then i went over to her and hugged her red head against my stomach and she nuzzled and kissed its environs in unashamed womanliness i congratulated myself for once britton rainstar i thought you bridged a puddle without putting your foot down in stinky stuff youve closed the door to debates on mrs olmstead without compromising yourself youve had a nice time and given same to a very nice young lady thats what i thought and why not i nourished that thought while i returned to bed and kay went downstairs to prepare my dinner it began to glimmer away due to a kind of bashful shyness of manner as she served said dinner to me and at bedtime when she came into my room in an oldfashioned unrevealing flannel lips trembling eyes downcast a pastel symphony of embarrassment bingo the sound was the sound of my comforting thought leaping out the window but i didnt think of that then all i could think of was drawing her down into my arms and holding her tight and trying to pet away her sadness you wont like me any more now she sobbed brokenheartedly you think im awful now you think im not a nice girl now and so on until i thought my heart was breaking too please please dont cry darling i pleaded please dont baby girl of course i like you of course i think youre a nice girl of course i think i dont think youre awful but she continued to weep and sob oh she didnt blame me not for a moment she knew i was married so it was all her fault but men never did like you afterwards there was this intern and shed liked him a lot and hed kept after her and finally shed done it with him and hed told everyone in this hospital that she did it and theyd all laughed and thought she was awful then there was this obstetrician shed worked for a wonderfully sweet considerate man but after she did it with him awhile he must have thought she was awful because he decided not to get a divorce after all then there was this well pee on all of them i broke in doing it is one of the very nicest things girls do and any guy who wouldnt treat her nice afterwards would doubtless eat doghockey in hammacherschlemmers side window she giggled then sniffled and giggled simultaneously she asked if she could ask me something and then she asked it would you i know you cant because youre already married but would you if you werent i mean you wouldnt think i was too awful to marry just because i did it you asked me something my precious lovepot i said so let me tell you something if i was not married and please note that i use the verb was not were since were connotes the wildly impractical or impossible as in if i were you and no one but a pretentious damned fool would say if i were not married because thats not only possible but in my case a lousy actuality but uh what was the question would you marry me if you were not i mean was not already married the answer is absotively and look dear were is proper when prefixed by the pronoun you thats one of those exceptions you really would britt honestly you wouldnt think i was too awful to marry let me put it this way my dearest dear i said i would not only marry you and consider myself the luckiest and most honored of men but after gods blessing had been called down upon our union and the minister had given me permission to raise your bridal veil i would raise your bridal gown instead and i would shower kisses of gratitude all over your cute little butt she heaved a great shuddery sigh then her head resting cozily against my chest she asked if i had really meant what i had said my god i said indignantly would i make such a statement if i didnt mean it i mean honest and truly oh i said so thats what you mean uhhuh i cannot tell a lie i said thus my answer must be yes honest and truly and a pail of wild honey with brown sugar on it she fell asleep in my arms the untroubled sleep of an innocent child and flights of angels must have guided her into it for her smile was the smile of heavens own i brushed my lips against her hair thinking that everyone should know such peace and happiness wondering why they didnt when it was so easily managed the ingredients were to be found in everyones cupboard or the cupboard which everyone is and you could put them together as easily as you could button your britches all that was necessary was to combine any good brand of kindness and any standard type of goodwill plus a generous dab of love then shake well and serve there you had peace and happiness beautifully personified by this sleeping angel in my arms without disturbing her i shifted my position eversoslightly and i took another look at her and i thought i have seen manny sleep like this too manny who thus far has done everything but kill me and doubtless plans to do just that then i thought connie looked thus also for gods sake the homeliest scrawniest broad in the world has at least a moment of surpassing beauty else a majority of the worlds female population would go unscrewed and unmarried and i thought that connie would probably like to kill me and quite likely would do so if she knew how to safely wangle it and i thought and how about kay this lovely child for all i know about her or dont know about her she too could have my murder on her mind yeah verily even while screwing me she could be plotting my slaughter perhaps she would see my death as atonement for her misuse by guys who had used her guys who thought she was awful and not a nice girl just because she did it finally in that prescient moment preceding sleep i thought congratulations rainstar you have done it again a very small puddle was in your path one that you could have walked through without dampening your shoe soles yet you shrank you chronic shrinker from even that small hazard you must spring over the literal wet spot in your walkway and that mess you came down in on the other side was definitely not a beehive manny came out to the house the next day she looked very beautiful her illness had left her even lovelier than she had been and but i believe weve already covered that so let us move on i was naturally pretty wary and she also was on guard we exchanged greetings stiffly and moved on to a stilted exchange of conversational banalities with that behind us i think we were on the point of breaking the ice when kay popped in with the coffee service she declared brightly that she just knew that we two convalescents would feel better after a good cup of coffee and she poured and passed a cup to each of us manny barely tasted hers and said it was very good i tasted mine and also lied about it kay said she would just wait until we finished it by which time doubtless since i was not feeling very well miss aloe would want to leave manny promptly put her cup down and stood up ill leave right now britt it was thoughtless of me to come out so soon so sit down i said i am quite well and im sure that neither of us wants any more of this coffee so please remove it miss nolton and leave miss aloe and me to conduct our business in private manny said timidly that she would be glad to come back another time but i told her again to sit down and she sat kay snatched up the coffee things and clumped to the door she turned around there addressing me with sorrowful reproach i was just doing my job mr rainstar im responsible for your health you know i know i said and im grateful it would be easier for me if i wasnt so conscientious my salary would be the same and it would be a lot easier for me if i didnt do id better leave said manny picking up her purse and i think youd better not i said i think miss nolton had better leave right this minute kay left slamming the door behind her i smiled apologetically at manny im sorry i said shes a very nice young woman and shes very good at her job but sometimes mmm ill just bet she is manny said and then with a small diffident gesture i want to tell you something and its well not easy for me could you come a little closei please of course i said and i moved over to her side on the love seat i waited and her lips parted then closed again and she looked at me helplessly apparently unable to find the words for what she wanted to say i told her gently to take her time we had all the time in the world and then by way of easing her tenseness i asked her if she remembered the last time we had been in this room together it was months ago and i thought id lost the pamphletwriting job before i even had it so i was sitting here with my head in my hands feeling sorry as hell for myself and i wasnt aware that youd come into the room until of course i remember she clapped her hands delightedly you looked like this she puffed her cheeks out and rolled her eyes inward in a hilarious caricature of despair thats just the way you looked darling and then i said lo the poor indian we said in unison lo the poor indian we laughed and smiled at each other she took my months retainer from her purse and gave it to me and we went on smiling at one another and she spoke to me in a voice as soft and tender as her smile poor lo how are you my dearest darling well you know i shrugged for a guy whos been shot out of the saddle a few times not bad not bad at all im sorry britt terribly terribly sorry thats what i was trying to tell you i havent been myself at least i hope the self ive been showing wasnt the real manuela aloe but im going to be all right now i i of course youre going to be all right i said i pulled a lousy trick on you and you paid me off for it so now were all evensteven nothing more will happen to you britt i swear it wont didnt i just say so i said now be a nice girl and say no more about it and start reading these beautiful words ive written for you she said all right britt swallowing heavily eyes shining too brightly then the tears brimmed over and she began to weep silently and i hastily looked away because id never known what to do when a woman started crying and i particularly didnt know what to do when the woman was manny aah britt she said tremulously how could i ever have been mean to anyone as nice as you doggone it everyone keeps asking me that i said and what the heck can i tell them she laughed tearily she said britt oh britt my darling and then she broke down completely great sobs tearing through her body i held her and patted her head and that sort of thing i took out my breastpocket handkerchief and dabbed her eyes and honked her nose in it conscious that there was something a little nutty about performing such chores for a girl who had almost killed me even though she hadnt meant to conscious that i again might be playing the chump and at the moment not really caring if i was i crossed to my desk and began putting the pages i had written into an envelope i took my time about it giving her time to pull herself together rattling on with some backhanded kidding to brighten things up now hear me i said i dont want you looking at this bawling and honking your schnozzle and being so disgustingly messy us noble redmen dont put up with such whiteeye tricks get me you silly squaw ggotcha a small and shaky snicker silly squaw always gets noble redman well i just hope youre not speaking with a forked tongue i said these are very precious words lovingly typed on top grade erasablebond paper and god pity you if you louse them up all right britt she did sound like she was so i turned back around i helped her up from the love seat gave her a small pat on the bottom and pressed the envelope into her hands as i walked her to the front door i told her a little about the manuscript and said that i would look forward to hearing from her about it she said that i would no later than the day after the morrow no wait a minute she said todays friday isnt it all day i believe lets make it monday then ill see you monday no one should ever see anyone on monday i said lets make it tuesday we settled on a tuesday pm meeting pausing at the front dooi she glanced out to where her own car stood in the driveway and asked what had happened to mine i hope the company hasnt pulled another booboo and come out and gotten it britt after all the stupid mixups weve had in the past that would be a little too much no no i said everything is as it should be i believe that exposure to the elements is good for a car helps it to grow strong and tough you know but since i havent been using it these several weeks i locked it up in the garage yes she looked up at me curiously but you get out a little bit dont you you dont stay in the house all the time thats what i do i said doctors orders i think its pretty extreme but i shrugged leaving the sentence unfinished again she gave me a curious frown very strange she murmured a slight chill coming into her voice i was certain that the doctors would want you to get a little fresh air and sunshine i said that oh well she knew how doctors were knowing that it sounded pretty feeble actually of course it was not the doctors but claggett who had absolutely forbidden me to leave the house manny said yes she did know how doctors were ill say goodbye here then i wouldnt want you to go against orders by walking to my car with me oh now wait a minute i said taking a quick look over my shoulder of course ill walk to the car with you i tucked her arm through mine and we crossed the porch and started down the steps we descended to the driveway and sauntered the few steps to her car i helped her into it and closed the door quietly mrs olmstead was out shopping per usual so she could not reveal my sneaking out of the house but i was fearful that kay might spot me and come storming out to yank me back inside again well goodbye darling i said and i stooped and hastily kissed manny take care and ill see you tuesday wait britt please yes i threw another quick glance over my shoulder i love being with you dear but i really shouldnt be standing out here its just me isnt it youre afraid of being here with me dammit no i said that isnt it at all its just that i i told you nothing more would happen to you britt im all right now and therell never be anything like that again and dont you believe me her voice broke and she turned her head quickly looking at the scantily populated countryside across the road there were a few houses scattered over a wide area and land had been graded for a number of others but everything had come to a halt with the advent of the garbage dump on former rainstar property manny i said listen to me please listen to me manny well she faced me again but slowly her gaze still lingering on the nearempty expanse beyond the road seeming to search for something there yes britt im not afraid of being here with you at all you said that nothing more would happen to me and i believe you its just that im supposed to stay in the house not to come outside at all and im afraid therell be a hell of a brouhaha if but youve been going out manny smiled at me thinly youve been going out and staying out for hours what i said why do you say that why she said yes why do i ive certainly no right to make an issue of it and before i could say anything more she nodded coldly and drove away i looked after her as her car sped down the driveway and turned into the road became lost in the dust of the ubiquitous dump trucks wending their way toward the garbage hummocks i turned away vaguely troubled and moved absently toward the porch i went up the steps still discomfited and puzzled by mannys attitude but grateful that kay had not discovered me in my fracture of a strict order one of the few unhappy aspects of sex is that it places you much too close physically while you are still mentally poles apart so that a categorical imperative is apt to be juxtaposed with a constitutional impossibility for how can one kick someone or part of someone that he has laved with love i couldnt face up to the consequences of kay noltons throwing her weight around with me again no sadist i i could not slug the provably and delightfully screwable i reached the top step and there was a sudden angry sound at my ear the buzz of a maddened hornet the hornet zoomed in and stung me painfully on the forehead the sting burning like acid i slapped at it then rubbed the tortured flesh with my fingers as a boy growing up on the old place i had been hit by hornets many times but i could remember none having the effect of this one it was numbing almost as if i had been hit by an instrument that was at once edged and blunt i felt a little dizzy and faint and i took my hand away from my head i stared at it stupidly it was red and wet dripping with blood and more blood was dripping down onto the agefaded wood of the porch my knees buckled slowly and i sank down to them my eyes closed and i slowly toppled over and lay prone my last thought before i lost consciousness was of manny her indirect insistence that i accompany her to her car the hurt in her voice and her eyes when i had hesitated about leaving the safety of the house hurt which i could only expunge by doing what i had been sternly ordered not to do so i had done as she wanted because i loved her and believed in her and then loving and trusting her i had remained out in the open exposed to the danger which is always latent in loving and trusting i had lingered at the side of her car pleading with her and she had sat with her back turned to me her gaze searching the landscape apparently searching it for a signal a rifle say with a telescopic sight i heard myself laugh even as the very last of my consciousness glimmered away because you see it was really terribly funny almost as funny as it was sad i had always shunned guns always maintaining that guns had been known to kill people and even defenseless animals and that those who fooled around with guns had holes in their heads and now i i i had been and i had a hole in my when i came back into my consciousness i was lying on my own bed and kay was hunkered down at the bedside staring anxiously into my face i started to rear up but she pressed me back upon the pillows i stammered nonsensically what why where how and then the jumble in my mind cleared and i said how did i get up here who brought me up shhh said kay i we made it together remember with me steering you and hanging onto you for dear life mrs olmstead helped you i wouldnt have thought the old gal had it in her mrs olmstead isnt back yet shes never around when you need her for anything now will you just shut up for goodness sake and tell me how doggone it anyway kay scowled her voice rising angrily its just too darned much i have to follow that woman around do everything over after shes done it i have to watch you every minute to keep you from doing something silly and all i get is bawled out for it i have to oh come on now i said it really isnt that bad is it yes it is and now youve made me lose control of myself and act as crazy as you are now you listen to me britt rainstar are you listening she was trembling with fury her face an unrelieved white against the contrasting red of her hair i tried to take her hand and she knocked it away then she quickly recovered it and squeezed it smiling at me determinedly through gritted teeth i asked you if you were oh the heck with it she said how are you feeling honey tolable maam i said tolerable how are you she said she was darned mad thats how she was then she told me to hold still darn it and she tested the strip of adhesive bandage on my forehead and then she leaned down and gently kissed it does it hurt very much britt you wouldnt ask that if you were really a nurse what what do you mean by that anyone with the slightest smattering of medical knowledge knows that when you kiss something you make it well ha she brushed her lips against mine you were told not to leave this house britt not under any circumstances why did you do it it wasnt really going out i said i just saw miss aloe to her car and you got shot but there was no connection between the two events shed been gone for oh a couple of minutes when it happened what does that prove im sure she had nothing to do with it i said stubbornly she told me she was sorry for what shed done and she swore that thered be no more trouble and she was telling the truth i know she was kay and i know you got shot kay said i also know that ill get blamed for it its not my fault you practically threw me out of your office and told me to leave you alone i was only ttrying to look after you bbut you i cut in on her telling her to listen to me and listen good and when she persisted obviously working herself up to a tear storm i took her by the shoulders and shook her dont you pull that on me i said dont pretend that that little stunt you pulled down in my office was an attempt to protect me you were just being nosy acting like a jealous wife miss aloe and i were discussing business and ha i know her kind of business shes got her business right in her well never mind i wont say it she dropped her eyes blushing i stared at her grimly and finally she looked up and asked me what i was looking at at you i said whats with this blushing bit i think its just about impossible for you to be embarrassed i dont think youd be embarrassed if you rode naked through coventry on a kiddykar with a bullseye on each titty and a feather duster up your arse youve repeatedly proved that youre shameless goddammit yet you go around kicking shit and turning red as a billy goats butt every time you see the letter p you oops said kay whoops and she lost her balance and went over backwards sitting down on the floor with a thud she sat thus shaking and trembling her hands covering her face making rather strange and fearful sounds whats the matter i said are you throwing a fit thats all i need by god a blushing fitthrower and her hands came away from her face they were literally exploded as she burst into wild peals of laughter the force of it made me wince but it was somehow contagious i started laughing too laughing harder at each new blast from her and the harder i laughed the harder she laughed that kind of laughter does something to some people and it did it to her she staggered to her feet trying to get to the bathroom but she just couldnt make it instead she fell down across me now crying from laughing so much and i took her by her wet seat and hauled her over to my other side you dirty girl i said why dont you carry a cork with you ddont she begged please ddont i didnt that is i didnt say anything more for practically anything will start a person up again when he has passed a certain point in laughing we lay quiet together with the only sound the sound of our breathing after a long time she sighed luxuriously and asked if i really minded her blushing and i said i supposed there were worse things i dont know why i do it britt but i always have ive tried not to but it just makes it worse i used to know a girl who was that way i said but an old gypsy cured her of it i told her how it was done following the old gypsys instructions she sprinkled salt on a sparrows tail when it was looking the other way when the sparrow flew off it took her blushes with her just like that kay said she didnt blush any more no but it started a blushing epidemic among the sparrows for years before they lost their shame by dodoing on people the midnight sky was brilliant with their blushes and darn you an incipient trembling of the bed you shut up i said quickly that we should both think of something unpleasant something that definitely was not a laughing matter and it was no trouble at all to think of such a something im gonna catch holy heck kay said solemnly boy oh boy am i gonna catch it you mean im going to catch it i said i was the one that got shot but i let you i didnt stop you from going outside stop me how the hell could you stop me im a grown man and if i wanted to go outside id go regardless of what you said or did youll see kay said sergeant claggett will hold me responsible hes already said he would i couldnt talk her out of her qualms nor did i try to very hard i was the one who had goofed and i would hear from claggett about that but she would be held responsible he would have her yanked off the job possibly even fired look kay i said we dont know that i was actually shot we dont know anything of the kind now do we kay said that of course we knew it at least she did that crease across my temple had been put there by a bullet now we dont know she added thoughtfully that anyone was actually trying to hit you that it was a professional say which it would just about have to be wouldnt it if the shooting was intentional why thats right i said and a pro wouldnt have just creased me hed have put one through my head ill bet it was an accident kay some character hunting rabbits across the road or or else i broke off remembering the other things that had happened to me or else what britt he wasnt trying to kill me or seriously injure me just to give me a bad jolt oh said kay slowly oh yes i guess youre probably right all right i guess your darling little miss aloe was lying when she promised not to give you any more trouble i snapped that manny hadnt been lying something that i was by no means sure of much as i wanted to be kay shrugged that of course i knew more about my business than she did so who was responsible for the shooting if manny was not i thought she was the only one you and sergeant claggett suspected of giving you such a bad time i mean i guess you did say that her uncle might be involved but you really didnt seem to believe it didnt and dont i said curtly that was just a farout possibility well just dont you worry your sweet tintedgray head about it said kay i imagine that miss aloe just forgot that shed ordered someone to take a shot at you ill bet that now that she remembers doing it shes just as sorry as she can be i said something that sounded like ship but wasnt kay said brightly that shed just thought of another explanation for the shooting manny had ordered it and then ordered it canceled but the gunman had forgotten the cancellation thats probably what happened britt dont you think so of course youd think a professional gunman would be a little more careful but oh well thats life thats life i said and this is my hand and if you dont stop needling me dammit im sorry darling it just about had to be an accident didnt it a stray bullet from a hunters gun well i hesitated right said kay so theres no reason to tell sergeant claggett that you were ever outside the house hed just get all upset and mad and maybe take me away from you and oh boy sighed kay am i glad to get that settled lets go to the bathroom shall we we went to the bathroom we got out of our clothes and washed and helped each other wash and kay carefully removed the adhesive strip and examined my head wound mmmhmm it doesnt look so bad britt how does it feel no problem a very slight itching and stinging occasionally well well leave it unbandaged for the time being let the air get to it have you felt any more faintness nope not the faintest she lowered the toilet seat and told me to sit down on it i did and she took my pulse while resting a palm on my forehead then the bathroom suddenly began to shake there was a sudden ominous creaking and cracking slowly mounting in volume kay pitched sideways and her mouth opened to scream i laughed grabbed her and pulled her down on my lap its all right i said dont be afraid ive been through the same thing a dozen times theres a lot of shaking and trembling and some of the damnedest racket you ever heard but i tightened my grip on her for the shaking was already pretty violent and the noise was so bad that i was virtually yelling in her ear the house was settling i explained something it had done sporadically for decades the phenomenon was due to aging and exceptionally heavy building materials and possibly to deep subterranean springs which lay beneath the structure but frightening as it was to anyone unaccustomed to it there was absolutely no danger in a few minutes it would be all over the few minutes were actually more than ten kay sat with her arms wound around my neck hanging on so tightly at times that i was almost strangled it was not a bad way to go though if one had to being hugged to death by a girl who was not only very pretty but also very naked and i held her nakedness to mine as enthusiastically as she held mine to hers it was so pleasant in fact that neither of us was in any hurry to let go even after the noise and the trembling had ceased i patted her on the flank and said she wiggled very good she whispered naughtily in my ear something which i shall not repeat and then she blushed violently and i even blushed a little myself i was trying to think of some suitable or rather unsuitable reply when she let out a startled gasp oh my god britt she pointed a trembling finger llook i looked and laughed its all right i said giving her another flank spank it always does that bbut the doorknob turned its still turning i know i imagine every other doorknob in the place is doing the same thing as i understand it the house undergoes a kind of windingup during the settling process then when the tension is relieved theres a general relaxing or unwinding and you see such things as doors flying open or their knobs turning kay said whew brushing imaginary perspiration from her brow it scared me to death britt really no it didnt kay i said really well i sure wouldnt want to be alone when it happened you see the knob turn and how do you know someones not there very simply i said if someones there he just opens the door the door opened and sergeant claggett came in he stood frozen in his tracks for a moment blinking at us incredulously then he said excuse me retreating across the threshold with a hasty back step excuse me for not getting up i said i want to see you downstairs britt he spoke with his head turned immediately understand of course i said just as soon as i get something in order and you too he addressed kay without looking at her i want to see you too officer nolton i suppose i should have seen the truth from the start almost any fool would have i am sure so that should have qualified me for seeing it i hadnt because i am a plain gardenvariety sort of fool not the devious kind i am a worshipper at the shrine of laissez faire a devotee of the status quo i accept things as they are for what they are without proof or documentation i ask no more than a quid pro quo and failing to get a fair exchange i will normally accept the less that is offered in a word i am about as undevious as one can be and having no talent nor liking for deception i am easily deceived as per the present instance claggett wanted me to have roundtheclock protection which is not easily managed by a mere detective sergeant in an undermanned tightly budgeted police department he didnt want me to know that i had such protection believing that i would inadvertently reveal it where it was best not revealed so the cop he planted on me was also a nurse someone whose presence in the house would be taken for granted and since she was a nurse he could have her wages paid by pxas insurers thus quieting any objections from the pd naive as i was i would still ask myself why a nurse would take such a potentially dangerous job claggett had provided the answer by making it appear that there was something wrong with her or that there could be something wrong with her that not only satisfied my curiosity as to why she was taking the job but it would also he hoped make me wary of her i would shy away from any personal involvement with her and she would not be distracted from her duties as a cop well the deception had worked fine up to a point a cop had been planted on me and i had no idea that she was a cop doubts about her good intentions had been planted in my mind and i did my damnedest to hold her at a distance why then had i wound up in bed with her how could she have been so outrageously derelict in her duty claggett swore savagely that it was too damned much for him i said somewhat uncomfortably that he seemed to be making too much of a much over the matter after all its friday afternoon jeff everyone relaxes and lets down a bit on friday afternoon everyone doesnt have a nut after him snapped claggett a screwedup broad whos been snatching his scalp by bits and pieces and just may decide she wants his life along with it now jeff i said im practically convinced that manny shut up claggett said and turned coldly to kay i dont believe you were wearing a gun when i arrived today what do regulations say about that im sorry sir i youre a disgrace said claggett cutting me off again before i was able to say anything effective i found the door unlocked and standing wide open and you naked and unarmed with the man you were supposedly protecting yyes sir im thoroughly ashamed sir and i swear it wont happen again no it wont youre suspended from duty as of this moment and youll be up before the disciplinary board just as soon as i can arrange it kay wasnt blushing any more she was apparently fresh out of blushes and she was very pale as she got to her feet whatever you say sergeant ill start getting my things together claggett brought her back to her chair with a roar you officer nolton will remain in this room until you are told to do otherwise as for you britt he gave me a look of weary distaste ive been trying to help you and ive gone to considerable lengths to do it much further than i should have in fact do you think this was the right way to repay me of course i dont since you obviously consider it wrong and its caused problems for miss nolton i myself dont feel that it was wrong per se but theres a variable factor involved i mean something is good only so long as it doesnt make others unhappy hmmm he said his blue eyes brooding well i do feel that youve let me down but that doesnt excuse officer nolton if it should lets face it jeff i said im quite a bit older than miss nolton also a lot more experienced and im afraid i was persistent with her to a shameful degree please dont blame her jeff it really was all my fault claggetts brows went up he grimaced lips pursed then turned an enigmatic gaze on kay how about it nolton is that the way it was well i am much younger than she broke off sat very erect and dignified i wouldnt care to say sir claggett ran a hand over his mouth he looked at kay a moment or two longer apparently seeing something in her of great interest then faced back around to me you started to say something about miss aloe anything important i think so she was out here to the house today and she apologized for what shed done implied that she hadnt been rational or responsible for her actions and she promised not to make any more trouble got pretty emotional about it im convinced that she meant it jeff well im not said kay and here came that pretty blush again im sorry sergeant i didnt mean to butt in but ive observed miss aloe very carefully and i thought youd want my opinion as a police officer i do said claggett in detail please shes just a snippy snotty little wop thats what im sure there are a great many good people of her race but shes not one of them claggetts interest in her seemed to increase tremendously he would shift his fascinated gaze away from her then as though against his will it would slowly move back and fasten on her again meanwhile he was saying that he had undergone a complete change of mind and that she should by all means remain on her present duty oh thank you sergeant she smiled on him brilliantly i know you were kind of disappointed about but it wont happen again sir ah well said claggett easily a pretty young girl and a handsome sophisticated older man how could i blame you for succumbing and whats to blame anyway just dont forget youve got business here too yes sir i wont get caught with my ill remember sir good claggett beamed im sure you mean that and it wouldnt be practical to pull you off the job anyway not with so short a time to go uh sir i mean we should know how things stand with miss aloe very soon if shes going to pull anything shell do it within the next week or so dont you think well kay hesitated doubtfully why do you say that sir because shes a very pretty girl too claggett said and pretty girls have a way of being jealous of other pretty girls if she still cares enough for mr rainstar to be mad at him shell try to stop him having fun with you and she wont waste time about it kay said well yes sir maybe but rather doubtfully not exactly sure that she had been complimented claggett said he was glad she agreed with him and he was glad to be glad he said because he was really pretty sad when he thought of her imminent resignation from the police department just as soon as youve finished this assignment of course he went on i realize its the smart thing for you to do a girl whos shown an aptitude for so many things in such a short span of time lets see youve been a nurse a secretary an airline stewardess a yes officer nolton i said you can have my resignation right now if you want it and you know what you can do with it too well sure sure claggett said heartily for that matter i could have you kicked out on your ass for stated reasons that would make it hard for you to get a job washing towels in a whorehouse well he paused do you want me to do that kay muttered something under her breath claggett leaned forward i didnt hear you speak up i kay wet her lips no sir i dont want you to dont want me to do what dont i said for gods sake drop it jeff he gestured curtly ordering me to butt out to mind my own business and let him mind his i said i couldnt do that youve made your point jeff so let it go at that you dont need to watch her bleed i crossed over to kay spoke to her gently want to go up to your room itll be all right with the sergeant wont it jeff yeah hell dammit he said sourly kay i touched her on the shoulder want me to help you she shook off my hand she buried her face in her hands and began to shake with silent weeping claggett and i exchanged a glance he stood up jerked his head toward the door and went out i took another glance at kay saw that her trembling had stopped and followed him we shook hands at the front door and he apologized for coming down hard on kay but he seemed considerably less than overwhelmed with regret the little lady had been under official scrutiny for a long time he said and her conduct today had simply triggered an already loaded gun im not referring to catching her in the raw with you i had to bawl her out for it but thats as far as it would have gone if thered been nothing more than that it was her attitude about it her attitude in general the things she said if you know what i mean he sighed shook his head and if you dont know to hell with you i know i said but she was pretty upset jeff if youll look at things from her viewpoint i wont said jeff you can be fair without seeing the other fellows side of things britt keep doing that and you stop having a side of your own you get so damned broadminded that you dont know right from wrong i said that i didnt always know now and he said i should ask him whenever i was in doubt incidentally i spoke to a lawyer about the way youd been gypped out of your property for that city dump and he thinks youve got a hell of a good case in fact hes willing to take it on a contingency for a third of what he can recover but ive told you i said i just cant do it jeff im simply not up to a courtroom battle my lawyer friend thinks theyd go for an outofcourt settlement well maybe i said but connie would be sure to find out about it and id still be up the creek shed grab any money i got and give me a good smearing besides i dont see that claggett frowned youve been sending her quite a bit of money havent you better than four thousand since i got out of the hospital then why should she want to give you a bad time why should she throw a wrench in a money machine she hurts you she hurts herself i nodded said he was probably right but still im just afraid to do it jeff i dont know why i am but i am he looked at me exasperatedly and seemed on the point of saying something pointed instead however he sighed heavily and said he guessed i just couldnt help it but think it over anyway wont you you dont need to commit yourself but you can at least think about it cant you oh well sure i said sure ill think about it thats a promise of course i said he left i returned to kay who was wellprepared to receive me i could simply kill you she exploded you made me lose my job you stupid old boob you im sorry i said but im sure you were much too good for it i was not i mean why didnt you speak up for me it was all your fault anyway but you didnt say a word to defend me i thought i did but possibly i didnt say enough i said i really dont think it would have changed anything however regardless of what id said oh you what do you know you silly old fool very little i said and at the rate im aging im afraid i wont be able to add much to my store of knowledge she glared at me her face blotched and ugly like a soiled picture she said angrily that i hadnt needed to act like a fool had i well had i you didnt even give him time to open his mouth before you were cracking your silly jokes saying that i couldnt wear my gun because it didnt match my birthday suit and a lot of other stupid silly stuff well you werent funny not a doggone bit just a plain darned fool thats all you were i know i said you know its a protective device i nodded the iaintnothinbutahounddawg syndrome when a dog cant cope he flops over on his back thumps his tail wiggles his paws and exposes his balls briefly he demonstrates that he is a harmless and amusing fellow so why the hell should anyone hurt him and it works pretty well with other dogs literal and figurative the meanest mastiff has never masticated me but ive taken some plumb awful stompings from pussycats huh you think youre so smart dont you meow sppftt i said it was a pretty grim weekend mrs olmstead decided to replace her usual grumbling and mumbling with silence the kind in which conversation is omitted but not the clashing and crashing of pans the smashing of dishes and the like kay performed her nurses duties with a vengeance taking my pulse and temperature every hour on the hour or so it seemed to me and generally interrupting me so often in doing her job that doing my own was virtually impossible sunday night after dinner there was a respite in the turmoil kay had retired to her room for a time and mrs olmstead was apparently doing something that could not be done noisily at any rate it seemed to be a good time to do some writing and i dragged a chair up to my typewriter and went to work or rather i tried to the weekends incessant clatter and interruptions had gotten me so keyed up that i couldnt write a word i got up and paced around my office then went back to my typewriter i squirmed and fidgeted and stared helplessly at the paper and finally i went out into the kitchen for a cup of coffee i shook the pot discovering that there was still some in it i put it on the stove to warm and got a cup and saucer from the cupboard moving very quietly to be sure keeping an eye on the door to mrs olmsteads quarters and listening for any sounds that might signal a resumption of her racket i poured my coffee and sipped it standing by the stove then quietly washed and dried the cup and saucer and returned them to the cupboard and suddenly i found myself grimacing with irritation at the preposterousness of my situation this was my house kay and mrs olmstead were working for me yet they had made nothing but trouble for me throughout the weekend and they had certainly not refrained from throwing their weight around before then forcing me to cater to them and just why the hell should things be this way why had most of my life been like this a constant givingin and knucklingunder to people who didnt give a damn about my welfare regardless of what they professed or pretended i was brooding over the matter silently swearing that there were going to be some changes made when i became aware of a very muted buzzing so muted that i almost failed to hear it i looked around listening trying to locate the source of the sound i looked down at the floor saw the faint outline of the telephone cord extending along the baseboard of the cabinetwork and i yanked open the door of the lower cupboard and snatched out the telephone just as manny was about to give up and hang up she asked me where in the world id been and i said id been right there and id explain the delay in answering when i saw her but im sorry i kept you waiting i wasnt expecting any calls tonight i know but i just had to call you britt ive been reading the manuscript you gave me on erosion and i think its wonderful darling absolutely beautiful the parallel you draw between the decline of the soil and the deterioration of the people the lowering of life expectancy and the incidence of serious disease britt i cant tell you when ive been so excited about something well thank you i said grinning from ear to ear im very pleased that you like it oh i do in its own way i think its every bit as good as deserts on the march i mumbled pleased saying nothing that made any sense im sure even to be mentioned in the same breath with dr paul sears classic work was overwhelming and i knew that manny wasnt simply buttering me up to make me feel good theres only one thing wrong with what youve done she went on its far too good for us youve got to make it into a fulllength book that will reach the kind of audience it deserves but pxa is paying for it paying very well too i know but im sure something can be worked out with pat ill talk to him after i talk to you lets see the day after tomorrow is it thats right i said well i havent read all youve done and i want to read back through the whole manuscript before our meeting so she hesitated im not sure i can make it on tuesday suppose i call you wednesday and see what we can set up i said that was fine with me i was glad to have the additional time to work we talked a few minutes more largely about the work and how well she liked it then we hung up and i started to leave the kitchen and mrs olmsteads surly voice brought me to a halt whats going on here anyways wakin folks up at this time onight her face was sleeppuffed her eyes streaked with threads of yellowish matter she rubbed them with a grayishlooking fist meanwhile surveying me sourly well she grunted i ast you a question mister rainstar hold out your hands i said huh she blinked stupidly what for hold them out now she held them out i put the phone in them took her by the elbow and hustled her out to the hallway writing desk i took the phone out of her hands and placed it on the desk now that is where it belongs i said and that is where i want it can you remember that mrs olmstead she said surlily that she could she could remember things a heck of a lot better than people who couldnt even remember to mail a letter i tell you one thing though that phones out here an im back in the kitchen i aint sure im gonna hear it all right i said when youre actually in the kitchen working you can keep the phone with you but never put it away in a cupboard where i found it just now she shrugged started to turn away without answering one thing more i said ive noticed that were always running out of shopping money no matter how much i leave for you you use it its going to have to stop mrs olmstead now you listen to me she said shaking a belligerent finger at me i cant help it that groceries is high i dont spend a nickel more for em than i have to i said i knew groceries were high i also knew that jack daniels was high and id noticed several bottles of it stowed in the bottom cupboard youll have to start drinking something cheaper i said you apparently do a great deal of drinking in bars when youre supposedly out shopping so i cant supply you with jack daniels for your home consumption she looked pretty woebegone at that so i told her not to worry about it for gods sake and to go to bed and get a good nights sleep and watching her trudge away shoulders slumped in her dirty old robe i felt like nine kinds of a heel because really why fuss about a little booze if it made her feel good at her age with all passion spent and the capacity for all other good things gone she surely was entitled to good booze drinking was probably all that made lifebecomeexistence tolerable for her as it probably is for all who drink i went to bed and to sleep thinking that the reason i hated getting tough with people was that it was too tough on me the next day went fairly well for me there was practically no trouble from mrs olmstead i avoided any with kay by simply submitting to her ministrations i got in a good days work and continued to work until after nine that night around ten while i was toweling myself off after a shower kay came into the bathroom bearing a thermometer i took her by the shoulders pushed her outside and locked the door when i had finished drying myself i put on my pajamas came out of the bathroom and climbed into bed nodding at kay who stood waiting for me primfaced does that mean she said icily that i now have your permission to take your temperature if you like i said well thank you so much she said she took my temperature i held up my wrist and she took my pulse almost hurling my hand away from her when she had finished she left then turning the light off and closing the door very gently some twenty minutes later she tapped on the door with her fingernails pushed it open and came in through slitted eyes i watched her approach my bed a soft sweetsmelling shadow in the dim glow of the hall light she stood looking down at me then her hands came out from behind her and went up over her head and they were holding a long sharp knife i let out a wild yell but the knife was already plunging downward it stabbed against my chest then folded over as cardboard will and kay fell across me shaking with laughter after a time she crawled over into bed next to me shedding her shorty nightgown en route she nuzzled me and whispered naughtily in my ear i told her she wasnt funny dammit shed damned near scared me to death she said she was terribly sorry but shed just had to snap me out of my stiffishness some way and i said oh well we were about to take it from there when i remembered something and sat up abruptly my god i said youve got to get out of here this place is going to be full of cops in about a minute what what the heck are you talking about the walls are bugged any loud cry for help will bring the police britt darling she said soothingly you just lie right back down here by mama you just shut your mouth so mama can kiss it but you dont understand dammit jeff claggett couldnt stake the place out but i was afraid to come back here without plenty of protection so so he told you that story said kay and determinedly pulled me back down at her side and he gave you me its all the protection he could give you and its all you need take it from officer nolton britt soontoberesigned officer nolton thanks to your dear friend the sergeant knock it off i said crossly i had an idea all along that i was being kidded why of course you did kay said smoothly and now youre sure and now of course i was since my yell for help had brought no response jeff had deceived me about the house being bugged just as he had about kays status he had done it in my own best interests and i was hardly inclined to chide or reproach him still i couldnt help feeling that uneasiness which comes to one whose welfare is almost totally dependent upon another person no matter how wellintentioned that person may be nor could i help wondering whether there were other deceptions i didnt yet know about or whether something meant for my own good might turn out just the opposite my sense of uneasiness increased rather than diminished it became so aggravated under kays incessant inquiries as to what was bothering me that i blew up and told her she was everything about you is getting to me i said that blushing trick the prudishsweet manner the cutekiddy way you talk like you wouldnt say crap if you were up to your collar in it the oh crud to it i said youve got me so bollixed up i dont know what im saying anymore we were in my bedroom at the time where else and i was fully prepared to go to bed by myself kay said she was sorry she got on my nerves but id feel a lot better after i had something she had for me she started to climb into bed with me i put a leg up in the air warding her off she tried to come by the other way and i stuck up an arm she frowned at me hands on her hips now you see here i have as much right to that bed as you have right to it i said you talk like a girl in a wooden hat baby you said you didnt think i was awful because i did it i mean you said youd marry me if you werent already married which i am i said dont forget that kay said that part didnt matter what was important was that i wanted to marry her and that kind of made her my wife and this was a community property state so half of the bed was hers and while i was unraveling that one she hopped over me and into the bed i let her stay for one thing it is very hard to push a beautiful wellbuilt girl out of your bed for another while i knew she had skunked me again that i had fallen for her act it was a very good act and what did one more fall matter to an incurable fall guy by the following day wednesday my feelings of uneasiness had blossomed into a sense of foreboding the feeling grew in me that things had gotten completely out of hand and were about to become worse and that there was nothing i could do about it it wasnt helped much by the bitter look mrs olmstead gave me as she departed to do her shopping or drinking or whatever she did with my money nor was i cheered by a brief bit of sharpness which i had with manny when she called to make an appointment with me we finally made one for that afternoon but i was still feeling quite down and a little irritated when kay showed her into my office around four oclock as it turned out she also was not feeling her best a fact she admitted as soon as our opening pleasantries were over i dont want to argue with you britt she said but you look quite well i think youre probably in a lot better condition than i am and as long as youve been going out anyway it isnt as if you were bedridden i dont see why you couldnt have come to the office wait a minute i said hold it right there regardless of how well i look or dont look im under strict orders not to leave the house but i called here several times when you were out at last mrs olmstead told me you were of course manny paused frowning of course that could have been her way of saying that you just didnt want to talk to me thered never be a time when i didnt want to talk to you you should know that i know but she hesitated again perhaps it wasnt mrs olmstead i thought it was and she said it was but do you suppose it could have been whatshername your nurse ill find out i said i know theyve been feuding and they just might have one of them might have tried to drag me into the quarrel i pondered the matter a moment then sighed and threw up my hands hell ill never find out both of them are entirely capable of lying poor britt manny laughed softly well it doesnt matter dear it doesnt bother me now that i know you havent been going out at all i havent been thats the truth manny i believe you the only time ive left the house was when i walked to your car with you last friday well she smiled at me her golden head tilted to one side since its been so long maybe you should walk to my car with me again today well well her smiled faded began to draw in around the edges youre afraid to is that it you still dont trust me i havent said that i said you gave me your word that i had nothing more to fear from you and im more than anxious to believe you i could probably say something more positive if i wasnt a little bewildered yes about what about your visit here this afternoon i thought you were here to discuss my manuscript but weve talked about practically nothing except my mishandled telephone calls and my walking to your car with you mannys expression cleared and she apologized hastily im sorry dear you have every right to be puzzled but i like the manuscript better than ever and pat thinks its a fine job too he agrees that you should make a book out of it and there wont be any problem about the money well call it square for the right to do a digest thats very generous of you i said and im very grateful we consider it a privilege to be associated with the project i just wish i could be here to see it through to the end not that you need my help of course but i cant be ththats wwhy she averted her head suddenly thats why i made such a big thing of being outside the house with you even for a little while i dont understand i said what do you mean you cant be here until the work is finished i mean this is the last time ill see you im leaving the company and going back east bbut i stared at her stunned but why im getting married i continued to stare at her i shook my head incredulously unable to believe what i had heard youre the only person ive told so please keep it to yourself i dont want anyone else to know just yet married my manny getting married but you cant i suddenly exploded i wont let you oh she smiled at me sadly why not britt well all right i said doggedly i cant marry you not now anyway maybe never but why the big hurry wed got everything straightened out between us and i thought that that that we could pick up where we left off idve been willing to settle for that at least until something better could be worked out but it just isnt possible she stood up and held out her hand goodbye and good luck britt wait a minute i also stood up and i took her hand and held onto it who is this guy anyway you wouldnt know him i knew him in the east a long time ago but why are you suddenly rushing into marriage with him why do you think im rushing but never mind its settled britt so please let go of my hand i let go of it she turned toward the door and i started to accompany her but she gestured for me to remain where i was im afraid im pretty stupid darling its the police whove ordered you to stay in the house isnt it and your nurse is one of them yes i said to both questions thats what pat figured he remembered her from somewhere and it finally dawned on him that hed seen her in uniform all right i said shes a cop and im under orders not to leave the house but i did it once and since this is a pretty special occasion the last time well see each other no she said sharply youll stay inside as youve been told to i said id at least walk to the front door with her and i did she held out her hand to me again a firm little smile on her face and i took it and pulled her into my arms there was the briefest moment of resistance then she came to me almost violently as though swept on a wave of emotion she embraced me kissed me over and over ran her soft small hands through my hair and kay nolton cleared her throat noisily and said well excuse me manny drew away from me giving kay an icy look how long were you watching us she demanded or did you lose track of the time never you mind toots im paid to watch people you should be paying said manny you get so much fun out of it and before kay could come up with a retort she was out of the house and slamming the door of the car kay said something obscene then turned angrily on me she said it was a darned good thing that manny wasnt coming back to the house and that she kay would snatch her baldheaded if she ever did i accused her of snooping listening outside the door while manny and i were talking she said i was doggone right shed been listening and if i didnt like it i could do the next best thing i went into my office and closed the door and at dinnertime she brought a tray to me also bringing a cup of coffee for herself she sat down across from me sipping from it as i ate i complimented her on the dinner and made other small talk in the midst of it she broke in with a curt question why isnt miss aloe coming here to the house any more britt i know she isnt but i dont know why you mean you missed part of our conversation i said answer me ive got a right to know i lifted the tray from my lap and set it on a chair i shook out my napkin and dropped it on top of the tray then i leaned back in my chair and looked thoughtfully out the window well she said sullenly i was just mulling over your remark i said about your having a right to know i dont feel that you have a right to know anything about my personal affairs but i can see how you might and i suppose its my fault that you do so to answer your question miss aloe is giving up her position here and going back east thats why i wont be seeing her again kay said oh in a rather timid tone she said that she was sorry if shed said or done anything that she shouldnt have i shook my head brushing off her statement not trusting myself to speak i was suddenly overwhelmed by my sense of loss the knowledge of how much manny had meant to me and i jumped up and went over to the window stood there staring out into the gathering dusk behind me i heard kay getting up quietly i heard her pick up the dinner tray and leave the room softly clicking the door shut behind her several minutes passed then she knocked and came in again carrying the phone on its long extension cord she handed it to me and started to leave but i motioned for her to remain she did so taking the chair she had occupied before britt it was jeff claggett how was your visit with miss aloe all right i said at least partly all right shes leaving town and going back east yes within the next day or so i believe the hell he grunted with surprise just like that huh she give you any reason well i hesitated i dont need to consult with her anymore im going ahead with the work on my own yes nothing else i couldnt say i said carefully what else could there be and what does it matter anyway i am sure that i have nothing more to fear from her im positive of it jeff and thats all im concerned about so who said no he sounded amused why so emphatic let it go i said the point is that theres no longer any reason to continue our present arrangement if youd like to make it official miss nolton is right here and hold it hold it britt claggett snapped i think we can close things out there very soon but you leave it to me to say when okay well all right i said i think it would be better to why guess about something when you can be sure why not wait until miss aloe actually leaves town he paused then lowered his voice nolton throwing her weight around is that it britt well i sidled a glance at kay i imagine it would be difficult to make a change wouldnt it it would all right then i said ill manage we hung up and i passed the phone back to kay she took it silently but at the door she turned and gave me a stricken look i faced around to my typewriter and began pounding on the keys and i kept at it until i was sure she had gone i had had about enough of kay nolton what had started out as a pleasant giving something that we could both enjoy had wound up as an attempt to take me over i wasnt ready to be taken over and i never would be nor would i ever want to take anyone else over love isnt tantamount to ownership love is being part of someone else while still remaining yourself that was the way it had been with me and manny and now that she was gone from my life well kay could not fill the space manny had left it was too great for any other to fill kay left me alone that night which was just as well for her i had discovered that confronting people when they insisted on it was not nearly so fearful as i had thought and i was all ready to do it again the mood was with me the next day and when mrs olmstead appeared in my office doorway and announced that she needed more money to go shopping i flatly refused to give her any youve had far too much already i told her coldly youve constantly emptied that cash box in the telephone desk and then come grumbling to me for more you must have had over six hundred dollars in less than two weeks time the best thing you can do now is to pack up your belongings and clear out that dont make me mad none she glared at me defiantly you just pay me my wages an ill be out of here fastern you can say scat i dont have to pay you i said youve already paid yourself several times over if she had given me any kind of argument i probably would have relented but surprisingly she didnt argue at all oh she did a little underthebreath cursing on her way out of my office in no more than ten minutes however she was packed and gone from the house kay who had been standing by during the proceedings declared that i had done exactly the right thing you should have done it long ago britt you were far too patient with that woman ive been that way with a lot of people i said but its a fault im going to correct she dropped her eyes toeingin with one whiteshod foot a slow blush spreading up her cheeks to blend with the auburn of her hair it was all beautifully calculated i have never seen such control she was saying as clearly as if she had spoken that she had been a naughtynaughty girl and she was truly sorry for it will you forgive your naughty girl britt she spoke in a cutechilds voice shes awfully sorry and she promises never to be naughty again it doesnt matter i said forget it why of course it matters but ill be good from now on honey i swear ill i dont care whether you are or not i said i can hang by my thumbs a few days if i have to if it takes any longer than that to wrap things up here and if i still need a copnurse you wont be her she gave me no more argument than mrs olmstead had i was amazed at how easy it was to tell people off without being very proud of it although admittedly my experience was pretty limited i didnt feel much like working the thought of manny my manny being married to another was too much on my mind but i worked anyway and i was still at it when claggett arrived in midafternoon manny was back in the hospital he informed me the same reputable hospital she had been in before with the same reputable doctors in attendance and as before she was in absolute seclusion and no information about her condition or the nature of her illness was being given out i could probably get a court order and find out claggett said if i could show any reason why it was necessary for me to know but i cant think what the hell it would be probably there isnt any i said nothing sinister i mean she told me yesterday that she wasnt feeling well possibly she got to feeling worse and had to go to the hospital possibly but why so secretive about it well tell you something claggett said maybe im a little cynical but ive never known anyone to pull a coverup yet unless there was something to cover up thats probably true but this could hardly be called a coverup could it its close enough and the one thing ive found thats usually covered up with doctors is mental illness its my guess said claggett thoughtfully that miss aloe has had a nervous breakdown or something of the kind the second one in less than a month either that or shes pretending to so that leaves us with a couple of questions yes i said i mean it does to take the last one first if shes pretending why is she and secondly if shes actually had a nervous collapse what brought it on i just hope shes all right i said in any case i dont see what her being in the hospital has to do with me well it could be just a coincidence but the last time she was hospitalized you had a pretty bad accident it was a coincidence i said and wondered why i suddenly felt so uncomfortable and uneasy im positive that shes leveling with me jeff i knew it when she wasnt and i know it now that she is claggett shrugged and said that was good he himself would never trust his own judgment where someone he loved was concerned because you could love someone who was completely no good and untrustworthy but well see he said and stood up i have no basis for believing that shes not on the level with you but we shouldnt be long in finding out i walked to the door with him wondering whether i should tell him about mannys impending marriage but i had promised not to and i could think of no reason why i should we shook hands and he promised to keep me in touch then just as he was leaving he abruptly pulled me back from the door and moved back into the shadows himself i started to ask what was the matter and he gestured me to silence so we stood there tensely in silence waiting and then there was the sound of footsteps mounting to the porch and crossing to the door my view was obscured by jeff claggett and the heavy shadows of the porch but i could see a little see that a man was standing with his face pressed against the screen to peer inside apparently he also was having a problem in seeing for he reached down to the door handle pulled it open and stepped uncertainly across the threshold claggett grabbed him in a bonecrushing bear hug pinning his arms to his sides the man let out a startled gasp wwhats going on here you tell me you sonofabitch rasped claggett lets see how fast you can talk its all right jeff i said hes my fatherinlaw connies letters to me had gone unanswered when she telephoned mrs olmstead told her i had moved and that she had no idea where i was and for the last ten days or so the phone had simply gone unanswered luther bannerman had determined to find out just what was what and hed driven all the way here from the midwest to do it he was in the dining room now with kay stuffing himself with the impromptu meal she had prepared for him at my request rambling and rumbling on endlessly about my general worthlessness me an daughter just couldnt support him any longer so he comes back down here an he sent her a little money but it was like pulling teeth to get it out of him and this last month more than a month i guess he didnt send nothing no sir not one red cent so i just up and decided pass me that coffee pot will you miss yes and i believe ill have some more of them beans an potato salad and a few of them in the kitchen jeff claggett unwrapped the strip of black tape from around the telephone cord and held the two ends apart a real sweet old lady he laughed sourly well that takes care of any calls since she left today if you had any since then but im damned if i understand how she could head off the others i said it was easy as easy as it was for her to see that i got no mail that would reveal what she was up to she kept the phone out in the kitchen when she was in the house and when she was away she hid it where it couldnt be heard and you never caught on claggett frowned she pulls this for almost a month and you never tipped why should i i said if someone like you called of course shed see that you got through to me anyone else would be inclined to take her at her word she had a little luck ill admit but it wasnt all that hard to pull off with someone who gets and makes as few calls as i do yeah well lets get on with the rest of it claggett sighed i hate to ask but the answer is yes to both questions i said mrs olmstead mailed the checks i sent to my wife or rather she didnt mail them and she made my bank deposits for me or didnt make them claggett asked me if i hadnt gotten deposit slips and i said no but the amounts were noted in my bankbook claggett said hed just bet they were and hed bet i hadnt written for deposit only on the back of the checks i said i hadnt and couldnt i needed some cash for household expenses i explained and id run out of personal checks i had some on order but they never arrived i wonder why claggett laughed shortly well i guess theres no way of knowing how much shes taken you for offhand or how much if any we can recover when and if we catch up with her but mr blabbermouth or bannerman shapes up to me like a guy who means to get money out of you right now im sure of it i said i should have at least a few hundred left in the bank but it wouldnt be enough to get him off my back no he said with a guy like him theres never enough well he drew a glass of water from the sink drank it down thoughtfully want me to handle him for you well i hesitated how are you going to do it yes or no britt i said yes he said all right then he would do it and there was to be no interference from me we went to the dining room and sat down across from bannerman he had stuffed his mouth so full that a slimy trickle streaked down from the corner of it claggett told him disgustedly to use his napkin for gods sake my fatherinlaw did so but with a pious word of rebuke good men got good appetites mister detective surest sign there is of a clean conscience like i was telling the young lady we heard what you told her claggett said coldly the kind of crap id expect from a peabrain loudmouth no stick around nolton he nodded to kay who resumed her chair id like to know what you think of this character he already knows kay said i told him when he tried to give me a feel bannerman spluttered redfaced that hed done nothing of the kind hed just been tryin to show his appreciation for all the trouble shed gone to for him but kay had taken her cue from claggett that here was a guy who should have his ears pinned back and she was more than ready to do the job are you calling me a liar buster she gave him a pugnacious glare well are you he said nno maam course not i was just aaah shut up she said and claggett said yes shut up bannerman youve been talking ever since you stepped through the door today and now its time you did some listening you want to or do you want trouble he wants trouble kay said i dont neither bannerman waved his hands a little wildly britt make these people stop all right listen and listen good claggett said mr rainstar has already given your daughter a great deal of money i imagine hell probably provide her with a little more when hes able to which he isnt at present meanwhile you can pack up that rattletrap heap you drove down here in and get the hell back where you came from anger stained luther bannermans face the color of eggplant i know what i can do all right he said hoarsely an its just what im gonna do im gonna have mr britton rainstar in jail for the attempted murder of my daughter how are you going to do that claggett asked you and your daughter are going to be in jail for the attempted murder of mr rainstar wwhat bannermans mouth dropped open why thats crazy you hated his guts claggett continued evenly youd convinced yourselves that he was a very bad man by being different than you were by being poor instead of rich so you tried to kill him and heres how you went about it he proceeded to explain despite bannermans repeated attempts to interrupt increasingly fearful and frantic attempts and his explanation was so cool and persuasive that it was as though he was reciting an actual chronicle of events the steering apparatus of my car had been tampered with also probably the accelerator evidence of the tampering would be destroyed of course when my car went over the cliff all that was necessary then was for me to be literally driven out of the house so angered that i would jump into the car and head for town but connie had overdone the business of making me angry she had pursued me to the kitchen door and been knocked unconscious when i flung it open and when i headed for town she was in the car with me thats the way it was wasnt it claggett concluded you and your daughter tried to kill mr rainstar and your little plan backfired on you my fatherinlaw looked at claggett helplessly he looked at me eyes welling piteously tell him britt tell him that connie and me wwouldnt that we just aint the kind of ppeople to to he broke off obviously very obviously overcome with emotion i wet my lips hesitantly in spite of myself i felt sorry for him this man who had done so much to humiliate me to make me feel small and worthless now seemed very much that way himself and i think i might have spoken up for him despite a stern glance from jeff claggett but my fatherinlaw compensated in blind doggedness for his considerable shortcomings in cerebral talents and he was talking again before i had a chance to speak ill tell you what happened he said surlily that fella right there that halfbreed injun britt rainstar tried to kill my daughter for her insurance he stood to collect a couple of hundred thousand dollars and that was just plenty of motive for a noaccount loafer like him claggett appeared astonished you mean to tell me that mr rainstar was your daughters beneficiary yes he was im in the insurance business and i wrote the policy myself well ill be damned claggett said in a shocked voice did you know about this britt i told you about it i said a little puzzled dont you remember mr bannerman wrote up a similar policy on me with my wife as beneficiary at the same time he nodded and said oh yes it all came back to him now but the company rejected you didnt they they wouldnt approve of your policy thats right i dont know why exactly but apparently i wasnt considered a very stable character or something of the kind you were a danged poor risk thats what bannerman said grimly just the kind of fella that would get himself in a fix with the law which is just what you went and done why if i hadnt spoken up to the sheriff after you tried to kill poor little connie he chopped the sentence off suddenly he gulped painfully as though swallowing something which had turned out to be much larger than he had thought kay gave him a cold narroweyed grin there was a snap to claggetts voice like a trap being sprung so mr rainstar was a pretty disreputable character was he was he bannerman i i i didnt say that i didnt say nothin like that atall an dont you sure you did and you told everyone in town what a nogoodnik he was a blabbermouth like you would be bound to tell em and dont think i wont dig up the witnesses wholl swear that you did but i didnt mean nothin by it i was just talkin bannerman whined you know how it is britt you say you wish someone was dead or youd like to kill em but no i said ive never said anything like that in my life you didnt trust your soninlaw bannerman claggett persisted and you sure as hell didnt like him but you allowed the policy on your daughter to stand a policy that made him her beneficiary why didnt you cancel it i never you mind bannerman said peevishly none of your doggoned business thats why claggett asked me if i had ever seen the policy and i said i hadnt he turned back to bannerman his eyes like blue ice there isnt any policy is there there never was it was just a gimmick to squeeze mr rainstar something to threaten him with when he tried to get a divorce that aint so there is too a policy all right whats the name of the insurance company i i disremember offhand bannerman stammered and then blurted out i dont have to tell you anyway now look you claggett leaned forward jaw jutting maybe you can throw your weight around with your friendly hometown sheriff maybe he thinks the sun rises and sets in your ass but with me youre just a pimple on the ass of progress so you tell me whats the name of the insurance company but i i really dont all right claggett made motions of rising dont tell me ill just check it out with the underwriters bureau and at that bannerman gave up he admitted weakly that there was no policy and that there never had been but he brazenly denied that he and connie had done wrong by lying about it ol britt was tryin to get a divorce and she had a right to keep him from it any way she could and never mind why she was so dead set against a divorce a woman didnt have to explain a thing like that the fact that she didnt want one was reason enough anyways connie hasnt been at all well since the accident taken all kinds of money to pervide for her if she hadnt had some way of scarin money out o britt apparently shes able to take care of herself now claggett said or do you have roundtheclock nurses and just remember ill check up on your story well bannerman hesitated yeah connies coming along pretty good right now course shes all jammed up inside an shes always gonna be an invalid what doctor told you that what doctors what hospital did her xrays well bannerman said weakly well and said no more jeff i said cant we wind this up just get this this thing the hell out of here if i have to look at him another minute im going to throw up claggett said he felt the same way and he jerked a thumb at bannerman and told him to beat it the latter said hed like to there was nothing hed like to do more but he just didnt see how he could do it i used practically every cent i had comin down here and that ol car of mine aint gonna go much further without some work bein done on it i want tget back home these here big cities aint for me but save it claggett said curtly youve probably got half of the first nickel you ever made but ill give you a stake to get rid of you nolton he gestured to kay get him in his car and see that he stays in it till i come out yes sir come on you she hustled my fatherinlaw out of the room and the front door opened then closed behind them i gave claggett my heartfelt thanks for the way he had handled things and promised to pay back whatever money he gave my fatherinlaw no problem he dismissed the matter but tell me britt i was just bluffing of course trying to shake him up but do you suppose he and your wife did try to kill you what for i said i was willing to get out of their lives i still am why should they risk a murder rap just because they hated me well hatred has been the motive for a lot of murders not with people like them i said not unless it would make them something ill tell you jeff i dont see them risking a nickel to see the holy ghost do a skirt dance he grinned then again becoming thoughtful he raised another question why is your wife so opposed to divorce dyou suppose i know youll give her money as long as you have it to give but money doesnt seem to have anything to do with it i said she was that way right from the beginning when i didnt have a cent and it didnt look like i ever would have i just dont know i shook my head there was a little physical attraction between us at one time very little but that didnt last and we never had any other interests in common well claggett shrugged bannerman was right about one thing a woman doesnt have to give a reason for not wanting a divorce we talked about other matters for a few minutes ie mrs olmstead my work for pxa and the prospects for suing over the condemnation of my land then he went back to bannerman again wondering why the latter had caved in so quickly when he claggett had threatened to call the underwriters bureau why didnt he try to bluff it out britt just tell me to go ahead and check he had nothing to lose by it and i might have backed down i dont know i said is it important weell he hesitated frowning yes i think it might be and i think it bears on the reason for your wifes not giving you a divorce dont ask me why its just a hunch but his voice died away i looked at his troubled face and again i felt that icy tingling at my spine a warning of impending doom and even as he was rising to leave a pall seemed to descend on the decaying elegance of the ancient rainstar mansion claggett drove off toward town to get some money for my fatherinlaw bannerman following him in his rattletrap old vehicle kay came back into the house while she prepared dinner for the two of us i cleaned up the mess luther bannerman had left and carried the dishes out to the kitchen she glanced at me as i took clean silver and plates from the cupboard asked if i was still mad at her i said i never had been id simply tried to set her straight on where we stood moreover i said i was grateful to her for the several jolts she had given my fatherin law she said that had been a pleasure but if youre not mad why do you look so funny britt so kind of down in the mouth maybe its because of seeing him i said he always did depress me on the other hand i left the sentence hanging unable to explain why i felt as i did the allpervading gloom that had settled over me kay said she was sort of down in the dumps herself for some reason maybe its this darn old house she said just staying inside here day after day the ceilings are so high that you can hardly see them the staircase goes up and up and its always dark and shadowy you feel like youre climbing one of those mountains that are always covered with clouds there are always a lot of funny noises like someone was sneaking up behind you and i laughed cutting her off the house was home to me and it had never struck me as being gloomy or depressing we both need a good stiff drink i said hold the dinner a few minutes and ill do the honors i couldnt find any booze mrs olmstead apparently had finished it all off but i dug up a bottle of pretty fair wine and we had some before dinner and with it we ate and drank and kay asked how much mrs olmstead had stolen from me i said i would have to wait until tomorrow morning to find out it really doesnt bother me a hell of a lot i added if she hadnt gotten it my wife would have oh yes she tore up the checks you sent your wife didnt she thats right i said well uh look britt she paused delicately ive got some money saved quite a bit actually so if youd like to i said thanks i appreciate the offer but i can get by all right well uh yes i suppose but another delicate pause how about your wife britt how much do you think shed want to give you a divorce i told her to forget it connie had apparently made up her mind not to give me a divorce on any terms and there was no use discussing it i dont know why perhaps she has a reason and im too stupid to see it but i laughed suddenly then quickly apologized im sorry kay i just thought of a story my greatgrandfather used to tell me would you care to hear it id love to she said in a tone that gave the lie to her statement but i told it to her anyway there was once a handsome young indian chief who married a maiden from a neighboring tribe she was neither fair of figure or face and her disposition was truly ugly never did she have a kind word to say to her husband never was he able to do anything that pleased her she was simply a homely shrew through and through and the tribes other squaws and braves wondered why they remained together as husband and wife the days passed and the months and the years finally when the chief was a very old man he died his wife laughed joyously at his funeral having inherited his many ponies and buffalo hides and other such wealth and this his wealth was her reason of course for marrying him and remaining with him for so many years kay stared at me frowning i looked at her deadpan and she shook her head bewilderedly thats the end of the story whats the point i just told you i said she married him and stuck with him for his dough or the indian equivalent thereof but but darn it why did he marry her because he was stupid i said his whole tribe was stupid whaaat why sure i said a lot of indians are stupid thats why we wound up in the shape were in today kay jumped up and left the table i was sorry now that i had told her the story but it hadnt been a rib my greatgrandfather actually had told it to me a bit of bitter funpoking at indians their decline and fall but there was wisdom in it for any race we all overlook the obvious danger is so commonplace that we have become atrophied to it we wring the hand of evil and are shocked at the loss of fingers i left the dining room pausing in the hallway to glance into the kitchen kay was aware of me i am sure but she did not look up so i went on down the hall to the vast reception area crossed its gleaming parquet expanse and started up the stairs it hadnt occurred to me before but what kay had said was true the upward climb was seemingly interminable and as shadowed as it was long there were those strange sounds also like stealthy footsteps in pursuit sounds where there should have been none and due to a trick of acoustics no sounds where sounds should have been i reached the landing breathing hard almost leaping up the last several steps i whirled around tensed heart pounding but there was no one behind me nothing but shadows cautiously i looked down over the brief balustrade which joined the top of the staircase to the wall of the landing the parquet floor below me was so distant that i would not have known that it was there had i not known that it was so distant and so cloaked in darkness i backed away hastily feeling more than a little dizzy i went on to my room cursing my runaway imagination calling down curses upon kay for her unwitting planting of fear in my mind cops should know better than that i thought it didnt bother cops to talk about darkness and shadows and funny noises and people sneaking up behind other people cops were brave which was not an adjective that could be applied to britton rainstar i was at least figuratively a very yellow red man i had a streak of snowy gray right down the middle of my raven locks and i had a streak of another color right down the middle of my tawny back i got out of my clothes and took a shower i put on pajamas and a robe and carpet slippers my pulse was acting up and there was a kind of jumpiness to my toes they kept jerking and squirming of their own volition my toes always do that when i am very nervous i almost called out to kay when she came up the stairs because she was a nurse wasnt she and i certainly needed something to soothe my nerves but she was miffed at me or she would have come to me without being summoned and if i managed to unmiff her i was sure what i would get to soothe me was kay herself one of the best little soothers in the world but one which i simply could not partake of i had screwed the lid on that jar you should excuse the expression she was forever forbidden fruit even though i should become one god forbid i tried to concentrate on nonscary things to think of something nice and the nicest thing i could think of was something i had just determined not to think of and while i was doing my damnedest not to think of her simultaneously doing my damnedest to think of something else she came into my room fully dressed even to her blue cape carrying her small nurses kit in one hand her suitcase in the other all right britt she said im moving in here with you or im moving out leaving right this minute oh come off of it i laughed youd get a permanent black eye with the department as big as your butt baby youd never get a decent job anywhere but you wont know about it will you britt she gave me a spiteful grin after i leave and youre all alone here in this big ol house she set her bags down and did a pantomime of what would happen to me clawing her hands and walking like a zombie and it was ridiculous as hell of course but it was pretty darned scary too then the big black thing will come out of the darkness she intoned in ghostly tones and poor little britt wont see it until its too late hell hear it but hell think its just one of those noises hes always hearing so he wont look around and now knock it off dammit i said you stop that right now and the big black thing will come closer and closer and closer and closer and closer gotcha yeow i yelled my hair standing on end get away from me you crazy broad fraidy cat fraidy cat she chanted br has a yellow streak running down his spine i said id rather have a yellow streak running down it than pimples she said angrily that she didnt have pimples running down hers and i said she would have when my hex went to work a pretty sight youll be when you start blushing your back will look like peaches flambe in eruption ah kay baby i said enough of this clowning around just give me something to make me sleep and then go back to your room and i wont go back to my room but ill give you a hypo if you really want it if i want it i said what do you mean by that i mean i wont be here youll be awwll allalone with the big black thing i thought you might be afraid to go to sleep awwll allalone in this big ol house but all right i said grimly we wound up our little affair and its going to stay wound up you know its best for both of us why goddammit i waved my arms wildly what kind of cop are you anyway a cop is supposed to be something pretty special she said she was something pretty special wasnt she managing a demure blush i said she could stay or get out just as she damned pleased its strictly up to you miss misbegotten my car keys are there in the top dresser drawer thank you but ill walk mr mangy mane im a strong girl and im not afraid of the dark she picked up her bags and left i heard the prolonged creaking of the stairs as she descended them a couple of moments later i heard the loud slamming of the front door i settled back on the pillows smugly grinning to myself dismissing the notion of going downstairs and setting the bolts on the door it would be a lot of bother for nothing i would just have to go down and unbolt it when kay came back as of course she would in a very few minutes probably she had never left the porch i closed my eyes forcing myself to relax ignoring the sibilant scratchings the allbutinaudible creakings and poppings peculiar to very old houses i thought of the stupid indian and his blindness to the obvious i thought of connies senseless refusal to give me a divorce i thought of luther bannerman his quick admission that connie had no insurance policy when he thought claggett was going to check on it why didnt connie want a divorce why the fear of claggett checking with the insurance company what oh my god i sat up abruptly slapping a hand to my forehead wondering how i could have missed something that an idiot child should have seen i was insured that was what claggett would have discovered bannerman had lied in saying that the insurance company had rejected me why had he lied why else but to keep me from becoming wary to allay any nasty suspicions i might entertain about his and connies plans for me of course the existence of the policy would have to be revealed in order to collect the death benefit the double indemnity payoff of but there was absolutely nothing to indicate that fraud and deception had been practiced to obtain the policy quite the contrary in fact i myself had applied for it and named connie as my beneficiary she had what is legally known as an insurable interest in me and if i was the kind of guy as i probably was who might neglect or forget to keep up my premium payments she had the right to make them for me moreover she definitely was not obligated to make the fact known that i had the policy an asset which could be cashed in or encumbered to her disadvantage if her marital status should change if for example we should be divorced i would have to certify to the change and inevitably i would actually know what i had only been assumed to know that i was insured so there could be no divorce connie and her father couldnt risk another automobile accident by way of killing me two such accidents might make my insurers suspicious an accident of any kind there on their home grounds might arouse suspicion and so i had been allowed to clear out i returned to my home after a time i began remitting sizable sums of money to connie and as long as i did i was left alone they could wait time enough to kill me when the flow of money to connie stopped now it had stopped so now a blast of cold air swept over me the front door had opened i sat up abruptly the short hairs on my neck rising i waited and listened nerves tensing face contorted into a stiffening mask of fear and then i grinned and relaxed lay back down again it would be kay of course i hadnt expected her to stay away this long to say that i was damned glad she had returned was a gross understatement but i must be very careful not to show it now more than ever kay had to be kept at a distance after all i had promised to marry her when and if i was free and connies attempt to murder me was a felony uncontestable grounds for divorce kay would undoubtedly hold me to my promise kay was a very stubborn and determined young woman once kay got an idea in her head she would not let go of it even when it was in her own interests to do so maybe it was a characteristic of all blushing redheads maybe that was why they blushed at any rate there must be no gladsome welcomes between us noting that might develop into intimacy perhaps i should pretend to be asleep yes but yes definitely it would show how little i was disturbed by her absence it would throw figurative cold water on the hottest of hotpantsed redheaded blushers i closed my eyes and composed myself i folded my hands on my chest began to breathe in even measured breaths this should convince her i thought lo the poor indian at rest after the days travail poor lo sleeping the sleep of the just kay finished her ascent of the stairs she came to the door of my room and looked in at me i wondered how i looked whether my hair was combed properly and whether any hair was sticking out of my nose nothing looks cruddier than protruding nose hairs i didnt think i had any but sometimes it shows when you are lying down when it would not show otherwise kay crossed to my bed stood looking down at me my nose twitched involuntarily she had apparently been running in her haste to get back to me she had gotten herself all sweaty anyway and she stank like hell i am very sensitive about such things i can endure the direst hardships my indian heritage i suppose but i cant stand a stinky squaw i opened my eyes and frowned up at her look baby i said i dont want to hurt your feelings but bbbbbbbbuht it wasnt kay it wasnt anyone i had ever seen before he was a young man younger than i was i knew that without knowing exactly how i knew it perhaps it was due to cocksureness the arrogance that emanated from him like the odor of sweat he was also a pro a professional killer no one but a pro could have had the incredible nervelessness and patience of this man to loiter in a hospital lobby say until he could give me a murderous shove down its entrance steps or to wait in the fields adjacent to my house until he could get me in the scope of his highpowered rifle or missing me to go on waiting until the house was unguarded and i was unprotected the pro knows that there is always a time to kill if he will wait for it he knows that when necessity demands disguise it must be quickly and easily used and readily disposed of and this man was wearing makeup it was a dry kind a sort of chalk it could be applied with a few practiced touches removed with a brush of the sleeve i could detect it because he had overused it making his face a shocking mask of hideousness cavernous eyes a goblins mouth repulsively exaggerated nostrils and why why the desire to scare me witless hatred why would he hate me there was a click the gleam of a razorsharp switchblade he held it up for me to see gingerly tested its murderous edge then looked at me grinning relishing my stark terror why who who could enjoy my torture and why why you sonofabitch i exploded youre mannys husband his eyes flickered acknowledgment as i looked past him get him manny get him good this time he turned his head an impulse reaction the ruse bought me a split second i vaulted over the end of the bed and hurtled into the bathroom slammed and locked the door just as he lunged against it a crack appeared in the inlaid paneling of the door i called out to the guy shakily foolishly im a historical monument mister this house is i mean you damage a historical monument and his shoulder hit the panel like a piledriver the crack became a split he swung viciously and his fist came through the wood he fumbled blindly for the lock i stooped opened my mouth and chomped down on his fingers there was an anguished yell he jerked his hand back so hard that i bumped my head against the door i massaged it carefully listening straining my ears for some indication of what the bastard would try next i couldnt hear anything not a damned thing i continued to listen and i still heard nothing had he given up no way not so soon not a professional killer with a personal interest in wasting me who hated me was jealous of me because of manny look you i called to him its all over between manny and me i mean it i paused listening you hear me out there its you and her from now on she told me so herself maybe you think shes stalling by going to the hospital but maybe she was too maybe her earlier hospitalization had also been a stall or maybe just the thought of being tied up with this guy again had driven her up the wall because he really had her on the spot you know she had tried to kill him had done such a job on him that she believed she had killed him thus her long convalescence after his death also after his recent reappearance he would have discovered her painful pestering of me in the course of casing her situation so she was vulnerable to pressure a girl who had not only tried to kill her husband but who had also pulled some pretty raw stuff on her lover and the fact that her husband the guy who was pressuring her was on pretty shaky grounds himself would not deter him for a moment for he was one of those bullish doginthemanger types the kind who would pull the temple down on his head to get a fly on the ceiling that was the way it was add up everything that had happened and that was the answer i called out to him again making my voice stern i said i would give him until i counted to ten wondering what the hell i was talking about until i counted to ten then what but he didnt seem very bright either so i went right ahead onetwothreefour do you hear me im counting fivesixseveneight all right dont say i didnt warn you niunten silence still silence well he could be gone couldnt he id chomped down on his fingers damned hard and he could be seriously bitten maybe id even gotten an artery and the bastard had beat it before he bled to death it just about had to be something like that i would just about have to have heard him if he still remained there i unlocked the door i hesitated then suddenly flung it open and i think he must have been standing against the far wall of the bedroom nursing his injured hand measuring the distance to the bathroom door as he readied himself for the attack upon it then at last hurtling himself forward head lowered shoulders hunched legs churning like pistons rapidly gaining momentum until he hit the door with the impact of a charging bull rather he didnt hit the door since the door was no longer there i had flung it open instead he rocketed through the opening and hit the wall on the opposite side and he hit it so hard that several of its tiles were loosened there was an explosive spllaat he bounded backward and his head struck the floor with the sound of a bursting melon for a moment i thought he must be dead then a kind of twitching shudder ran through his body and i knew he was only dead to the world very unconscious but very much alive i got busy i yanked off my robe and tied him up with its cord i grabbed up some towels and tied him up with them i tied him up with the hose of the hotwater bottles i tied him up with the electric light cords from the reading lamps and some pillow cases and bedsheets and a large roll of adhesive bandage that was about all i could find to tie him up with so i let it go at that but i still wasnt sure that it was enough with a guy like that you could never be sure i backed out of the bathroom keeping my eye on him i backed across the bedroom still watching him and out into the hallway and then i stopped stockstill my breath sucking in with shock connie stood flattened against the wall immediately outside my door and lurking in the shadows at the top of the stairs was the hulking figure of my fatherinlaw luther bannerman i looked from him to her staring stupidly momentarily paralyzed with shock i thought how why what immediately following it with the thought how silly can you get she and bannerman had journeyed from their homeplace together having a supposedly invalided daughter was a gimmick for chiseling money from me so he had parked her before coming out to my house this afternoon picking her up afterward since kay wouldnt have volunteered any information they assumed that she was no more than the nurse she appeared to be one who went home at night she had left while they waited to make sure she would not return they saw mannys husband enter the house in a way that no legitimate guest would so they followed him inside and when he failed to do the job he had come to my confusion lasted only a moment it could have taken no longer than that to sort things out and put them in proper order but connie and luther bannerman were already edging toward me arms outspread to head off my escape i backed away back was the only way i could go get him papa connie hissed now i saw a shadow upon the shadows bannerman poising to slug me i threw up an arm drew my own fist back you hypocrite sonofabitch you come any closer ill connie slugged me in the stomach she stiffarmed me under the chin i staggered backwards and fell over the rail of the balustrade i went over it and down my vision moving in a dizzying arc from beamed ceiling to panelled walls to parquet floor i did a swift backandforth review of the floor and decided that i was in no hurry at all to get down to it i had never seen such a hardlooking floor i was only sixtyplus feet above it only but it seemed like sixty miles i had hooked my feet through the balusters when i went over the rail connie was alternately pounding on them and trying to pry them loose meanwhile hollering to her father for help do something darn it slug him bannerman moved down the stairs a step or two he leaned over the rail striking at me i jabbed a finger in his eye he cursed and let out a howl connie cursed howled for him to do something goddammit never mind your damn eye hit him cant you dont you cuss me daughter he leaned over the rail again it aint nice to cuss your papa connie yelled oh shit exasperatedly and gave my foot an agonizing blow her father took another swing at me and my head seemed to explode i heard him shout with triumph connies maliciously delighted laugh that almost got him papa just a little bit more now dont you worry daughter just you leave him to papa he aimed another blow at me she hit my sore foot again and i kicked her and i grabbed him he was offbalance leaning far out over the rail i grabbed him by the ears simultaneously kicking at connie he came over the rail with a terrified howl clutching my wrists for dear life my foot went between connies legs and she was propelled upward as bannermans weight yanked me downward she shrieked one terrorfilled shriek after another shrieking she flattened herself against my leg and hung onto it she shrieked and screamed and then yelled and howled and one jerked one way and the other pulled the other way and i thought my god theyre going to deafen me and pull me apart at the same time they were really a couple of lousy wouldbe murderers but they were amateurs of course and even a pro can goof up as witness mannys husband i caught a glimpse of him as i was swung back and forth looking more like a mummy than a man due to the variety and number of items with which i had bound him he came hopping through my bedroom door very dazed and wobblylooking he hopped out onto the landing lost his balance and crashed heavily into the balustrade it creaked and scraped ominously the distant floor of the reception hall seemed to jump up at me a few inches and the terrified vocalizings of the bannermans increased somehow the mummy got to his feet again though why i dont know i doubt that he knew what he was doing he got to the head of the stairs stood looking down at them dazedly he executed another little hop and of course he fell went down the steps in a series of bouncing somersaults hitting the leg which bannerman had just managed to hook over the rail the jolt almost knocked bannerman loose from me naturally i was yanked downward also simultaneously exerting a tremendous yank upon the balustrade it was too much too damned much it tore loose from its ancient moorings and dropped downward connie skidded down my body headfirst unable to stop her plunge until she was extended almost the length of her body clutching her fathers legs as she clung to me by her heels she screamed and cursed him hysterically he cursed and kicked at her a strange calm had settled over me the calm of the doomed i was at once a part of things and yet outside them and my overall view was objective i didnt know how the few screws and spikes which still attached the balustrade to the landing managed to stay in place why it didnt plunge downward bearing us with it into the reception hall moreover i didnt seem to care rather i cared without caring what concerned me in a vaguely humorous way was the preposterous picture we must make connie bannerman and i balled together in a kind of crazy bomb which was about to be dropped at any moment i waited for the weight to go off of me the signal that we were making the final plunge i waited and i kept my eyes closed tight knowing that if i opened them if i looked down at that floor so far below me it would be about the last time i looked at anything there was so much racket from the bannermans and the grating and screeching of the balustrade that i could hear nothing else but suddenly the weight did go off me in two gentle yanks there was another wait then and i expected to hit the floor at any moment then i myself was yanked and a couple of strong arms went around me and i was hustled effortlessly upward i was set down on my feet i received a gentle bearingdown shake then a sharp slap i opened my eyes found myself on the secondfloor landing with its ruined balustrade connie and bannerman were stretched out on the floor face down with their hands behind their heads mannys husband lay at the foot of the stairs in a heap kay peered at me anxiously im terribly terribly sorry darling are you all right fine i said because i was alive wasnt i and being alive was fine wasnt it to show my gratitude i would gladly have gone down on my knees and kissed her can i would have been back sooner britt but a truck driver tried to pick me up i think i broke his darned jaw fine i said britt honey we dont have to say anything to sergeant claggett about my leaving you alone do we lets not okay fine i said ill think of a good story to cover just leave it to me fine i said you do love me dont you britt you dont think im awful fine i said and then i put my arms around her and sank slowly down to my knees no not to kiss her can although i really wouldnt have minded it was just that id waited as long as i could and i couldnt wait any longer for something soft to faint on kays story was that she had gone out of the house to investigate some suspicious noises and had found a guy apparently trying to break in during her pursuit of him mannys husband and subsequently the bannermans had entered the house but fortunately she was in time to overpower them and save me from death the story didnt go down very well with jeff claggett but he couldnt call her a liar without calling me one so he let it go and kay not only kept her job with the department but she received a commendation and promotion the increase in pay she estimated would pay for the allwhite gown and accoutrements which she advised me unblushingly she intended to wear at our wedding to move on connie and luther bannerman pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit murder and attempted murder they received ten years on each count said sentences to run consecutively mannys husband remained mute and was convicted of attempted murder but other charges were dug up against him before he could begin serving the sentence he was a very bad guy seemingly the last i heard he had accumulated two life sentences pius fifty years and he was still standing mute apparently he saw nothing to gain by talking manny was taken from her hospital to the criminal ward of the county hospital pat aloe could have got her out i am sure since the charge against her of harboring a criminal failing to report her husband to the police was a purely technical one but pat had grimly washed his hands of manny he wanted nothing more to do with her he had no further need for her for that matter having begun the swift closing out of pxas affairs manny cooperated fully with the authorities and their attitude toward her was generally sympathetic she had attacked her husband without intent to kill him his abuse had driven her temporarily insane and when she recovered her senses she was holding a steam pressingiron in her hand and he was sprawled on the ground at her feet the storm was gathering by now and she was forced to flee back inside her resort cabin when the police came in the morning to investigate the storms havoc she was near death with shock and she was never questioned about her husbands supposed death actually he wasnt even seriously hurt but there was a dead man nearby one of several who had died in the storm who resembled him in size and coloring mannys husband made the features of the dead man unrecognizable with a few brutal blows switched clothes with him and planted his identification on him he disappeared into the night then and no one ever questioned the fact that he was dead possibly because so many people were glad to have him that way rumors had been circulating for some time that he had irritated people who were not of a mind to put up with it and only his apparent death saved him from the actuality there followed an extended period of hiding out of keeping out of the way of former associates finally however believing that feeling about him had cooled down and having sized up mannys situation he had paid her a covert visit she was terrified anyone who knew him well would be also she was vulnerable to his threats thanks to the nominal attempt on his life and the malicious mischief she had made for me she couldnt go to the police she couldnt go to pat who was already furious with her so she acceded to her husbands demands she would go away with him if he would leave me alone she collapsed after his visit and was forced to go to the hospital his reaction was to try to kill me she hoped to buy him off and he accepted the money she gave him but of course he could not stay bought again he gave her an ultimatum she would go back to him or i would go period so she had agreed to go back to him but the ugly prospect had brought on another nervous collapse with its resultant hospitalization actually he had no intention of leaving me alone regardless of what she did he was a handsome hood and as vain and mean as he was handsome and it was simply not tolerable to him to allow his wifes lover to live so he had tried to kill me for the third time at the same time the bannermans were attempting to kill me for the second time and so much for them the charge against manny was dismissed with the urgent recommendation that she seek psychiatric help she gladly promised to do so mrs olmstead was caught up with in las vegas she was drunk thoroughly unremorseful and some twenty thousand dollars ahead of the game she returned most of my money i think im not sure since i dont know exactly how much she got away with anyway i declined to prosecute and she was still in vegas the last i heard still drunk still unremorseful and still a big winner i went to the hospital a few days after the bannermans and mannys husband tried to kill me my house needed repairs to make it livable and it was kind of lonesome there by myself so i went to the hospital and i remained there while the courts dealt with my wouldbe killers and certain other happy events came to pass the doctors hinted that i was malingering and suggested that i do it elsewhere jeff claggett gave me a stern scolding you dont want to marry nolton you shouldnt marry her why not lay it on the line with her instead of pulling the sick act well i do like her jeff i said and she saved my life you know oh hell she was goofing off when she should have been on the job and we both know it well but i promised to marry her i didnt think id ever be free of connie at the time but that wasnt a promise dammit anyway youve got a right to change your mind you shouldnt go ahead with something thats all wrong to keep a promise that should never have been made im sure youre right i said ill have a talk with kay as soon as i get some other things out of the way what things well youve got a goahead on your erosion book and a hefty advance from the publisher youre getting a good settlement on your condemnation suit my lawyer friend says it will be coming through any day now so what the hell are you waiting for nothing i said firmly and i wont wait any longer good youll settle with nolton right away then you bet i will i said maybe not right away but he cursed and stamped out of the room the phone rang and of course it was kay just one question britt rainstar she said how much longer do you plan on staying in that hospital whats the difference i said my divorce hasnt come through yet hasnt it she said hasnt it i uh well i laughed nervously i havent received the papers yet but i believe i did hear that uh my goodness kay i said you surely dont think that i dont want to marry you thats exactly what i think britt well shame on you i said the very idea then when are you leaving the hospital very soon i said practically any day now she slammed the phone down i lay back on the pillows and closed my eyes i was thoroughly ashamed of myself my shame increased as the days drifted by and i stayed on in the hospital the naive evasivechild manner i maintained was evidence of my general feeling of hopeless unworthiness the iaintnothinbutahounddawg routine set to different music whatever i did i was bound to make someone unhappy and i have always shrunk from doing that i am always terribly unhappy when i make others unhappy i wondered what in the name of god i could tell manny after all i had told her that the only reason i didnt marry her was because i couldnt i was married to connie and there was no way i could dissolve our marriage now however i was free of connie and manny was free of her husband so how could i possibly tell her that i was marrying kay nolton i was wrestling with the riddle the afternoon she came to see me the first time i had seen her since that seemingly longago day when she had come to the house i stalled on giving her the news about kay staving it off by complimenting her on how nice she looked she thanked me and said she certainly hoped she looked nice you see im getting married britt she said i thought you should be the first to know i gulped and said oh thinking that took me off the hook all right or sank it into me well i hope youll be very happy manny thank you she said im sure i will be is it uh anyone i know weell no she shook her head i dont believe you do youre going to get acquainted with him because i intend to see that you do and i think that youll like him the real him a lot better than the man you think you know uh what i frowned i dont understand well youd just better her voice rose broke into joyous laughter youd better you nutty mixedup mixed blood or ill take your pretty graystreaked scalp she came to me at a run flung herself down on the bed with me naturally the bed collapsed noisily we were picking ourselves up when the door slammed open and a nurse came rushing in she had red hair and beautiful long legs and a scrubbedclean look kay i stammered wwhat are you doing here she snapped that her name was nolton miss nolton and she was there because she was a nurse as i very well knew now whats going on here miss she demanded glaring at manny never mind i want you out of here right this minute and for goodness sake for goodness sake do us all a favor and take him with you oh i intend to manny said sunnily im getting married and hes the bridegroom well im glad to hear it kay said im gglad that ssomeones willing to marry him he said tthat that i she turned suddenly and hurried out the door manny came into my arms and i did what you do when a very lovely girl comes into your arms and then over her shoulder i saw the door ease open and i saw that it was kay who had opened it she stuck her tongue out at me she winked and grinned at me and then just as she closed the door she turned on a truly beautiful blush and when it comes time to close the door on someone or something i know of no nicer way to do it end
