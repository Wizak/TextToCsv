 james sladerman frowned at the toe of his shoe hed been frowning since the summons from commissioner dodson had reached him in the squad room that morning after blowing out a long stream of smoke slade crushed out the cigarette in the mosaic ashtray to his left he barely shifted his body slade knew how to wait only the night before he had waited for more than five hours in a dark chilly car in a neighborhood where it paid to watch your back as well as your wallet it had been a tedious fruitless five hours as the stakeout had produced nothing but then slade knew from long experience that police work consisted of hours of endless legwork impossible boredom and paperwork punctuated by moments of stark violence still he preferred the fivehour wait to the twenty minutes he had spent in the commissioners carpeted beigewalled outer office it smelled of lemony polish and now his own virginia tobacco the keys of a typewriter clattered with monotonous efficiency as the commissioners secretary transcribed what the hell does he want slade wondered again throughout his career slade had studiously avoided the politics of police work because of an inherent dislike of bureaucracy in his climb from cadet to detective sergeant there had been little opportunity for his path to cross dodsons slade had had brief personal contact with dodson at his fathers funeral captain thomas c sladerman had been buried with all the glory and honor that comes from serving on the force for twentyeight years and dying in the line of duty mulling over it slade recalled that the commissioner had been sympathetic to the widow and the young daughter hed said the right things to the son perhaps on some level he had been personally grieved early in their careers dodson and sladerman had been partners they had still been young men when their paths had separated one finding a niche in politics and administration the other craving the action of the streets on only one other occasion had slade had onetoone contact with dodson then slade had been in the hospital recovering from a gunshot wound the visit of the commissioner of police to a mere detective had resulted in talk and speculation that had embarrassed slade as much as annoyed him now he realized it would be all over the station house that the old man had called him in his frown became a scowl for a moment he wondered if he had committed some breach in procedure then became furious with himself for behaving like a kid hauled before the school principal the hell with it he decided forcing himself to relax the chair was soft too soft and too short to compensate slade curved his spine into the back and stretched out his long legs his eyes half closed when the interview was over he had the stakeout to look forward to again if it went down tonight hed have a few evenings free to spend at the typewriter with any luck and a solid month without interruptions he could finish the novel blocking out his surroundings he mentally reviewed the chapter he was working on sergeant sladerman annoyed by the distraction slade lifted his eyes slowly his expression cleared he realized hed wasted his time staring at the floor when the commissioners secretary provided a far more appealing view his smile was at once appraising and charming the commissioner will see you now the secretary answered the smile wishing hed looked at her like that before rather than sitting in sullen silence he had a face any female would respond to a bit narrow angular with dark coloring that came from italian ancestors on his mothers side the mouth had been hard in repose but now curved it showed both promise and passion black hair and gray eyes were an irresistible combination especially she thought when the hair was thick and a bit unruly and the eyes were smoky and mysterious he was an interesting prospect she thought as she watched slade unfold his long rangy frame from the chair as he followed her to the oak door he noted that the ring finger of her left hand was bare idly he considered getting her phone number on the way out the thought slipped to the back of his mind as she ushered him into the commissioners office there was a perillo lithograph on the right wall a lone cowboy astride a paint pony the left wall was crowded with framed photos commendations diplomas if slade found it an odd combination he gave no sign the desk with its back to the window was dark oak on it were papers in tidy stacks a gold pen and pencil set and a triple picture frame seated behind them was dodson a dark tidy little man who had always reminded slade more of a parish priest than new yorks commissioner of police his eyes were a calm pale blue his cheeks healthily ruddy thin wisps of white wove through his hair all in all dodson was the picture of avuncular gentleness but the lines in his face hadnt been etched by good humor sergeant sladerman dodson motioned slade to a chair with a gesture and a smile built like his father he thought briefly as he watched slade take his seat did i keep you waiting a bit like his father dodson thought again managing not to smile except that thered been talk that the sons real interest lay in writing not in police work tom had always brushed that aside dodson remembered my boys a cop just like his old man a damn good cop at the moment dodson was banking on it hows the family he asked casually while keeping those deceptive blue eyes direct fine thank you sir janice is enjoying college he offered slade a cigar when it was refused dodson lit one for himself slade waited until the smoke stung the air before answering just how he wondered did dodson know his sister was in college yes she likes it hows the writing he had to call on all of his training not to reveal surprise at the question his eyes remained as clear and steady as his voice struggling no time for small talk dodson thought tapping off cigar ash the boys already itching to be gone but being commissioner gave him an advantage he took another slow drag of the cigar watching the smoke curl lazily toward the ceiling i read that short story of yours in mirror dodson went on it was very good thank you what the hells the point slade wondered impatiently no luck with the novel briefly almost imperceptively slades eyes narrowed not yet sitting back dodson chewed on his cigar as he studied the man across from him had the look of his father too he mused slade had the same narrow face that was both intelligent and tough he wondered if the son could smile with the same disarming charm as the father yet the eyes were like his mothers dark gray and thoughtful skilled at keeping emotions hidden then there was his record dodson mused he might not be the flashy cop his father had been but he was thorough and thank god less impulsive after his years on the force the last three in homicide slade could be considered seasoned if an undercover cop wasnt seasoned by thirtytwo he was dead slade had a reputation for being cool perhaps a shade too cool but his arrests were clean dodson didnt need a man who looked for trouble but one who knew what to do once he found it slade he allowed a small smile to escape thats what youre called isnt it yes sir the familiarity made him uncomfortable the smile made him suspicious im sure youve heard of justice lawrence winslow curiosity came first then a quick search through his mental file presided over the new york appellate court before he was elected chief justice of the connecticut supreme court about fifteen years ago died of a heart attack four maybe five years ago facts and figures dodson mused the boy didnt waste words he was also a damn fine lawyer a judge who understood the full meaning of justice a good man his wife remarried two years ago and lives in southern france so what slade thought with fresh impatience as dodson gazed broodingly over his shoulder im godfather to his daughter jessica the same question zipped through slades mind as dodson focused on him again she lives in the family home near westport beautiful place a stones throw from the beach its quiet peaceful he drummed his fingers against the desk i imagine a writer would find it very appealing there was an uncomfortable premonition which slade pushed aside possibly was the old man matchmaking slade almost laughed out loud no that was too ridiculous over the last nine months there has been a rash of thefts throughout europe the abrupt change of subject startled slade so much that the surprise showed clearly on his face quickly he controlled it and lifted a brow saying nothing important thefts dodson continued mainly from museums gems coins stamps france england spain and italy have all been hit the investigation has led the respective authorities to believe the stolen articles have been smuggled into the states smugglings federal slade said briefly and he thought silently has nothing to do with a homicide detective or some justices spoiled daughter another uncomfortable thought came to him which he ignored smugglings federal dodson repeated a bit too amiably for slades taste he placed the tips of his neat fingers together watching the younger man over them i have a few connections in the bureau because of this cases delicate nature ive been consulted he paused a beat long enough for slade to comment if he chose to then went on some substantial leads in the investigation point to a small wellrespected antique shop the bureau knows theres an operator from the information i have theyve narrowed down the possibilities for dump sites and this shop is one of the chosen few he decided dryly its believed someone on the inside is on the take pausing he adjusted the picture frame on his desk they want to put an operative on it inside so that the head of the organization wont slip away from them this time hes clever dodson mused half to himself again dodson gave slade a moment to question or comment and again he went on as the other man remained silent allegedly the goods are hidden cleverly hidden in an antique then exported to this shop retrieved and ultimately disposed of it seems the feds have things under control barely masking his impatience slade reached for a cigarette theres one or two complications dodson waited for the hiss and flare of the match theres no concrete evidence nor is the identity of the head of the organization known a handful of accomplices yes but we want him or her he added softly the tone had slades eyes sharpening dont get interested he warned himself it has nothing to do with you swallowing the questions that had popped into his head he drew on his cigarette and waited theres also a more delicate problem for the first time since slade had walked into the room he noticed dodsons nerves the commissioner picked up his gold pen ran it through his fingers then stuck it back in its slot the antique shop alleged to be involved is owned and operated by my goddaughter dark brows lifted but the eyes beneath them betrayed nothing justice winslows daughter its generally believed that jessica knows nothing of the illegal use of her shop if indeed there is illegal use dodson reached for the pen again this time holding it lengthwise between both hands i know shes completely innocent not only because shes my goddaughter he went on anticipating slades thoughts but because i know her shes every bit as honest as her father was jessica cherishes larrys memory and he added carefully setting down the pen she hardly needs the money hardly slade muttered picturing a spoiled heiress with too much time and money on her hands smuggling for kicks he mused a change of pace from shopping and parties and jetsetting the bureaus closing in dodson stated the next few weeks could bring the whole mess down around her ears it might be dangerous for her slade controlled the snort of derision even the shield of ignorance isnt going to protect her once things come to a head if her shops involved ive tried to convince her to come to new york for a visit but his voice trailed off amused exasperation moved over his face jessicas stubborn claims shes too busy she tells me i should come visit her with a shake of his head dodson let out what passed for a sigh i considered it but my presence at this point could jeopardize the investigation however i feel jessica needs protection discreet protection someone trained to deal with the situation who can stay close to her without causing speculation a smile touched his eyes someone who could assist the investigation from the inside slade frowned he liked the conversation less and less taking his time he stubbed out his cigarette and how do you expect me to do that dodson smiled fully he liked the irritation in slades voice as much as the directness jessica will do what i want to a point leaning back in the overstuffed leather chair he relaxed again shes been complaining lately about the mess her librarys in about not having enough time to sort through and catalog im going to call her tell her im sending the son of an old friend of mine and her fathers thats true by the way he added tom and larry knew each other some years back your covers simple enough youre a writer who needs a quiet refuge for a few weeks and in turn youll sort out her library slades eyes had darkened during dodsons casual rundown jurisdiction he began some paperwork dodson interrupted easily it can be taken care of after all its the boys from the bureau wholl make the collar when its time im supposed to play librarian and baby sitter slade gave a snort of disgust look commissioner im that close to wrapping up the bitronelli murder he brought his thumb and forefinger together if youd better be dodson interrupted again but with a hint of steel in his voice the press is having a great time making the nypd look like fools on that one and if youre so close he added before slade could toss back a furious retort you should be able to leave for connecticut in a couple of days the bureau is interested in having a cop on the inside a cop who knows how to keep his eyes and ears open theyve checked you out and agree with my choice terrific slade muttered standing he prowled the room im homicide not robbery youre a cop dodson said shortly yeah babysitting for some snobby little heiress slade thought darkly who was either smuggling for thrills or too dizzy to see what was going on under her nose terrific he muttered again once janice was out of college he thought he could quit the force and concentrate on his writing he was tired of it tired of the misery he came in contact with almost every day of his life tired of the dirt the futility tired of the nasty little pieces of humanity his job forced him to deal with and tired too of seeing the look of relief in his mothers eyes each time he came home with a sigh he resigned himself maybe a couple of weeks in connecticut would be a nice change a change anyway when he demanded as he turned back to face dodson day after tomorrow dodson said smoothly ill give you a complete briefing then ill call jessica and tell her to expect you with a shrug slade went back to his chair to listen chapter contents prev next fall touched the trees and stung the air against a hard blue sky the colors were vibrant passionate the ribbon of road cut through the hills and wound eastward toward the atlantic whipping through the open car windows the wind was chilled and fragrant slade wondered how long it had been since he had smelled that kind of freshness no city smells of sweat and exhaust when his book was accepted perhaps he could move his mother and janice out of the city a home in the country maybe or near the shore it was always when or as soon as he couldnt afford to think if another year on the force another year of scraping up tuition money and then shaking his head slade turned up the radio it wasnt any good thinking of next year he wasnt in connecticut to appreciate the scenery it was just another job and one he resented jessica winslow he mused age twentyseven the only child of justice lawrence winslow and lorraine nordan winslow graduate of radcliffe senior class president shed probably been head cheerleader too he thought with a sneer all buttondowned and ponytailed ralph lauren sweaters and gucci loafers struggling to be open minded he continued his catalog opened the house of winslow four years ago up until two years ago she did the majority of buying herself good excuse to play around in europe he thought as he punched in the car lighter michael adams jessica winslows assistant and current buyer thirtytwo yale graduate figures slade reflected exhaling smoke that rushed out of the open window son of robert and marion adams another prominent connecticut family no firm evidence but someone slade was instructed to keep his eye on he leaned his elbow on the window as he considered as chief buyer adams would be in a perfect position to handle the operation from overseas david ryce shop assistant for eighteen months twentythree son of elizabeth ryce the winslow housekeeper dodson had said he was often trusted with running the shop alone that would give him the opportunity to handle the local operation systematically slade ran through the list of the winslow staff gardener cook housekeeper daily maid good god he thought in disgust all that for one person she probably wouldnt know how to boil an egg if her life depended on it the gates to the winslow estate stood open with room enough for two cars to pass easily slade turned into the long macadam drive lined with bushy bloomless azaleas there was a burst of birdsong then silence he drove nearly a quarter of a mile before pulling up in front of the house it was large but he had to admit not oppressively so the brick was old mellowed by sun and sea air smoke rose from one of the chimneys on the hipped roof the gray shutters werent just decorative he noted but could be used for practical purposes if a storm rose up off the sound he smelled the chrysanthemums before he saw them the blossoms were huge growing near the base of the house they were rust gold and copper complimenting the violent red of bushes it charmed him as did the lazy odor of woodsmoke this wasnt indolence but peace hed had too little of that shaking off the mood slade walked up the steps to the front door he lifted a fist and knocked hard he hated doorbells in less than a minute the door opened he had to look down quite a distance down to see a tiny middleaged woman with a pleasantly ugly face and graystreaked hair he caught a whiff of a pinescented cleaner that reminded him of his mothers kitchen may i help you the accent was broad new england im james sladerman miss winslows expecting me the woman scrutinized him with cautious black eyes youd be the writer she stated obviously not overly impressed stepping back she allowed him to enter as the door closed behind him slade glanced around the hall the floor was uncarpeted a gleaming blond oak that showed some wear under the careful polishing a few paintings hung on the ivorytoned wallpaper a pale green glass bowl sat on a high round table and overflowed with fall flowers there were no overt displays of wealth but wealth was there hed seen a print of the painting to his right in an art book the blue scarf that hung negligently over the railing of the steps was silk slade started to turn back to the housekeeper when a clatter at the top of the steps distracted him she came barrelling down the curved staircase in a flurry of swirling blond hair and flying skirts the hammer of heels on wood disrupted the quiet of the house slade had a quick impression of speed motion and energy betsy you make david stay in bed until that fevers broken dont you dare let him get up damn damn damn im going to be late where are my keys three inches away from slade she came to a screeching halt almost overbalancing automatically he reached for her arm to steady her breathless she brought her eyes from his shirt front to stare at him it was an exquisite face fair skinned oval delicate with just a hint of cheekbone that added a rather primitive strength indian viking he wondered celtic her eyes were large the color of aged whiskey set below brows that were lowered in curiosity the faintest line appeared between them a stubborn line slade reflected his sister had one she was small he noted the top of her head barely skimmed his shoulder her scent was reminiscent of fall something musky blossoms and smoke the arm beneath his hand was slender under a thin wool blazer he felt the stir inside him man for woman and hastily dropped his hand this is mr sladerman betsy announced that writer oh yes the smile cleared away the faint line between her brows uncle charlie told me you were coming it took slade a moment to connect uncle charlie with dodson not knowing if he was smothering an oath or a laugh he accepted her extended hand charlie told me you could use some help miss winslow help she rolled her eyes and cleared her throat yes you could call it that the library look im sorry to rush off the minute you get here but my assistants ill and my buyers in france tilting her wrist she grimaced at her watch i have a client coming to the shop ten minutes ago dont worry about it if this frazzled lady can run a business ill volunteer to walk a beat he decided but gave her an easy smile itll give me a chance to get settled in fine ill see you at dinner then glancing around she muttered again about keys in your hand slade told her stupid with a sigh jessica uncurled her fingers and stared at the keys in her palm the more i have to rush the worse it gets lifting amused eyes to his she brushed her hair from her shoulders please dont bother with the library today it may shock you so much that youll run away before i can smooth things over betsy as she dashed for the door jessica looked over her shoulder tell david hes fired if he gets out of bed bye the door slammed behind her betsy clucked her tongue ten minutes later slade inspected his suite of rooms they were nearly as large as the apartment he had grown up in there was a faded carpet on the bedroom floor that he recognized was not old but antique in a small black marble fireplace wood was neatly laid for burning crossing to the sitting room he saw a sturdy desk topped with a vase of the chrysanthemums a brass paperweight and a feather quill without hesitation he cleared it off to make room for his typewriter if he had his way his writing would be more than a cover when he wasnt babysitting hed get some work done of course there was the library to fool with on an exasperated sigh slade turned his back on his typewriter and went back downstairs he roamed filing the position and layout of rooms in the cops part of his mind their descriptions in the writers in his tour of the first floor slade could find no fault with jessicas taste it was only the nouveau riche who went in for ostentation the winslow woman preferred muted colors and clean lines in her clothes too he mused remembering how she had looked in the duncolored blazer and skirt still the blouse shed worn had been a deep almost violent green that just might indicate something else slade stopped to run his fingers over the surface of a rosewood piano compared to this he mused the battered upright his mother treasured was so much kindling with a shrug he wandered to the next door the library he caught the scent of old leather and dust as he looked on the largest private collection of books hed ever seen for the first time since he had walked into dodsons office slade felt a stir of pleasure a quick study told him that the books were well read as well as carelessly filed he crossed the room and mounted the two stairs to the second level not filed at all he corrected but simply jumbled he ran a long finger along a row of volumes robert burns tilted onto a copy of kurt vonnegut a big job he concluded one he might have enjoyed if it had been his only purpose he took one long look around before absently pulling out a book there was nothing he could do about jessica winslow at the moment he thought as he settled down to read jessica swerved into the parking area beside her shop relieved to see it empty she was late but her client was later or she thought with a frown hed grown tired of waiting and left with a halfhearted oath she hurried to unlock the front door quickly she went from window to window letting the shades snap up without slackening pace she headed for the back room tossed her purse aside then filled a small kettle with water she gave the struggling ivy in the rear window a quick douse before setting the kettle on the stove halfway out of the room she went back to turn the burner on underneath it satisfied she wandered into the main shop it wasnt large but then jessica had never intended it to be intimate personal yes it was that she thought with her signature on it the shop was more than a business to her it was an accomplishment and a love the business end invoices filing books she ran meticulously all of her organizational efforts went into the shop which perhaps was the reason for her lack of order elsewhere the shop was the focus of her life and had been since shed conceived of it initially shed needed something to give some purpose to her life after college was behind her the idea for the shop had germinated slowly then had grown and developed jessica had too much drive too much energy to drift once she had decided to start a business shed moved quickly then that same drive and energy had made it work it turned a profit the money itself meant little but the fact that her shop made it meant everything shed spent six months scouring new england then europe for the right pieces a large inventory hadnt been her goal but an exclusive one after her opening the response had begun as a small trickle mostly friends and friends of friends justice winslows daughter running a shop had brought out the curiosity seekers as well jessica hadnt minded a client was a client and a satisfied one the best advertising for the first two years shed run the shop alone indeed she had never considered that her business would outgrow her when it had shed hired michael adams to handle the overseas buying he was charming capable and knowledgeable the women customers adored him gradually their relationship had mellowed from business to friendship to easy affection as business had continued to thrive jessica had hired david ryce hed been hardly more than a boy at loose ends bored enough to find trouble if it got in the way jessica had hired him because theyd grown up together then she had come to depend on him he was quick with figures and tireless with details he had a streak of street sense that made him a good man to have in business street sense jessica mused james sladerman odd that the term would bring him back to her mind even in that quick exchange at the foot of the stairs shed felt something in him it told her he was a man who would know how to handle himself in business maybe in an alley definitely with a half laugh she stuck her hands in her pockets now why should she think that the fingers that had gripped her arm had been strong his build had been wiry but no it had been his eyes she thought there was something hard in his eyes yet she hadnt been repelled or frightened but drawn even when hed looked at her for those first three or four seconds with that intensity that seemed to creep beneath her skin she hadnt been afraid safe she realized hed made her feel safe that was odd jessica decided catching her bottom lip between her teeth why should she suddenly feel safe when she had no need for protection the door of the shop jingled open pushing speculation aside jessica turned miss winslow i apologize im very late dont give it a thought mr chambers jessica considered telling him that shed also been late then decided against it what he didnt know wouldnt hurt him behind her the kettle whistled im just making tea why dont you join me before we look over the new snuffboxes chambers removed a rather fussy hat from a balding head wonderful i do appreciate you calling me when you get a new shipment in he smiled revealing good dentures you dont think id let anyone see the snuffboxes before you in the kitchen jessica poured boiling water into cups michael found these in france there are two i think youll be particularly interested in he preferred the ornate jessica thought with a smile as she lifted the tray he loved the foolishly gaudy little boxes that men with lace cuffs used to carry she glanced at chambers stubby form and wondered if he pictured himself as a cavalier or perhaps a regency buck still his fascination with snuffboxes had made him a regular customer who had more than once recommended her shop to other people and he was rather sweet in his fussy little way she thought as she placed the tea tray on a table sugar she asked him ah i shouldnt chambers patted his ample middle but perhaps one cube his glance flicked briefly down to her legs as jessica crossed them a pity he thought with an inward sigh that he wasnt twenty years younger later he left happily with two eighteenthcentury snuffboxes before jessica could file the invoice she heard the grumble of an engine glancing up she saw the large delivery truck pull in front of the shop she read the company logo on the side of the steel doors and frowned a bit she could have sworn the delivery that michael was shipping wasnt due until the following day when she recognized the driver jessica waved then walked to the front door to meet him hi miss winslow hello don she accepted the itemized list he handed her muttering about not expecting him until tomorrow he shrugged mr adams put a rush on it mmm she jiggled the keys in her pocket as she scanned the list well he seems to have outdone himself this time and another delivery on saturday i dont oh her eyes lit up with pleasure as they fixed on one item the writing desk the queen anne i meant to tell michael to keep his eyes open for one then forgot it must be fate of course she should uncart it first at least take a look no impulses were the best jessica decided smiling she looked back up at the driver the rest comes in here but that goes to my home would you mind well it was easy to justify using the smile jessica could already see the desk in the front parlor if its not too much trouble she added the driver shifted to his other foot i guess itll be all right joe wont mind he jerked his thumb at his partner who had opened the wide double doors of the truck thanks i really appreciate it that desk is just what ive been looking for feeling triumphant jessica went to the back room for more tea as she had burst out hours before jessica burst in through the front door of the house betsy she slung her purse over the newel post did it come without waiting for an answer she dashed toward the front parlor since you were six ive been telling you to slow down betsy came through the parlor doors intercepting her at least then you wore sensible shoes betsy jessica gave her a quick hard squeeze that held as much impatience as affection did it come yes of course it came the housekeeper straightened her apron with a tug and its sitting in the parlor just like you told me itll be there whether you walk sensibly or run like a fool the last of the sentence was wasted as jessica was already rushing by her oh its lovely gently she ran a finger over the wood then quickly began to examine it on all sides it was a delicate airy little piece a womans desk jessica opened the slant top then sighed at the unmarred interior really lovely wait until david sees it she opened one of the inner drawers it slid out smoothly its exactly what ive been looking for what luck that michael came across it crouching she ran a hand down one of its slender legs its pretty betsy admitted thinking that the carving would be one more thing to keep dust out of i bet you could have sold it for a pretty penny too the advantage of owning a shop is being able to cop some of the merchandise for yourself rising jessica shut the lid again now all she needed was a frivolous little inkwell or perhaps a porcelain box to set on top of it suppers nearly ready oh supper shaking her head jessica brought herself back to the moment mr sladerman ive neglected him all day is he upstairs in the library betsy announced grimly all day wouldnt even come out for lunch oh boy jessica combed a hand through her hair he hadnt looked like a man who would have much patience with disorganization i really wanted to ease him into that well im going to go be charming so we dont lose him whats for supper she asked over her shoulder stuffed pork chops and mashed potatoes that should help jessica muttered as she headed for the library door she opened it slowly enough to stick her head inside some things she decided you dont rush into he was sitting at a long work table surrounded by pillars and piles of books a thick pad was in front of him and the pencil in his hand was worked halfway down his hair fell over his forehead but she could see his brows drawn together in concentration or annoyance she mused she put on her best smile hi he looked up eyes pinning her jessica could feel the little prickles of power all over her skin she absorbed it intrigued by the sensation without being aware of it her smile had faded into a look of puzzlement who is this man she wondered it was curiosity as much as courage that had her coming all the way into the room the lamp on the desk slanted across his face highlighting his mouth and putting his eyes in shadow she didnt feel safe with him this time but unsettled she continued toward him youve got a hell of a mess here slade said shortly tossing his pencil aside it was better to attack than let himself dwell on how beautiful she was if you run your shop like this he gestured widely its a miracle youre not bankrupt the specific complaint eased the tension in her shoulders thered been nothing personal in that look she assured herself shed been foolish to think there had been i know its terrible jessica admitted smiling again i hope youre not going to do the sensible thing and walk out gingerly she lowered a hip to the table before lifting a book at random do you like challenges mr sladerman she was laughing he noted or her eyes were but he sensed very clearly that she laughed at herself a reluctant smile tugged at his mouth as he struggled to study her objectively maybe she was innocent maybe not he didnt have the same blind faith as the commissioner but she was beautiful and he was attracted slade decided the attraction was going to be difficult to work around letting out a long breath he gazed around the room how much choice did he have im going to take pity on you miss winslow i have a fondness for books so do i she began then had to deal with another of his cool direct looks really she claimed with a laugh im just not neat do we have a deal mr sladerman solemnly she offered her hand he glanced at it first soft and elegant he thought like her name and her voice with a quick curse at fate for making the commissioner her godfather slade took her hand in his we have a deal miss winslow jessica slid from the table keeping his hand in hers when he would have drawn away somehow shed known it would be hard and strong how do you feel about stuffed pork chops they were tender and delicious slade ate three after his stomach remembered the lack of lunch and he thought after a slice of cheesecake this case had some advantages over the one hed just wrapped up for two weeks hed made do on cold coffee and stale sandwiches and his partner hadnt been as easy to look at as jessica winslow shed guided the conversation expertly during the meal and had ended by tucking her arm through his to lead him back to the parlor have a seat she invited ill pour you a brandy as he started to cross the room the desk caught his eye that wasnt here this morning what with a decanter in her hand she glanced over her shoulder oh no it just came this afternoon do you know anything about antiques no he gave the desk a cursory study before taking a chair ill leave that to you miss winslow jessica she poured a second brandy before crossing to him do i call you james or jim slade he told her as he took a snifter even my mother stopped calling me jim when i was ten you have a mother the quick unconscious surprise in her voice had him grinning everybodys entitled to one feeling foolish jessica sat across from him you just seem to be capable of arranging the whole business without one both sipped brandy and their eyes met over the snifters jessica felt the moment freeze out of time out of place do minds touch she thought numbly wasnt she sensing at that moment the turbulent spin of his thoughts or were they hers brandy slipped hot and strong down her throat snapping her back talk she ordered herself say something do you have any other family she managed slade stared at her wondering if he had imagined that instant of stunning intimacy hed never felt that with any woman before any lover it was ridiculous to imagine that hed felt it with one he barely knew a sister he said at length shes in college a sister jessica relaxed again and slipped out of her shoes thats nice i always wanted a brother or sister when i was growing up money cant buy everything slade shrugged with the words seeing the puzzled hurt on her face he cursed himself if she was getting to him already what would it be like in a week youre quick with clichés jessica observed i suppose thats because youre a writer after another sip of brandy she set the glass aside what do you write unpublished novels she laughed as she had in the library drawing another smile from him it must be frustrating only daily he agreed why do you do it why do you eat jessica considered for a moment then nodded yes i suppose its like that isnt it have you always wanted to write he thought of his father how he had bragged that his son would be the next sladerman on the force he thought of his teenage years when he had written his stories in longhand in spiral notebooks late into the night he thought of his fathers eyes the first time he had seen his son in uniform and he thought of the first time hed had a short story accepted yes perhaps it was easier to admit to her what he had never been able to explain to his family always when you want something badly enough and you dont give up jessica began slowly you get it slade gave a short laugh before he drank always she touched the tip of her tongue to her top lip almost always its all a gamble isnt it long odds he murmured frowning into his glass i usually play long odds he studied the amber liquor which was almost exactly the shade of her eyes she shouldnt be so easy to talk to he mused hed find himself saying too much ah ulysses i wondered where you were lifting his eyes slade stared at a large loping mop of fur it lunged unerringly into jessicas lap he heard her groan then giggle damn it how many times do i have to tell you youre not a lap dog youre breaking my ribs she twisted her head but the wet pink tongue found her cheek stop she sputtered pushing impotently get down she ordered get down right this minute ulysses barked twice then continued to lap his tongue all over her face what slade asked slowly is that jessica gave another mighty shove but ulysses only rested his head on her shoulder a dog of course theres no of course about that dog hes a great pyrenees she retorted quickly running out of breath and he flunked obedience school three times you mangy softheaded mutt get down ulysses let out a long contented breath and didnt budge give me a hand will you she demanded of slade ill have internal injuries this time once before i was stuck for two hours until betsy got home rising slade approached the dog with a frown does he bite god im suffocating and the man asks if he bites a grin split slades face as he looked down at her cant be too careful about these things he might be vicious jessica narrowed her eyes sic em ulysses hearing his name the dog roused himself to lick her face again joyfully satisfied jessica demanded now grab him somewhere and get me out bending slade wrapped his arms around the bulk of fur the back of his hand brushed jessicas breast as he shifted his grip sorry he muttered dragging at the dog good god what does he weigh about one twentyfive i think with a shake of his head slade put his back into it ulysses slid to the floor to lay adoringly at jessicas feet taking a deep gulp of air jessica closed her eyes she was covered with loose white hair her own was disheveled and curled around her shoulders the color slade observed of sunbleached wheat with her face in repose the slant of her cheekbones was more pronounced her lips were just parted their shape was utterly feminine the classic cupids bow but for the fullness in the lower lip it spoke of passion hidden quietly simmering passion the mouth and the cheekbones added something to the tearoom looks that had slades pulse responding he couldnt want her he told himself that wasnt just irresponsible it was stupid he stared down at the dog again you should do something about training him he said shortly i know with a sigh jessica opened her brandycolored eyes her affection for ulysses made her forget the discomfort and the mess he usually created hes very sensitive really i just havent got the heart to subject him to obedience school again thats incredibly stupid slade tossed back hes too big not to be trained want the job jessica retorted straightening in the chair she began to brush at stray dog hair ive got one thanks why should it annoy her that he hadnt once used her name she asked herself as she rose dignity had to be sacrificed as she stepped over the now sleeping dog i appreciate the help she said stiffly and the advice is duly noted slade shrugged off the sarcasm no problem you struck me as more the poodle type though really for a moment jessica merely studied his eyes yes they were hard she decided hard and cool and cynical and i have the impression you dont think much of the poodle type help yourself to the brandy im going up chapter contents prev next for the next two days there was an uneasy truce perhaps it lasted that long because jessica made a point of staying out of slades way he in turn stayed out of hers while patiently noting her routine which he discovered was no routine at all she simply never stopped she didnt take time for the social rigamarole he had expected luncheons clubs committees but worked apparently inexhaustibly most of her time was spent at the shop at the rate he was going he knew he would find out little in the house his next move was the house of winslow it followed that he needed to make peace with jessica to get there from his bedroom window he watched her drive away it was barely eight oclock a full hour before she normally left slade swore in frustration how did the commissioner expect him to watch her or protect her if thats what she needed if she was always in one place while he was in another it was time to improvise an excuse to pay her a visit at her place of business grabbing a jacket on the way slade headed for the stairs he could always claim that he wanted to do a bit of research on antique furniture for his novel that would buy him a few hours as well as give him a reason to poke around before hed rounded the last curve in the steps he heard betsys voice nothing but trouble dont fuss slade stopped waiting as the footsteps came his way there was a tall gangly man walking down the hall his mop of dark blond hair was long and straight cut rather haphazardly just below the collar of a chambray workshirt he wore jeans and wirerim glasses and stood hunched over a bit either from habit or fatigue because he was staring down at his sneakers he didnt see slade his face was pale and the eyes behind the lenses were shadowed david ryce slade concluded and kept silent i told you she said you werent to come in today betsy bustled after him a feather duster gripped in her hand im fine if i lie around in bed another day im going to mold he coughed violently fine fine indeed betsy clucked her tongue swinging the duster at his back mom lay off exasperated david started to turn back to her when he spotted slade he frowned choking back another cough oh you must be the writer thats right slade came down the last two steps just a boy he thought taking davids measure quickly who hasnt completely thrown off the youthful defiance jessie and i figured youd be a short stooped little guy with glasses i dont know why he grinned but slade noted that he placed a hand on the newel post for support getting anywhere with the library slowly better you than me david murmured wishing for a chair has jessica come down yet shes already gone slade told him there you see betsy folded her arms over her chest and if you go in shell just send you right back home thunder at you too because his legs threatened to buckle david gripped the newel post harder shes going to need help with the new shipment anothers due in today lotta good youd do betsy began catching the look in davids eye slade cut in i was thinking about running down there myself id like to see the place maybe do a little research i could give her a hand he watched david struggle caught between his desire to go to the shop and his need to lie down shell try to move everything herself he muttered thats the truth betsy agreed apparently switching her annoyance from her son to her employer nothing stops that one its my job to move in the new stock check it off i dont moving furniture around shouldnt require any great knowledge of antiques slade put in casually knowing it was too perfect to let pass he slipped into his jacket and since i was heading that way anyway there its settled betsy announced she had her son by the elbow before he could protest mr sladerman will go look out for miss jessica you go back to bed im not going back to bed a chair all i wants a chair he sent slade a weak smile hey thanks tell jessie im coming back on monday the paperwork oh the new stock can wait over the weekend tell her to humor the invalid and leave it for me slade nodded slowly sure ill tell her turning he started out deciding that the new stock interested him very much fifteen minutes later slade parked in the small graveled lot beside jessicas shop it was a small framed building fronted with several narrow windows the shades were up through the glass he could see her tugging on a large and obviously heavy piece of furniture cursing women in general he walked to the front door and pulled it open at the jingle of bells she spun around that anyone would be by the shop at that hour surprised her that slade stood inside the door frowning at her surprised jessica more well the physical exertion had winded her so that she struggled to even her breathing i didnt expect to see you here she didnt add that she wasnt particularly pleased either shed stripped off her jacket and pushed up the sleeves of her cashmere sweater beneath it small high breasts rose and fell agitatedly slade remembered their softness against the back of his hand very clearly he forgot hed come to make peace with her dont you have more sense than to push this stuff around yourself he demanded with a quick oath he pulled off his jacket and tossed it over a chair jessica stiffened her back as well as her tone well good morning to you too her annoyance rolled off of him after crossing to her slade leaned against the large piece shed been struggling with where do you want it he asked shortly and i hope to god youre not one of those women who changes her mind a half dozen times he watched her eyes narrow and darken as they had that night in the parlor oddly he found her only more attractive when she was agitated if it hadnt been for that the way her chin jutted out might have amused him i dont believe anyone asked for your assistance for the first time he was treated to the ice in her tone im capable of arranging my stock myself dont be any more stupid than necessary he shot back youre just going to hurt yourself now where do you want this thing this thing she began heatedly is a nineteenthcentury french secretaire he gave it a negligent glance yeah so where do you want me to put it ill tell you where you can put it his laughter cut her off it was very male and full of fun it wasnt a sound she had expected from him with an effort she swallowed a chuckle of her own as she stepped back from him the last thing she wanted was to find anything appealing about james sladerman over there she said coolly pointing turning away jessica picked up a washstand to carry it in the opposite direction when the sounds of wood sliding over wood had stopped she turned back to him thank you the gratitude was short and cold now what can i do for you he treated himself to a lengthy look at her she stood very straight her hands folded loosely her eyes still dangerous two motherofpearl combs swept her hair back from her face he allowed his gaze to sweep down briefly she was very slender with a handspanable waist and barely any hips the trim flannel skirt hid most of her legs but slade could appreciate what was visible from the knees down her feet were very small one of them tapped the floor impatiently ive thought about that from time to time he commented as his eyes roamed back to hers but i came by to see what i could do for you ryce was worried that you might do just what you were trying to do a few minutes ago youve seen david her cool impatience evaporated swiftly jessica crossed the room to take slades arm was he up how is he suddenly he wanted to touch her her hair her face shed be soft he felt an almost desperate need for something soft and yielding her eyes were on his wide with concern he was up he said briefly and not as well as he wanted to be he shouldnt have been out of bed no probably not did her hair carry that scent he wondered that autumnwoods fragrance that was driving him mad he wanted to come in this morning come in jessica pounced on the two words i gave specific orders for him to stay home why cant he do as hes told slades eyes were suddenly keen on her face does everyone do what you tell them hes my employee she retorted dropping her hand from his arm he damn well better do what i tell him as quickly as she had flared up her mood shifted and she smiled hes hardly more than a boy really and betsy nags at him its just her way though i appreciate his dedication to the business hes got to get well her eyes drifted to the phone on the counter if i call hell just get defensive he said he wouldnt come in until monday slade leaned against the secretaire he wanted you to leave the paperwork on the new shipments for him jessica stuck her hands in her pockets obviously still toying with the idea of phoning to lecture david yes all right if hes going to come in on monday at least hell be sitting down ill get the new stock situated in the meantime so hes not tempted she smiled again hes nearly as obsessed with this place as i am if i so much as move a candlestick david knows it before he got sick he was trying to talk me into a vacation she laughed tossing her head so that her hair swung behind her he just wanted the place to himself for a week or two a very dedicated assistant slade murmured oh davids that jessica agreed what are you doing here slade i thought youd be buried in books half glad half wary that the reserve of the last few days had vanished he gave her a cautious smile i told david id give you a hand that was very nice the surprise in her voice had his smile widening i can be nice occasionally he returned besides i thought i might be able to get some information on antiques research oh she accepted this with a nod all right i wouldnt mind having some help with the heavier things what period were you interested in period furniture jessica explained as she walked to a long low chest is there a particular century or style renaissance early american italian provincial just a general sort of lesson today to give me the feel of it slade improvised as he nudged jessica away from the chest where do you want this he lifted and carried jessica arranged the lighter pieces while keeping up a running dialog on the furniture they moved this chair was chippendale see the square tapered seat and cabriole leg this cabinet was french baroque in satinwood gilded and carved she ran over a little table with a polishing cloth explaining about chinese influences and tea services during the morning they were interrupted half a dozen times by customers jessica turned from antique lover to salesperson slade watched her show pieces explain their background then dicker over prices if he hadnt been sure before he was certain now her shop was no toy to her she not only knew how to manage it but worked harder than hed given her credit for not only did she handle people with a deft skill he was forced to admire but she made money if the discreet price tags hed come across were any indication so why he wondered if she was dedicated to her shop if she turned a profit would she risk using her business for smuggling now that hed met her and spent some time with her it wasnt as easy for slade to dismiss it as kicks or thrills yet she wasnt lacking in brains was it plausible that an operation was going on under her nose without her knowledge slade i hate to ask jessica kept her voice lowered as she came close to his side touching came naturally to her it seemed for her hand was already on his arm irresponsible or not he discovered that he wanted her turning he trapped her effectively between the chest and himself her hand remained on his arm just below the elbow though they touched in no other way he suddenly had a very clear sensation of how her body would feel pressed against his his eyes brushed over her mouth then came to hers ask what her mind went blank some sound filled her head like an echo of surf pounding on the shore she could have stepped back an inch and broken the contact stepped forward an inch to consummate it jessica did neither dimly she was aware of a pressure in her chest as though someone were pressing hard against it to cut off her air in that instant they both knew he had only to touch her for everything to change slade she murmured half question half invitation he snapped back retreating from the edge from an involvement he couldnt afford did you want me to move something else his voice was cool as he stepped away from her shaken jessica backed toward the chest she needed distance mrs mackenzie wants to take the chifforobe with her shes gone out to pull her car to the front would you mind putting it in the back of her station wagon all right she indicated the piece with a silent gesture not moving until he was out the front door with it alone jessica allowed herself a long uneasy breath that was not a man a woman should lose control with she warned herself he wouldnt be gentle or particularly kind she placed the flat of her palm on her chest as if to relieve the pressure that lingered there dont overreact the next time she advised herself its the way he looks at me jessica decided as if he could see what im thinking she ran an unsteady hand through her hair i dont even know what im thinking when he looks at me so how could he and yet and yet her pulse was still racing when the door jingled open again she hadnt budged from her spot in front of the chest of drawers im starved she improvised swiftly then started to move as slade watched she hurried from window to window lowering shades she hung a sign on the door and then locked it you must be too she said when he remained silent its after one and ive had you dragging furniture around all morning how about a sandwich and some tea slade managed to smile and sneer at the same time tea her laughter eased her own tension no i suppose not well david keeps some beer she hustled to the back of the shop and pulled open the door of a small refrigerator she crouched then rummaged here i knew id seen some straightening jessica turned and collided with his chest he took her arms briefly in reflex then as quickly dropped them heart hammering she stepped away sorry i didnt know you were behind me will this do safely at arms length she offered the bottle fine his expression was bland as he took it and sat at the table the tension had settled at the base of his neck hed have to be careful not to touch her again or to give in to the urge to taste that subtly passionate mouth of hers once he did hed never stop there desire tightened a hard ball in the pit of his stomach almost violently slade twisted the cap from the beer ill fix some sandwiches jessica became very busy in the refrigerator roast beef all right yeah thats fine what goes on in his mind she wondered as she kept her hands busy its just not possible to tell what hes thinking she sliced neatly through bread and meat prudently keeping her back to him looking down at her own hands she thought of slades he had such long lean fingers strong shed liked the look of them now she caught herself wondering how they would feel on her body competent experienced demanding the flare of desire was quick but not unexpected this time fighting it she sliced the second sandwich a bit savagely he watched the sunlight stream through the window onto her hair it fell softly on the varied hues of blue in her sweater he liked the way the material clung to her enhancing the straight slender back and narrow waist but he noted too the tension in her shoulders he wasnt going to get very far if they were both preoccupied with an attraction neither wanted he had to make her relax and talk slade knew one certain way of accomplishing that youve got quite a place here jessica he wasnt aware that it was the first time hed said her name but she was that pleased her as much as the careful compliment thank you belatedly she remembered to turn the burner on under the kettle as she brought his sandwich to the table people have finally stopped calling it jessicas little hobby is that what it started out to be not to me she stretched on tiptoe to reach a cup slade watched the hem of her skirt sneak up but to a lot of people it was just justice winslows daughter having a fling at business did you want a glass for that no slade brought the bottle to his lips and drank why antiques it was something i knew something i loved its sensible to make a career out of something you know and appreciate dont you think he thought of the standard policeissue revolver hidden in his bedroom when its possible howd you get started i was lucky enough to have the funds to back me up the first year while i gathered stock and renovated this place the kettle shrilled then sputtered when she switched off the heat even with that it was hard enough setting up books getting licenses learning about taxes she wrinkled her nose as she brought her plate and cup to the table but thats a necessary part of the whole with that the traveling and the selling the first couple of years were killers she bit into her sandwich i loved it she would have he mused he could sense the pentup energy even as she sat there calmly drinking tea david ryce work for you long about a year and a half he was at that undecided point of his life i suppose we all go through when weve finished being teenagers but havent quite grasped adulthood she smiled across the table at slade do you know what i mean more or less you probably less than most she commented easily as it turned out he resented the offer of a job and the fact that he needed one david and i grew up together theres nothing harder on the ego than having big sister give you a break she sighed a bit remembering his moodiness his grudging acceptance his initial lack of interest anyway within six months he stopped being resentful and became indispensable hes very quick particularly with figures david considers the books his province now and hes better with them than the selling angle oh her eyes danced he isnt always diplomatic with customers hes much better with bookkeeping and inventory michael and i can handle the buying and selling michael before he drank again slade repeated the name as though it meant nothing michael does almost all my buying all the imports at any rate you dont buy the stock yourself not from overseas not anymore jessica toyed with the last half of her sandwich if id tried to keep up with it i wouldnt have been able to keep the shop open year round watching out for estate sales and auctions just in the new england area takes me away from the shop enough as it is and michael michael has a real genius for finding gems he wondered if her analogy was fact was michael adams shipping gems as well as hepplewhites across the atlantic michaels been handling that part of the business for nearly three years jessica went on and hes not only a good buyer but a terrific salesman particularly with my female clientele she laughed as she lifted her cup hes very smooth both looks and manner slade noted the affection in her voice and speculated just how much was between owner and buyer he wondered if adams was involved in smuggling and jessicas lover his thoughts trailed off as he looked down at her hands she wore a thin twisted band of gold on her right hand and a starshaped group of opals on her left the sun hit the stones shooting little flames of red into the delicate blue it suited her he thought taking another swig of beer in any case ive gotten spoiled jessica stretched her shoulders with a sigh its been a long time since ive had to run the shop alone ill be glad to have both michael and david back next week i might even take uncle charlie up on his invitation uncle charlie her cup paused halfway to her lips uncle charlie jessica repeated puzzled he sent you slade gave a quick silent oath as he shrugged the commissioner he said blandly i dont think of him as uncle charlie the commissioners awfully formal still frowning at him jessica set down her cup shes not a fool slade concluded as he swung an arm over the back of his chair i always call him that habit dont you like to travel he changed the subject neatly adding a quick disarming smile id think the buying end would be half the fun it can be it can also be a giant headache airports and auctions and customs the line between her brows vanished i have been thinking about combining a business and pleasure trip next spring i want to visit my mother and her husband in france your mother remarried yes its been wonderful for her after my father died she was so lost we both were she murmured and after nearly five years she mused there was still an ache it was dull with time but it was still there theres nothing harder than to lose someone you loved and lived with and depended on especially when you think that person is indestructible then hes taken away with no warning her voice had thickened touching off a chord of response in him i know he answered before he thought her eyes came up and fixed on his do you he didnt like the emotion she stirred up in him my father was a cop he answered curtly he was killed in action five years ago oh slade jessica reached for his hand how terrible how terrible for your mother wives of cops learn to live with the risk he moved his hand back to his beer sensing withdrawal jessica said nothing he wasnt a man to share emotion of any kind easily she rose stacking plates do you want something else i imagine therere cookies stashed around here somewhere she wouldnt probe he realized wouldnt eulogize shed offered him her sympathy then had backed off when shed seen that it wasnt wanted slade sighed it was difficult enough to deal with his attraction to her without starting to like her as well no he rose to help her clear the table when they entered the shop jessica went straight to the door to snap up the shade on the glass slade whirled sharply as he heard her quick cry of alarm it was immediately followed by a laugh mr layton jessica flipped the lock to admit him you scared the wits out of me he was tall well dressed and fiftyish his bankerish suit was offset by a gray silk tie the same color as his hair the rather thin stern face lightened with a smile as he took jessicas hand sorry dear but then you did the same to me glancing past her he gave slade an inquiring look this is james sladerman mr layton hes staying with us for a while davids been ill oh nothing serious i hope just the flu jessica told him but a heavy dose of it she gave him a sudden shrewd smile you always manage to pop in on me when ive just gotten in a shipment ive just managed to get this one arranged and anothers on its way he chuckled a hoarse sound due to his fondness for cuban cigars its more your predictability than chance miss winslow your michaels been in europe for three weeks id asked him to keep an eye out for a piece or two for me before he left oh well the jingle of the door interrupted her mr chambers i didnt expect you back so soon chambers gave her a rather sheepish smile as he removed his hat the box with the pearl inlay he began i cant resist it go on ahead my dear layton gave jessicas shoulder a pat ill just browse for the moment pretending an interest in a collection of pewter slade watched both men layton browsed lingering here and there to examine a piece once he drew out a pair of half glasses and crouched down to study the carving on a table slade could hear jessicas quiet voice as she discussed a snuffbox with chambers he choked back a snort of derision at the idea of a rational man buying anything as ridiculous as a snuffbox after telling jessica to wrap the box chambers turned to fuss over a curio cabinet it was a simple matter for slade to mentally note both mens descriptions and names later he would commit them to paper and call them in whoever they were they appeared to have at least a basic knowledge of antiques at least from what he could glean from their conversation as they both discussed the cabinet wandering to the counter slade glanced down at the ticket jessica was writing up her handwriting was neat feminine and legible one eighteenthcentury snuffbox french with pearl inlay it was the price that had him doing a double take are you kidding he asked aloud ssh she glanced over at her customers saw that they were occupied then sent slade a wicked grin dont you have any vices slade immoral not insane he retorted but the grin had appealed to him he leaned a bit closer do you she let the look hold enjoying the easy humor in his eyes it was the first time shed seen it no she gave a low laugh absolutely none for the first time he reached out to touch her voluntarily just the tip of her hair with the tip of his finger the pen slipped out of jessicas hand are you corruptible he murmured he was still smiling but she no longer felt easy jessica found herself grateful that the counter was between them and there were customers in the shop i wouldnt have thought so she managed laytons hoarse chuckle distracted her coming around the counter jessica walked toward her customers giving slade a wide berth dangerous curves ahead her mind warned one wrong turn with this man and youd be through the guardrail and over the cliff shed been too cautious for too long to be reckless now its a lovely little piece she said to both men it arrived right after youd left the other day mr chambers she was aware though he made no sound when slade turned his attention from her and wandered to the far end of the room in the end chambers bought the cabinet while layton chose what jessica referred to as a fauteuil and a console from the louis xv period slade saw them as a chair and a table too ornate for the average taste but elegant names he imagined equaled elegant prices with customers like that he commented when the shop was empty you could open a place twice this size i could she agreed as she filed the slips but its not what i want and of course not everyone buys as freely those are men who know what they like and can afford to have it its my good fortune that theyve taken to buying it here for the past year or so she watched him poke around opening a drawer here and there until he settled in front of a corner cabinet inside was a collection of porcelain figures lovely arent they she commented as she joined him he kept his back to her though that didnt prevent her scent from creeping into his senses yeah theyre nice she caught her bottom lip between her teeth it wasnt often dresden was described as nice my mother likes things like this ive always thought this was the best in the collection jessica opened the door and drew out a small delicate shepherdess i nearly whisked her away for myself slade frowned at it she does have a birthday and a thoughtful son her eyes were dancing when he lifted his to them how much he said flatly jessica ran her tongue over her teeth it was bargaining time there was nothing she liked better twenty dollars she said impulsively he laughed shortly im not stupid jessica how much when she tilted her head the stubborn line appeared between her brows twentytwo fifty thats my last offer reluctantly he smiled youre crazy take it or leave it she said with a shrug its your mothers birthday after all its worth a hell of a lot more than that it certainly would be to her jessica agreed frustrated slade stuck his hands in his pockets and frowned at the figurine again twentyfive he said sold before he could change his mind jessica hustled over to the counter and began to box it with a deft move she peeled the price tag from the bottom and dropped it in the trash i can giftwrap if you like she said no charge slowly he walked over to the counter watching as she laid the porcelain in a bed of tissue paper why because its her birthday birthday presents should be wrapped thats not what i mean he put a hand on the box to stop her movements why he repeated jessica gave him a long considering look he didnt like favors she concluded and only took this one because it was for someone he cared for because i want to his brow lifted and his eyes were suddenly very intense do you always do what you want i give it my best shot doesnt everyone before he could answer the door opened again delivery for you miss winslow slade felt a stir of excitement as the delivery was offloaded maybe just maybe thered be something he wanted to tie this case up quickly neatly and be gone while he still had some objectivity jessica winslow had a way of smearing the issue they werent a man and woman and he couldnt forget it he was a cop she was a suspect his job was to find out what he could even if it meant turning evidence on her listening to her steady stream of excitement as he uncarted boxes slade thought hed never known anyone who appeared less capable of dishonesty but that was a feeling a hunch he needed facts in his temporary position as mover and hauler he was able to examine each piece carefully he caught no uneasiness from jessica but rather her appreciation for helping her check for damage during shipping the twinge of conscience infuriated him he was doing his job he reminded himself and it was her damn uncle charlie that had put him there another year slade told himself again another year and thered be no commissioner to hand him special assignments as a baby sitter cum spy for goddaughters with amber eyes he found nothing his instinct had told him he wouldnt but slade could have used even a crumb to justify his presence she never stopped moving for the two hours it took to unload the shipment jessica was everywhere polishing arranging dragging out empty crates when there was nothing more to do she looked around for more thats it slade told her before she could decide that something might be shown to a better advantage somewhere else i guess youre right absently she rubbed at the small of her back its a good thing those three pieces are being shipped out monday its a bit crowded hey im starving she turned to him with an apologetic smile i didnt mean to keep you so long slade its after five without giving him a chance to comment she dashed to the back room for their jackets here ill close up how about a hamburger and a movie he said impulsively im just keeping an eye on her he told himself thats what im here to do surprised jessica glanced around as she pulled down the last shade from the look on his face she thought amused he was already half regretting having asked but that was no reason to let him off the hook what a romantic invitation how can i refuse you want romance he countered well go to a drivein movie he heard her quick gurgle of laughter as he grabbed her hand and pulled her outside it was late when the phone rang the seated figure reached for it and a cigarette simultaneously hello wheres the desk the desk frowning he brought the flame to the tip and drew its with the rest of the shipment of course youre mistaken the voice was soft and cold ive been to the shop myself it has to be there a flutter of panic rose in his throat jessica just hasnt unpacked it yet possibly youll clear this up immediately i want the desk and its contents by wednesday the pause was slight you understand the penalty for mistakes chapter contents prev next jessica woke thinking of him she took time on the lazy sunday morning to ponder the very odd saturday she had spent most of it with slade a moody man she mused stretching her arms toward the ceiling by turns she had been comfortable with him exasperated by him and attracted to him no that wasnt quite true she amended even when shed been comfortable or exasperated shed been attracted there was something remote about him that made her want to pry him open a bit shed put quite a lot of effort into that the evening before and had come up with nothing he wasnt a man for divulging secrets or bothering with small talk he was an odd combination of the direct and the aloof he didnt flatter not by looks or words and yet she felt certain that he wasnt indifferent to her it wasnt possible that shed imagined those moments of physical pull theyd been there for him as well as for her but he had guards she thought with quick frustration shed never known a man with such guards those dark intense eyes of his clearly said keep back arms length while the challenge of piercing his armor appealed to her her own instinctive awareness of what the consequences would be held her back jessica enjoyed a dare but she usually figured the odds first in this case she decided they were stacked against her a nice cautious friendship was in order she concluded anything else spelled trouble rising she picked up her robe and headed for the shower but wouldnt it be nice she thought to feel that rather hard mouth on hers just once downstairs slade was closeted in the library hed been up since dawn she was crowding his mind what crazy impulse had prompted him to ask her out the night before after downing his fourth cup of coffee slade lit a cigarette for gods sake he didnt have to date the woman to do his job she was getting to him he admitted as he pushed a pile of books aside that low musical laugh and all that soft blond hair it was more than that he thought ruefully it was her she was too close to possessing all the things hed ever wanted in a woman warmth generosity intelligence and that steamy almost primitive sexuality you could sense just under the surface if he kept thinking of her that way it was going to cloud his objectivity even now he was finding himself trying to work out a way to keep her out of the middle when slade drew on the cigarette his eyes were hard and opaque hed protect her when the time came expose her if it came to that but there was no way to keep her out of it still over the mix of leather and dust and smoke he thought he caught a lingering trace of her scent after evading the cooks admonishment to put something in her stomach jessica drank a hurried cup of coffee wheres david she called out when she spotted betsy armed with a rag and a bottle of silver polish he took a walk down to the beach his mother harrumphed a bit but added he looks better i guess the airll do him good ill grab a jacket and check on him long as he doesnt know thats what youre up to betsy jessica feigned offense im much too good for that as the housekeeper snorted the doorbell sounded go ahead jessica told her ill get it she made a dash for the door michael with pleasure she threw her arms around his neck its good to have you back slade came into the hall in time to see jessica embraced and kissed with that low promising laugh she pressed her cheek against the cheek of a slender darkhaired man with smooth features and light green eyes michael adams slade concluded after conquering the urge to stride up to the couple and yank them apart the description fit he caught the gleam of a diamond on the mans pinky as he ran his hand through jessicas hair soft hands and a sunlamp tan slade thought instantly ive missed you darling michael drew jessica back far enough to smile into her face she laughed again touching a hand to his cheek before she stepped out of his arms knowing you michael you were too busy with business and other things to miss anyone how many broken hearts did you leave in europe i never break them michael claimed before brushing her lips again and i did miss you come inside and tell me everything she ordered while tucking her arm through his the stock you sent back is wonderful as always ive already sold oh hello slade the moment jessica turned she saw him quickly potently his eyes locked on hers she had to use all of her strength of will not to draw in her breath was there a demand in them she wondered a question confused she gave a slight shake of her head what was it he wanted from her and why was she ready to give it without even knowing what it was jessica there was a faint smile on his face as he waited michael this is james sladerman hes staying with us for a while and trying to make some order out of the library no small job from what ive seen of it michael commented i hope youve got plenty of time enough knowing the housekeeper would be close enough to eavesdrop jessica stepped away from michael and called her betsy could we have coffee in the parlor slade youll join us she had expected him to refuse but he gave her a slow smile sure he didnt have to look at michael to see the annoyance before they walked into the parlor why jessica whats the queen anne doing here fate she told him then laughed as she sat on the sofa id meant to ask you to find one for me when i saw it on the shipping list i wondered if you were psychic after studying it for a moment he nodded it certainly suits this room he sat next to jessica as slade settled in an armchair no problem with the shipments no theyre already unpacked as a matter of fact three pieces go out tomorrow davids been ill this past week slade helped me get things in order yesterday really michael took out a waferthin gold case then offered slade a cigarette refusing with a shake of his head slade pulled out his own pack do you know antiques mr sladerman no slade struck a match watching michael over the flame unless we count the lesson jessica gave me yesterday michael sat back tossing an arm casually over the back of the sofa what do you do his smooth neat fingers toyed absently with jessicas hair slade took a hard drag on his cigarette im a writer fascinating would i have read any of your work he gave michael a long steady stare i wouldnt think so slade is working on a novel jessica intervened there were undercurrents that made her uncomfortable you havent told me yet what its about he caught the look in her eye recognizing it as a plea for peace not yet he decided well just see what we can stir up smuggling he said flatly there was a loud clatter of china from the doorway damn david took a firmer grip on the tray then gave jessica a sheepish smile i almost dropped the whole works david she sprang up to take the coffee tray from him you can hardly carry yourself much less all this slade watched him give her a disgruntled look before he flopped into a chair david was still pale or had the loss of color come when smuggling had been mentioned slade wondered there was a faint line of sweat on his brow between his mop of hair and his glasses after setting down the tray jessica turned back to him how do you feel david scowled at her dont fuss all right she leaned over until her face was level with his if id known you were going to be such a bad patient id have brought you some crayons and colored paper though he gave her hair a hard tug he grinned get me some coffee and shut up oh yes sir she said meekly when she turned david sent slade a quick wink gotta know how to handle these society types hi michael welcome back reaching in his pocket he found a crumpled pack of cigarettes as he searched for matches his eyes lit on the desk hey whats this one of michaels finds ive already laid claim to jessica told him as she brought him his coffee you can take care of the paperwork next week monday he said firmly eyeing the desk queen anne its lovely isnt it she handed slade a cup before crossing to it opening the lid she showed off the inside slade felt the back of his neck prickle there was a rise in tension he felt it could nearly smell it shifting his eyes from jessica he studied both men michael added cream to his coffee david found his match with a half shrug slade told himself he was getting jumpy and wait until you see the rest of the stock jessica told david as she came back to the sofa michael outdid himself slade let the conversation hum around him answering briefly if he was asked a direct question she was crazy about the kid he concluded it showed in the way she teased lightly bullied and catered to him slade remembered her comment about having wanted a brother or sister david was obviously her substitute how far would she go to protect him he wondered all the way flashed through his mind if there was one firm impression hed gotten from jessica winslow it was loyalty her relationship with michael was less defined if they were lovers slade concluded that she was very casual about it somehow he didnt feel jessica would be casual about intimacy passion he thought again there was hot vibrant passion smoldering in that slender little body if michael was her lover slade would have seen some sign of it in the kiss they had exchanged at the door if she had been in his arms it would have been there he thought as his gaze drifted to her mouth it was soft and unpainted from ten feet away he could all but taste it slowly irresistibly desire crept into him and with it an ache a dull throbbing ache hed never felt before if he could have her even once the ache would go slade could almost convince himself of that he needed to touch that buttersoft skin experience that promise of passion then hed be free of her he had to be free of her glancing up jessica found herself trapped again his eyes imprisoned her she could feel herself being pulled as physical a sensation as if he had taken her hand she resisted hes quicksand her mind flashed youll never get away if you take that final step and yet the risk tempted her jessica michael took her hand scattering her thoughts hmm yes how about dinner tonight the little place up the coast you like his calm familiar green eyes smiled at her jessica felt her pulses level this was a man she understood id love to and dont worry about getting home early david put in im minding the shop tomorrow you stay home jessica lifted her brow at the order oh really david snorted at the dry tone there goes miss radcliffe he told slade she forgets i was around when she was twelve and had braces on her teeth how would you like to be flat on your back again she invited sweetly ill be ready at seven she told michael ignoring davids grin fine giving her a quick kiss michael rose see you tomorrow david nice to meet you mr sladerman as he left jessica set down her cup and sprang up as if she had been in one place too long im going to take ulysses for a walk on the beach dont look at me david drawled i have to conserve my energy i wasnt going to ask you slade he would have liked to steer clear of her for a while resigned he rose sure ill get a jacket the beach was long and rocky from off the bay the breeze was keen and tinged with salt jessica was laughing stooping to pick up driftwood and toss it for the dog to chase ulysses bounded up the beach and back again running energetic circles around them until jessica flung another stick to the right water hurled itself on rocks then rose in a misty spray slade watched jessica run to another piece of driftwood doesnt she ever walk he wondered she laughed again holding the stick over her head as the dog leaped clumsily at it dont contact us unless you have something useful slade jammed his hands in his pockets as he remembered his orders watch the woman he was watching the woman damn it and she was getting to him watch what the sunlight does to her hair watch how a pair of faded jeans cling to narrow hips watch how her mouth curves when she smiles watch detective sladerman blow everything because he cant keep his mind off a skinny woman with brandycolored eyes what are you thinking he snapped back to find jessica a step in front of him searching his face cursing himself he realized he was going to blow more than his cover if he wasnt careful that i havent been to the beach in a long time he improvised jessica narrowed her eyes no i dont think so she murmured i wonder what it is about you that makes you so secretive with an impatient gesture she pushed back her hair the wind immediately blew it back in her face but its your business i suppose annoyed he picked up a rock and hurled it into the breakers i wonder what it is about you that makes you so suspicious curious she corrected a bit puzzled by his choice of word youre an interesting man slade perhaps because theres so much you dont say what do you want a biography you annoy easily she murmured he whirled to her dont push it jess the nickname pleased her no one but her father had ever used it the fury on his face pleased her too shed poked the first hole in his shield and if i do she challenged youll get pushed back im not polite she laughed no you damn well arent should that scare me she was baiting him even knowing it didnt help slim and strong she stood in front of him her hair whipped around her face by the wind her eyes were gold and insolent no she wouldnt scare easily slade told himself it was to prove a point even as he yanked her into his arms he told himself it was to prove a point he saw it on her face anticipation acceptance no fear cursing her he brought his mouth down hard on hers it was as he thought it would be soft fragrant pliant she melted like wax in his arms even as his lips bruised hers a man could drown in her the pounding of the surf seemed to echo in his head there was a sensation of standing in the surf having it ebb and suck the sand from under him he dragged her closer her breasts yielded against the hard line of his chest tempting him to explore their shape with his hands but all his power all his concentration was bound up in the pressure of mouth to mouth her hands slid under his jacket up his back pressing urging him to take more head swimming he drew away struggling to separate himself with a long shaky breath jessica dropped her head on his shoulder i nearly suffocated his arms were still around her hed meant to drop them now with her snuggled close her hair brushing his cheek he wasnt certain he could then she tilted her face to his she was smiling youre supposed to breathe through your nose he told her i think i forgot so did i he mused then take a deep breath slade suggested im not nearly finished yet with no less force with no less turbulence his mouth returned to hers this time she was prepared no longer passive jessica made demands of her own her lips parted and her tongue met his searching teasing tasting his flavor was as dark and unsettling as she had imagined greedy she dove deeper she heard his moan felt the sudden race of his heart against her own an urgency filled her so quickly that it took total command there was nothing but him his arms his lips he was all she wanted she had never felt this kind of need or this kind of power even when his lips were brutal she returned the same aggression arousal was too tame a word excitement too bland jessica felt a frenzy a burst of energy that could only be tamed by possession touch me she wanted to scream as her fingers gripped his hair desperately take me its never been like this and i cant bear to lose it she strained against him her gesture as much a demand as an offering he was stronger she knew the sleek hard muscles warned her but his need could be no greater no need could be greater than the one that throbbed in her pounded in her her body felt assaulted both helpless and invulnerable oh show me she thought dizzily ive waited so long to really know a gull screamed overhead like a spray of ice water it jolted slade back what the hell was he doing he demanded as he pushed jessica away or more to the point what was she doing to him hed lost everything his purpose his identity his sanity in one heady taste of her now she stared at him cheeks flushed with passion eyes dark with it her mouth was moist and swollen from his parted with her breath coming rapidly slade with his name husky on her lips she reached for him roughly he caught her wrist before she could touch him youd better go in there was nothing in his eyes now they were opaque again unreadable he stared down at her with a complete lack of interest for an instant she was too confused to understand hed taken her to the edge to that thin tenuous border then had rudely shoved her back as though she hadnt moved him in the least shame flooded her face with color anger stole in again damn you she whispered turning she dashed for the beach steps and took them two at a time jessica dressed with care there was nothing like the feel of silk against the skin to salve wounded pride turning sideways in front of the fulllength mirror she gave a nod of approval the lines of the dress were simple except for the surprising plunge in the back that dipped just below the waist it didnt bother her conscience that she had chosen the dress more with slade in mind than michael and the color suited her mood a deep imperial purple she swept her hair back from her face with two diamondcrusted pins then let it fall as it chose satisfied jessica grabbed her evening bag and started downstairs she found slade in the parlor tightening a screw in a chippendale commode his hands were lean and competent she remembered the feel of them when theyd run over her body in a quick desperate search well arent you handy jessica stated he glanced up frowned and tightened his grip on the screwdriver did she have to look like that he thought darkly the dress clung everywhere and from the way she walked by him he knew she was aware of it slade turned the screw savagely betsy complained that the handle was loose he muttered jack of all trades she said lightly drink im fixing martinis he started to refuse then made the mistake of looking over at her her back was naked and slim and smooth the silk shifted enticingly as she reached for a bottle of vermouth desire was as breathtaking as a punch in the solar plexus scotch he snapped she smiled over her shoulder rocks straight up drink like a man do you slade oh shed get through that damned indifference jessica vowed and enjoy every minute of it after pouring him three fingers she brought the glass to him he slipped the screwdriver into the back pocket of his jeans and rose keeping his eyes on hers slade took a long slow sip of scotch dress like a woman do you jess determined to rattle him she turned a circle like it did you wear it to stir up adams juices or mine he countered with a provocative smile she turned away to finish the martinis do you think women always dress to stir men up dont they normally i dress for myself after pouring a drink she turned back to regard him over the rim tonight i thought id test a theory he went to her the challenge in her eyes and his own ego made it imperative just as she had anticipated what theory jessica met his angry gaze without faltering do you have any weaknesses slade any achilles heel deliberately he set down his own glass then took hers he felt her stiffen though she didnt back away his fingers circled her neck coaxing her lips to within an inch of his she felt the warm rush of his breath on her skin you could regret finding out jess i wont treat you like a lady she tossed her head back though her heart was hammering she met his eyes with an angry dare who asked you to his fingers tightened her lashes lowered the doorbell rang slade picked up his drink and downed the rest of it your date he said shortly then stalked out of the room slade pulled his car to a halt a short distance away from the restaurant switched off the engine pulled out a cigarette then waited michaels daimler was just being parked by the valet slade would have been more comfortable if he could have slipped inside to keep a closer eye on jessica but that was too risky he saw the car pull up behind him tension pricked at the back of his neck as the driver climbed out to approach his car slade slipped a hand inside his jacket and gripped the butt of his gun a badge was pressed against the window glass slade relaxed as the man rounded the hood to enter by the passenger side sladerman agent brewster gave a quick nod of greeting you follow the lady i follow the man commissioner dodson told you id be in touch yeah greenharts looking after ryce not a lot of action there the guys been laid up for more than a week youve got nothing yet i take it nothing slade shifted to a more comfortable position i spent the day at her shop saturday helped her uncart a new shipment if there was anything in it id swear she didnt know it i had my hands all over everything in that place shes too damn casual to be hiding anything maybe with a weighty sigh brewster pulled out a worn black pipe and began to pack it if that fancy little shops the dump site at least one of ems hiding something maybe all three seems ryce is like baby brother as for adams brewster struck a match and sucked on his pipe slade said nothing well the ladys got the justices name behind her and a lot of political pressure to keep her name clear but if shes involved its going to hit the fan shes not he heard himself say then flipped his cigarette out the window youre in the majority brewster commented easily even if shes as pure as a mothers heart shes in a hell of a spot right now pressures building sladerman the lids going to blow real soon and when it does its going to get ugly winslow might find herself right in the middle dodson seems to think youre good enough to keep her out of the way when it goes down ill take care of her slade muttered i dont like her being alone with adams in there well i missed my dinner brewster touched his rounded stomach ill just go eat on the taxpayers money and keep an eye on your lady shes not my lady slade mumbled the restaurant was quiet and candlelit by the table where jessica sat with michael was a breathtaking view of the sound on the nightblack water there was moonlight and the scattered reflection of stars the murmur of diners was discreet low tones soft laughter the scent of fresh flowers mixed with the aroma of food and candlewax champagne buzzed pleasantly in her head if someone had told her shed been working too hard lately jessica would have laughed but now she was completely relaxed for the first time in over a week im glad you thought of this michael he liked the way the light flickered over her face throwing a mystery of shadows under her cheekbones enhancing the odd golden hue of her eyes why was it she always seemed that much more beautiful when hed been away from her and had he for a dozen foolish reasons waited too long jessica he brought her hand to his lips ive missed you the gesture and the tone of his voice surprised her its good to have you back michael odd that hed always been known for his smooth lines and was now unable to think how to proceed jessica i want you to start coming with me on the buying trips come with you her brow creased why michael youre more than capable of handling that end i hate to admit it but youre much better at it than i i dont want to be away from you again puzzled jessica gave a quick laugh as she squeezed his hand michael dont tell me you were lonely i know theres nothing you like better than zipping around europe hunting up treasures if you were homesick its a first his fingers tightened on hers i wasnt homesick jessica and there was only one thing i was lonely for i want you to marry me surprise was a mild term jessica was stunned and her face was transparent marry she nearly thought she had misunderstood him she could hardly conceive of michael wanting to be married at all but to her theyd been together for nearly three years business associates friends but never jessica you must know how i feel he placed a hand over their joined ones ive loved you for years michael i had no idea oh michael that sounds so trite she ran the fingers of her free hand up and down the stem of her glass i dont know what to say to you say yes michael why now why all of a sudden she stopped the nervous movement of her hand and studied him you never even hinted that you had any feelings for me other than affection do you know how hard its been he asked quietly contenting myself with that jessica you werent ready for my feelings youve been so wrapped up in making a success out of the shop you needed to make a success of it and i wanted to build up my own part of it before i asked you we both needed to be independent it was true all that he said and yet how was she to suddenly stop seeing him as michael her friend her associate and see him as michael her lover her husband i dont know he squeezed her hand either in reassurance or frustration i didnt expect you would so quickly will you think about it yes of course i will and even as she promised the memory of a violent embrace on a windy beach ran through her mind in the late hours the phone rang but it didnt wake him hed been expecting it youve located my property he moistened his lips then dried them again with the back of his hand yes jessica took the desk home theres a small problem i dont like problems cold beads of sweat broke out on his forehead ill get the diamonds out its just that jessicas always around theres no way i can take the desk apart and get them while shes in the house i need some time to convince her to go away for a few days twentyfour hours but thats not thats all the time you have or all the time miss winslow will have sweat coated his lip and he lifted a trembling hand to wipe it away dont do anything to her ill get them for miss winslows sake be successful twentyfour hours he repeated if you dont have them by then shell be disposed of ill retrieve my property myself no ill get them dont hurt her you swore shed never have to be involved she involved herself twentyfour hours chapter contents prev next jessica had no answers alone she sat on the beach chin on her knees and watched the early sun spread streaks of pink above the water yards away ulysses chased the surf bounding back to the shore each time it turned on him hed given up on the idea of conning jessica into tossing sticks for him shed always liked the beach at sunrise it helped her think the screech of gulls the pound of water against rock the burgeoning light always calmed her mind so that an answer could be found not this time it wasnt as if shed never considered marriage sharing a home raising a family but shed never had a clear picture of the man could it be michael she enjoyed being with him talking to him they shared interests but oh there was a but she thought as she lowered her forehead to her knees an enormous but and he loved her shed been blind to it where was her sensitivity she wondered with a surge of guilt and frustration how could a thing a business have been so important that it blocked her vision worse now that she knew what was she to do about it slade came down the beach steps swearing how the hell could he keep a rein on a woman who took off before sunrise gone walking on the beach betsy had told him alone on a deserted beach slade thought grimly completely vulnerable to anything and anyone did she always have to be moving doing why couldnt she have been the lazy halfwit hed imagined her to be then he spotted her head down shoulders slumped if it hadnt been for the mass of wheatcolored hair he would have sworn it was another woman jessica stood straight and was always heading somewhere usually too fast she didnt curl up in a ball of defeat uncomfortable he thrust his hands in his pockets and walked toward her she didnt hear him but sensed the intrusion and the identity of the intruder almost simultaneously slowly she straightened then looked out at the horizon again good morning she said when he stood beside her youre up early so are you you worked late i heard your typewriter sorry no a fleeting smile i liked it is the book going well slade glanced up as a gull soared over their heads whitebreasted and silent it moved for a while last night somethings wrong he thought he started to sit beside her then changed his mind and remained standing what is it jess she didnt answer immediately but turned her head to study his face and what would he do she wondered if he wanted a woman to marry him would he wait patiently choose the best time then be satisfied when she asked him to wait for an answer a ghost of a smile touched her lips god no have you had many lovers she asked what she didnt pay any attention to his incredulous expression but turned to stare out at the surf again i imagine you have she murmured youre a very physical man the clouds skimming over the water were shot through with red and gold as she spoke jessica watched them brighten i can count mine on three fingers she continued in a tone that was more absent than confidential the first was in college a relationship so brief it hardly seems fair to include it he sent me carnations and read shelley out loud she laughed a little as she settled her chin back on her knees later when i was touring europe there was this older man french very sophisticated i fell like a ton of bricks then i found out he was married and had two children shaking her head jessica gripped her knees tighter after that there was an advertising executive oh he had a way with words it was right after my father died and i was groping he borrowed ten thousand dollars from me and vanished i havent been involved with a man since she brooded out to sea i didnt want to get stung again so ive been careful maybe too careful he wasnt overly pleased to hear about the men in her life forcing himself to be objective he listened when she fell silent slade dropped down beside her for the space of a full minute there was nothing but the sound of crashing waves and calling gulls jess why are you telling me this maybe because i dont know you maybe because it seems ive known you for years a bit shakily she laughed and dragged her hands through her hair i dont know taking a deep breath she stared straight ahead michael asked me to marry him it hit him hard like a stunning blow to the back of the neck that leaves you disoriented just for an instant before unconsciousness very deliberately slade gathered a handful of sand then let it sift through his fingers and and i dont know what to do she turned to him then all turbulent eyes and frustration i hate not knowing what to do stop it now he ordered himself tell her youre not interested in hearing about her problems but the words were already slipping out how do you feel about him i depend on michael she began talking fast hes part of my life hes important to me very important but you dont love him slade finished calmly then you should know what to do its not that simple she tossed back with a sound of exasperation she started to rise then made herself sit still hes in love with me i dont want to hurt him and maybe maybe you should marry him so he wont be hurt slade gave a mirthless laugh dont be such an idiot anger rose quickly and was as quickly suppressed it was difficult to argue with logic more miserable than offended she watched a gull swoop low over the water i know marrying him would only hurt both of us in the long run especially if his feelings for me are as deep as he thinks they are youre not sure hes in love with you slade murmured considering the other reasons michael might want her to marry him im sure he thinks he is jessica returned i thought maybe if we became lovers then good god he caught her by the shoulder roughly are you considering offering your body as some sort of consolation prize dont she shut her eyes so she couldnt see the derision in his you make it sound so dirty what the hell are you thinking of he demanded in an uncharacteristic gesture of futility she lifted her hands my track record with men has been so poor i thought well given a little time hed change his mind imbecile slade said shortly just tell him no now you make it sound so easy youre making it complicated jess am i for a moment she lowered her forehead to her knees again his hand was halfway to her hair before he stopped himself youre so sure of yourself slade nothing makes a coward of me more than people i care about the idea of facing him again knowing what i have to do makes me want to run he was responding to the fragility she so rarely showed deep inside him something struggled to be free to comfort her he banked it down an instant before it was too late he wont be the first man whos had a proposal turned down she sighed nothing shed said had made sense once it had been spoken aloud everything he said had some of the burden lifted with a half smile she turned to him have you have i what had a proposal turned down he grinned pleased that the lost look had left her eyes no but then marriage didnt figure in any of them she gave her quick gurgle of laughter what did reaching over he grabbed a handful of her hair is this color real thats an abominably rude question one deserves another he countered if i answer yours will you answer mine no then i suppose well both have to use our imagination jessica laughed again and started to rise but the hand on her hair stopped her the quizzical smile she gave him faded quickly his eyes were fixed on hers dark intense and for once readable desire hot electric restless desire and she was drawn to him already aroused by a look for the first time she was afraid he was going to take something from her she wouldnt easily get back if she managed to get it back at all he pulled her closer and she resisted in an instinctive defense against a nebulous fear jessica put her hands to his chest no this isnt what i want yes yes it is her eyes told him even while her hands pushed him away in one move she was under him on the sand i warned you i wouldnt treat you like a lady his mouth lowered took and enticed fear was buried in an avalanche of passion at the first taste of him response overwhelmed her wild and free jessica forgot what she stood to lose and simply experienced his tongue probed slowly searching expertly seducing while his lips crushed hers in an endless exquisite demand she answered mindlessly willing desperately wanting then he tore his mouth from hers to move over her face as if to absorb the texture of her skin through the sense of taste alone she fretted to have his lips on hers turning her head in search then suddenly fiercely he buried his lips at her throat wrenching a moan from her the sand made whispering sounds as she shifted wanting the agonized delight he was causing to go on and on her hands found their way under his sweater up the planes and muscles of his back down the hard line of ribs to a lean waist the moist air smelled of salt and the sea and faintly of the musky scent of passion his mouth found hers again unerringly as water crashed like thunder on the rocks nearby she felt his lips move against hers though the meaning of his murmur was lost to her only the tone a hint of angry desperation came through then his hands began to search with bruising meticulousness from her hips to her breasts lingering there as if trapped by the softness she was unaware of the sun beating down on her closed lids of the coarse sand under her back there was only his lips and hands now calloused fingers ran over her skin scraping kindling fresh fires while feeding those already ablaze roughly he caught her bottom lip between his teem drawing it into his mouth to suck and nibble until her sighs were moans in a sudden frenzy jessica arched against him center to throbbing center denim strained against denim in a thin frustrating barrier on a groan slade buried his face in her hair immersed in the scent of it as he groped for control but thered be no control he knew with the taste and scent and feel of her overpowering him with a muffled oath he rolled from her springing up before she could touch him and make him forget all reason slade drew air into his lungs harshly letting it cool the heat that radiated through him he had to be out of his mind he thought to have come that close to taking her seconds passed he could tick them off by the sound of her unsteady breathing behind him and his own jess no dont say anything i get the picture her voice was thick and wavering when he turned back she had risen to brush off the clinging sand the glint of the morning sun haloed the crown of her head even while the breeze tossed the ends up and back you changed your mind everyones entitled when she started to walk by him slade gripped her arm jessica jerked against his hold found it firm then threw up her chin hurt slade could see it all too well beneath the anger in her eyes it was better that way he told himself smarter but the words came out of his mouth before he could stop them would you prefer that wed made love on the beach like a couple of teenagers shed forgotten where theyd been place and time hadnt mattered when the need to love had been paramount it only cut deeper into her pride that he had remembered and had maintained enough control to stop id prefer you didnt touch me again she returned coolly she lowered her eyes to his restraining hand then lifted them again slowly starting now slades grip only tightened i warned you once not to push me push you jessica retorted i didnt start this i didnt want this no you didnt start it he took her shoulders now giving her three hard shakes and i didnt want it either so back off her teeth snapped together on the final shake if hurt had outweighed anger before now the tide was turned enraged jessica knocked both of his hands away dont you dare shout at me she yelled outdoing him in volume behind them water hurled itself against rock then lifted in a tumultuous spray and dont intimate that ive thrown myself at you because i havent with her arms pinned she had to toss her head to free it of blowing hair her eyes glinted behind the dancing strands id have you crawling on your hands and knees if i wanted his eyes became gray slits anger mixed with an uncomfortable certainty that she probably could i dont crawl for any woman much less some snotty little twit who uses perfume as a weapon snotty little she broke off sputtering twit she managed after an outraged moment why you simpleminded egotistical ass unable to think of a better defense she shoved a hand against his chest i hope you havent put a woman in that novel of yours because you know zip im not even wearing any perfume and i wouldnt need breathing hard jessica trailed off what the hell are you grinning at your face is pink he told her its cute her eyes flashed golden fury the intent for violence was clear in the step she took toward him lifting his hands aloft palms out slade stepped back truce he wasnt sure when or how but sometime during her diatribe his anger had simply vanished he was almost sorry fighting with her was nearly as stimulating as kissing her nearly jessica hesitated her temper hadnt run its course but there was something very appealing about the way he smiled at her it was friendly and a shade admiring she had the quick notion that it was the first absolutely sincere smile hed given her and it was more important than her anger maybe she said not willing to be too forgiving too quickly state your terms after a moments consideration she placed her hands on her hips take back the snotty little twit the gleam of pure humor in his eyes pleased her for the simpleminded egotistical ass bargaining was her biggest vice jessica curled her fingers and contemplated her nails just the simpleminded the rest stands he hooked his thumbs in the front pockets of his jeans youre a tough lady you got it when he held out his hand they shook solemnly one more thing since theyd dealt with the anger slade wanted to deal with the hurt i didnt change my mind she didnt speak after a moment he slipped an arm around her shoulders and began to lead her back toward the beach steps without too much effort he blocked out the nagging voice that told him he was making a mistake slade he glanced down at her as they skirted the small grove at the top of the steps what michaels coming to dinner tonight okay ill stay out of the way no she spoke too quickly then bit her lip no actually i was wondering if you could play chaperone he finished shortly careful jess youre coming close to being a twit again refusing to be angry she stopped in the center of the lawn and turned to him slade everything you said on the beach is true id said the same to myself but i love michael almost the same way i love david when he only frowned at her she sighed what i have to do tonight hurts id just like some moral support it would be a little easier if you were there during dinner afterward ill handle it reluctant and resigned slade let out a long breath just through dinner and youre going to owe me one hours later jessica paced the parlor her heels clicked on the hardwood floor fell silent over the persian carpet then clicked again she was grateful that david had a date it would have been impossible to have hidden her mood from him and just as impossible to have confided in him the business relationship was bound to be strained now between her and michael jessica didnt want to add more problems perhaps michael would even decide to resign she hated the thought of it oh it would always be possible to replace a buyer she thought but theyd been so close such a good team shutting her eyes she cursed herself she couldnt help thinking of michael in conjunction with the shop it had always been that way maybe if they had known each other before the partnership like she and david her feelings would be different jessica clasped her hands together again no there simply wasnt that spark if there had been the shop would never have interfered shed felt the spark once or twice in her life that quick jolt that says maybe just maybe thered been no spark with slade she mused thered been an eruption annoyed jessica shook her head she shouldnt be thinking of slade now or of the two turbulent times shed been in his arms it was only right that she concentrate on michael on how to say no without hurting him before coming into the room slade stopped to watch her always moving he thought but this time there were nerves beneath the energy she was wearing a very simple very sophisticated black dress with her hair caught in a braid over one shoulder looking at her slade had a moments sympathy for michael it wouldnt be easy to love a woman like that and lose unless michael was a total fool one glance at her face was going to give him her answer shed never have to open her mouth hes going to survive jess when she whirled slade strode over to the liquor cabinet there are other women you know he was deliberately offhand deliberately cynical knowing what her reaction would be even with his back to her he thought he could feel the sudden blaze of heat from her eyes i hope you fall hard one day slade jessica retorted and i hope she thumbs her nose at you he poured himself a scotch not a chance he said lightly want a drink ill have some of that she walked over and snatched the glass from his hand then took a long sip dutch courage he asked when she swallowed controlling a grimace she gave him a narrow look while the liquor burned her throat youre being purposely horrid yeah dont you feel better with a helpless laugh she shoved the glass back in his hand youre a hard man slade youre a beautiful woman jessica the quiet words threw her completely off balance shed heard them dozens of times from dozens of people but they hadnt made the blood hum under her skin but then compliments wouldnt roll easily off the tongue of a man like slade she thought and somehow she felt he wasnt only speaking of physical beauty no he was a man whod look beyond what could be seen and into what could only be felt their eyes held a moment too long for comfort it occurred to her that she was closer to losing something vital to him now than she had been on the beach that morning you must be a very good writer she murmured as she stepped away to pour a glass of vermouth why youre very frugal with words and your timing with them is uncanny because her back was to him she allowed herself to moisten her lips nervously the clock on the mantel gave the melodious chime that signaled the hour i dont suppose youd like to write me a speech before michael gets here ill pass thanks slade hesitating only briefly jessica turned to him i shouldnt have told you everything i did out on the beach this morning it really isnt fair to michael for you to know and it isnt fair to you that i dropped my lifes history on you that way youre an easy person to confide in because you listen a bit too well part of my job he muttered and thought of the endless stream of interviews with suspects witnesses victims im trying to thank you jessica said shortly cant you take it graciously dont be grateful until ive done something he tossed back id choke before id thank you again she dumped a splat of vermouth in her glass as the doorbell rang neither man was pleased to be sharing a meal with the other but they made the best of it the general conversation eased slowly toward talk of the shop im glad you went by for a few hours michael jessica poked at the shrimp dijon rather than eating it i dont think davids really up to a full days work yet he seemed well enough and mondays are usually slow in any case he swirled his wine giving his dinner little more attention than jessica you worry too much darling you werent here last week she shredded a roll into tiny pieces saying nothing slade passed her the butter glancing down jessica saw the mess shed made and picked up her wine he was well enough today to sell the connecticut chest to mrs donnigan michael commented after noting the exchange david made a sale to mrs donnigan initial surprise turned to humor youd have to know the lady slade shes a diedinthewool yankee who can stretch a dollar like a piece of elastic michael sells to her on a rare occasion i do but david trailing off she smiled how did he manage it by being very reluctant to part with it when i came in he was nudging her toward the pecan hope chest telling her hed all but promised the other to another customer she gave a quick spurt of laughter well it looks like our boys learning im going to have to give in and let him go to europe with you next time briefly michael frowned down at his plate then very deliberately stabbed a shrimp if thats what you want her distress was immediate before jessica could fumble for a new line of conversation slade intervened by asking what a connecticut chest was she threw him a swift glance of appreciation and let michael take over why did i say that she demanded of herself how could i be insensitive enough to forget that hed asked me to go to europe with him the next time on an inward sigh jessica toyed with her dinner im not going to handle this well she thought im simply not going to handle it well at all how different they are it occurred to her all at once as she watched the two men talk casually michael with his smooth gestures was well groomed in voice and manner sleekly dressed jessica reflected that shed never seen him in anything more casual than a polo shirt and golf pants he was all civilized charm and sophisticated sexuality slade rarely gestured at all it was as if he knew that body language could give his thoughts away no he had a strange capacity for stillness and she wouldnt term him rugged though he favored jeans and sweaters not charming but disarming she decided and his sexuality was anything but sophisticated animal slade asked questions on antiques when he couldnt have cared less this would give jessica a few moments to regain the composure she had so nearly lost it might also give him the opportunity to form a more concrete opinion of michael he seemed harmless enough slade reflected a pretty boy with enough brains to make it his profession or enough brains to be one of the rungs on the smuggling ladder not the top one slade thought instinctively not enough guts he was the type of man slade might have matched jessica with polished intelligent and he was good looking enough if you liked that type apparently jessica didnt they hadnt been lovers slade pondered this as he listened to michael what sort of man he wondered could be around that woman day after day and not make love to her or go mad michael had managed to keep himself in check for nearly three years slade calculated that he hadnt been able to do so for as many days michael adams was either madly in love with her or more clever than he looked catching the way michaels eyes would drift to her occasionally slade felt a stir of sympathy madly in love or not he wasnt indifferent michael took another sip of wine and tried to continue a conversation he was beginning to detest he knew jessica oh yes he thought fatalistically he knew jessica hed seen her answer in her eyes the one woman who mattered to him was never going to be his all three of them were relieved when betsy brought in the coffee tray miss jessica if you dont start eating more than that cooks going to quit again if she didnt quit once a month shed throw the entire household off schedule jessica said lightly food was something she could do without until after she had settled things with michael ill just take a cup to the library slade was up and pouring his own before betsy could object ive got some things to finish up tonight fine jessica took care not to look at him lets have ours in the parlor michael no no betsy ill carry it she continued as the housekeeper started to mutter slade disappeared before she could lift the tray help yourself to the brandy she told michael as they entered the parlor ill just have the coffee he poured a generous amount placing the crystal stopper back in the decanter before turning betsy had lit the fire while they were eating it crackled with a cheer neither jessica nor michael were feeling remaining across the room he watched her pour coffee from the china pot into china cups the set had a delicate pattern of violets on an ivory background michael counted each petal before he spoke jessica her fingers tightened on the handle of the creamer and he swore silently strange that hed never wanted her more than at the moment he was sure hed never have her hed been too confident that when the time was right everything would simply fall into place i didnt mean to make you unhappy her eyes lifted to meet his michael no you dont have to say anything its written all over your face the one thing youve never been able to do well is hide your feelings he took a long swallow of brandy youre not going to marry me say it quick she ordered herself no i cant rising she walked over to stand with him i wish i felt differently michael i wish id known what your feelings were sooner he looked into his brandy the same color as her eyes and just as intoxicating he set the snifter down would it have made any difference if id asked you a year ago two years ago i dont know helplessly she lifted her shoulders but as were basically the same people we were then i dont think so she touched his arm wishing she had better words kinder words i care michael you must know that i do but i cant give you what you want lifting a hand he circled the back of her neck i cant tell you i wont try to change your mind michael no im not going to pressure you now he gave her neck a gentle squeeze but i have the advantage of knowing you well what you like what you dont like taking her hand he pressed a kiss in her palm i also love you enough not to hound you with a smile he released her hand ill see you at the shop tomorrow yes all right jessica pressed her hands together shed felt nothing but regret when hed pressed his lips to her palm good night michael when the front door closed behind him she stood where she was she had no taste for coffee now nor the energy to carry the tray to the kitchen and deal with betsy or the cook leaving things as they were jessica headed for the stairs jess slade stopped her with a word he came down the hall as she paused on the second step okay all of a sudden she wanted badly to cry to turn run into his arms and weep instead she snapped at him no its not okay why the hell should it be you did what you had to do he said calmly hes not going to drive off a cliff what do you know about it she tossed back you havent got any feelings you dont know what its like to care for someone you have to have a heart to be hurt whirling she dashed up the stairs making it almost halfway before she stopped shutting her eyes tight jessica slammed a fist onto the railing after a deep breath she turned and walked back down he stood at the bottom waiting im sorry why because her words had cut deeper than he liked he shrugged you were on target no i wasnt wearily she rubbed a hand over her forehead and i havent any right to use you for a punching bag you gave me a lot of support today and im grateful save it he advised as he turned away this time it was her turn to stop him slade he took two more steps swore then turned back to her his eyes were dark smolderingly angry as if her apology had flamed his temper more than her insults i realize you might think differently but you dont go to hell for being kind with that she left him staring after her as she continued up the stairs chapter contents prev next two am jessica heard the old seth thomas clock in the hall strike two musical bongs her body was exhausted but her mind refused to settle slades spurts of stopandgo typing had silenced over an hour before he could sleep she thought in disgust as she rolled to her back to stare again at the ceiling but then he wasnt in an emotional whirl thoughts of michael drifted to her and she sighed no lets be honest jessica she ordered herself it isnt michael whos keeping you awake its the man two doors down on the left alone in the dark in the tangle of soft linen sheets jessica could feel the scrape of sand against her back the heat of the sun and bite of the wind on her face the press of his body against hers desire churned in her tired body awakening pulses she struggled to calm she felt the ache move slowly from her stomach to her breasts quickly she sprang out of bed and tugged on a robe all she needed was a hot drink to settle her she decided almost frantically if that didnt work shed switch on the television until some old movie lulled her to sleep in the morning shed have herself in order again shed go back to work stay out of slades way until he finished the library and went back to where he came from jessica slipped out of the room and moved on silent bare feet down the hall she paused in front of slades door even reached for the handle before she caught herself good god what was she thinking of moving quickly she headed for the stairs maybe a brandy would be a better idea than the hot drink she decided out of habit she went quietly down the steps avoiding the spots that creaked and groaned brandy and an old movie she told herself if that didnt put her to sleep nothing would seeing that the parlor doors were closed she frowned now who would have done that she wondered they were never closed with a shrug she decided slade had shut them before coming up to write she crossed the hall and pulled one open a light blinded her it shone straight in her eyes forcing her to throw up a hand to shield them shock came first she stepped back stunned by the glare confused by its source before she could speak jessica froze a flashlight no one should be in the closed parlor with a flashlight in the middle of the night fear ran coolly over her skin then lodged like a fist in her throat without a seconds thought she turned and raced back up the stairs slade snapped fully awake the moment his door was flung open a shadow darted toward his bed and instinctively he grabbed it twisted it and pinned it underneath him it gave a quiet whoosh of air as it slammed onto the mattress at the moment of contact he knew he held jessica what the hell are you doing he demanded as his fingers clamped over her wrists her scent flooded his senses instant desire roughened his voice with the wind knocked out of her jessica struggled to speak fear had her body shuddering under his downstairs she managed someones downstairs he tensed but schooled his voice to casualness a servant at two oclock in the morning she hissed as anger began to take over it suddenly seeped into her that he was naked and that her robe had parted when he had yanked her into bed swallowing she struggled beneath him with a flashlight he rolled from her quickly where the parlor snatching her robe together jessica tried to pretend that she hadnt been weakened not for a minute by desire she watched his shadow as he tugged on jeans youre not going down there isnt that what you expected me to do when you came in here he countered he opened a drawer and found his gun no i didnt think at all the police reaching over she switched on the light we have to call the sentence died as she saw what he held in his hand a new bubble of terror rose in her throat where did you get that stay here he was nearly at the door before jessica could propel her numb body from the bed no you cant go down there with a gun slade how he stopped her with a hard bruising grip on her shoulder when they fixed on her his eyes were ice cold and expressionless stay put he ordered then closed the door firmly in her face too shocked to do otherwise jessica stared at the blank wood what in gods name was going on she demanded as she pressed her hands to her cheeks it was crazy someone sneaking around the parlor in the middle of the night slade handling a big ugly gun as if hed been born with it in his hand nerves jumping she began to pace the room it was too quiet she thought as her fingers laced and unlaced just too quiet she couldnt just stand there slade had just finished a quick thorough tour of the first floor when the creak on the steps had him whirling he saw jessica stagger back against the wall eyes wide as he turned the gun on her goddammit the word exploded at her as he lowered the gun i told you to stay upstairs she had enough time to register that shed seen the stance hed taken with the gun on a hundred television police shows then the trembling started i couldnt is he gone looks that way seizing her hand slade dragged her into the parlor stay in here im going to check outside jessica sank into a chair and waited it was dark the thin shifting moonlight tossed wavering shadows around the room defensively she curled her feet under her and cupped her elbows with her hands fear she realized was something shed rarely dealt with she wasnt doing a good job of it now shutting her eyes a moment jessica forced herself to take deep even breaths as the shuddering calmed her thoughts began to focus what was a writer doing with a revolver why hadnt he called the police a suspicion rose out of nowhere and she shook it off no that was ridiculous wasnt it when slade returned to the parlor ten minutes later she hadnt moved from the chair with a flick of the wrist he hit the switch flooding the room with light nothing he said shortly though she hadnt spoken theres no sign of anyone or any sign of a breakin i saw someone she began indignantly i didnt say you didnt then he was gone again leaving her next retort sputtering on her lips he came back without the gun what did you see as he asked he began a more careful search of the room brows drawn together she watched his practiced movements the parlor doors were closed when i opened them a light hit my eyes a flashlight i didnt see anything anything out of place in here she continued to watch his deft professional search as he roamed around the room no the suspicion wasnt ridiculous she realized as her stomach tightened it was all too pat hes done this before hes used that gun before who are you he heard the chill in her voice as he crouched in front of the liquor cabinet none of the crystal had been disturbed he didnt turn you know who i am jess youre not a writer yes i am what is it she asked flatly sergeant lieutenant he took the brandy decanter and poured liquor into a snifter his brain was perfectly cool he walked to her and held out the glass sergeant drink this her eyes stayed level on his go to hell with a shrug slade set the snifter beside her a deadly calm washed over her dulling the sting of betrayal i want you out of my house but before you leave jessica said quietly i want you to tell me why you came uncle charlie did send you didnt he orders from the commissioner the last sentence was full of carefully calculated disgust slade said nothing debating just how much hed have to tell her to satisfy her she was pale but not with fear now she was spitting mad fine keeping her eyes on his she rose then ill call your commissioner myself you can pack your typewriter and your gun sergeant she was going to have to have it all he decided and wished fleetingly for a cigarette sit down jess when she made no move to obey he gave her a helpful shove back into the chair just shut up and listen he suggested as she opened her mouth to yell at him your shops suspected in connection with a major smuggling operation its believed that stolen goods are hidden in some of your imports then transferred to a contact on this side probably through the sale of the whole article she wasnt attempting to speak now but simply staring at him as if hed lost his mind interpol wants the head man rather than the few underlings already under observation hes managed to slip away from them before they dont want it to happen again you your shop the people who work for you are under observation until hes in custody or the investigation leads elsewhere in the meantime the commissioner wants you safe i dont believe a word of it but her voice shook slade thrust his hands in his pockets my information as well as my orders come from the commissioner its ridiculous her voice was stronger now touched with scorn do you think something like that could go on in my shop without my knowing about it even as she reached for the brandy she caught the look in his eyes jessicas hand froze on the glass then dropped away i see she said quietly the pain was dull in her stomach briefly she pressed a hand to it before linking her fingers together did you bring your handcuffs along sergeant cut it out jess because he couldnt handle the way she looked at him slade turned to prowl the room i said the commissioner wanted you protected was it part of your job to attract me enough so that i might be indiscreet when he whirled back she sprang to her feet to meet his fury with her own is making love to me all in a days work i havent begun to make love to you infuriated he grabbed the lapels of her robe nearly hauling her off her feet and i wouldnt have taken the damn assignment if id known you were going to tie me up in knots every time i looked at you the bureau thinks youre clean dont you understand that only puts you in a more dangerous position how can i understand anything when im not told anything she tossed back what kind of danger could i possibly be in this isnt a game jess frustrated he shook her an agent was killed in london last week he was close too close to finding out whos pulling the strings his last report mentioned a quarter of a million dollars worth of diamonds what does that have to do with me jessica jerked away from him if they think therere diamonds stashed away in one of my imports let them come in they can take the furniture apart piece by piece and tip off the number one man slade returned how do you know im not in charge a raging headache was added to the sickness in her stomach wearily jessica rubbed at her temple i run the shop he watched her slender fingers knead at the ache not alone all movement stopped very slowly jessica lowered her hand david and michael she whispered incredulity gave way to anger no i wont have you accusing them no ones accusing anyone yet no youre here to spy on us i dont like it any better than you then why are you here the deliberate scorn in her tone made him want to strangle her he spoke slowly brutally because the commissioner didnt want his goddaughter to end up with her beautiful throat slit her color drained at that but she kept her eyes level who would hurt me david michael even you must see how absurd that is youd be surprised what people do to survive he said tersely in any case there are other people involved the kind who wouldnt think of you as any more than an expendable obstacle she didnt want to think about that couldnt if she wanted to stop herself from having a bout of hysteria be practical she ordered herself be logical this time she lifted the brandy and drank deeply before speaking if youre with the nypd you have no jurisdiction here the commissioner has a lot of clout the hint of color that seeped back into her cheeks relieved him she was tougher than she looked in any case im not here about the smuggling not officially why are you here officially to keep you out of trouble uncle charlie should have told me slade lifted his shoulders in a half shrug as he looked around the room yeah maybe theres no way of telling if he was after something in here or slipping through this room to another not with the way this house is set up with a frown he ran a hand absently over his bare chest do you see anything out of place in here jessica followed the sweep of his eyes no i dont think he could have been around very long you didnt stop typing until one wouldnt it make sense for him to wait until all the lights were out before he broke in he started to remind her that no one had broken in then changed his mind if it helped her to believe it had been a stranger she might sleep better he thought of david who had a room on the east wing of the first floor ive got to call in my report go on to bed no unwilling to admit that she couldnt bring herself to go upstairs alone jessica lifted the brandy again ill wait she sat as he went out to the phone in the hall purposely she tuned out his conversation though it was carried on in such quiet tones that she would have had to strain to hear her shop she thought how was it possible for her shop to be tangled up in something as fantastic as international smuggling if it hadnt been so frightening she would have laughed michael and david with a brisk shake of her head she shut her eyes no that part she wouldnt believe there was a mistake somewhere and in time the police or the fbi or whoever was haunting her would realize it a burglar had been in the parlor it was as simple as that hadnt betsy grumbled a dozen times about her not using the alarm system the image of slade with the gun in his hand came back to her too clearly that was something she couldnt shut out when he came back into the room jessica was sitting very still eyes closed there were shadows under them what hed just learned on the phone wasnt going to make them go away but perhaps a good nights sleep would come on he said briskly trying not to soften as her eyes shot open in alarm at his voice youre tired go up and take a pill if you cant sleep and youre not going in to the shop tomorrow but i have to she began you have to do as youre told from here on he corrected youll be safer here where i can keep an eye on you starting now you dont leave the house without me dont argue taking her hand he hauled her to her feet you havent got any choice at this point you have to trust me she did jessica realized as he pulled her up the steps that if everything else was a maze of confusion that was clear that very quick first impression shed gotten when shed all but run into him at the bottom of the staircase had been viable with him she was safe i dont like knowing youre a cop she murmured yeah im not always crazy about it myself go to bed jess he dropped her arm as they came to her door before he could move on jessica grabbed his hand slade she hated what she was going to ask hated admitting to herself much less him that she was terrified of being alone i she looked away from the impatience in his eyes and glanced into her darkened room could you stay i told you ive got my orders from the commissioner no i dont mean she moistened her lips i mean with me tonight she looked up at him pale soft vulnerable he felt the blood start to pound in his chest in defense his voice was blunt and cold when i go to bed with a woman i tend to give her my complete attention i havent got time for that now she felt a flutter that was both panic and excitement im not asking you to make love with me just not to leave me alone he allowed his eyes to rake down her warm flesh soft curves and iceblue silk do you think id spend the night with you and not have you no the answer came quick and quiet the flutter became a throb in a quick move calculated to frighten her slade backed her up against the door you havent the experience to deal with me lady not quite gently his hand closed over her throat beneath his palm he felt the wild scramble of her pulse but her eyes her eyes were tawny and unafraid he wanted her with a desperation that threatened to drive everything else aside im not one of your polite country club men jess he told her in a dangerously quiet voice you dont know the places ive been the things ive done i could show you tricks that would make your french lover look like a boy scout if i decided i wanted you you couldnt run fast enough she could barely hear him over the dull thud of her heart her eyes had misted over with desire which of us is running slade her arms were already heavy but she lifted them in one long slow stroke she ran her hands up his naked back he stiffened the fingers on her throat tightened swiftly she pressed her body to his damn you jess on a groan his mouth came down to savage hers her senses whirled from the onslaught but she clung this was what she wanted the mindless passion he could bring her on the instant of contact the kiss wasnt loverlike it wasnt the worshipful merging of lips the gentle teasing of tongues it was madness jessica abdicated her sanity without a second thought let him teach her what he would he ripped the robe from her where they stood then gave into the driving need to let his hands mold every inch of her softer inconceivably softer than he imagined her skin seemed to flow under his fingers within seconds he had her trembling one wracking convulsive shudder after another her thighs were slim and strong running a hand up them he found her then took her gasping to a staggering peak until she swayed helplessly in his arms slade swore again knowing he couldnt stop he had told himself he would treat her callously and then walk away to save her to save himself now she was moist and warm and pliant in his arms her fragrance clung to the air seducing him he shook his head struggling to clear it but she pressed her lips to his throat huskily murmuring his name he was with her in bed not even aware if he had dragged or carried her there jessica twisted under him answering his kiss deliriously as his hands moved everywhere he gave her no chance to orient herself there was a tangle of sheets under her the soft fabric of his jeans against her legs but she was only aware of the hurricane thats where he took her all speeding wind and black sky his ragged breathing shivered into her ear before his tongue darted inside in a zigzagging journey that had her mind spinning he ran openmouthed nibbling kisses down her throat to the hollow between her breasts she arched her nipples hard with need but he continued down and ran his tongue along the line of her ribs half mad she dug her fingers into his hair wanting him to take her before she exploded wanting the agonizing pleasure to go on forever greedily he came back to her breast the moist trail his tongue left causing her to shudder with fire and ice by turns his teeth nipped into the soft swell of flesh while with a fingertip he began a slow torturous path around the other lips and finger circled in until she was writhing beneath him he drew her nipple into his mouth catching the other arching point between his thumb and finger jessica cried out as the dual pleasure exploded then was lost in wave after wave of sensation as his teasing became rampant hunger she was tugging at his jeans but he shifted away from her seeking hands without the restriction he knew hed take her instantly he was far from ready hed sensed her passion knew it lay smoldering but now it was engulfing him in a heat he hadnt foreseen she was wildly responsive like a thoroughbred mare given her head he wanted to drive her drive them both to the breaking point the musky woodsy scent seemed to emanate from her skin wherever he buried his lips her body was slender almost too slender but with a seductive womanly softness that made him want to go on touching and tasting until there was no inch of her he didnt know when his mouth brushed low over her stomach she moaned nails digging into his shoulders as she urged him down he could hear his name trembling out of her lips between raw gasping breaths but when his tongue sought and found the center of her pleasure he lost everything else he drove her to peak after peak exhausted jessica hungered for more her skin was fused to his both hot and damp with desire her body was stunningly alive throbbing from thousands of minute pulses he had discovered and exploited even his name wouldnt form on her lips any longer together they struggled with the last barrier of clothing that kept them apart she found his hips lean and longboned his thighs firm and muscled they came together savagely each gasping from the shock of power she couldnt stop the shudders they continued to race through her long after slade lay beside her silent her body ached and glowed did we make love or war jessica wondered dizzily whatever had happened between them had never happened to her before and she knew with a certainty that it would never happen with any other man none of her inhibitions had surfaced he wouldnt have allowed them to was there another man with his strength his intensity his savagery not for her jessica realized instinctively rolling to him there had never been nor would there ever be anyone else for her shed lost that vital part of herself to him long before they had ever gone to bed her heart oh i love you she thought whoever whatever you are and the surest way to turn you away from me now is to tell you closing her eyes jessica rested her head on his shoulder youre already wondering how you lost control enough to take me to bed she concluded with instinctive accuracy already wondering how to prevent this from happening again but im not going to lose you the vow formed firmly as she ran a hand over his chest youre not getting away slade struggle all you want lightly she ran a trail of kisses over his shoulder to his throat jess slade put up a hand to stop her hed never be able to think clearly with her touching him if he was going to find his way out of the quicksand he was rapidly sinking in he had to think jessica merely kissed the fingers that got in her way then trailed her lips to his cheek hold me she murmured i want your arms around me with an effort slade resisted the husky demand and the soft lips that insisted on clouding his brain jessica this isnt smart weve got i dont want to be smart slade she interrupted she shifted so that her head was just above his her lips just above his dont talk not tonight when her fingers ran down his side she had the satisfaction of feeling his quick involuntary tremor i want you her tongue traced his lips she felt the sudden thunder of his heart against her breast you want me thats all there is tonight in the darkness he could see the pale clouds of hair the moonlit skin shadowed by the slash of cheekbone he saw the amber fire of her eyes before her mouth took his and captured him chapter contents prev next slade woke beside her she was deep in an exhausted sleep her breathing slow and regular there were shadows under the sweep of lashes dark smudges against pale skin his arm was around her slim waist in sleep hed betrayed himself by wanting her close they shared the same pillow he spent several minutes cursing himself before he rolled out of bed jessica didnt even stir he grabbed up his jeans and went to his own room and straight to the shower deliberately slade turned the cold on full hadnt he saturated himself enough with her last night he asked himself furiously as the icy spray hit his body like sharp pinpricks did he have to wake up wanting her need for her this kind of consuming need was going to interfere with his job slade had to remind himself again and again that jessica was a job only a job and in the brief phone conversation the night before he had been told enough to make him realize that her position had become only more delicate someone wanted something in her house someone she trusted knowing who it was wouldnt be enough slade had to find out what it was or rather the feds had to find out what he corrected grimly he had to stick to her like glue until it was all over why the hell dont they let me get her out of here he thought on a fresh burst of fury the order over the phone had been firm and unarguable jessica stayed the investigation couldnt be jeopardized by letting her walk she stayed slade repeated silently and he wasnt to let her out of his sight for the next fortyeight hours that didnt include sleeping with her he reminded himself as he let the cold water sluice over his head it didnt include getting so caught up in her that he forgot what he was doing there in the first place and how the hell was he supposed to live in the same house with her now and not touch her he grabbed the soap and lathered himself roughly maybe it would wash away the woodsy scent that seemed to have crept into his own skin waking jessica reached for him he was gone and so instantly was her peace the few hours of sleep had left her tightly strung instead of relaxed if he had been there if she could have turned to him on wakening she wouldnt have felt the sick sense of loss david and michael no she couldnt even allow herself to think it covering her face with her hands jessica struggled to block it out but then she could see the icy look in slades eyes when he had aimed the gun on her its madness its a mistake a quarter of a million in diamonds interpol david and michael unable to bear it she sprang out of bed she needed to clear her brain to think the house felt like an airless prison she threw on her clothes and headed for the beach when he came by her room to check on her ten minutes later slade found the bed empty the quick panic was as uncharacteristic as it was unprofessional hurriedly he checked the bath and her sitting room before going downstairs he didnt find jessica in the dining room but betsy where is she he demanded betsy cleared off the place she had set for jessica then scowled at him so youre in a chipper mood too wheres jessica betsy sent him a shrewd look looks sick this morning wonder if she caught davids flu down at the beach she continued before he could snap at her alone yes alone didnt even take that overgrown mutt with her said shes not going into work today and betsy placed her hands on her hips and scowled at his retreating back well she muttered and clucked her tongue it was cold concealing his shoulder holster under his jacket was simple by the time slade had reached the beach steps hed nearly run out of curses hadnt anything hed said to her the night before gotten through he spotted her standing near the breakers and tore down the steps and across the sand jessica heard his approach and turned whatever she might have said slipped back down her throat as he grabbed her by the shoulders and shook her you idiot what are you doing down here alone dont you know the position youre in her hand swung out connecting sharply with his cheek the slap stunned both of them causing angry eyes to meet angry eyes in quick surprise his grip loosened enough for jessica to step back dont you shout at me she ordered automatically soothing the flesh his hands had bruised i dont have to take that from anyone youll take it from me he said evenly ill give you that one jess but remember i hit back what are you doing out here im taking a walk she snapped i arranged for david to take over the shop today as per your orders sergeant so were back to that he reflected and dug his hands into his pockets his hair whipped unheeded around his face fine my next order is that youre not to leave the house until i say so the fire in her eyes was suddenly misted with tears hugging herself she spun away from him shed show him anger shed show him passion but she refused to show him weakness house arrest she said thickly hed rather have had her slap him again than cry protective custody he countered with a sigh he placed his hands on her shoulders jess swiftly she shook her head knowing that kind words would undermine her completely when she felt his brow drop to the top of her head she squeezed her eyes tight dont fall apart now he murmured it wont be for very long when its over when its over what she interrupted in swift despair will one of the people closest to me be in jail am i supposed to look forward to that on a long breath she opened her eyes and looked out to sea the water was choppy whitecapped and gray a storm was coming in she thought dispassionately the sky was beginning to boil with it youre supposed to get through today he told her tightening his grip then youre supposed to get through tomorrow life she mused is that really how lifes supposed to be is that how he felt about his why did you leave me alone this morning his hands dropped away from her shoulders without turning jessica knew hed stepped back gathering her courage she faced him all the guards were back if her body had not still ached from the fury of lovemaking she might have thought shed imagined all of the night before the man staring at her showed no hint of emotion youre going to tell me it was a mistake she managed after a moment something that shouldnt have happened and wont happen again her chin came up as love warred with pride please dont bother he should have let her go he intended to let her go before he could stop himself slade took her arm carefully wrapping his fingers around it as if measuring its size and strength im going to tell you it was a mistake he said slowly something that shouldnt have happened but i cant tell you it wont happen again i cant be near you and not want you the man shifted his position in the cover of trees with businesslike movements he opened the briefcase and began to fit the pieces of the rifle together for the moment he paid little attention to the two figures down on the beach one thing at a time that was one of the reasons for his success in his field hed only had the contract for four hours and was relatively pleased that it would take him little more than that to complete it after snapping on the sight he pulled out a handkerchief the brisk wind wasnt doing his head cold any good but then ten thousand dollars bought a lot of antihistamines after sneezing softly he replaced his handkerchief then drew a bead on the figures on the beach jessica felt some of her strength returning why was it a mistake then slade let out an impatient breath because im a cop from the lower east side whos seen things i could never tell you about because i want you so much not just now this minute but tomorrow twenty years from now and that scares me oil and water jess its as simple as that you wanted to walk well walk slipping his hand from her arm he interlaced his fingers with hers then turned away from the shore he lowered his rifle as slade blocked his clear shot of jessica the contract was for the woman only and business was business the wind fluttered at his drabcolored overcoat and snuck underneath it sniffling he brought his handkerchief out again then settled down to wait jessica kicked a pebble into a clump of rocks you are a writer arent you so i tell myself then why do you do this you dont like it it shows it wasnt supposed to show the fact that she could see what hed successfully concealed from everyone including himself from time to time infuriated slade look i do what i have to what i know not everybody has a choice no she disagreed everyone has a choice ive got a mother waiting tables and living off a dead cops pension the words exploded from him stopping her ive got a sister in her third year of college whos got a chance to be something you dont pay tuition with rejection slips jessica lifted both hands to his face her palms were cool and soft then you made your choice slade not every man would have made the same one when the time comes and you publish youll have everything jess he took her wrists but held them a moment instead of pulling her hands from his face her pulse speeded instantly at his touch drawing an unwilling response from him you get to me he muttered and you dont like it she leaned toward him lashes lowering he crushed her to him devouring the willing mouth it was as cool as her hands but heated quickly beneath his already frantic he grabbed her hair drawing her head back farther so he could plunder all the sweet moist recesses her arms went around his neck imprisoning him in the softness the fragrance the need the back of his head was caught in the crosshairs of the scope of a highpowered rifle with a sophisticated silencer jess his lips moved against hers with the sound of her name he broke away only to catch her close to his chest holding her there while he tried to steady himself youre tired he said when he heard her sigh well go in you should get some more sleep she allowed him to shift her to his side patience she told herself this isnt a man who gives himself easily im not tired she lied matching her steps to his why dont i give you a hand in the library thats all i need he muttered casting his eyes up in his peripheral vision he caught a quick flutter of white among the thinning leaves in the grove he tensed muscles tightening as he strained to see there was nothing more than a rustling easily caused by the wind then the flutter of white again im terrific at organizing if i put my mind to it jessica claimed as she stepped in front of him and i the breath was knocked out of her as slade shoved her to the ground in back of a small outcropping of rock she heard a quick ping as if stone had struck stone before she could fill her lungs with air hed drawn out his gun what is it whats wrong dont move he didnt even look at her but kept her pinned beneath him as his eyes swept the beach jessicas eyes were locked on his gun slade hes in the grove about ten feet to the right of where we are now he calculated thinking out loud its a good position he wont move at least for a while who she demanded what are you talking about he brought his eyes to hers briefly chilling her with the hard cold look shed seen before the man who just took a shot at you she went as still and stiff as a statue no one did i didnt hear hes got it silenced slade shifted just enough to get a clearer view of the beach steps hes a pro hell wait us out jessica remembered the odd sound shed heard just as slade had shoved her to the ground stone hitting stone bullet hitting rock a wave of dizziness swept over her clouding her vision until she saw nothing but a gray mist from a distance she heard slades voice and struggled against the faintness heart pounding in her ears she focused on him again he was still looking beyond her to the beach steps that we know hes there what impatiently slade looked down at her there wasnt a trace of color in her face against the pallor her eyes were dull and unfocused he couldnt allow her the luxury of going into shock snap out of it and listen to me he said harshly catching her face in his hand odds are he doesnt know weve made him he probably thinks were back here making love if my cover was blown hed have taken care of me instead of waiting to get a clear shot at you now youve only got to do one thing jess understand one thing she repeated with a nod stay put she nearly gave way to a hysterical giggle that sounds like a good idea how long do you think well have to stay here you stay until i get back her arms came around him quickly and with desperate strength youre not going out there hell kill you its you he wants slade said flatly as he pried her arms away from his neck i want you to do exactly as i say he wriggled on top of her and managed to shrug out of his jacket then the shoulder holster after tugging his shirt out of his jeans he tucked the gun in the back waistband im going to stand up and after a minute ill walk over to the steps hell either think you wouldnt play games or that were finished and youre staying out for a while she didnt hold on to him because she knew it was useless he was going to do it his own way what if he shoots you she asked dully a hell of a bodyguard youd make dead if hes going to hell do it the minute i stand up slade told her cupping her face again then youll still have the gun wont you he kissed her hard and quick before she could speak stay put jess ill be back he rose nonchalantly still looking down at her jessica counted ten long silent seconds everything in her system seemed to be on slow motion her brain her heart her lungs if she breathed at all she was unaware of it she lay in a vacuum of fear slade grinned at her a flash of reassurance that didnt reach his eyes numbly she wondered if the smile was for her benefit or for the man in the grove no matter what you stay where you are with this he turned away from her and strolled easily to the beach steps he hooked his thumbs lazily in his pockets as if every muscle in his body wasnt tensed waiting a thin stream of sweat rolled down his back a hell of a bodyguard youd make dead jessicas words played back to him as he forced himself to take the steps slowly he knew how close that one silent bullet had come he was taking a chance coming out in the open not only with himself but with jessica calculated risk slade reminded himself sometimes you played the odds he counted the steps off five six seven it wasnt likely the gunman had the rifle trained on him now hed be waiting for jessica to make a move from behind the clump of rocks ten eleven twelve did she listen this time he thought with a quick flash of panic dont look back for gods sake dont look back there was only one way left to keep her safe the moment he reached the top slade drew out his gun and dashed for the trees the carpet of dried leaves would betray him slade counted it a mixed blessing it would distract the mans mind from jessica he took a zigzagging pattern toward the place where he had spotted the flutter of white just as he dashed behind an oak he heard the dull thud dispassionately he saw splinters of bark fly out inches from his shoulder close he thought very close but his brain was cool now the man would know hed botched the contract just as hed know if slades luck ran out that the police were involved slades gun and his shield would tell the pro all he needed to know patiently slade waited five eternal minutes became ten the sweat was drying cold on his back neither man could move soundlessly so neither moved at all one laying siege to the other a bird frightened off by slades mad rush into the grove came back to settle on a limb and sing joyfully a squirrel hunted acorns not ten feet away from where he stood slade didnt think at all but waited the stormbrewing clouds closed in completely blocking out the sun now the grove was cold and gloomy wind whipped through his loose shirt there was a muffled sneeze and a rustle of leaves instantly slade sprang out toward the sound hitting the ground and rolling when he caught a quick glimpse of the man and the rifle prone he fired three times jessica lay numbed by a fear icier than the wind off the sound that was all she could hear the wind and the water once she had loved the sound of it the howling wind the passionate crash of water against rock staring up at the sky she watched the clouds boil with one hand she clutched slades discarded jacket the leather was smooth and cold but she could just smell him she concentrated on that if she could smell him he was alive if she willed it hard enough for long enough hed stay alive too long her mind shouted its been too long her fingers tightened on the leather hed said hed be back she was going to believe that with her fingertips she touched her lips and found them cold the warmth hed left there had long since faded i should have told him i love him she thought desperately i should have told him before he left what if no she wouldnt let herself think it he was coming back painfully she shifted enough so that she could watch the beach steps she heard the three rapid shots and froze the pain in her chest snapped her out of it her lungs were screaming for air dimly jessica ordered herself to breathe before she scrambled up and ran fear made her clumsy twice she stumbled on her way up the steps only to haul herself up and force more speed into her legs she broke into the grove skidding on cracked leaves and branches slade sprang around the moment he heard her he was quick but not quick enough to prevent her from seeing what hed been determined she wouldnt see jessica stopped her headlong rush into his arms relief turning to shock and shock to trembling cursing he stepped in front of her blocking her view dont you ever listen he demanded then pulled her into his arms is he did you unable to finish she shut her eyes she wouldnt be sick she ordered herself she wouldnt faint one of his shirt buttons ground into her cheek and she concentrated on the pain youre not hurt no he said shortly this aspect of his life should never have touched her he berated himself he should have seen to it why didnt you stay on the beach i heard the shots i thought hed killed you then youd have done us both a lot of good rushing in here he pulled her away took one look at her face and yanked her back into his arms its all right now for the first time his tone was gentle loving it broke her down as his shouting and anger would never have done she began to weep in raw harsh sobs the fingers of one hand digging into his shirt the fingers of the other still holding his jacket without a word he led her to the edge of the grove he sat on the grass then drew her down into his lap and let her cry it out not knowing what else to do he rocked stroked and murmured im sorry she managed still weeping i cant stop get it all out jess his lips brushed her hot temple you dont have to be strong this time burying her face against his chest she let the tears come until she was empty even when she quieted he stroked the hair from her damp face rocking her with a gentle rhythm the need to protect had long since stopped being professional if he could have found the way slade would have blocked the morning from her mind taken her away somewhere someplace where no ugliness could touch her i couldnt stay on the beach when i heard the shots no he kissed her hair i suppose not i thought you were dead ssh he took her lips this time with a tenderness neither of them had known he possessed you should have more faith in the good guys she wanted to smile for him but threw her arms around his neck instead the contact was another reassurance that he was whole and safe oh slade im not sure i could live through something like that again why why would anyone want to kill me it just doesnt make sense he drew her away so that their eyes met hers were red and swollen from weeping his cool and direct maybe you know something and dont even realize it the pressures on and whoevers in charge of this business is smart enough to know it youve become a liability but i dont know anything she insisted pressing the heels of her hands to her temples someone wants to kill me and i dont even know who it is or why you said that that man was a professional someone paid him to kill me lets go inside he pulled her to her feet but she jerked away the helpless weeping was over and the strength was back though it had the dangerous edge of hysteria how much was i worth she demanded thats enough jess he took her by the shoulders for one quick shake enough youre going to go in and pack a bag ill take you to new york im not going anywhere the hell you arent he muttered as he started to pull her toward the house jessica yanked out of his grip for the second time you listen to me its my life my shop my friends im staying right here until its over ill do what you tell me to a point slade but i wont run he measured her slowly ive got to call this business in youre to go straight to your room and wait for me she nodded not trusting his easy acceptance all right he nodded not trusting hers the moment she stepped into her room jessica began to peel off her clothes it was suddenly of paramount importance that she scrub off every grain of sand every lingering trace of the time she had spent on the beach she turned the hot water in the tub on full until the room was misted with steam plunging in she gasped at the shock of the heat against her chilled skin but took the soap and lathered again and again until she could no longer smell the scent of salt water the scent of her own fear it had been a nightmare she told herself this was normalcy the cool green tile on the walls the leafy fern at the window the ivory towels with the pale green border she had chosen herself only the month before a month ago she thought when her life had been simple thered been no man then coolly attempting to kill her for a fee david had still been the brother shed never had michael had been her friend her partner she hadnt even heard of a man named james sladerman she closed her eyes and pressed hot damp fingers to them no it wasnt a nightmare it was real she had lain curled behind a pile of rocks while a man she barely knew and loved had risked his life to protect hers it was horribly horribly real and she had to face it the time was over when she could try to pass off what slade had told her as a mistake while she had been blindly trusting someone she loved had deceived her involved her used her which one she asked herself which one could she believe it of would either david or michael have stood passively by while someone arranged to have her killed lowering her hands jessica forced herself to be calm no whatever else she would believe she wouldnt believe that slade thought she might know something without being aware of it if that was true she was no closer to the solution than she had been before jessica slid her body down in the tub and closed her eyes again there was nothing for her to do but wait anything but satisfied with his conversation with his contact slade put a call through directly to the commissioner sergeant what have you got for me someone tried to kill jessica this morning he answered curtly for a moment there was dead silence on the wire give me the details dodson demanded briefly emotionlessly slade reported while his knuckles turned white on the receiver she wont leave voluntarily he finished i want her out today now i need you to officially give me the right to put her in protective custody i can have her in new york in less than two hours i take it youve already checked in with this your friends in the bureau want her to stay this time he didnt attempt to disguise the bitterness in his voice they dont want anything to interfere with the investigation at this delicate state he quoted jamming a cigarette between his lips as long as shes willing to cooperate they wont move her and jessicas willing to cooperate shes a stubborn thickheaded fool whos too busy thinking about adams and ryce and that precious shop of hers youve gotten to know her i see the commissioner commented does she trust you slade expelled a stream of smoke she trusts me keep her in the house slade in her room if you think its necessary the servants can think shes ill i want what you want isnt the issue dodson cut him off curtly or what i want he added more calmly if its gone far enough that a pro was hired shell be safer there with you than anyplace else weve got to nail this down fast with luck before its known that the contract on her is no longer operable shes nothing more than bait slade said bitterly just make sure she isnt swallowed dodson retorted youve got your orders yeah ive got them disgusted slade slammed down the receiver looking down at his hands he realized frustrated that they were as good as tied he was up against a solid wall of refusal from jessica right on down the investigation the justice of it didnt matter to him any longer she was all that mattered that in itself destroyed his objectivity and by doing so made her vulnerable he cared too much to think logically his hands curled into fists no cared wasnt the right word he admitted slowly he was in love with her when or how he didnt have the faintest idea maybe it had started that first day she had come tearing down the steps toward him and it was stupid he scraped his hands roughly over his face even without the mess they were in it was stupid theyd been born on opposite sides of the fence had lived their entire lives on opposite sides of the fence he didnt have any right to love her even less to want her to love him she needed him now professionally as well as emotionally that would change when it was over right now he couldnt afford to think of how he would deal with his feelings once jessica was safe again first he had to make certain she would be with slow deliberate force he crushed out his cigarette then went upstairs to her they came into the bedroom together jessica from the bath slade from the hall she was wrapped in one of the ivory towels with the pale green border her hair fell wet around her shoulders while the clean sharp scent of soap surrounded her her skin was flushed and glowing from the heat of her bath for a moment they stood still watching each other she could feel the frustration the anger in him as he turned to close the door behind him are you all right yes she sighed a little because it was nearly the truth im better dont be angry with me slade dont ask for the impossible all right needing something to do she went to the dresser and picked up her brush what do we do now we wait straining against impotence he jammed his fists in his pockets youre to stay in the house let the servants think youre ill or tired or just plain lazy youre not to answer the door or the phone or see anyone unless im with you she slammed the brush back down her eyes meeting his in the mirror i wont be jailed in my own home either that or a cell he improvised adding a shrug either way you want it you cant put me in a cell dont bet on it leaning back against the door he ordered his muscles to relax youre going to play this my way jess starting now her automatic rebellion was instantly quelled as she remembered those agonizing minutes on the beach she wasnt only risking her own life she realized but his as well youre right she murmured im sorry abruptly she whirled around i hate this i hate all of it i told betsy you didnt want to be disturbed he answered calmly shes got it into her head that youve caught a touch of davids flu well let her go on thinking it why dont you get some sleep dont go she said quickly as he reached for the doorknob ill just be down in the library you need to rest jess youre worn out i need you she corrected and walked to him make love to me slade as if we were just a man and a woman who wanted to be together lifting her arms she circled his neck cant we believe that its true for just a few hours lets give each other the rest of the morning he lifted the back of his hand to her cheek in a gesture they both found uncharacteristic slade wondered if she knew that his need was as great as hers to touch to lose himself in lovemaking so close he thought as he ran his knuckles over the line of her cheekbone hed come so close to losing her your eyes are shadowed his voice was rough with emotion you should rest but his lips were already lowering to seek hers the brush of mouth on mouth gentle caring comforting jessica melted against him overpowered by the tenderness shed drawn out of him his hand was still on her face gliding over her features as if to memorize them on a sigh her lips parted softening under his until he thought he would sink into them they had stood there only the night before locked in an embrace that had been turbulent with passion almost brutal with desire the soothing quality of his kiss was no less arousing the pulse at the base of her throat beat thickly as slades fingertip slid down to it she needed he needed thinking only of this he brought his hand to the loose knot of the towel to draw the material from her before he carried her to bed jessica saw his eyes dark and intense sweep over her as she began to unbutton his shirt then her fingers were trapped between their bodies his mouth fixed on hers again the night before hed made her soar now he made her float soft kisses soft words both unexpected rained over her his fingers combed through her damp hair spreading it out on the pillow lingering in its silk as if he would touch each individual strand her hands were free again and trembling they dealt with the last buttons on his shirt she felt a quiver race after her exploring hands heard his incoherent murmur as she worked the rest of his clothes from him flesh to heated flesh they began the journey rain began to patter against the windows hed never been a gentle lover intense yes passionate yes but never gentle she unlocked something in him something giving and tender no less desperately than the night before he wanted her but with the hunger came the sweet calming breath of love the peaceful emotion guided them both to meet the unspoken needs of the other touch me here let me taste look at me there was no need for words when hearts and minds were attuned he wandered over the body he already knew so well in the gray gloomy light he worshiped her with hands lips and eyes naked heavy eyed skin flushed with desire jessica lay quietly as he took his gaze over her with the slow intensity she recognized she was a willing prisoner in the thick humming world conceived by pleasure and sensation the rain grew loud the room dimmer lifting a hand to either side of his face she drew him back to her with her tongue she slowly traced the shape of his mouth then probed inside to drink up all the tastes of him flavors musky and sharp seeped into her deep into her until she hungered for more desire rose to the next plane not so gentle now nor so calmly they sought each other kisses became possessive caresses urgent under the sound of the rain she heard his breath shudder under the pressure of her hands she felt his muscles tighten the liquefying pleasure that had ruled her became a hot torrid need catapulting her beyond the gray insular room into a place of white light and golden fire searing searching seducing his mouth veered down her over her until her skin was molten with a strength only recently discovered she rolled on top of him to complete a crazed journey of her own they tangled and untangled in a wildly choreographed dance of passion the light wasnt white now but red the fire flamed blue she heard her name rip from his lips before they crushed down on hers whatever madness he spoke was muffled against her in his urgency desire spun into delirium as they came together there was speed and strength and desperation faster and faster they climbed while his mouth clung to hers swallowing her gasps mixing them with his own spent she lay beneath him his mouth was pressed to her throat his hands tangled in her hair the rain drummed against the windows now hurled by the wind his body was warm and damp and heavy on hers a feeling of security drifted over her followed by a weariness that reached her bones slade lifted his head to see her eyes glazed over with fatigue youll sleep now it wasnt a question he tempered the command with a kiss youll stay the words were thick as she fought off sleep long enough to hear his answer ill start the fire rising slade walked to the white brick hearth and added paper to the kindling the long match hissed as he struck it crouched he watched the flames lick then catch minutes passed but he remained staring steadily at the fire without seeing it he knew what was happening to him no what had happened to him slade corrected he was in love with a woman he should never have touched a woman he had no business loving a woman he reminded himself grimly whose life depended on him until she was out of danger he couldnt afford to think of his own feelings or of their consequences for her sake the cop had to come first the man second straightening he turned back to her the shock of the morning had taken its toll in exhaustion he noted she lay on her stomach one hand balled loosely on the pillow her hair fanned out dry now her face pale beneath its disorder her eyes were shadowed her breathing heavy the fire brought flickers of light into the room to play over her skin she was too small he thought too slender to deal with what had happened to deal with the threat of what could happen and how much good would he do her he asked himself as his eyes passed over her love clouded his judgment slowed his reflexes if hed been an instant slower that morning shaking his head slade began to dress it wouldnt happen again hed keep her in the house if he had to chain her hed see her through this keep her safe and then then hed get out of her life he promised himself and get her out of his he drew the sheet over her allowing his hand to linger on her hair briefly before he left the room chapter contents prev next late late in the morning while jessica slept slade stood at the library window that faced the garden watery sunlight struggled through the clouds to fall on the wet shrubs and grass rosebushes were naked and thorny fall flowers hung heavyheaded and dripping their petals scattered the storm had stripped the leaves away from the trees so that they lay soggy and dull on the ground the wind had died someone had let ulysses out the dog lumbered along on the wet ground sniffing here and there without any apparent interest finding a likely branch he clamped it between his teeth then trotted off toward the beach hell of a watchdog slade thought in disgust but then who could blame the dog for not barking at someone he knew someone hed seen in the house for years scrubbing his face with his hands slade turned away from the window the waiting was eating at him another sign that he was losing his objectivity by rights he should have taken this part of the assignment in his stride as long as jessica did what she was told there was virtually no way for anyone on the outside to get to her the man who had been in the parlor the night before was running scared and for that reason wouldnt test his luck during the day in a house full of active servants if everything went according to plan it was simply a matter of holding tight until the fbi made its move if slade thought tightly everything went according to plan plans had a way of veering off course when the human element was involved a glance at his watch told him that jessica had been asleep for half an hour with luck shed sleep through the day when she slept she was safe and every hour that she was safe brought them closer to the finish idly he picked up one of the books from a pile hed begun to organize shed have to get someone to take care of this mess he thought once her life was settled again once her life was settled he repeated silently and he was back in new york away from her with an oath he tossed the book aside was he ever going to get away from her he wondered with something uncomfortably close to fear oh he could put the distance between them miles of distance all he had to do was to get into his car and head it in the right direction but how long would it take him to chase her out of his head that was for tomorrow he reminded himself and was suddenly abominably tired he knew better than to think of tomorrows slade turning he saw jessica in the doorway it annoyed him that she was there infuriated him that her face was still pale her eyes still shadowed what are you doing up he demanded you look like hell jessica managed a weak smile thanks you know how to boost a womans morale sergeant youre supposed to be resting he reminded her i couldnt sleep take a pill i never take pills because her hands were clammy she linked them together she wouldnt tell him of the nightmare that had woken her of the sharp sweating fear that had had her choking back a scream as she fought off sleep nor would jessica tell him how she had reached for him only to find him gone are you working slade frowned then followed her gaze to the pile of books beside him i might as well clear up some of this he said with a shrug ive got nothing but time now i could help uncomfortably aware that her movements were jerky jessica walked farther into the room and dont make one of those snide remarks she continued hurriedly i know the librarys a disgrace and the finger points at me but i do have a knack for organizing once i get started if nothing else i can fetch and carry for you until he cut off her stream of hasty words by putting his hand over hers as she reached for a book her skin was ice cold instinctively he tightened his grip wanting to warm her jess go back to bed get some sleep ill have betsy bring you up a tray later im not sick the words erupted from her as she yanked her hand away youre going to be slade returned evenly if you dont take care of yourself stop treating me like a child she ordered enunciating each word carefully i dont need a baby sitter no he gave a quick laugh remembering his early conception of his assignment then tell me how much sleep have you had in the last two days whens the last time youve had a meal i had dinner last night she began you pushed your dinner around your plate last night he corrected keep it up youll pass out and make my job easier im not going to pass out she said quietly her eyes had darkened that much more of a contrast to her skin because he wanted to rage at her slade withdrew i wouldnt count on it but suit yourself he said carelessly overall it doesnt matter whether youre conscious or unconscious in dismissal he turned back to the stack of books im sorry im not as accustomed to this sort of thing as you are jessica began in a tone that started off calm then became more and more agitated it isnt every day im investigated by the fbi and shot at by a professional gunman the next time im sure ill be able to enjoy a banquet after i see a dead body on my property all in a days work for you isnt it slade killing a man a hard knot lodged in his stomach another in his chest casually he pulled out a cigarette and lit it chest heaving with the emotion of her words she watched him dont you feel anything jessica demanded he made himself take a long slow drag made himself speak calmly what do you want me to feel if id been slower id be dead swiftly she turned away then pressed her forehead to the window glass the few clinging raindrops blurred and seemed to multiply until she shut her eyes and so would you she reminded herself what he did he did for you im sorry she murmured im sorry why his voice was as cool as the pane she rested upon and just as hard you were on target again taking a deep breath jessica turned to face him yes the guards were there but she knew him better now what he had done that morning hadnt been done coldly you hate being reminded that youre just as human as the rest of us dont you it infuriates you that youre haunted by feelings emotions needs slowly she walked to him i wonder if thats why you wont stay with me after weve made love are you afraid ill find a weakness slade a little crack i might be able to widen watch how far you go he warned softly you wont like the trip back you hate wanting me dont you in a deliberately controlled movement slade crushed out his cigarette yes as she opened her mouth to speak again the door to the library swung open both she and slade turned to see david stride in he took a long look at jessica then pushed his glasses back up on his nose you look like hell why arent you in bed david she couldnt control the tremor in her voice or the sudden urge that had her racing into his arms to hug him fiercely david sent slade a surprised look over her shoulder as he awkwardly patted her back whats all this you got a fever come on jessie not him she thought desperately please god not david through sheer force of will jessica controlled the tears that burned in her eyes in silence slade watched the exchange jessica clung to davids thin frame as if it were an anchor while he looked puzzled concerned and embarrassed all at once speculating slade dipped his hands into his pockets hey whats all this is she delirious david tossed the question at slade but managed to nudge jessica back enough to peer into her face you look ready to drop he stated and tested her forehead with his palm mom called me at the shop giving me all kinds of grief about passing on my germs drawing her away he grimaced at the memory thats what you get for coming into my room and shoving that chicken soup down my throat im all right she managed just a little tired sure tell that to someone who didnt spend last week flat on his back moaning jessica wanted to cling to him again to pour out everything that was inside her instead she took a step back smiled and hated herself ill be fine im just going to take it easy for a couple of days have you called the doctor david the annoyance in her tone pleased him its great having the situation reversed he told slade she did nothing but nag for two weeks have you he demanded of jessica again when i need one ill call one why arent you at the shop dont worry im heading right back david shot her a grin relieved by the question and the brisk tone that was more like jessica after mom called and read me the riot act i wanted to check on you the deliveries went out yesterday without any problem traffics been light but ive made enough sales to earn my keep he gave her hair a quick tug i dont want to see you in the shop until next week babe michael and i can handle it in fact you look like you could use a vacation if you tell me how terrible i look again youre not going to get that raise youve been hinting about thats what happens when you work for a woman he told slade turning david headed back for the door mom says for you two to come in to lunch this time youre getting the chicken soup with a satisfied grin tossed over his shoulder he left them the moment the door closed jessica pressed both hands to her mouth what ran through her wasnt pain not even an ache but a bloodless kind of hurt that left her numb in the vital areas of heart and mind she didnt move or make any sound for a moment she felt that she had simply ceased to exist not david her own whispered words jolted her with them came a torrent of emotion not david she repeated whirling on slade i wont believe it nothing you can say will make me believe hed do anything to hurt me he isnt capable any more than michael is in a couple of days itll be over slade kept his tone neutral then youll know one way or the other i know now spinning around she dashed for the door slades hand clamped down on hers on the handle youre not going after him he said evenly when she tried to jerk free he took her by the shoulders with more gentleness than he was feeling he hated to see her like this tormented desperate hating knowing it was him she would turn against but he had no choice youre not going after him he said again spacing the words precisely unless i have your word ill cuff you to the bed and lock you in he narrowed his eyes as her hand struggled beneath his i mean it jess she didnt turn against him but to him and that slade discovered was worse not david she murmured crumpling into his arms slade i cant bear it i think i could stand anything but knowing either one of them was involved with what with what happened this morning she seemed so fragile he was almost afraid she would shatter if he applied the least pressure what do i do with her now he wondered as he laid his cheek on her hair he knew how to handle her when she was furious he could even manage her when she dissolved into stormy tears but what did he do when she was simply limp and totally dependent on him she was asking him for reassurance he couldnt give emotion he was terrified to offer jess dont do this to yourself block it out a couple of days he tilted up her chin until their eyes met he saw trust and a plea let me take care of you he heard himself say i want to take care of you he wasnt aware of moving until his lips found hers her vulnerability undermined him to keep her from harm to shield her from hurt seemed his only purpose think of me he murmured unconsciously speaking the thoughts that raced around in his head only think of me slade drew her closer changing the angle for more soft nibbling kisses tell me you want me let me hear you say it yes i want you breathless and pliant she allowed him to give and to take while she remained passive for the moment jessica had no strength to offer anything but surrender in return but it was enough for both of them in his arms she could almost forget the nightmare and the reality he took her hands and buried his lips in the palm of one then the other it surprised her enough to steady rather than arouse her slade wasnt a man for endearments or for typically romantic gestures even as the tingle ran up her arms it occurred to jessica that her weakness her despair only made his difficult job impossible hed been wiser than he knew to ask her to think of him drawing on her reserves of strength she straightened her shoulders and smiled at him betsy has a nasty temper when she has to keep meals waiting gratified he answered the smile hungry yes she lied jessica managed to eat a little though the food threatened to stick in her throat knowing slade watched her she made an effort to appear as though she were enjoying the meal she talked rambled about anything but what was foremost on her mind too many topics of conversation could lead back to the shop to david to michael to the man in the grove jessica found herself fighting the inclination to look out the window to look out only reminded her that she was imprisoned in her own home tell me about your family she demanded almost desperately deciding that it would be better to go along with her pretense than insist she eat or rest slade passed her cream for the coffee she was allowing to grow cold my mothers a quiet woman the kind of person who talks only when she has something to say she likes little things like the figure i bought in your shop and fussy glass she plays the piano started taking lessons again last year the only thing she ever insisted on was that janice and i learn to play do you slade heard the surprise in her voice and gave her a mild scowl badly he admitted she finally gave up on me how does she feel about jessica hesitated then picked up her spoon to stir her coffee about what you do she doesnt say slade watched her move the spoon around and around until a tiny whirlpool formed in the cup i wouldnt think it any easier to be the mother of a cop than the wife of one but she manages shes always managed with a nod jessica pushed the untouched coffee aside and your sister janice you said she was in college she wants to be a chemist he gave a quick mystified laugh she said so after her first day in high school chemistry you should see her mixing all those potions this tall skinny girl with soft eyes and beautiful hands not your average mad scientist she blew up our bathroom when she was sixteen jessica laughed perhaps her first genuine laugh in twentyfour hours did she really a minor explosion slade passed it off pleased to hear the low gurgle that had been so much a part of her until the day before the super wasnt too impressed with her explanation of unstable compounds one can see his point jessica mused where does she go to school princeton she got a partial scholarship and even with that jessica reflected the cost of tuition must devour his income how much did a cop make she wondered not enough she thought instantly not nearly enough to compensate for the risk his writing takes a back seat to his sisters education jessica studied the cold coffee in her cup and wondered if janice sladerman realized how much her brother was willing to sacrifice for her you must love her very much she murmured and your mother slade lifted a brow it wasnt something he thought of it simply was yes i do things havent been easy on either of them they never complain never expect and you lifting her eyes jessica gave him a long quiet look how have you managed to hide from them what you really want sensing his instant withdrawal she reached out to take his hand you really hate anyone knowing what a nice person you are dont you slade doesnt suit the tough cop image she grinned pleased to see that shed embarrassed him you can always tell me how you knock suspects around until they beg to confess youve been watching too many old movies linking his fingers with hers slade drew her to her feet theyre one of my vices she confessed i cant tell you how many times ive seen the big sleep thats about a private detective not a cop he pointed out as he walked her back to the library whats the difference he shot her a look how much time do you have well she considered glad to forget the outside world for a few moments it might be interesting to learn why ones called a flatfoot and the other a gumshoe he stopped turning to her with an expression between amusement and exasperation very old movies he decided classics she corrected i only watch them for their cultural value slade only lifted a brow at that it was a gesture jessica had learned he used in lieu of dozens of words since you want to help you can do the cataloging he gestured toward the pile of books littering the work table your handwriting has to be better than mine all right grateful for any task jessica plucked one of a neat stack of index files i suppose youll want to reference and crossreference and all that sort of thing something like that slade she put the card back down before she turned to him youd rather be working on your book than doing this why dont you take a couple of hours for yourself he thought of the novel nearly finished waiting for him on the desk upstairs then he thought of the way jessica had looked when she had walked through the library doors an hour before this kind of mess drives me crazy he told her while im here i might as well point you in the right direction how many books are in here he asked before she could voice another objection momentarily distracted jessica looked around i dont have any idea most of these were my fathers he loved to read a smile touched her lips then her eyes his taste was eclectic to say the least but i think he had a preference for hardboiled whodunits the thought occurred to her quite suddenly whats your book about is it a detective novel the one im working on now he grinned no well she lowered a hip to the table what then he began to make a clear space for her to work its about a family beginning in the postwar forties and working through modern day changes adjustments disappointments victories let me read it she demanded impulsively his words she knew instinctively would reveal much of the inner man its not finished ill read what is searching for a pencil slade stalled he wanted his words read it was a dream hed lived with for too many years to count but jessica was different she wasnt the nameless faceless public her opinion good or bad held too much weight maybe he muttered if youre going to help youd better sit down slade wrapping her arms around his waist jessica rested her cheek on his back ill just bother you until you say yes its a talent of mine something about the casually intimate embrace stirred him beyond belief her breasts pressed lightly against his back her hands linked loosely at his waist in that moment for that moment he surrendered completely to the love he felt for her it was deeper than need sharper than longing didnt she see that there was nothing he could refuse her slade thought as he brought his hands down to cover hers couldnt she see that shed become woman and dream and vulnerability all in the space of days if they were to pretend for her sake that there was no threat beyond the walls perhaps they could pretend for his that she belonged to him bother me he invited turning so that he could gather her into his arms but i warn you im no pushover with a low laugh jessica rose on her toes until her lips brushed his i can only hope my works cut out for me deepening the kiss she slid her hands under his shirt to run them up the firm planes of his back along the ridge of muscle that might get you a couple of pages he murmured want to try for a chapter she allowed her tongue to trace his lips lazily giving them a quick teasing nip as she slid a finger up and down his spine she sensed his response just as she sensed his reluctance to show it to her bargaining is my forte she told him quietly she gave him a slow lingering kiss retreating just as she felt him increase the pressure just how many chapters are in this book slade closed his eyes the better to enjoy the sensation of being seduced when no seduction was necessary about twentyfive hmmm he felt her lips curve as they touched his again this could take all day count on it unexpectedly he drew her away then framed her face with his hands we can start negotiations right after we do some work in here oh catching her tongue between her teeth jessica looked around at the disordered books after after slade said firmly nudging her down in a chair start writing jessica was hardly aware of the hours that passed one then two then three he worked quietly systematically and with a patience she could never hope to emulate slade knew the books a great deal better than she jessica saved reading for the rare times when her physical energy lagged behind her mental energy she enjoyed books he loved them she found this small realization another step in the ladder to discovering him it was easier in the quiet cluttered library to get him to talk have you read this yes what did you think of it and he would tell her easily and in depth without ever stopping his work how her father would have liked him jessica thought he would have admired slades mind his strength his sudden flashes of humor he would have seen the goodness slade took such care to keep hidden she doubted slade realized that by letting her work with him here he was revealing his other side the dreamer perhaps shed always known it was there even when she had recognized the streak of hard street sense it was a complex man who could carry a gun and discuss byrons don juan with equal ease that afternoon she needed the dreamer perhaps he knew it the light began to fade to a soft gray shadows gathered in the corners of the room jessica had forgotten her tension and had become involved with the mindless task of copying titles and names onto the index cards when the phone rang she scattered two dozen of them on the floor quickly she began to retrieve them it just startled me she said when slade remained silent she cursed her trembling hands as she gathered the cards back into a pile its been so quiet thats all furious with herself she let the cards fall again damn it dont sit there looking at me like that id rather you swore at me he rose and went to her then crouched in front of her you made a hell of a mess he murmured if you cant do better ill have to get myself a new assistant with a sound that was part sigh part laugh she leaned her forehead against his give me a break its my first day on the job betsy opened the door then lifted her brows and pursed her lips well she always figured where there was smoke there was fire and shed smelled smoke the minute those two had set eyes on each other she gave a quick harrumph and watched jessica jump as though shed been scalded mr adams is on the phone betsy said regally then closed the door again slade closed his hand over jessicas call her back he said quietly have her tell him youre resting no with a quick shake of the head she rose dont keep asking me to run slade because i might do it then id hate myself turning she picked up the phone hello michael slowly slade straightened tucked his hands in his pockets and watched her no its nothing really just a little touch of the flu jessica spoke in quiet tones while she wrapped the phone cord around and around her fingers davids just feeling guilty because he thinks i caught it from him he shouldnt have worried you i am taking care of myself she shut her eyes tightly a moment but her voice remained light and steady no i wont be in tomorrow the cord of the phone dug into her skin carefully jessica unwound it thats not necessary michael no really i promise dont worry ill be ill be fine in a couple of days yes i will goodbye after replacing the receiver jessica stood for a moment staring down at her empty hands he was concerned she murmured im never ill he wanted to come over and see me but i put him off good sympathy wouldnt help her now slade decided weve done enough in here for today why dont we go upstairs he walked to the door as if taking her agreement for granted he opened it then paused and looked back she still hadnt moved come on jess she crossed to him but stopped at the door michael would do nothing to hurt me she said without looking at him i just want you to understand that as long as you understand that i have to look at everyone as a potential threat he returned evenly youre not to see either one of them or anyone else unless im with you spotting the light of defiance in her eyes he continued if he and david are innocent the next couple of days wont do them any harm if you really believe it he went on shrugging off the look of fury she sent him you should be able to handle all this he wasnt going to give her an inch jessica concluded as she fought both tears and rage perhaps it was best if he didnt she took a long steadying breath youre right and i will handle it are you going to work on your book now slade gave no sign that the change of subject made any difference to him i thought i might jessica was determined to be just as practical as he at least on the surface fine go on up then and ill bring some coffee for both of us you can trust me she went on before he could object ill do exactly what you tell me to do so i can prove you wrong i am going to prove you wrong slade she told him with quiet concrete determination fine as long as you stick to the rules finding herself more at ease with a goal in mind jessica smiled then ill bring up the coffee while im reading your book you can concentrate on finishing it its one sure way to keep me occupied for the rest of the day he pinched the lobe of her ear is that a bribe if you dont know one when you hear one she countered you must be a pretty lousy cop chapter contents prev next jessicas coffee grew cold again she sat up against the headboard of slades bed with a pile of manuscript on either side of her the stack of pages she had read was rapidly outgrowing the pile she had yet to read engrossed she had been able to pass off betsys nagging when the housekeeper had brought up a tray of soup and sandwiches jessica had given her an absent promise to eat which she had forgotten the moment the door was closed again shed forgotten too though he had scrawled notes and revisions in the margins that she was reading slades work the story the people had completely taken her over she traveled with an ordinary family through the postwar forties through the simplicities and complexities of the fifties into the sixties with their turbulence and fluctuating mores children grew up values changed there were deaths and births the realization of some dreams and the destruction of others through it all as a new generation coped with the pressures of the seventies jessica came to know them they were people she might have met undeniably people she would have cared for the words flowed at times gently at other times with a grittiness that made her stomach tighten it wasnt an easy story his characters were too genuine for that he showed her things she didnt always want to be shown but she never considered setting the pages aside at the end of a chapter jessica reached automatically for the next page confused she glanced down to see that there were no more annoyed with the interruption she then realized she had read all he had given her for the first time in almost three hours the sound of slades typing penetrated her concentration there was a full moon that too came to her abruptly the light flowed into the room to vie with the stream of the bedside lamp the fire slade had lit when theyd come upstairs had burned down to glowing embers jessica stretched her cramped muscles wanting to give herself a moment before she went into slade when she had insisted on reading his work jessica hadnt been certain how she would feel or what she would say to him when she was finished knowing herself too easily influenced by emotion she had been certain that she would find some merit in his writing now she wanted time to decide how much her feelings for slade had to do with her feelings about the story she had just read none she realized before she had completed the first chapter jessica had forgotten why she was reading it even though her main purpose had been accomplished she knew slade better now he had a depth of perception she had only sensed an insight into people she envied as well as admired in his writing as well as his speech he was frugal with words but in the writing his inner thoughts surfaced he might be sparing with his own emotions but his characters had a range to them that were rooted in their creator and jessica mused shed been wrong when she had once told him he didnt know women he knew them almost too well she thought as she fingered the tip of a page how much did he see when he looked at her that she had been confident was private how much did he understand when he touched her that she had been certain she could keep hidden did he know she loved him instinctively jessica glanced at the doorway that separated the bedroom and the sitting room slades typing continued no she was certain he had no idea how deep her feelings ran or she thought with a small smile that she was determined not to let him walk out of her life whenever or however things were resolved if he knew she mused hed put her at arms length a cautious man she reflected slade was a very cautious man one who saw himself suited for the solitary life jessica decided that he had some surprises coming when she felt her life was her own again she was going to deal him a few she rose and went to the doorway his back was to her the light falling on his hands as they moved over the keys from the set of his shoulders the angle of his head she could tell his concentration was deep not wanting to disturb him she waited resting against the doorjamb the ashtray at his elbow was half full with a lit cigarette smoldering and forgotten his coffee cup was empty but his dinner tray hadnt been touched she felt a betsylike urge to scold him for neglecting to eat this is how it could be she realized abruptly if the nightmare was behind us he could work here and id hear the sound of his typing when i came home thered be times hed get up in the middle of the night and close the door so the noise wouldnt wake me wed walk on the beach on sunday mornings watch the fire on rainy afternoons one day she thought and closed her eyes it could happen one day with an exasperated sigh slade stopped typing one hand reached up to rub at the stiffness in his neck whatever impetus had driven him for three hours had suddenly dried up and he wasnt ready automatically he reached for his coffee only to find the cup empty maybe if he went down for some more the flow would come back even as he considered it jessica came to him wrapping her arms around his neck she rested her cheek on top of his head love was coursing through her swiftly too swiftly she squeezed him tightly forcing back the words she was afraid he wasnt ready to hear there were others she wanted to say first slade dont ever stop doing what you were meant to do not sure of her meaning he frowned down at the words hed just written how much did you read all you gave me not enough when will you finish oh slade its wonderful jessica continued before he could speak its a beautiful piece of work everything the words the feeling the people slade turned so that he could see her face he didnt want platitudes not from her her eyes were lit with enthusiasm while his remained cool and guarded why because you told a story with depth about people all of us have met or have been she spread her fingers searching for words that would satisfy him because it made me cry and cringe and laugh there were parts that scene in the parking lot in the seventh chapter i didnt want to read it was hard savage but i had to read it even when it hurt slade no one that reads that is going to be untouched she laid her hands back on his shoulders and isnt that why a writer writes his eyes never left hers he waited weighing what he saw there with her words you know he said slowly i dont think i realized until just now what a chance i was taking by letting you read it a chance she repeated why if you hadnt been touched im not sure i could have finished it nothing he could have said would have meant more jessica brought his hand up to her cheek wondering if he realized how much hed said in one sentence i was touched slade she said quietly when its published and i read it im going to remember that part of it was written right here going to erect a monument he asked with a smile just a discreet plaque leaning over she kissed him i wouldnt want it to go to your head what about an agent she asked suddenly do you have one chuckling he drew her down into his lap yes i have one so far we havent done each other much good but hes marketed some short stories and hes doing whatever it is agents do to sell my other novel the other one jessica drew away as slade began to nibble on her ear its finished then mmmhmm come back here he demanded wanting to taste that soft sensitive spot at the curve of her shoulder whats it about she demanded eluding him when can i read it is it as good as this one has anyone ever told you that you ask too many questions his hand slipped under her sweater to cup her breast with his thumb he flicked lazily over the point feeling it harden as her heartbeat went from steady to erratic i like that he murmured nipping at the cord of her neck i can feel your pulse go crazy everywhere i touch in one long stroke he moved down her rib cage to her waist youre losing weight he said with a frown youre already too thin did you eat any dinner has anyone ever told you that you talk too much jessica asked before she pressed her lips to his his answer was a low sound of pleasure she tasted warm more pungent than sweet as the tip of her tongue slipped to his to tantalize then retreated to provoke he thought he heard her laugh low and husky before he gripped the back of her neck in his hand and plunged deep her scent and her taste were the same so that he felt himself surrounded by her before slade could rise to carry her to the bed jessica was pulling him to the floor there was a sudden urgency in her a flash of fire the habitual energy that had been lacking in her all day abruptly surfaced in a torrent of passion she tugged at the buttons of his shirt impatient to have his flesh against hers while her mouth was already making wild passes over his face and throat her aggression both unbalanced and aroused him because he understood that part of it came from a need to block out her fears slade let her lead the pace was hers and it was frantic within moments he was too caught up in her to think at all she was undressing him swiftly her lips following the path of her busy hands until his mind was totally centered on her shivering thoughts quick tastes maddening touches she gave him no time to focus on only one but insisted he experience all in an enervating haze of sensation vulnerability was something new to him but he found himself trapped in a sultry viscous world where he had no guards no defense she was driving him beyond the point of reason but still he couldnt find the will to stop her and take command this time there was only response it poured from him increasing her strength and depleting his when her mouth fixed on his again he fumbled with her sweater he whose hands were always sure found them damp and trembling when at last he could touch her though her flesh was as hot as his she allowed him to linger nowhere moving over him with a speed and agility that left his hands frustrated and his body throbbing skin slid over skin her moist hungry mouth ravaging her soft hands greedy knowing he was helpless excited her this strong man this hard man was completely powerless under her spell but jessica had no spells only needs and love she realized that she loved him more on finding that he could be weak his body was firm and muscled but it shuddered now for her the light from the desk lamp slanted across his face so that she could see his eyes opaque with passion on hers his mouth was tempting and she took it tasting all the hot heady flavors that sprang from desire his breath was warm and ragged as it trembled into her open mouth with sudden clarity she smelled the lemon and beeswax polish from the desk in some sane portion of her mind jessica knew the scent would come back to her whenever she thought of the first time he fully gave himself to her for she had him now mind emotion and body even when he took them back she would have had this one instant in time when he held nothing away from her so she gave herself to him taking him into her on a flash of sharp silvery pleasure her strength soared driving both of them fast and hard until it crested suspending them when it ebbed she seemed to dissolve into him so that they lay entwined joined and sated slade struggled to clear his mind but found that she filled it consumed it the power that had driven her was depleted her body nearly weightless on his but he discovered that she still dominated him he wanted to draw away perhaps to prove to both of them that he could that he had a choice his hands only tangled deeper into her hair until he found the soft slender neck though she lay passive hardly breathing he could feel the hammer of her heart against his no force of will could make his pulses level though his physical need was fully satisfied he wanted her but his wants were only to have her near jess he lifted her face to his without any idea what thoughts would spill out into words her eyes were huge and heavy and shadowed her face was soft with the afterglow of passion and with weariness hed had no right he thought on a quick rage of guilt no right to allow her to use up all her reserves of energy and strength to satisfy his needs no dont jessica could see the change in his face already she thought he was taking back what he had so briefly given her dont shut me out she said quietly dont shut me out so soon without realizing he was doing so he traced her lips with his thumb sleep with me tonight was all he said slade waited until he was certain she slept before he eased from the bed watching jessica he dressed in silence thin moonlight washed over her face and bare shoulders shifting with shadows as a cloud passed over the moon with any luck he calculated that he could give the first floor a thorough check stake out the parlor for a couple of hours then be back without her ever knowing he had gone giving her one last look he slipped from the room with the soundless efficiency that came from years of experience slade tested the multitude of doors and windows he noted with disgust the simple locks that would keep out only the rankest of amateurs the house is full of silver and small portable valuables he reflected a burglars paradise and she seals it off with dimestore locks a credit card and a hairpin slade decided as he examined the rear kitchen door hed have to see that jessica installed something less flimsy before he left in a mound of white fur ulysses slept on the cool tile floor snoring lightly he never stirred as slade stepped over him testing slade rattled the knob on the back door ulysses rhythm never altered wake up you goodfornothing mutt at the command the dog opened one glazed eye thumped his tail twice then went back to sleep rubbing the back of his neck slade reminded himself that a runofthemill burglar wasnt the immediate problem he stepped over the dog again and left him snoring cautiously he moved through the servants wing there was a pale light under one door and the muffled laughter of a latenight talk show the rest were silent glancing at his watch he saw that it was just past midnight slade went back to the parlor to wait he sat in a wingback chair lost in the shadows watch and wait there was little more he could do and he was itching to do something anything to move the investigation along maybe the commissioner picked the wrong man after all he mused this time slade wanted to look for trouble and he wanted to find it whoever had hired the man in the grove was going to pay he had little doubt of that but he wanted to collect personally the woman upstairs in his bed was all that mattered the diamonds were incidental they were just rocks after all with a market value jessica was priceless with a silent laugh he stretched out his legs dodson could hardly have foreseen that his handpicked bodyguard would fall in love with his assignment slade knew his own reputation thorough precise and cool well he thought hed lost his cool almost from the instant hed seen the little blond whirlwind with the viking cheekbones he wasnt thinking like a cop but like a man a man who wanted revenge and that was dangerous as long as he remained on the force he had to play by the rules the first rule was no personal involvement slade nearly laughed aloud at that rule one down the tubes he decided as he dragged a hand through his hair how could he be more personally involved he was already in love with her already her lover if they were any more personal theyd be married and having children that thought stopped him cold he couldnt permit his mind to run in that direction he wasnt for her theyd drift apart once the investigation was over naturally thats what he wanted slade told himself but the frown remained in his eyes he had his own life to deal with the demands of his profession his responsibilities his writing even if there was room in his life for a woman their paths ran in opposite directions they werent about to cross again it was only chance that had brought them together this time circumstances that had brought about an intimacy that had led to emotional attachment hed get over her he pinched the bridge of his nose between his thumb and forefinger the hell he would wasnt a man allowed a few dreams he demanded of himself when he sat alone in the dark in a room that smelled of lemon wax and fall flowers wasnt he allowed to weave some sort of future when a woman lay soft and warm in his bed he was entitled to some basic selfishness wasnt he with a half sigh slade settled against the back of the chair maybe the man was but the cop wasnt and he reminded himself jessica needed the cop more whether she believed it or not blanking out his mind slade waited in the dark for just under three hours instinct told him he was wasting his time some sleep was essential if he was to be alert enough to keep her safe and occupied during the daylight hours stiff from sitting he absently worked out the kinks as he headed back to the stairs another day he mused two at the most if agent brewster was as close as hed led slade to believe fatigue settled over him the moment he allowed his muscles to relax four hours sleep would recharge his system hed gotten by on less quietly he turned the knob of his bedroom door jessica was sitting in the middle of the bed curled into a tight ball she took the deep tearing breaths of a drowning woman fighting for air moonlight pooled over her as she shuddered jess there was a scream rising in her throat when her head jerked up slade saw the wild sheen of fear in her eyes before she focused on him she could hold back the cry by digging her teeth into her lip but the shudders went on slade went to her swiftly her skin was clammy as he took her shoulders her face damp with a mixture of tears and perspiration it ran through his mind that someone had slipped past him and gotten to her then the idea was as quickly dismissed what is it he demanded whats the matter its nothing desperately she fought to control the tremors the nightmare had come back horridly vivid to attack all of her senses cold wind the smell of salt spray the roar of the surf and someones heavy footsteps as they ran after her the shifting shadows as clouds blocked out the sun the iron taste of her own terror and worse much worse she had been afraid to turn afraid she would see the face of someone she loved on the man who pursued her i woke up she managed i guess i panicked when you werent here it was partially true and difficult enough to confess she couldnt bring herself to admit she could be terrorized by a dream i was just downstairs he brushed sweatdampened hair from her cheeks i wanted to make sure everything was locked up professional habit she nearly managed a smile before she dropped her head to his shoulder yeah even as he gathered her close she trembled it wasnt the moment he decided to lecture her on flimsy locks and thin chains ill go down and get you a brandy no she bit her lip again as the refusal came out too forcefully no please i already feel like an idiot youre entitled to be jumpy jess softly he brushed a kiss over her hair she wanted to cling to beg him not to leave her alone for an instant she wanted to pour out every fear and fantasy and dread but she couldnt and the denial was as much for her own sake as his with a policeman in the house she countered tilting back her head she looked up at him a strong face she mused strong arms and serious eyes just come to bed you must be tired making the effort she forced away the nerves and gave him a smile how does one man cope with two careers sergeant he shrugged as he kneaded her tense shoulders i manage how can a woman look so beautiful at three oclock in the morning my mother claims its bone structure her smile warmed a bit as she willed herself to relax under his hands i prefer to think its something less scientific like being born during a lunar eclipse nuzzling her neck he chuckled were you yes my father said thats why i had cats eyes to help me see in the dark slade kissed her lightly before he set her away from him and rose if you dont get some sleep theyre going to be bloodshot what a gallant thing to say jessica frowned at him as he undressed what about you i can get by on three or four hours when i have to she gave a quick snort your machismos surfacing slade when he turned his head the moonlight streamed over his face illuminating the lightningfast grin jessica felt her heart flutter up to her throat shouldnt she be used to him by now she wondered the mercurial moods the streaks of boyish good humor in the sometimes overly serious man his body was sleek and limber streamlined like a channel swimmers muscled like a lightweight boxers his face mirrored both of his professions the intellect and the action hell take care of you her mind comforted just trust but there were lines of fatigue and strain that the moonlight accented as well and you take care of him her thoughts added smiling she held out her arms to him come to bed she ordered lying down beside her slade drew her close there was no driving physical need to possess her instead he felt a simple serenity all the more precious for its rarity for the next few hours they would be any man and woman sharing the intimacy of sleep she curled warmly into him as much to soothe as be soothed there were no more words jessica lay still schooling her breathing so that it was deep and even until she felt him drift off with her eyes open and fear threatening on the verges of her mind she watched the moonlight play on his shoulder as it rose and fell the light was misty with predawn before she slept when the phone rang he jolted out of a restless sleep sweat pearled on his forehead afraid to answer more afraid not to he lifted the receiver yes hello your times up i need more he said quickly knowing that weakness would never be tolerated he swallowed the tremor in his voice just a few days it isnt easy to get to them with the house full of people must i remind you that you arent paid to do only whats easy i tried to get to them last night i was nearly caught then you were careless ive no use for carelessness less for carelessness than weakness he thought rapidly and moistened his lips jessica jessicas not feeling well he reached for a cigarette to steady his nerves he had to think quickly and calmly if he wanted to stay alive she isnt planning on coming into the shop in a couple of days i should be able to convince her to take a long weekend shell listen to me he took a greedy drag of his cigarette praying that he spoke the truth with her out of the house i can get to the diamonds without taking any chances moisture beaded on his top lip and he wiped the back of his hand across it youll have them this weekend a couple of days wont matter a sigh breathed through the phone chilling him youre mistaken again too many mistakes my young friend remember my associate in paris he made mistakes the phone slid wetly in his hand he remembered the man found floating in the seine tonight he said desperately ill have them for you tonight ten oclock at the shop he paused to make certain the weapon of fear had done its work the soft jerky breathing pleased him if you fail this time i wont be so understanding youve done very well since you started to work for me id hate to lose you ill bring them then i then i want out well discuss it ten oclock with a gentle click the connection was broken chapter contents prev next slades mind and body awoke at the same instant the luxury of drifting slowly awake was something he had forfeited years before he had had to perfect the ability to sleep quickly and lightly and to awake just as quickly ready to function it was a habit he looked forward to breaking without really believing he ever would he saw from the slant of the sun that it was still early but he shifted his gaze to check the mantel clock nonetheless just past seven the four hours rest had done all it needed to do turning his head he looked down at jessica the pale blue smudges under her eyes made him frown though by his calculations she had slept nearly eight hours the smudges were deeper than they had been the day before today hed make certain she rested more if he had to slip a sleeping pill into her coffee and ate something if he had to forcefeed her he could all but feel the pounds slipping off her though he barely shifted the mattress as he moved away from her her hand tightened on his arm her eyes flew open get some more sleep he ordered touching his lips to hers what time is it her voice was husky and thick but her hand stayed firm on his arm early jessica relaxed muscle by muscle but didnt release him how early too early he bent to give her another brief kiss before he rose but she pulled him closer too early for what she felt his lips curve against hers youre not even awake yet wanna bet running a hand down she trailed her fingers over his flat stomach the sleepy kiss smoldered with burgeoning passion maybe you cant get by on three or four hours sleep after all cocking his brow he lifted his head wanna bet her answering laugh was smothered by his lips it had never been like this for her each time they made love it stunned her enticed her then consumed her in his arms with his hands and lips running wild and free over her body she could lose herself and how she needed to lose herself hed known from the first how to play her each time they came together he found new variations giving her no opportunity to become familiar with a touch or to anticipate a demand he could dominate her mind so effortlessly plunge her back into a world that was all keen emotion and sharp sensation everything would magnetize from the bare brush of a fingertip to the bruising pressure of lips jessica thought she could feel the individual threads of the sheet against the naked flesh of her back the whispering tick of the clock was like thunder pale sunlight danced gray and ghostly she could see it fall over his hair accenting its dark confusion as she dove her hands into it in her ear he whispered something poetic and foolish about the texture of her skin though the tone was almost reverent his hands were aggressive arousing and drugging in turns murmuring she told him what she wanted shifting she offered what he needed when he took her slade took her slowly watching the flickers of pleasure and passion on her face in the thin morning light savoring the sensations that rippled through him as she moved he nibbled on her parted lips he tasted her and himself before he roamed over her closed lids fragile he thought her skin was so fragile yet all the while her hips urged him to take to take quickly with iron control he kept the rhythm easy prolonging the ultimate delight jess he could hardly form her name between labored breaths open your eyes jess i want to see your eyes the lids fluttered as if weighed down by the pale gold lashes open your eyes love and look at me he wasnt a man for endearments even through the haze of needs and sensations jessica recognized it a new warmth filled her pure emotion to double the physical ecstasy she opened them the irises were opaque rich amber filmed over with passion as he moved inside her the lashes flickered threatening to lower again no look at me his voice had dropped to a rough whisper their lips were close so that their breath merged shudder for shudder jessica saw that his eyes were dark dark gray and intense as if he would look into her mind and read whatever frantic thoughts raced inside tell me that you need me he demanded i have to hear you say it just once jessica struggled to form words as she climbed higher toward delirium i need you slade youre the only one his lips crushed down on hers to muffle her cry as he drove her swiftly to the peak his last rational thought was almost a prayer that the words he had demanded would be enough for him strange that his body felt more rested more relaxed now than it had upon waking slade slid down to press a kiss at the hollow between her breasts before he shifted from her now get some more sleep he ordered but before he could rise jessica had her arms locked around his neck ive never been more awake in my life whatre you going to do with me today slade make me fill out more of those silly cards those silly cards he said as he slipped a hand under her knees are a necessary part of any organized library theyre boring she said defiantly when he lifted her spoiled he decided carrying her into the bathroom i certainly am not the line appeared between her brows as he switched on the shower you certainly are he corrected genially but thats all right i kind of like you that way oh well thanks a lot he grinned kissed her then set her down in the shower stall jessica let out one long surprised scream slade its freezing best way to get the blood moving in the morning he stepped in with her partially blocking the spray well second best he amended then cut off a stream of abuse with his lips turn on the hot water she demanded when he let her breathe again im turning blue he picked up her arm giving it a light pinch no not yet he disagreed want the soap ill go take my own shower thanks huffily she tried to climb out only to find herself tangled with him under the icy spray let go this is police brutality she lifted her face to glare at him and got struck fully with the cold needle spray slade sputtering she blinked her eyes to clear them her body was pressed against his frigid and tingling youre going to pay for this i swear you are blinded by the water and her own streaming hair she struggled to free herself with one arm keeping her prisoner slade took his free hand over her lavishly soaping her skin stop it infuriated and aroused jessica fought against him when his hand passed intimately over her bottom she grew more desperate then she heard him chuckle temper had her head snapping back up though the spray made her vision vague and watery you listen to me she began soapy fingers passed over her nipple slade dont with a moan she arched away his palm slipped between her thighs no but her mouth blindly sought his jessica no longer felt the cold when she left the shower she was glowing some color had seeped back into her cheeks slade noted it with a mixture of relief and pleasure though jessica did her best to maintain outward indignance im going to go get dressed she informed him as she wrapped her wet hair in a towel because she was still naked slade found it hard to be offended by her haughty tone refreshed he hooked his own towel around his waist okay ill meet you downstairs for breakfast in ten minutes ill be there she told him grandly as she stooped to pick up his shirt when i get there grinning he watched her slip into his shirt and button it i could get used to seeing you like that he commented when she sent him an arch look his grin only widened wet and half naked he explained its that machismo again jessica muttered holding back the smile turning she flounced to the door ten minutes he reminded her jessica cast a baleful look over her shoulder then slammed the door behind her her grin quickly escaped then almost as quickly faded david stood directly outside her own bedroom door his hand already poised to knock his head had turned at the sound of the slam but he hadnt moved his eyes roamed over her taking in slades shirt the damp glowing skin and sleepstarved eyes well his tone like his eyes turned cool i guess youre already up jessica felt more color flow into her cheeks as close as she and david had been living in the same house they had never chanced upon each other under these circumstances both had always been extremely private about that area of their lives were both adults jessica reminded herself as she walked toward him but theyd been children together yes im up did you want me part of her wanted to run to him as she had the day before part of her no longer trusted so unconditionally guilt gave her a reserve toward him nothing else could have sensing it he became only more distant and disapproving thought id check with you before i went in thats all he gave her another brief telling look since youre busy im not busy david come in coolly polite jessica opened the bedroom door then gestured him inside it never occurred to her that she was breaking one of slades rules by talking to david alone even if it had she would have done no differently were there any problems yesterday i should know about no his eyes rested on the bed which hadnt been slept in his voice tightened nothing to worry about obviously youve got enough to keep you busy dont be sarcastic david it doesnt suit you she took the towel from her hair and flung it aside if you have something to say to me come out with it she plucked up a comb and began to drag it through her hair do you know what youre doing he blurted out jessicas hand paused in midstroke slowly she lowered the comb to place it back on the dresser she caught a glimpse of herself pale shadoweyed damp and inadequately covered in slades wrinkled shirt be specific youre sleeping with the writer shoving up his glasses he took a step toward her and if i am she countered tightly why should you object what do you know about him david demanded with such sudden heat that she was rendered speechless he comes out of nowhere probably without two nickels to rub together its a nice setup here big house free meals a willing woman be careful david she stiffened as the anger in her eyes met his how do you know hes not just a sponge a couple million dollars is a hell of a target the angry color paled with hurt and of course what else could he be interested in other than my money when she would have turned away he took her shoulders come on jessie the eyes behind the glasses softened you know i didnt mean it that way but hes a stranger and youre well youre just too trusting am i david she swallowed the sudden rise of tears as she studied his wellknown face have i made a mistake by trusting i dont want you to get hurt he squeezed her shoulders before he dropped his hands you know i love you the admission seemed to make him uncomfortable with a shrug he stuck his hands in his pockets and damn it jessica you must know how crazy michael is about you hes been in love with you for years but im not in love with him she said quietly im in love with slade in love with him jeez jessie you hardly know the guy the use of the silly exclamation brought a quick laugh from her as she dragged a hand through her hair oh david i know him better than you think look let me check into him a little bit maybe find out no swiftly jessica cut him off no david i wont permit that slade is my business so was that creep from madison avenue who soaked you for ten thousand he muttered turning away she covered her face with her hands it was funny she thought she should be able to laugh two of the most important people in her life were warning her about each other hey jessica im sorry awkwardly david patted her wet hair that was a dumb thing to say ill butt out just well just be careful okay he shifted from one foot to the other wondering why she was suddenly so emotional youre not going to cry or anything are you no that did nudge a small laugh from her he sounded suspiciously as he had when hed been twelve and shed come home after fighting with her current boyfriend loyalty came full circle overlapping everything else david turning jessica laid her hands on his shoulders looking beyond the lenses and deep into his eyes if you were in trouble if youd gotten in over your head and made a mistake a serious one would you tell me his eyes narrowed slightly but she couldnt tell if it was from curiosity or guilt i dont know i guess it would depend it wouldnt matter what youd done david id always be on your side the tone was too serious uncomfortable he shrugged his thin shoulders and tried to lighten it im going to remind you of that the next time you jump me for making a mistake in the books jessie you really dont look good you ought to think about getting away for a few days ill be fine sensing an argument she continued but ill give it some thought good ive got to go i told michael id open up today he gave her a quick kiss on the cheek im sorry if i came on too strong before i still think hesitating he shifted his shoulders again well weve all got to do things our own way yes she murmured as she watched him walk to the door yes we do david if you or michael need money are we going to get a raise he asked with a quick grin as he turned the knob forcing a smile jessica picked up her comb again well see about it when i come back to work hurry back he said then left her alone jessica stared at the closed door then down at the comb in her hand on a sudden spurt of rage she hurled it across the room look at what shed been doing pumping him half hoping hed confess so that she could see an end to things shed watched him searching for some sign of guilt and she wouldnt be able to prevent herself from doing the same with michael her own lack of trust appalled her dropping onto the stool of her vanity she stared at her reflection it wasnt right that she should feel this way alienated from the two people shed felt closest to watching for signs waiting for them to make a mistake worse she thought worse wanting them to make one so that she could stop the watching and waiting she took a long hard look at herself her hair was wet and tangled around an unnaturally pale face the pallor only accented the smudges under her eyes she looked frail already half beaten that she could put an end to with a few basic practicalities stiffening her spine jessica began to dab makeup on the smudges if an illusion of strength was all she had left shed make the best of it when the phone rang across the room she jolted knocking a small china vase to the floor helplessly she stared at the shattered pieces that could never be put back together betsy answered the phone as slade reached the bottom of the stairs yes hes here may i say whos calling she stopped slade with an arch look as she held out the receiver its a mrs sladerman she said primly frowning slade took the receiver mom betsy sniffed at that and walked away why are you calling me here you know im working is anything wrong he demanded as annoyance turned to concern is janice all right nothings wrong and janice is fine his mother put in the moment he let her speak and how are you annoyance returned swiftly mom you know youre not supposed to call when im working unless its important if the plumbings gone again just call the super i could probably have figured that one out all by myself mrs sladerman considered look i should be home in a couple of days just put whatever it is on hold until i get there all right she said mildly but you did tell me to let you know if i heard anything from your agent well talk about it when you get home goodbye slade wait a minute letting out an impatient breath he shifted the phone to his other hand you didnt have to call to pass on another rejection no she agreed but i thought maybe i should call with an acceptance he started to speak then stopped himself anticipation only led to disappointment on the new short story for mirror now he did mention something about that too she let the sentence trail off until slade was ready to shout at her but he was so excited about selling the novel that i didnt take it all in slade felt the blood pounding in his ears what novel your novel idiot she said with a laugh second chance by james sladerman soon to be published by fullbright and company emotion raced through him too swiftly resting his forehead against the receiver he closed his eyes hed waited all of his life for this one moment now nothing seemed ready to function he tried to speak found his throat closed then cleared it are you sure am i sure she muttered slade do you think i cant understand english even if its fancy agent talk he said theyre working up a contract and hell be in touch with the details business about film rights and serial rights and clauses with numbers of course she added when her son remained silent its up to you if you dont want the fiftythousanddollar advance she waited then gave a maternal sigh you always were a quiet one slade but this is ridiculous doesnt a man say something when he finally has what hes always wanted always wanted he thought numbly of course shed known how could he have ever deceived himself into thinking hed concealed it from her the money hadnt sunk in he was still hearing the magic word published i cant think he said finally well when you can get the one youre working on now together they want to see it seems they think theyve got a tiger by the tail slade i wonder if ive told you often enough that im proud of you yeah he let out a long breath you have thanks her chuckle was warm in his ear thats right darling save your words for your stories i have a few hundred phone calls to make now i love to brag congratulations thanks he said again inadequately mom yes buy a new piano she laughed goodbye slade he listened to the dial tone for nearly a full minute excuse me mr sladerman would you like your breakfast now confused slade turned to stare at betsy she stood behind him little black eyes wrinkled skin and graying hair on short sturdy legs she smelled faintly of silver polish and lavendar sachet the smile slade gave her had her taking a cautious step back it looked a bit crazed youre beautiful she backed up another step sir absolutely beautiful swooping her up he spun her in a fast circle then kissed her full on the mouth betsy managed one muffled shriek her lips tingled for the first time in ten years put me down and behave yourself she ordered clinging to her dignity betsy im crazy about you crazy period she corrected refusing to be charmed by the gleam in his eye just like a writer to be nipping at the brandy before breakfast put me down and ill fix you some nice black coffee im a writer he told her with something like wonder in his voice yes indeed she said soothingly put me down like a good boy jessica stopped halfway down the steps to stare was that slade grinning like a madman and holding her housekeeper two feet off the ground her mouth dropped open as he planted another kiss on betsys staunch unpainted lips slade taking betsy with him he turned it flashed through jessicas mind that it was the first time she had seen him fully completely happy youre next he announced as he set betsy back on her feet pixilated betsy told jessica with a knowing nod before breakfast published slade corrected as he swung jessica from the stairs before breakfast his mouth crushed hers before she had a chance to speak she felt the emotion coming from him in sparks hard clean emotion without eddies or undercurrents the joy transferred into her so that she was laughing even as her mouth was freed published your novel when how yes yes he kissed her again before continuing to answer her questions in turn i just got a call fullbright and company accepted my manuscript and want to see the one im working on something changed in his eyes as he drew her back against him she saw it only briefly it wasnt a loss of happiness but a full dawning of realization my lifes my own he murmured its finally mine oh slade jessica clung to him needing to share the moment im so happy for you lifting her face she framed his in her hands its just the beginning nothing will stop you now i can feel it betsy we need champagne she said as she wrapped her arms around slades neck again at nine oclock in the morning the sentence trembled with righteous shock we need champagne at nine oclock on this morning jessica told her right away in the parlor were celebrating with her tongue clucking rapidly betsy moved down the hall writers she reminded herself were hardly better than artists and everyone knew the sort of lives they led still he was a charming devil she allowed herself one undignified chuckle before she went into the kitchen to report the goingson to the cook come inside jessica ordered tell me everything thats everything slade told her as she pulled him into the parlor they want the book thats the important thing ill have to get the details from my agent the figure of fifty thousand finally registered fully ill get an advance he added with a half laugh enough to keep me going until i sell the second one that wont be long i read it remember on a sudden burst of energy she grabbed his hand what a movie it would make think of it slade you could do the screenplay youll have to be careful with the film rights make sure you dont sign away something you shouldnt or a miniseries she decided yes thats better then you could ever thought about giving up antiques and opening an agency he asked mildly negotiatings negotiating she countered then smiled and im an artist with her face set in lines of disapproval betsy entered carrying a tray will there be anything else miss winslow when betsy used such formal address jessica knew she had sunk beyond reproach no nothing thank you betsy she waited until the housekeeper had disappeared before casting slade a baleful glance thats your fault really she informed him shell be polite and longsuffering all day now because you molested her and i joined you in champagne depravity before breakfast we could ask her to have a glass he suggested as he worked the cork from the bottle you really do want me to be in trouble jessica lifted both glasses as the cork popped out to writing james sladerman on one of those necessary cards in my library she said when both glasses were full laughing he clinked his rim against hers youll have the first copy he promised then drained his glass how do you feel slade sipping more cautiously jessica watched him refill his glass how do you feel really he studied the bubbles in the wine as if searching for the word free he said quietly i feel free shaking his head he began to wander the room after all these years of doing what i had to ill have the chance to do what i want to the money just means that i wont starve doing it even after this last years tuition is paid but now the doors open its open he repeated and i can walk through it jessica moistened her lips and swallowed youll quit the force now i intended to next year he toyed with the wick of a candle on the piano a restlessness crept into the other feelings a restlessness he hadnt permitted himself to acknowledge before this means it can be sooner much sooner ill be a civilian she thought of the gun he secreted somewhere in his rooms upstairs relief flowed through her to be immediately followed by anxiety i guess itll take some getting used to ill manage youll resign right away no need to wait he considered ive got enough to get by on until the contracts signed ill need time if they want rewrites then theres this novel to finish and another ive been kicking around i wonder how itll feel to write fulltime instead of grabbing snatches its what you were meant to do she murmured as soon as this is over im going to find out over her eyes fixed on his but he wasnt looking at her youre staying what distracted he brought his gaze back to her the expression on her face made him frown what did you say i thought youd turn over the assignment to someone else jessica reached for the bottle to add champagne to a glass that was already full youll want to get back to new york right away with deliberate care slade set down his glass i dont leave things until theyre finished no she set the bottle back down no of course you wouldnt you think id walk out of here and leave you the anger in his voice had her taking a quick sip of champagne i think she said slowly when someones about to get what theyve worked for waited for they shouldnt take any chances he went to her and took the glass from her hand then set it beside the halffilled bottle i think you should shut the hell up when she started to speak he cupped her face in one strong hand i mean it jess youre a fool to stay when you have a choice she blurted out his eyes narrowed with temper before he brought his mouth to hers for one brief hard kiss youre a fool to think i have one but you do jessica corrected more calmly i told you once before we always have a choice all right slade nodded never taking his eyes off hers say the word and ill go back to new york today if youll go with me he added when she started to speak her answer was a quick defiant shake of the head then were in this together until the finish jessica went into his arms and clung she needed him to stay as badly as she wanted him to go for now she would only think of tomorrows just remember i gave you your chance you wont get another one tilting her head back she smiled at him one day im going to remind you of it were in this together he nodded again not noting that she had edited his phrase okay lets get some breakfast to go with this champagne before betsy completely writes you off chapter contents prev next for jessica the day crawled the confinement alone would have been torture to her she hated seeing the sun pour through the windows while she remained trapped inside even the beach was off limits so she was prevented from learning if she could walk there again without looking over her shoulder thinking of her shop only brought on a dull nagging headache the one thing shed conceived and built by herself had been taken out of her hands perhaps she would never feel the same pride in it the same dedication to making it the best she was capable of worse her own weariness was taking her to the point where she no longer cared jessica detested being ill her usual defense against a physical weakness was to ignore it and go on it was something she couldnt or wouldnt change now however she had no outlet the quiet library and monotonous tasks slade gave her were grating on already taut nerves finally she tossed her pen across the table and sprang up i cant stand this anymore she gestured widely to encompass the library at large slade if i write one more word ill go crazy isnt there something we can do anything this waiting is unbearable slade leaned back in his chair listening calmly to her complaints hed watched her fidget throughout the morning fighting off boredom tension and exhaustion the only surprise he felt was that shed managed to go so long without exploding sitting still he mused was not jess winslows forte he pushed aside a pile of books gin he stated mildly jessica plunged her hands into the pockets of her trousers damn it slade i dont want a drink i need to do something rummy he finished as he rose rummy for a moment she looked puzzled then gave a gusty sigh cards im ready to beat my head against the wall and you want to play cards yeah got any i suppose jessica dragged a hand through her hair holding it back from her face a moment before she dropped her arm to her side is that the best you can come up with no slade came to her to run his thumb along the shadows under her eyes but i think weve given betsy enough shocks for today with a half length jessica gave in all right then cards she went to a table and pulled open a drawer what stakes she asked as she rummaged around in the drawer your capitals a bit bigger than mine slade said dryly half a penny a point okay big spender jessica located a pack of cards then flourished them prepare to lose and he did resoundingly at slades suggestion they had settled in the parlor his thoughts had been that the sofa and a quiet fire would relax her and a steady boring game might put her to sleep hed already concluded that asleep was the only way jessica could handle the waiting without losing her mind he hadnt expected her to know a great deal about the game any more than he had expected to be trounced gin jessica announced again he looked down in disgust at the cards she spread ive never seen anyone with that kind of luck skill she corrected picking up the cards to shuffle them his opinion was a brief fourletter word ive worked vice he told her while she dealt i know a hustle when i see one vice jessica poked her tongue in her cheek im sure that was very interesting it had its moments he muttered scowling at the cards shed dealt him what department are you with now homicide oh she swallowed but managed to keep her voice light i suppose that has its moments too he gave her a grunt that might have been agreement as he discarded jessica plucked it up and slipped it into her own hand when slade narrowed his eyes she only smiled you must have met a lot of people in your work she contemplated her hand then tossed out a card thats why your characters have such depth briefly he thought of the street people dealers and prostitutes petty thieves and victims still she was right in her way by the time hed hit thirty slade had thought hed seen all there was to see he was constantly finding out there was more yeah i meet a lot of people he discarded again and again jessica plucked it up busted a few professional card sharks jessica sent him an innocent look really one was a greatlooking redhead he improvised ran a portable game in some of the best hotels in new york soft southern accent white hands and a marked deck experimentally he held a card to the light before he discarded it she went up for three years is that so jessica shook her head as she reached for the card gin come on jess theres no way apologetically she spread her cards there seems to be after a quick scan of her cards he swore okay thats it slade tossed in his hand figure up my losses im finished well lets see jessica chewed on the end of a pencil as she scanned the notepad dotted with numbers from previous hands you got caught with a bundle that time didnt you not bothering to wait for his reply she scribbled on the pad the way i figure it you owe me eight dollars and fiftyseven and a half cents setting down the pad she smiled at him lets just make it eight dollars and fiftyseven even youre all heart jess just pay up she held out a hand palm up unless you want to go for double or nothing not a chance slade reached into his pocket and drew out his wallet he tossed a ten onto the table i havent got any change you owe me a buck fortythree with a smirk jessica rose to retrieve her purse from the hall closet one dollar she said rummaging through her billfold as she came back into the parlor and twentyfive thirty fortythree she dropped the change into his hand then grinned were even not by a long shot slade grabbed her and gave her a long thorough kiss if youre going to fleece me he murmured gathering her hair in one hand the least you can do is make it worth my while seems reasonable she agreed as she offered her lips again god how he wanted her not just for a moment or a day or a year he thought as he lost himself in the taste of her for always forever all those terms he never allowed himself to think there was a wall between them the thin glass wall of status he forgot when she was in his arms he had no business feeling what he felt or asking what he wanted to ask but she was warm and soft and her lips moved willingly under his jess dont talk she wrapped her arms tighter around him just kiss me again her mouth clung to his smothering the words that begged to be said and the longer the kiss went on the thinner the wall between them became slade thought he could feel it crack then shatter without a sound jess he murmured again as he buried his face in her hair i want she jolted and slade swore when the doorbell rang ill get it she said no let betsy he held her another minute feeling the hammer of her heart against his chest more than willing jessica nodded when slade released her she sank into a chair its silly she began then michael walked into the parlor jessica ignoring slade michael went to her to take her hand youre so pale you should be in bed she smiled but couldnt prevent her fingers from tightening on his you know id go crazy if i stayed in bed i told you not to worry michael how could i help it he lifted her hand to brush his fingers over the knuckles especially with david muttering all afternoon about you not knowing how to take care of yourself that was she broke off casting a quick look at slade that was just a small disagreement we had im fine really you dont look fine you look exhausted frowning michael followed the direction of her gaze until he too looked at slade understanding was followed by anger resentment then weary acceptance she should be in bed he told slade curtly not entertaining guests slade shrugged as he eased himself into a chair its not my place to tell jess how to run her life and what exactly is your place michael please jessica cut off slades answer and rose hastily ill be going up soon i am tired with a silent plea she turned to slade ive kept you from your work too long you havent written all day no problem he pulled out a cigarette ill make it up this evening michael stood between them obviously not wanting to leave and knowing there was no point in staying ill go now he said at length if you promise to go up to bed yes i will michael she put her arms around him feeling the familiar trim build smelling the light seabreeze scent of his aftershave you and david mean so much to me i wish i could tell you david and i he said quietly and brushed a hand down her hair yes i know he cast slade a last look before he drew her away good night jessica good night michael slade waited until he heard the front door close what kind of disagreement did you have with david it was nothing to do with this it was personal nothings personal right now this was turning she fixed him with weary eyes but he saw the stubborn crease between her brows i have a right to some privacy slade i told you not to see either of them alone he reminded her book me she snapped dont tempt me he met her angry eyes directly and dont do it again yes sergeant on a disgusted sigh jessica dragged a hand through her hair im sorry dont apologize he told her briefly just do what youre told i think i will go up im tired she added not looking at slade good he didnt get up nor did he take his eyes off her get some sleep yes yes i will good night slade he listened to her go up the steps then tossed his cigarette into the fire and swore upstairs jessica filled the tub that was what she needed she told herself an aspirin for the headache a hot tub for the tension then she would sleep she had to sleep her body was crying for it for the first time in her life jessica felt the near weightlessness of true exhaustion she waited until the bathroom was steamy then lowered herself into the tub she knew she hadnt deceived slade jessica wasnt fool enough to believe that hed taken her excuse of being tired at face value he was just as cognizant of what was going on inside her head as she was the visit from michael had been the last straw in a day filled with unspoken fears and rippling tension nothing had happened she thought in frustration as she let the water lap over her how much longer would she have to wait another day a week two weeks on a long quiet sigh she shut her eyes jessica understood her own personality too well she would be lucky to get through the night much less another week of waiting and wondering take an hour at a time she advised herself it was seven oclock shed concentrate on getting through until eight at twenty past eight slade went systematically through the first floor checking locks hed waited throughout an unbearably long day for the phone call that would tell him his assignment was over silently he cursed interpol the fbi and dodson as far as he was concerned they were all equally to blame jessica wouldnt be able to take much more that had been made abundantly clear during michaels visit another thing had been made abundantly clear slade had found himself entirely too close to stepping over the last boundary if the doorbell hadnt rung he would have said things best left unsaid asked things he had no right to ask of a vulnerable woman she might have said yes would have said yes he corrected as he stepped past a snoring ulysses and would have regretted it he reflected when the situation changed and her life was back to normal what if he had asked her then theyd been married before shed had time to readjust a good way to mess up two lives slade he told himself it was better to make the break now draw back until they were just cop and assignment again at least she was upstairs resting not beside him tempting him to cross the line again when she wasnt there where he could see her touch her it was easier to keep things in perspective the servants were settled in their wing he could hear the low murmur of a television and the settling of boards after hed finished checking the locks hed go upstairs and write slade rubbed a hand over the back of his neck where the tension concentrated then hed sleep in his own bed alone as he walked toward the kitchen door slade saw the knob slowly turn muscles tensed he stepped back into the shadows and waited eightthirty jessica glanced at the clock again as she roamed her bedroom neither the bath nor the aspirin had relaxed her enough to bring sleep any closer if slade would come up she thought then shook her head she was becoming too dependent and that wasnt like her still she felt that her nerves would calm somewhat if she could just hear the sound of his typewriter an hour at a time she reminded herself glancing at the clock yet again well shed made it from seven to eight but she wasnt going to make it until nine giving up jessica started back downstairs if hes annoyed she mused shed just have to make the best of it being confined in the house was bad enough without restricting herself to her rooms shed almost be willing to fill out some more of those silly cards anything to keep her hands busy until her thoughts broke off as she came to the foot of the stairs for the second time the parlor doors were closed a tremor ran up her back urging her to turn around go to her room and pretend shed never left it shed taken the first step in retreat before she stopped herself hadnt she told slade not to tell her to run this was her home jessica reminded herself as she stepped forward whatever happened in it was hers to deal with taking a deep breath she opened the parlor doors and flicked on the light switch slade waited as the rear door opened quietly at first there was only a shadow but the build was familiar relaxing he stepped forward into the moonlight startled david whirled around and swore you scared the hell out of me david complained as he let the door swing shut behind him whatre you doing standing around in the dark just checking the locks slade said easily moving right in david muttered after turning on the lights he went over to the stove want some coffee he asked grudgingly thanks slade straddled a chair and waited for david to come out with whatever was on his mind the last report slade had received from brewster had put david in the clear his name and face and fingerprints had been run through the most sophisticated computers his every movement had been under surveillance for over a month david ryce was exactly what he seemed a young faintly defiant man who had a knack for figures and an affection for antiques he was also having what he thought was a discreet affair with a premed student slade recalled brewsters almost paternal amusement with davids infatuation though hed felt an initial twinge of guilt at keeping the knowledge of davids clean slate from jessica slade had decided she had enough trouble keeping herself under control better that she suspected both men than for her to be certain that michael adams was up to his neck in the smuggling operation michael jessica stared facing the truth and not wanting to believe it jessica he stood with pieces of the desk in his hand frantically searching for some viable excuse for his presence and his actions i didnt want to disturb you id hoped youd be asleep yes im sure you did with a quiet resigned sigh she shut the parlor doors at her back there was a problem with this piece michael began i wanted to please dont jessica crossed the room poured two fingers of brandy and drank it down i know about the smuggling michael she told him in a flat voice i know youve been using the shop smuggling really jessica i said dont she whirled sharply pushed by anger and despair i know michael and so do the police oh god as his color drained he looked around wildly was there anyplace left to run i want to know why her voice was low and steady you owe me that i was trapped he let the pieces of the desk fall to the floor then groped for a cigarette jessica i was trapped he promised you wouldnt be involved that youd never have to know you have to believe that id never have gotten you mixed up in this if thered been any choice choice she murmured thinking of slade we all have our choices michael what was yours in europe a couple of years ago i he took a greedy drag of his cigarette i lost some money a lot of money more than i had to lose and to the wrong person he sent her a swift pleading look he had me worked over you might remember when i took those extra two weeks in rome he drew in and expelled smoke quickly they were pros it was days before i could walk when he gave me an alternative to crippling me permanently i took it dragging a hand through his hair michael walked over to the bar he poured bourbon neat splattering drops then downed it in one swallow he knew who i was of course my family my connection with your shop your unimpeachable reputation the liquor gave him temporary strength his voice steadied it worked beautifully for him it wasnt for the money jessica i just wanted to stay alive and then i was in too deep she felt something soften inside her and quickly pushed it aside no pity she ordered herself he wouldnt drag pity from her now who is he michael no shaking his head he turned to face her i wont tell you that if he found out you had his name youd never be safe safe she laughed shortly if you were concerned for my safety you might have told me not to walk on the beach when someone was going to shoot at me shshoot good god jessica i didnt think hed he threatened but i never believed hed actually try to hurt you i would have done something his hand trembled spilling ash onto the carpet with a jerky movement of his arm michael tossed the cigarette into the fire i begged him not to involve you swore id do anything he wanted if hed leave you out of it i love you jessica dont talk about loving to me with more control than she was feeling jessica bent over to pick up one of the pieces he had dropped it was part of the inner molding whats in the desk michael diamonds he said and swallowed a quarter of a million if i dont take them to him tonight where she interrupted to the shop ten oclock let me see them she watched him separate one of the partitions of a cubbyhole from the space where a drawer had been lifting a thin piece of wood he revealed a false bottom he drew out a small padded bag its the last time he began clutching the bag in his palm ive already told him im through as soon as i deliver these im going to leave the country it is the last time jessica agreed then held out her hand but youre not delivering anything im taking the diamonds michael theyre going back where they came from and youre going to the police you might as well hold a gun to my head he swiped an unsteady hand over his mouth hell kill me jessica if he finds out i went to the police i wouldnt even be safe in a cell hell kill me and if he knows what youve done hell kill you too dont be a fool eyes glittering she grabbed the bag from his hand hell kill you anyway and me is he stupid enough not to know the police are closing in she demanded is he stupid enough to leave you alive as a liability think she ordered impatiently your only chance is with the police michael her words touched off a fear hed buried deep inside his mind michael had always known his involvement in the operation could only end one way that fear much more than money had kept him loyal not the police again his eyes darted around the room i have to get away dont you see jessica someplace where he wont find me let me have the diamonds i can use them no her hand tightened on the bag you used me no more for gods sake jessica do you want to see me dead his breathing was raw and jerky as the words tumbled out i dont have time to raise the money ill need if i leave now ill have a start she stared at him a thin film of sweat covered his face beading over lips that trembled his eyes were glazed with terror hed used her she thought but that didnt kill the feelings she had for him if he was determined to run shed give him what he wanted jessica crossed to a painting of a french landscape and swung it out on hidden hinges revealing a wall safe quickly she twirled the tumblers and opened it take this she offered michael a stack of bills its not worth what the diamonds are but cash should be safer in any case it wont take you far enough michael she said quietly as he reached for the money but you have to make your own decision theres only one i can make he slipped the bills inside his jacket then finally met her eyes im sorry jessica nodding she turned away she heard his footsteps as he crossed to the doors michael was david involved in this no david did nothing but take what he thought were routine orders he saw everything hed ever wanted everything hed ever cared about slipping through his hands jessica just go michael when you run you have to run fast she listened for the click of the doors before she opened the padded bag a cold sparkling stream of diamonds fell into her palm so this is what my lifes worth she murmured carefully she replaced them then stared at the remains of the queen anne desk all for a whim she whispered if she hadnt had that impulse to bring the desk home then with a fierce shake of her head jessica broke off the thought there were no ifs she needed to see slade but she needed a moment to herself first on a sigh she sank into a chair letting the bag of diamonds fall into her lap i guess jessica told you about this morning as the coffee heated on the stove david reached for cups slade lifted a brow what was this he wondered shouldnt she have he countered look i dont have anything against you i dont even know you david turned tossing back the hair that fell over his brow but jessies important to me when i saw her come out of your room this morning i didnt like it he measured the man across the room and knew he was outmatched i still dont like it slade watched the eyes behind the lenses so this was her private disagreement jessica had the loyalty she expected here he mused id say you dont have to like it slade said slowly but jess wouldnt feel that way uncomfortable under the direct stare david shifted a bit i dont want her to get hurt neither do i david frowned something about the way slade said it made him believe it shes a soft touch temper leaped into the gray eyes so quickly david nearly backed away when slade spoke the words were soft and deadly controlled im not interested in her money okay sorry relaxing a bit david shrugged its just that shes gotten stung before she trusts everybody shes really smart you know for a scatterbrain who forgets what shes doing because shes doing twenty things at once but with people jessica wears blinders the coffee began to boil over behind him david spun around and turned off the burner look forget i said anything she told me this morning it was none of my business and it isnt except that well i love her you know he mumbled hows she feeling shell be better soon boy i hope so he said fervently as he brought the coffee to the table i wouldnt want her to hear me say it but i could use her at the shop between getting the new stock checked in and michaels moodiness david grimaced and dumped milk into his coffee michael slade prompted casually yeah well i guess everybodys entitled to a few temper tantrums michael just never seems to have a temper at all he flashed slade a grin jessica would call it breeding maybe he has something on his mind david moved his shoulders absently before he drank still i havent seen him this unraveled since the mixup on the chippendale cabinet last year oh some wells slade mused took no priming at all it was my fault david went on but i didnt know hed bought it for a specific customer we do that sometimes but he always lets jessie or me know it was a beauty david remembered dark kingwood great marquetry decoration mrs leeman bought it the minute it was uncarted she was standing in the shop when the shipment came in took one look and wrote out a check michael got back from europe the day we were packing it for delivery and had a fit he said it had already been sold that hed had a cash advance david took a quick sip of his coffee discovered it was bitter and drank again resignedly the paperwork had been mislaid i guess he went on that was odd because jessies a fiend for keeping the invoices in order mrs leeman wasnt too pleased about the mixup either he recalled with a grin jessie sold her a side table at cost to soothe her feathers who bought it slade demanded what the cabinet david adjusted his glasses lord i dont know i dont think michael ever told me and with the mood he was in i didnt like to ask you have the receipt yeah sure puzzled david focused on him again at the shop why i have to go out slade rose swiftly and headed for the rear stairs dont go anywhere until i get back what are you david broke off as slade disappeared upstairs maybe he was a nut after all david mused as he frowned at slades empty chair youre having a casual conversation with a guy and all of a sudden hes make sure jess stays put slade ordered as he came down again his jacket was already zipped over his revolver stays put dont let anyone in the house slade paused long enough to aim hard direct eyes at david no one comes in got it something in the eyes had david nodding without question slade grabbed a napkin and scrawled a number on it if im not back in an hour call this number tell the man who answers the story about the cabinet hell understand the cabinet david stared dumbly at the napkin slade thrust into his hand i dont understand you dont have to just do it the back door slammed behind him yeah sure david grumbled why should i understand anything a loony tune he decided as he stuffed the napkin into his pocket maybe writers were supposed to be loony tunes jessica sure knew how to pick them with a glance at his watch he decided to check on her maybe the writer was a little loose upstairs maybe not but hed managed to unsettle him when david was halfway down the hall the parlor doors opened david jessica closed the distance between them at a run then launched herself into his arms hey what gives he managed to struggle out of her hold and take her by the shoulders is there a different strain of flu running around that affects the brain i love you david close to tears jessica framed his face with her hands he flushed and shifted his weight yeah i love you too look im sorry about this morning well talk about that later theres a lot i have to tell you but i need to see slade first he went out out her fingers dug into davids thin arms where i dont know intently he studied her face jessie youre really sick let me take you upstairs no david its important her voice changed from frantic to stern the one he always responded to you must have some idea where he went i dont he returned a bit indignantly we were sitting there talking one minute and he was up and heading out the next about what impatient jessica gave him a quick shake what were you talking about just this and that i mentioned that michaeld been moody like hed been when wed had that mixup on the chippendale cabinet last year the chippendale jessica pressed her hands to her cheeks oh god yes of course slade gave me some business about not letting anyone in the house and calling some number if he didnt get back in an hour hey where are you going jessica had swung her purse from the newel post and was rummaging through it hes gone to the shop to the shop and its nearly ten where are my keys call call the shop see if he answers in a quick move she dumped the contents of her purse on the floor call she repeated when david gaped at her okay take it easy while jessica made a frantic search through the items on the floor david dialed the phone i cant find them i cant theyre in my coat she remembered and dashed for the hall closet he doesnt answer david told her probably hasnt had time to get there yet if thats where he was going in the first place which doesnt make any sense because its closed and jessie where are you going he said you werent to go out damn it you forgot your coat will you wait a minute but she was already racing down the front steps toward her car chapter contents prev next it took slade only a few moments to pick the lock on the front door of the shop if there was one thing he was going to see to before he left he decided it would be to get jessica to a decent locksmith a miracle she hasnt been cleaned out he mused as he moved through the main shop into the back room blind luck slade concluded then tossed his jacket over a chair moving in the dark he passed through the kitchen into what served as an office there was a large mahogany desk with neat stacks of papers a blotter with names and numbers scribbled on it and a tiffany lamp slade switched it on he caught the boldly printed ulysses needs food on the blotter right beneath the scrawled new mop hndl betsy annoyed with a half grin slade shook his head jessicas idea of organization was beyond him turning away he walked to the file cabinet set in the rear corner the top drawer seemed to be her personal items he found a receipt for a blouse she had bought two years before in a file marked insurance policies shop between two file folders was a wrinkled grocery list on a sound of annoyance he pulled out the second drawer it was the other side of the coin the files were neat legible and in perfect order a quick flip through them showed slade they were receipts for the current year arranged chronologically delivery bills also current and chronological and business correspondence each section was a study in organized filing he thought of the top drawer and shook his head in the third drawer he found what he was looking for receipts from the previous year slade drew out the first file folder and took it to the desk methodically he scanned each one beginning in january he learned nothing else when he had completed the first quarters receipts other than the fact that jessica did a thriving business slade replaced the first folder and drew out the second time ticked away as he examined each paper he drew out a cigarette and worked patiently from month to month he found it in june one chippendale cabinet kingwood with marquetry decoration his brow rose slightly at the price not a bad deal i imagine he murmured noting the name of the purchaser he smiled everyone makes a tidy little profit after pocketing the receipt slade reached for the phone brewster might find davids little story very interesting before he had punched two numbers slade heard the sound of a car pulling up outside swiftly he turned out the light as he moved from the desk he drew out his gun jessica sped along the winding back road that led to her shop if shed had an ounce of sense she berated herself she would have told david to call the number slade had given him why hadnt she at least told him to keep calling the shop until he reached slade nervously she glanced at her watch ten oclock oh god if only the man coming to meet michael were late slade would be in the back room she concluded searching through the old receipts what would the man do when he got to the shop and found slade there instead of michael jessica pressed down harder on the gas and flew around a turn the beams of approaching headlights blinded her overreacting she swerved skidding the left rear wheel on the shoulder of the road heart in her throat she fishtailed spun on gravel then righted the car thats right she thought with her heart pumping wreck the car thatll do everybody a lot of good cursing herself jessica wiped a damp palm on her slacks dont think she ordered herself just drive its less than a mile now even as she said it the car sputtered then bucked frustrated jessica pressed down hard on the accelerator only to have the audi stall then die no infuriated she slammed both hands against the steering wheel the needle on the gas gauge stayed stubbornly on empty how many times she demanded how many times had she told herself to stop and fill up knowing it wasnt the time for selflectures she slammed out of the car leaving it in the middle of the road lights beaming she started to run slade stood pressed behind the doorway that led to the back room he heard the quiet click of the doorknob then the cheery jingle of bells he waited listening to the soft footsteps and gentle breathing then there was a coldly patient sigh dont be childish michael it hardly pays to hide when you leave a car out front in plain view and you should know he added softly theres no place you can hide from me slade hit the overhead lights as he turned into the room chambers isnt it he said mildly with the fetish for snuffboxes he leveled the gun were closed with no change of expression chambers removed his hat youre the stockboy arent you he gave a wheezy chuckle how foolish of michael to send you but then he hasnt the stomach for violence i dont have that problem rippeons in the morgue when chambers gave him a pleasantly blank look slade continued or dont you catch the names of the pros you hire death is an occupational hazard chambers said with an elegant shrug he never bothered to glance at the gun leveled at his chest he knew a man was the real weapon so he watched slades eyes what has michael promised you mr sergeant slade corrected sladerman nypd temporarily attached to the fbi slade caught the faint flicker in chambers eyes the only deal i have with adams is a quiet talk in the near future involving jessica winslow the thought gave slade a moments grim pleasure games up chambers weve had adams under surveillance for some time along with a few other members of your team you were all that was missing a slight miscalculation on my part chambers murmured as he glanced around the shop normally i dont involve myself directly with any of the transports but then miss winslow has such a charming shop i couldnt resist a pity he looked back at slade again you dont look to be the type wholl take a bribe even a lucrative one you seem to be a good judge of character keeping the gun steady slade reached for the phone on the counter with the breath tearing in her lungs jessica dashed the last yards toward the shop she could see the lights glowing behind the drawn shades her thoughts centered solely on slade she hit the door at a full run at a speed unexpected in a man of his bulk chambers grabbed her the moment she stumbled inside his arms slid around her throat before fear could register jessica felt cold steel against her temple slades forward motion stopped with a jerk put down your gun sergeant it seems the game isnt quite over after all when slade hesitated chambers merely smiled i assure you though the gun is small it works very well and at this range he trailed off delicately casting a furious look into jessicas stunned eyes slade let the gun drop okay he held up empty hands let her go chambers gave him a mild smile oh i dont think so it seems i need an insurance policy momentarily mr chambers jessica put a hand to the arm that was constricting her air the sergeant doesnt appreciate your timing miss winslow he said pleasantly however i do very much this shall we say puts a different aspect on things slade shot a quick glance at the clock on his right by his calculations david should be calling his contact within moments the name of the game now was stall you wont have to put a bullet in her he commented if you keep choking her oh i beg your pardon chambers loosened his hold fractionally the gun stayed lodged at her temple greedy for air jessica gasped it in a beautiful creature isnt she he asked slade i often wished i were twenty years younger such a woman looks her best on a mans arm dont you agree mr chambers what are you doing here this time of night it was a weak ploy but the best jessica could think of let me go and put that thing away oh my dear we all know i cant do that i would like to for your sake he continued as jessica too shifted her eyes to the clock how much time do we have she wondered frantically she could be useful to you slade commented youll need a shield to get out of this i have my escape routes plotted sergeant he smiled i always leave a back door open you cant expect to get away mr chambers jessicas eyes met slades then shifted meaningfully to the clock slade must have told you that the police know everything he mentioned it keeping his arm firm he patted her shoulder you became a small weakness of mine i enjoyed those pleasant chats we had those pleasant cups of tea i felt badly that this was to be my last shipment before moving on oh yes he said to slade i was aware the authorities were getting close though i confess i miscalculated just how close and though it would seem the diamonds are temporarily lost ill find michael eventually he doesnt have them jessica said quickly then grabbed chambers arm as it cut off her breath again no the word was soft and silky even as slade anticipated moving forward chambers shot him a warning look where are they jessica swallowed straining to hear the sound of sirens why dont they come ill show you perhaps she could bargain for slades life if she could keep him alive then get chambers out of the shop even for a little while oh no that wont do he tightened his grip again tell me no jessica managed to whisper the word ill take you without speaking chambers took the gun from her temple and aimed it at slade no dont i have them at home she said frantically i have them in the wall safe in the parlor dont hurt him please ill give you the combination thirtyfive to the right twelve to the left five right and left to twentythree theyre all there i wouldnt let michael take them honest chambers commented and trusting i am fond of you my dear so i suggest you close your eyes when it comes to your turn i promise to make it as painless as possible even as slade made his move jessica screamed in protest no using all of her weight and the adrenaline of terror she flung herself on the arm holding the gun she heard the shot echoing in her head as she stumbled then was shoved roughly aside jessica landed in a heap she felt the pain in her shoulder as it connected with the floor tasted the iron flavor of blood or fear in her mouth as she scrambled up as she pushed the hair out of her eyes she saw slades fist fly toward chambers face the portly man seemed to crumble layer by layer on his way to the floor so quickly she thought numbly it was all over so quickly one moment they were both at the edge of their lives and then it was over shed never take her life for granted again not a second of it weakly she leaned back against a highboy slade get me some rope or cord from the back room you idiot she pressed her fingers between her brows and stifled a hysterical giggle so much for romantic endings she thought as she stumbled blindly toward the storeroom blinking away the haze that covered her eyes jessica found some packing cord she stared at it a moment losing track of why she needed it will you hurry up slade shouted at her responding automatically she brought it out to him tenfifteen she thought as she passed the clock how could it only be tenfifteen could people come so close to death and escape all in ten minutes slade ripped the cord out of her hand without looking up damn it jess of all the stupid things to do what the hell do you mean by bursting in here like that you know you werent to leave the house binding the unconscious chambers slade let out a steady stream of curses michael told me ten oclock she murmured and i thought if youd had a thought in your head you would have stayed put like you were told what did you think you could do racing out here like this damn it i had him before you came barrelling through the door thats not even enough for you he secured the knot then pushed passed her on the way to the phone then you throw yourself on the gun he wrenched off the receiver and started to dial you couldve been shot yes in dumb fascination jessica stared down at the stain spreading on the arm of her sweater i think i was what annoyed he turned back to her then dropped the phone out of suddenly nerveless hands oh my god in two strides he was back beside her ripping the arm of the sweater off by the seam jess youre hit brows lowered in concentration she stared at the wound yes i am she said in the deliberately steady voice of a drunk i dont feel it should it hurt theres a lot of blood shut up damn it just shut up he examined the wound quickly seeing that the bullet had gone cleanly through the flesh jesss flesh he thought his stomach rolled he stripped off his shirt and tore it into a tourniquet stupid fool youre lucky it wasnt your head his hands trembled causing him to fumble with the knot and curse her more violently it was a little gun she managed he shot her a look ripe with conflicting emotions but her vision was blurred a bullets a bullet he muttered feeling the warmth of her blood on his hands he swallowed a line of sweat ran down his naked back damn it jess what were you trying to do jumping out that way i knew what i was doing terribly sorry her head lolled a bit as she tilted it back and tried to focus on him how rude of me to intercept a bullet with your name on it dont get cute now he said between his teeth if you werent bleeding i swear id deck you he wanted to hold her and was terrified shed dissolve in his arms his throat was dry from the rawness of his own breathing as he forced himself to treat her arm as an object not part of her when hed finished binding the wound slade held her steady with one hand you probably saw that move on one of your stupid movies is that why you threw yourself at the gun no she felt as if she were floating as he started to lead her to a chair actually sergeant it was because i thought he would kill you since im in love with you i couldnt allow that he stopped dead at her words and stared down at her when he opened his mouth to speak he found he couldnt form a sound much less a word his hand dropped away from her uninjured arm im really sorry jessica said in a thick voice but i think im going to faint the last thing she heard over the buzzing in her head was a stream of curses jessica floated toward consciousness to a blur of white she felt as though her body were drifting apart from her mind even the steady throb in her shoulder seemed separate from her the white dimmed to gray then gradually lightened again until she focused on what was a wall perplexed she stared at it with an interest dulled by medication she shifted her gaze all the walls were white she noted there were horizontal blinds at the window that showed hints of night between their slants the blinds were white too as was the bandage around the arm that didnt feel like part of her she remembered letting out a sigh she focused on a blue plastic pitcher and a clear plastic glass hospital she thought with an absent grimace she hated hospitals a face bent over her obscuring her line of vision amber eyes studied pale blue they were nice enough eyes she decided in a round smooth face with a hint of jowl she spotted the white coat and stethoscope doctor she said in a whispery voice that made her frown miss winslow how are you feeling she thought about it seriously for a moment like ive been shot he gave a pleasant chuckle as he took her pulse a sensible answer he concluded youll do how long she moistened dry lips and tried again how long have i been here just over an hour taking out a slim flashlight he aimed the beam at her right eye then her left it feels like days the medication makes you sluggish any pain just a throb it doesnt feel like my arm he smiled and patted her hand its yours slade wheres slade his brow creased then cleared the sergeant hes spent most of his time pacing the corridors like a madman he wouldnt wait in the lounge when i ordered him to hes better at giving orders jessica lifted her head off the pillow letting it fall back again when the room whirled around lie still he told her firmly youll be spending a little time with us the line appeared between her brows i dont like hospitals he only patted her hand again a pity let me see slade she demanded in the best authoritative voice she could muster her eyelids threatened to droop and she forced them open please she added i dont think you take orders any better than he does no she managed a smile i dont ill let him come in a few minutes only then he thought as he studied her eyes youll sleep for the next twentyfour hours thanks with an absent nod he murmured something to the nurse who entered slade paced up and down the hospital corridor dozens of thoughts dozens of fears raced through his mind a headache pulsed behind his right temple shed been so pale no it was just shock shed be fine shed been unconscious through the ambulance ride it was better that way she might have been in pain god where was the doctor if anything happened to her his stomach convulsed again swallowing slade forced the muscles to relax turned fear to anger the headache spread to the back of his neck if they didnt let him see her soon he was going to sergeant whirling slade caught the doctor by the lapel of his coat jess how is she i want to see her now can i take her home well versed in dealing with frantic spouses parents and lovers the doctor spoke calmly without bothering to struggle out of the hold shes awake he said simply why dont we sit down slades fingers tightened why because ive been on my feet since eight oclock this morning with a sigh he decided it was best to treat this one standing up miss winslow is as well as can be expected what the hell does that mean exactly what it says the doctor returned evenly you did a good job of emergency first aid as to your second question you can see her in a moment and no you cant take her home does she have any family slade felt the color drain from his face family what do you mean family the wound wasnt that bad the bullet went clean through i had her here inside a half hour you did very well the doctor told him i simply want to keep her here for a few days under observation i need to know who to notify observation terrifying visions ran through his mind whats wrong with her to put it simply exhaustion and shock would you like more complicated medical terms shaking his head slade released him and turned away no he rubbed his hands over his face thats all it is then shes going to be all right with rest and care now her family there isnt anyone for lack of something to do with his hands slade stuck them in his pockets a sensation of utter helplessness covered him sapping the strength that tension and anger had given him ill take the responsibility i know this is a police matter sergeant but what exactly is your relationship to miss winslow slade gave a short laugh baby sitter he muttered ill take the responsibility he repeated with more force call commissioner dodson nypd hell verify it turning back he fixed the doctor with a steady look i want to see her now jessica was watching the door when slade opened it her lips curved i knew youd find a way to get past the guards can you bust me out of this place keeping his hands in his pockets he crossed to her she was as white as the sheets she lay on only her eyes gave a hint of color he thought of the first day he had seen her vibrant rushing a feeling of total inadequacy swept over him so that the hands in his pockets balled into fists how do you feel i told the doctor i felt like id been shot gingerly she touched the bandaged arm actually i feel like ive drunk a half dozen martinis and fallen off a cliff she sighed closing her eyes briefly youre not going to get me out of here are you no i didnt think so resigned she opened her eyes again to stare at the blue plastic pitcher slade i lied about the diamonds i tossed them under the seat in my car its in the middle of the road on the way to the shop i forgot to get gas she looked at him then its not even locked and jessica moistened her lips when he remained silent i gave michael money to get away thats accessory after the fact or something isnt it i suppose im in trouble ill take care of it even through her drugged haze she felt surprise arent you going to shout at me no fighting to keep her eyes open jessica laughed ill have to get shot more often she held out a hand not noticing his hesitation to take it david wasnt involved michael told me everything david had no idea what was going on i know it seems i was half right she murmured jess her hand felt so fragile im sorry what for jessica found that it took much too much effort to keep her eyes open the world was soft and gray when she closed them she thought she felt his fingers lace with hers but couldnt be sure you didnt do anything no slade looked down at her hand it was limp now he had only to release it for it to fall back on the bed thats what im sorry for its all over now isnt it slade her breathing was deep and even before he answered its all over now jess bending he pressed his lips to hers then walked away chapter contents prev next slade banked down the uncomfortable sensation of deja vu as he waited in the commissioners outer office his scowl was a bit more pronounced than it had been the first time he had sat there three weeks had passed since he had left jessicas bedside hed gone directly back to her home on leaving the hospital there hed had to deal with a puzzled then furious then frantic david shot what do you mean shot slade could still visualize the pale strained look on davids face still hear the trembling angry words if youre a cop why didnt you protect her hed had no answer for that slade had gone up to pack even as david had dialed the number of the hospital then hed driven home taking the miles to new york in a numbed weariness slade had told himself to cross jessica off as he crossed off what he considered the final assignment in his police career shed get the care and the rest she needed when she was ready to go home the nightmare would be behind her and so he told himself would he then fatigue the bonedeep exhaustion that comes after a long intense period of tension did the rest for him he collapsed into bed and slept around the clock but she had been the first thing in his mind when he woke hed called the hospital daily telling himself he was just tying up loose ends the reports were always the same resting comfortably there were days when slade had to fight the urge to get into his car and go back to her then she was released he told himself that was the end of it slade had plunged into an orgy of work the novel was finished in a marathon sixteenhour stint while he kept his door locked and his phone off the hook with his resignation turned in there were only a few necessary visits to the station house more loose ends he signed his contract and mailed his agent a copy of his second novel the reports and debriefings on the smuggling case brought jessica back too vividly slade filled out his papers and answered questions with a brevity that bordered on curtness he took the professional praise for his work in stony silence he wanted it over completed he reminded himself that his life was his own for the first time in thirtythree years but she wouldnt leave him alone she was there at night when he lay awake and restless she was there in the afternoon when he poured his concentration into the outline of his next novel she was there always there whether he walked the streets alone or surrounded himself with people he could see her on the beach laughing the wind grabbing at her hair as she tossed driftwood for the dog to chase he could see her in the kitchen of the shop slicing sandwiches while the sun dappled over her skin though he tried to block it out he could hear the way she murmured his name when she lay in his arms soft and warm and eager then he would see her white and unconscious and her blood was on his hands the guilt would overwhelm him until he threw himself into work again using the characters he developed to dilute her memory but they all seemed to have pieces of her a gesture a phrase an expression how could he escape someone who seemed to know where he would run how fast and how far now sitting again in dodsons outer office slade told himself this would be the end of it hed known all along that dodson would want a personal meeting once it was done all ties would be severed sergeant he glanced up at the secretary oblivious this time to the slow inviting smile she sent him without a word he rose to follow her into dodsons office slade dodson leaned back in his chair as slade entered then gave his secretary a brief nod no calls he ordered have a seat silently slade obeyed while the commissioner sucked pleasurably on a cigar until the tip glowed smoke wafted to the ceiling in a spiraling column which dodson watched with apparent fascination so congratulations are in order when slade gave him nothing but the same silent stare dodson continued on your book he said absently he fingered his small scrolled tie pin were sorry to lose you saying nothing slade waited for the pleasantries to be over in any event dodson leaned forward to tap his cigar ash your last case is wrapped up by all accounts tightly i dont doubt well get a conviction youre aware that michael adams had made a full confession he sent slade an arch look and got no reply the domino theory seems to be working very well in this case one name leads to another as far as chambers himself goes weve got enough on him to put him away conspiracy to commit murder accessory to murder attempted murder perhaps murder one on that business in paris not to mention the robberies and smuggling no dodson regarded the tip of his cigar with interest i dont think we need worry about him for quite some time he waited for a full thirty seconds then went on as if he were engaged in a twoway conversation youll give your evidence naturally when the time comes but it shouldnt interfere too much with your new career stubborn young fool he thought as he puffed on his cigar he decided to test the younger mans iron control by saying a name jessica told me she gave michael several thousand dollars to aid in his escape watching for a reaction he caught the faintest flicker in slades eyes here then gone it was all he needed to confirm the notion that had seeded in his mind when he had seen his goddaughter she felt that made her an accessory strange michael never mentioned her giving him any money and i spoke with him myself theres a rumor that you saw him too right after he was brought in dodson let the sentence trail off suggestively when slade didnt rise to the bait dodson went on undaunted hed cracked a few tough eggs in his own career on the street and behind a desk i imagine a few choice words were sufficient to keep michael quiet and of course jessica can afford to lose a few thousand we might have a bit of trouble keeping her quiet though he smiled that conscience of hers you know how is she the words were out before slade could stop them though he swore under his breath dodson gave no sign of hearing shes looking very well he swiveled gently in his chair ill tell you slade i was shaken when i visited her in the hospital ive never known jessica to be ill in her life and well it was quite a shock slade pulled out a cigarette lighting a match with sharp controlled violence shes bounced back the commissioner continued pleased with the reaction drove the doctor crazy until hed let her out then she went right back to work that shop of hers he gave slade a quick grin i dont suppose the notoriety will do her business any harm noting the tension in the set of slades shoulders dodson paused long enough to tap out his cigar she speaks very highly of you really slade expelled a long stream of smoke my assignment was to keep her safe i did a remarkably poor job of it she is safe dodson corrected and as stubborn as ever david and i both tried to persuade her to go to europe take a little time off to get her bearings she wont hear of it he settled back in his chair as a faint smile flickered on his lips says shes going to stay put slades eyes flew from the view out the window to pin dodsons emotions smoldered in them fiercely quickly then were suppressed hard to believe he managed she never did before so she tells me dodson steeped his fingers shes given me a full report with a great many details you omitted from yours apparently dodson commented as slade narrowed his eyes you had your hands full full enough slade returned dodson pursed his lips in speculation or agreement slade couldnt tell jessica seems to think she handled the entire business badly she handled it too well slade disagreed in a mutter if shed fallen apart i could have gotten her out yes well differing points of view of course dodsons gaze fell on the tripleframed photos of his wife and children hed had a few differing points of view with that lady from time to time he remembered the look in jessicas eyes when shed asked for slade of course now that its over he ventured im not entirely sure she wont fall apart delayed reaction slade smothered the instant urge to protect and prevent shell get through the aftermath all right therere enough people in that house to take care of her dodson laughed thats usually the other way around half the time jessica serves her staff of course betsy will cluck around her for a time until jessicas ready to scream and of course jessica wont betsys been with her for twenty years then theres the cook shes been there nearly as long makes great biscuits he paused reminiscently i guess it was about three years ago that jessica picked up all her medical bills when she had a stroke i suppose you saw old joe the gardener slade grunted crushing out his cigarette he must be ninety years old ninetytwo if memory serves me she doesnt have the heart to let him go so she hires a young boy during the summer to do the heavy work the little maid carol is the daughter of her fathers chauffeur jessica took her on when the girls father died thats jessica he sighed gustily loyal her loyaltys one of her most endearing traits and one of her most frustrating now dodson concluded was the time to drop the bomb shes hired a lawyer for michael this time the reaction was fast and furious she did what while he lifted his hands palms up in a gesture of helplessness dodson struggled with a smile she tells me she feels its her responsibility just how does she come by that slade demanded his control deserted him so that he sprang up and paced the office if he hadnt been working for her he wouldnt have gotten tangled up in this mess dodson shrugged you know how her mind works as well as i do yeah when it works at all adams is the one who got her involved hes responsible for everything that happened to her she was nearly killed twice because he didnt have the spine to protect her yes dodson agreed quietly hes responsible the emphasis on the pronoun was slight but full of meaning slade turned back at that dodson met his eyes with a look that was too understanding and too knowledgeable he thought slade looked like his father for a moment impulsive emotional hotheaded but tom dodson mused would never have been able to struggle with such turbulent feelings and win slade turned away from him again if she wants to hire a lawyer for him he murmured thats her business its got nothing to do with me no look commissioner on a spurt of fury slade whirled around i took the assignment i finished the assignment ive written my report and been debriefed ive also turned in my resignation im finished lets see how long you can convince yourself of that dodson mused smiling he extended his hand yes as i said were sorry to lose you the air smelled of snow when slade climbed out of his car he glanced up at the sky no moon no stars there was a keen night wind that made low howling noises through the naked trees he shifted his gaze to the house lights glowed here and there in the parlor in jessicas bedroom even as he watched the upstairs light winked out maybe shes gone to bed he thought hunching his shoulders against the cold i should go i shouldnt even be here even as he told himself so he walked up the steps to the front door he told himself he should turn around get back in the car and drive away he cursed whatever demon had prompted him to make the trip in the first place he lifted his hand to knock before slades fist connected with the wood the door flew open he heard jessicas breezy laugh felt the quick brush of fur against his legs then caught her as she raced out after ulysses and collided with his chest everything everything he had tried to forget came back to him in that one instant the feel of her the scent the taste of her skin under his lips then jessica tilted back her head and looked him fully in the face her eyes were bright and alive her skin flushed with laughter as he stood tense her lips curved for him in a smile that made his legs weak hello slade im sorry we almost knocked you flat her words were truer than she knew he thought quickly he released her and took a step back youre going out just for a run with ulysses jessica looked beyond his shoulder and hes gone now looking back at slade jessica offered her hand its good to see you come in and have a drink warily slade stepped inside but evaded the offered hand she turned away to fling her jacket over the newel post shutting her eyes tightly a moment when her back was to him lets go in the parlor she said brightly when she faced him again theres a nice fire in there without waiting for his answer jessica dashed away she was moving slade observed at her usual speed and the shadows were gone from under her eyes gone as if they had never existed she was as she had been in the beginning a woman with boundless energy he followed her more slowly into the parlor she was already pouring scotch into a glass im so glad you came the house is too quiet jessica picked up a decanter of vermouth with no idea what was inside as she poured she continued to talk it was wonderful for a few days but now i almost regret that i sent everyone away of course i had to lie to get them out of here youre talking too fast too fast she told herself but couldnt stop i told david and the staff i was going to jamaica to lie in the sun for a week then i bought them all airline tickets and shoved them out of the house you shouldnt be alone he was frowning at her when she handed him his drink why not with a laugh jessica tossed back her hair i couldnt stand being treated like an invalid i got enough of that in the hospital sipping her drink she turned to the fire she wouldnt let him see the hurt every day that shed been confined in that sterile white room she had waited for his call watched the door for his visit nothing hed cut himself out of her life when shed been too weak to prevent it slade stared at her slim straight back and wondered how he could leave without touching her how are you the question was curt and brief jessicas fingers tightened on her glass do you care she wondered she sipped the vermouth making the words slip back down her throat turning she smiled at him how do i look he stared at her until the need was a hard ball in his stomach you need to gain some weight she laughed shortly thank you very much needing to do something jessica wandered over to toy with the keys of the piano did you finish your book yes then everythings going well for you everythings going just dandy he drank willing the liquor to dull the ache your mother liked the figure confused he drew his brows together oh yeah yeah she liked it they lapsed into silence accented by the crackling wood and drifting notes there was too much to say slade thought and nothing to say again he cursed himself for not being strong enough to stay away youve gone back to work he asked yes weve had a stream of customers since the publicity i suppose itll taper off have you resigned from the force yes silence fell again more thickly jessica stared down at the piano keys as if she were about to compose a symphony youd want to tie up loose ends wouldnt you she murmured am i a loose end slade something like that he muttered her head came up at that and her eyes fixed on his once searingly turning away she walked to the window well then she whispered with her finger she drew a maze on the glass i think ive told every proper authority every proper thing there was a steady stream of men in dark suits in my hospital room she dropped her hand to her side why didnt you come to see me or call her voice steadied as she stared at the reflection of the lamp in the window shouldnt there have been a final interview for your report or is that why you came tonight i dont know why the hell i came he tossed back then slammed down his empty glass i didnt come to see you because i didnt want to see you i didnt call because i didnt want to talk to you well that certainly clears that up he took a step toward her stopped himself then thrust his hands in his pockets hows your arm its fine absently she reached up to touch the wound that had healed while she thought of the one that hadnt the doctor says i wont even have a scar great thats just great slade pulled out a pack of cigarettes then tossed it on a table i like the idea jessica returned calmly im not fond of scars did you mean what you said it rushed out of him before he could think to prevent it about the scar no not about the damn scar frustrated he dragged a hand through his hair i try to mean what i say she murmured her heart was in her throat now so that she forced herself to say each word carefully you said you were in love with me every muscle in his body tensed did you mean it taking a deep breath jessica turned back to him her face was composed her eyes calm yes i meant it its your warped sense of gratitude he told her then paced to the fire and back again something began to warm in her jessica felt simultaneous sensations of relief and amusement i think i could tell the difference she considered sometimes im very grateful to the butcher for a good cut of meat but i havent fallen in love with him yet oh youre funny slade shot her a furious glance dont you see it was just circumstance just the situation was it jessica smiled as she crossed to him slade backed away i dont want any part of you he told her heatedly i want you to understand that i think i understand she lifted a hand to his cheek i think i understand very well he caught her wrist but couldnt force himself to toss it aside do you know how i felt having you unconscious your blood on my hands do you know what it did to me seeing you in that hospital bed ive seen corpses with more color she felt his fingers tremble lightly before they dropped her wrist damn it jess he breathed before he spun away to pour himself another drink slade jessica wrapped her arms around his waist why hadnt she thought of that she demanded of herself why hadnt she realized that he would blame himself i was the one who was in the wrong place at the wrong time dont he put his hands on hers firmly pushing them away ivegot nothing for you cant you understand nothing different poles jess we barely speak the same language if he had faced her he would have seen the line form between her brows i dont know what youre talking about look at this place he gestured around the room as he whirled to her where you live how you live its got nothing to do with me oh pursing her lips she considered i see youre a snob damn you cant you see anything infuriated he grabbed her shoulders i dont want you try again she suggested he opened his mouth then relieved his frustration by shaking her youve no right no right to get inside my head this way i want you out once and for all i want you out slade she said quietly why dont you stop hating it so much and give in im not going anywhere how his hands found their way into her hair he didnt know but they were sunk deep and so was he struggling all the way he gave in i love you damn it id like to choke you for it his eyes grew dark and stormy you worked on me he accused as she gazed up at him calm and composed right from the beginning you worked on me until i cant function without you for gods sake i could smell you down at the station house pushed as much by fury as by need he dragged her into his arms i thought id go mad unless i could taste you again his lips covered hers not gently but then jessica wasnt looking for gentleness here was the hard bruising contact she had longed to feel again her response came in an explosion of heart body and mind so that her demand met his and fulminated they clung for one long shimmering instant then they were tangled together on the hearth rug i need you the words shuddered from him as two pairs of hands struggled with clothes now he found her naked breast and groaned its been so long too long words were no longer possible beside them the fire sizzled new flames licking at wood wind rattled at the windows they heard nothing felt nothing but each other lips sought then devoured hands explored then possessed there was no time for a slow reacquaintance hungry they came together swiftly letting sharp pleasure cleanse all doubts they remained close body to body and mouth to mouth until need drifted to contentment jessica held him against her when he would have shifted to her side no dont move she murmured im crushing you only a little slade lifted his head to grin at her and found himself lost in the cloudy amber of her eyes slowly he traced the slanted line of her cheekbone i love you jess still angry about it she asked before he buried his face at her throat she caught the grin resigned on a small gasp she punched his shoulder resigned huh thats very flattering well let me tell you i didnt picture myself falling in love with a badtempered excop who tries to order me around that musky woodsy fragrance of her skin distracted him he began to nuzzle at her neck wallowing in it who did you picture yourself falling in love with a cross between albert schweitzer and clark gable she told him slade gave a snort before raising his head again yeah well you came close are you going to marry me jessica lifted a brow do i have a choice bending he nibbled on her lips arent you the one who says a person always has a choice mmm so i am she pulled him closer for one long satisfying kiss i suppose we both have one to make dont we their eyes met then they spoke together you
