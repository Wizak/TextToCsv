 death by ecstacy the warriors im sure they saw us coming the alien technologies officer persisted do you see that ring sir the silvery image of the enemy ship almost filled the viewer it showed as a broad wide ring encircling a cylindrical axis like a mechanical pencil floating inside aplatinum bracelet a finned craft projected from the pointed end of the axial section angular letters ran down the axis totally unlike the dotsandcommas of kzinti script of course i see it said the captain it was rotating when we first picked them up it stopped when we got within two hundred thousand miles and it hasnt moved since the captain flicked his tail back and forth gently thoughtfully like a pink lash you worry me he commented if they know were here why havent they tried to get away are they so sure they can beat us he whirled to face the at officer should we be running no sir i dont know why theyre still here but they cant have anything to be confident about thats one of the most primitive spacecraft ive ever seen he moved his claw about on the screen pointing as he talked the outer shell is an iron alloy the rotating ring is a method of simulating gravity by using centripetal force so they dont have the gravity planer in fact theyre probably using a reaction drive the captains catlike ears went up but were lightyears from the nearest star they must have a better reaction drive than we ever developed we had the gravity planer before we needed one that good there was a buzzing sound from the big control board enter said the captain the weapons officer fell up through the entrance hatch and came to attention sir we have all weapons trained on the enemy good the captain swung around at how sure are you that they arent a threat to us the at officer bared sharply pointed teeth i dont see how they could be sir good weapons keep all your guns ready to fire but dont use them unless i give the order ill have the ears of the man who destroys that ship without orders i want to take it intact yes sir wheres the telepath hes on his way sir he was asleep hes always asleep tell him to get his tail up here the weapons officer saluted turned and dropped through the exit hole captain the at officer was standing by the viewer which now showed the ringed end of the alien ship he pointed to the mirrorbright end of the axial cylinder it looks like that end was designed to project light that would make it a photon drive sir the captain considered could it be a signal device urrrrr yes sir then dont jump to conclusions like a piece of toast the telepath popped up through the entrance hatch he came to exaggerated attention reporting as ordered sir you omitted to buzz for entrance sorry sir the lighted viewscreen caught the telepaths eye and he padded over for a better look forgetting that he was at attention the at officer winced wishing he were somewhere else the telepaths eyes were violet around the edges his pink tail hung limp as usual he looked as if he were dying for lack of sleep his fur was flattened along the side he slept on he hadnt even bothered to brush it the effect was as far from the ideal of a conquest warrior as one can get and still be a member of the kzinti species the wonder was that the captain had not yet murdered him he never would of course telepaths were too rare too valuable and understandably too emotionally unstable the captain always kept his temper with the telepath at times like this it was the innocent bystander who stood to lose his rank or his ears at the clank of a falling molecule thats an enemy ship weve tracked down the captain was saying wed like to get some information from them would you read their minds for us yes sir the telepaths voice showed his instant misery but he knew better than to protest he left the screen and sank into a chair slowly his ears folded into tight knots his pupils contracted and his ratlike tail went limp as flannel the world of the eleventh sense pushed in on him he caught the captains thought sloppy civilian get of a sthondat and frantically tuned it out he hated the captains mind he found other minds aboard ship isolated and blanked them out one by one now there were none left there was only unconsciousness and chaos chaos was not empty something was thinking strange and disturbing thoughts the telepath forced himself to listen steve weaver floated bonelessly near a wall of the radio room he was blond blueeyed and big and he could often be seen as he was now relaxed but completely motionless as if there were some very good reason why he shouldnt even blink a streamer of smoke drifted from his left hand and crossed the room to bury itself in the air vent thats that ann harrison said wearily she flicked four switches in the bank of radio controls at each click a small light went out you cant get them right ill bet they dont even have a radio ann released her chair net and stretched out into a fivepointed star ive left the receiver on with the volume up in case they try to get us later man that feels good abruptly she curled into a tight ball she had been crouched at the communications bank for more than an hour ann might have been steves twin she was almost as tall as he was had the same color hair and eyes and the flat muscles of conscientious exercise showed beneath her blue falling jumper as she flexed steve snapped his cigarette butt at the air conditioner moving only his fingers okay what have they got ann looked startled i dont know think of it as a puzzle they dont have a radio how might they talk to each other how can we check on our guesses we assume theyre trying to reach us of course yes of course think about it ann get tim thinking about it too jim davis was her husband that year and the ships doctor full time youre the girl most likely to succeed have a smog stick please steve pushed his cigarette ration across the room take a few ive got to go the depleted package came whizzing back thanks said ann let me know if anything happens will you or if you think of anything i will and fear not steve somethings bound to turn up they must be trying just as hard as we are every compartment in the personnel ring opened into the narrow doughnutshaped hall which ran round the rings forward rim steve pushed himself into the hall jockeyed to contact the floor and pushed from there it was easy going the floor curved up to meet him and he proceeded down the hall like a swimming frog of the twelve men and woman on the angels pencil steve was best at this for steve was a belter and the others were all flatlanders earthborn ann probably wouldnt think of anything he guessed it wasnt that she wasnt intelligent she didnt have the curiosity the sheer love of solving puzzles only he and jim davis he was going too fast and not concentrating he almost crashed into sue bhang as she appeared below the curve of the ceiling they managed to stop themselves against the walls hi jaywalker said sue hi sue where you headed radio room you i thought id check the drive systems again not that were likely to need the drive but it cant hurt to be certain youd go twitchy without something to do wouldnt you she cocked her head to one side as always when she had questions steve when are you going to rotate us again i cant seem to get used to falling but she looked like shed been born falling he thought her small slender form was meant for flying gravity should never have touched her when im sure we wont need the drive we might as well stay ready til then besides im hoping youll change back to a skirt she laughed pleased then you can turn it off im not changing and we wont be moving abel says the other ship did two hundred gee when it matched courses with us how many can the angels pencil do steve looked awed just point zero five and i was thinking of chasing them well maybe we can be the ones to open communications i just came from the radio room by the way ann cant get anything too bad well just have to wait steve youre always so impatient do belters always move at a run come here she took a handhold and pulled him over to one of the thick windows which lined the forward side of the corridor there they are she said pointing out the star was both duller and larger than those around it among points which glowed arclamp bluewhite with the doppler shift the alien ship showed as a dull red disk i looked at it through the telescope said steve there are lumps and ridges all over it and theres a circle of green dots and commas painted on one side looked like writing how long have we been waiting to meet them five hundred thousand years well there they are relax they wont go away sue gazed out the window her whole attention on the dull red circle her gleaming jet hair floating out around her head the first aliens i wonder what theyll be like its anyones guess they must be pretty strong to take punishment like that unless they have some kind of acceleration shield but free fall doesnt bother them either that ship isnt designed to spin he was staring intently out at the stars his big form characteristically motionless his expression somber abruptly he said sue im worried about what suppose theyre hostile hostile she tasted the unfamiliar word decided she didnt like it after all we know nothing about them suppose they want to fight wed she gasped steve flinched before the horror in her face whatwhat put that idea in your head im sorry i shocked you sue oh dont worry about that but why did shh jim davis had come into view the angels pencil had left earth when he was twentyseven now he was a slightly paunchy thirtyeight the oldest man on board an amiable man with abnormally long delicate fingers his grandfather with the same hands had been a worldfamous surgeon nowadays surgery was normally done by autodocs and the arachnodactyls were to davis merely an affliction he bounced by walking on magnetic sandals looking like a comedian as he bobbed about the magnetic plates hi group he called as he went by hello jim sues voice was strained she waited until he was out of sight before she spoke again hoarsely she whispered did you fight in the belt she didnt really believe it it was merely the worst thing she could think of vehemently steve snapped no then reluctantly he added but it did happen occasionally quickly he tried to explain the trouble was that all the doctors including the psychists were at the big bases like ceres it was the only way they could help the people who needed them be where the miners could find them but all the danger was out in the rocks you noticed a habit of mine once i never make gestures all belters have that trait its because on a small mining ship you could hit something waving your arms around something like the airlock button sometimes its almost eerie you dont move for minutes at a time theres always tension out in the rocks sometimes a miner would see too much danger and boredom and frustration too much cramping inside and too much room outside and he wouldnt get to a psychist in time hed pick a fight in a bar i saw it happen once the guy was using his hands like mallets steve had been looking far into the past now he turned back to sue she looked white and sick like a novice nurse standing up to her first really bad case his ears began to turn red sorry he said miserably she felt like running she was as embarrassed as he was instead she said and tried to mean it it doesnt matter so you think the people in the other ship might want to uh make war he nodded did you have historyofearth courses he smiled ruefully no i couldnt qualify sometimes i wonder how many people do about one in twelve thats not many people in general have trouble assimilating the facts of life about their ancestors you probably know that there used to be wars before hmmm three hundred years ago but do you know what a war is can you visualize one can you see a fusion electric point deliberately built to explode in the middle of the city do you know what a concentration camp is a limited action you probably think murder ended with war well it didnt the last murder occurred in twentyone something just a hundred and sixty years ago anyone who says human nature cant be changed is out of his head to make it stick hes got to define human nature and he cant three things gave us our present peaceful civilization and each one was a technological change sues voice had taken on a dry remote lecturehall tone like the voice on a teacher tape one was the development of psychiatry beyond the alchemist stage another was the full development of land for food production the third was the fertility restriction laws and the annual contraceptive shots they gave us room to breathe maybe belt mining and the stellar colonies had something to do with it too they gave us an inanimate enemy even the historians argue about that one heres the delicate point im trying to nail down sue rapped on the window look at that spacecraft it has enough power to move it around like a mail missile and enough fuel to move it up to our point eight lightright right with plenty of power left for maneuvering its a better ship than ours if theyve had time to learn how to build a ship like that theyve had time to build up their own versions of psychiatry modern food production contraception economic theory everything they need to abolish war see steve had to smile at her earnestness sure sue it makes sense but that guy in the bar came from our culture and he was hostile enough if we cant understand how he thinks how can we guess about the mind of something whose very chemical makeup we cant guess at yet its sentient it builds tools right and if jim hears you talking like this your be in psychiatry treatment thats the best argument youve given me steve grinned and stroked her under the ear with two fingertips he felt her go suddenly stiff saw the pain in her face and at the same time his own pain struck a real tiger of a headache as if his brain were trying to swell beyond his skull ive got them sir the telepath said blurrily ask me anything the captain hurried knowing that the telepath couldnt stand this for long how do they power their ship its a lightpressure drive powered by incomplete hydrogen fusion they use an electromagnetic ramscoop to get their own hydrogen from space clever can they get away from us no their drive is on idle ready to go but it wont help them its pitifully weak what kind of weapons do they have the telepath remained silent for a long time the others waited patiently for his answer there was sound in the control dome but it was the kind of sound one learns not to hear the whine of heavy current the muted purr of voices from below the strange sound like continuously ripping cloth which came from the gravity motors none at all sir the kzins voice became clearer his hypnotic relaxation was broken by muscle twitches he twisted as if in a nightmare nothing aboard ship not even a knife or a club wait theyve got cooking knives but thats all they use them for they dont fight they dont fight no sir they dont expect us to fight either the idea has occurred to three of them and each has dismissed it from his mind but why the captain asked knowing the question was irrelevant unable to hold it back i dont know sir its a science they use or a relgion i dont understand the telepath whimpered i dont understand at all which must be tough on him the captain thought completely alien thoughts what are they doing now waiting for us to talk to them they tried to talk to us and they think we must be trying just as hard but why never mind its not important can they be killed by heat yes sir break contact the telepath shook his head violently he looked like hed been in a washing machine the captain touched a sensitized surface and bellowed weapons officer here use the inductors on the enemy ship but sir theyre so slow what if the alien attacks dont argue with me you snarling the captain delivered an impassioned monologue on the virtues of unquestioning obedience when he switched off the alien technologies officer was back at the viewer and the telepath had gone to sleep the captain purred happily wishing that they were all this easy when the occupants had been killed by heat he would take the ship he could tell everything he needed to know about their planet by examining their lifesupport system he could locate it by tracing the ships trajectory probably they hadnt even taken evasive action if they came from a kzinlike world it would become a kzin world and he as conquest leader would command one percent of its wealth for the rest of his life truly the future looked rich no longer would he be called by his profession he would bear a name incidental information said at officer the ship was generating one and twelve sixtyfourth gee before it stopped rotating little heavy the captain mused might be too much air but it should be easy to kzinform it at we find the strangest life forms remember the chunquen both sexes were sentient they fought constantly and that funny religion on altair one they thought they could travel in time yes sir when we landed the infantry they were all gone they must have all committed suicide with disintegrators but why they knew we only wanted slaves and im still trying to figure out how they got rid of the disintegrators afterward some beings said the at offir will do anything to keep their beliefs eleven years beyond pluto eight years from her destination the fourth colony ship to we made it fell between the stars before her the stars were greenwhite and bluewhite blazing points against nascent black behind they were sparse dying red embers to the sides the constellations were strangely flattened the universe was shorter than it had been for awhile jim davis was very busy everyone including himself had a throbbing blinding headache to each patient dr davis handed a tiny pink pill from the dispenser slot of the huge autodoc which covered the back wall of the infirmary they milled outside the door waiting for the pills to take effect looking like a fullfledged mob in the narrow corridor and then someone thought it would be a good idea to go to the lounge and everyone followed him it was an unusually silent mob nobody felt like talking while the pain was with them even the sound of magnetic sandals was lost in the plastic pile rug steve saw fun davis behind him hey doc he called soffly how long before the pain stops mines gone away you got your pills a little after i did right right thanks doc they didnt take pain well these people they were too unused to it in single file they walked or floated into the lounge lowpitched conversations started people took couches using the sticky plastic strips on their falling jumpers others stood or floated near walls the lounge was big enough to hold them all in comfort steve wriggled near the ceiling trying to pull on his sandals i hope they dont try that again he heard sue say it hurt try what someone steve didnt recognize halflistening as he was whatever they tried telepathy perhaps no i dont believe in telepathy could they have set up ultrasonic vibrations in the walls steve had his sandals on he left the magnets turned off a cold beer do you realize well never taste beer again jim davis voice i miss waterskiing ann harrison sounded wistful the feel of a pusher unit shoving into the small of your back the water beating against your feet the sun steve pushed himself toward them taboo subject he called were on it anyway jim boomed cheedy unless youd rather talk about the alien which everyone else is doing id rather drop it for the moment whats your greatest regret at leaving earth only that i didnt stay long enough to really see it oh of course jim suddenly remembered the drinking bulb in his hand he drank from it hospitably passed it to steve this waiting makes me restless said steve what are they likely to try next shake the ship in morse code jim smiled maybe they wont try anything next they may give up and leave oh i hope not said ann would that be so bad steve had a start what was jim thinking of course ann protested weve got to find out what theyre like and think of what they can teach us jim when conversation got controversial it was good manners to change the subject say said steve i happened to notice the wall was warm when i pushed off is that good or bad thats funny it should be cold if anything said jim theres nothing out there but starlight except a most peculiar expression flitted across his face he drew his feet up and touched the magnetic soles with his fingertips eeeee jim jim steve tried to whirl around and got nowhere that was sue he switched on his shoes thumped to the floor and went to help sue was surrounded by bewildered people they split to let jim davis through and he tried to lead her out of the lounge he looked frightened sue was moaning and thrashing paying no attention to his efforts steve pushed through to her all the metal is heating up davis shouted weve got to get her hearing aid out infirmary sue shouted four of them took sue down the hall to the infirmary she was still crying and struggling feebly when they got her in but jim was there ahead of them with a spray hypo he used it and she went to sleep the four watched anxiously as jim went to work the autodoc would have taken precious time for diagnosis jim operated by hand he was able to do a fast job for the tiny instrument was buried just below the skin behind her ear still the scalpel must have burned his fingers before he was done steve could feel the growing warmth against the soles of his feet did the aliens know what they were doing did it matter the ship was being attacked his ship steve slipped into the corridor and ran for the control room running on magnetic soles he looked like a terrified penguin but he moved fast he knew he might be making a terrible mistake the aliens might be trying desperately to reach the angels pencil he would never know they had to be stopped before everyone was roasted the shoes burned his feet he whimpered with the pain but otherwise ignored it the air burned in his mouth and throat even his teeth were hot he had to wrap his shirt around his hands to open the controlroom door the pain in his feet was unbearable he tore off his sandals and swam to the control board he kept his shirt over his hands to work the controls a twist of a large white knob turned the drive on full and he slipped into the pilot seat before the gentle light pressure could build up he turned to the rearview telescope it was aimed at the solar system for the drive could be used for messages at this distance he set it for short range and began to turn the ship the enemy ship glowed in the high infrared it will take longer to heat the crewcarrying section reported the alien technologies officer theyll have temperature control there thats all right when you think they should all be dead wake up the telepath and have him check the captain continued to brush his fur killing time you know if they hadnt been so completely helpless i wouldnt have tried this slow method id have cut the ring free of the motor section first maybe i should have done that anyway safer the at officer wanted all the credit he could get sir they couldnt have any big weapons there isnt room with a reaction drive the motor and the fuel tanks take up most of the available space the other ship began to turn away from its tormentor its drive end glowed red theyre trying to get away the captain said as the glowing end swung toward them are you sure they cant yes sir that light drive wont take them anywhere the captain purred thoughtfully what would happen if the light hit our ship just a bright light i think the lens is flat so it must be emitting a very wide beam theyd need a parabolic reflector to be dangerous unless his ears went straight up unless what the captain spoke softly demandingly a laser but thats all right sir they dont have any weapons the captain sprang at the control board stupid he spat they dont know weapons from sthondat blood weapons officer how could a telepath find out what they dont know weapons officer here sir burn an awful light shone in the control dome the captain burst into flame then blew out as the air left through a glowing split in the dome steve was lying on his back the ship was spinning again pressing him into what felt like his own bunk he opened his eyes jim davis crossed the room and stood over him you awake steve sat bolt upright his eyes wide easy jims gray eyes were concerned steve blinked up at him what happened he asked and discovered how hoarse he was jim sat down in one of the chairs you tell me we tried to get to the control room when the ship started moving why didnt you ring the strapdown you turned off the drive just as ann came through the door then you fainted how about the other ship steve tried to repress the urgency in his voice and couldnt some of the others are over there now examining the wreckage steve felt his heart stop i guess i was afraid from the start that alien ship was dangerous im more psychist than emdee and i qualified for history class so maybe i know more than is good for me about human nature too much to think that beings with space travel will automatically be peaceful i tried to think so but they arent theyve got things any selfrespecting human being would be ashamed to have nightmares about bomb missiles fusion bombs lasers that induction projector they used on us and antimissiles you know what that means theyve got enemies like themselves steve maybe nearby so i killed them the room seemed to swoop around him but his voice came out miraculously steady you saved the ship it was an accident i was trying to get us away no you werent davis accusation was as casual as if he were describing the chemical makeup of urea that ship was four hundred miles away you would have had to sight on it with a telescope to hit it you knew what you were doing too because you turned off the drive as soon as youd burned through the ship steves back muscles would no longer support him he flopped back to horizontal all right you know he told the ceiling do the others i doubt it thinking in selfdefense is too far outside their experience i think sues guessed oooo if she has shes taking it well davis said briskly better than most of them will when they find out the universe is full of warriors this is the end of the world steve what im being theatrical but it is three hundred years of the peaceful life for everyone theyll call it the golden age no starvation no war no physical sickness other than senescence no permanent mental sickness at all even by our rigid standards when someone over fourteen tries to use his fist on someone else we say hes sick and we cure him and now its over peace isnt a stable condition not for us maybe not for anything that lives can i see the ship from here yes its just behind us steve rolled out of bed went to the window someone had steered the ships much closer together the kzinti ship was a huge red sphere with ugly projections scattered at seeming random over the hull the beam had sliced it into two unequal halves sliced it like an ax through an egg steve watched unable to turn aside as the big half rotated to show its honeycombed interior in a little while said jim the men will be coming back theyll be frightened someone will probably insist that we arm ourselves against the next attacks using weapons from the other ship ill have to agree with him maybe theyll think im sick myself maybe i am but its the kind of sickness well need jim looked desperately unhappy were going to become an armed society and of course well have to warn the earth safe at any speed but how you ask could a car have managed to fail me already i can see the terror in your eyes at the thought that your car too might fail here you are with an indefinite lifespan a potentially immortal being taking every possible precaution against the abrupt termination of your godhead and all for nothing the disruptor field in your kitchen disposeall could suddenly expand to engulf you your transfer booth could make you disappear at the transmitter and forget to deliver you at the receiver a slidewalk could accelerate to one hundred miles per hour then slew sideways to throw you against a building every boosterspice plant in the thousand worlds could die overnight leaving you to grow old and gray and wrinkled and arthritic no its never happened in human history but if a man cant trust his car fa petes sake what can he trust rest assured reader it wasnt that bad for one thing it all happened on margrave a world in the first stages of colonization i was twenty minutes out of triangle lake on my way to the wiggly river logging region flying at an altitude of a thousand feet for several days the logging machines had been cutting trees which were too young and a mechanic was needed to alter a few settings in the boss brain i was cruising along on autopilot playing doubledeck complex solitaire in the back seat with the camera going so that just in case i won one id have a film to back up my bragging then a roc swooped down on me wrapped ten huge talons around my car and swallowed it right away your see that it couldnt happen anywhere but margrave in the first place i wouldnt have been using a car for a twohour trip on any civilized world id have taken a transfer booth in the second place where else can you find rocs anyway this big damn bird caught me and ate me and everything went dark the car flew blithely on ignoring the roc but the ride became turbulent as the roc tried to fly away and couldnt i heard grinding sounds from outside i tried my radio and got nothing either it couldnt reach through all that meat around me or the trip through the birds gullet had brushed away my antennas there didnt seem to be anything else i could do i turned on the cabin lights and went on with the game the grinding noises continued and now i could see what was causing them at some time the roc had swallowed several boulders for the same reason a chicken swallows grit to help digestion the rocks were rubbing against the car under peristalsis trying to break it down into smaller pieces for the murky digestive juices to work on i wondered how smart the boss brain was when it saw a roc glide in for a landing at the logging camp and when it realized that the bird was incapable of leaving no matter how it shrieked and flapped its wings would the master computer draw the correct conclusion would it realize the bird had swallowed a car i was afraid not if the boss brain were that smart it would have been in business for itself i never found out all of a sudden my seat cocoon wrapped itself around me like an overprotective mother and there was a meaty threehundredmileperhour smack the cocoon unwrapped itself my cabin lights still showed redlit fluid around me but it was getting redder the boulders had stopped rolling around my cards were all over the cabin like a snowstorm obviously id forgotten one teensy little mountain when i programmed the autopilot the roc had been blocking the radar and sonar with predictable results a little experimenting showed that my drive had failed under the impact my radio still wouldnt work and my emergency flares refused to try to fire through a rocs belly there was no way to get out not without opening my door to a flood of digestive juices i could have done that if id had a vac suit but how was i to know id need one on a twohour car trip there was only one thing to do i collected my cards shuffled and started a new game it was half a year before the rocs corpus decomposed enough to let me out in that time i won five games of double complex solitaire ive only got films for four the camera ran out im happy to say that the emergency foodmaker worked beautifly if a little monotonously the airmaker never failed and the clock tv kept perfect time as a clock as a tv it showed only technicolor ripples of static the washroom went out along about august but i got it fixed without much trouble at pm on october i forced the door open hacked my way through the mummified skin and flesh between a couple of roc ribs and took a deep breath of real air it smelled of roc id left the cabin door open and i could hear the airmaker whine crazily as it tried to absorb the smell i fired off a few flares and fifteen minutes later a car dropped to take me home they say i was the hairiest human being theyd ever seen ive since asked mr dickson the president of general transportation why he didnt include a depil tube in the emergency stores a castaway is supposed to look like a castaway he tells me if youre wearing a years growth of hair your rescuer will know immediately that youve been lost for some time and will take the appropriate steps general transportation has paid me a more than adequate sum in a compensation for the fact that my car was unable to handle a roc theyve promised me an equal sum for writing this article it seems there are strange and possibly damaging rumors going around concerning my delayed arrival at wiggly river rest assured reader i not only lived through the accident without harm but came out of it with a substantial profit your car is perfectly safe provided it was built later than ad how the heroes die only sheer ruthlessness could have taken him out of town alive the mob behind carter hadnt tried to guard the marsbuggies since carter would have needed too much time to take a buggy through the vehicular airlock they could have caught him there and they knew it some were guarding the personnel lock hoping hed try for that he might have for if he could have closed the one door in their faces and opened the next the safeties would have protected him while he went through the third and fourth and outside on the marsbuggy he was trapped in the bubble there was room to drive around in less than half the prefab houses had been erected so far the rest of the bubbletowns floor was flat fused sand empty but for scattered piles of foamplastic walls and ceilings and floors but theyd get him eventually already they were starting up another buggy they never expected him to run his vehicle through the bubble wall the marsbuggy tilted then righted itself a blast of breathingair roared out around him picked up a cloud of fine sand and hurled it explosively away into the thin poisoned atmosphere carter grinned as he looked behind him they would die now all of them he was the only one wearing a pressure suit in an hour he could come back and repair the rip in the bubble hed have to dream up a fancy story to tell when the next ship came carter frowned what were they at least ten windharried men were wrestling with the wall of a prefab house as carter watched they picked the wall up off the fused sand balanced it almost upright and let go the foamplastic wall rose in the wind and slapped hard against the bubble over the tenfoot rip carter stopped his buggy to see what would happen nobody was dead the air was not shrieking away but leaking away slowly methodically a line of men climbed into their suits and filed through the personnel lock to repair the bubble a buggy entered the vehicular lock the third and last was starting to life carter turned his buggy and was off top speed for a marsbuggy is about twentyfive miles per hour the buggy rides on three wide balloontired wheels each mounted at the end of a fivefoot arm what those wheels cant go over the buggy can generally hop over on the compressedair jet mounted underneath the motor and the compressor are both powered by a litton battery holding a tenth as much energy as the original hiroshima bomb carter had been careful as careful as he had had time for he was carrying a full load of oxygen twelve fourhour tanks in the air bin behind him and an extra tank rested against his knees his batteries were nearly full he would be out of air long before his power ran low when the other buggies gave up he could circle round and return to the bubble in the time his extra tank would give him his own buggy and the two behind him were the only such vehicles on mars at twentyfive miles per hour he fled and at twentyfive miles per hour they followed the closest was half a mile behind carter turned on his radio he found the middle of a conversation cant afford it one of you will have to come back we could lose two of the buggies but not all three that was shute the bubbletowns research director and sole military man the next voice deep and sarcastic belonged to rufus doolittle the biochemist whatll we do flip a coin let me go the third voice said tightly ive got a stake in this carter felt apprehension touch the nape of his neck okay alf good luck said rufus good hunting he added maliciously as if he knew carter were listening you concentrate on getting the bubble fixed ill see that carter doesnt come back behind carter the rearmost buggy swung in a wide loop toward town the other came on and it was driven by the linguist alf harness most of the bubbles dozen men were busy repairing the tenfoot rip with heaters and plastic sheeting it would be a long job but an easy one for by shutes orders the bubble had been deflated the trasparent plastic had fallen in folds across the prefab houses forming a series of interconnected tents one could move about underneath with little difficulty lieutenantmajor acchael shute watched the men at work and decided they had things under control he walked away like a soldier on parade stooping as little as possible as he moved beneath the dropping folds he stopped and watched gondot operating the airmaker gondot noticed him and spoke without looking up mayor whyd you let alf chase carter alone shute accepted his nickname we couldnt lose both tractors why not just post them on guard duty for two days and what if carter got through the guard he must be determined to wreck the dome hed catch us with out pants down even if some of us got into suits could we stand another rip in the bubble gondot reached to scratch his short beard his fingertips rapped helmet plastic and he looked annoyed maybe not i can fill the bubble anytime youre ready but then the airmakerll be empty well be almost out of tanked air by the time they finish mending that rip anotherd finish us shute nodded and turned away all the air anyone could us tons of nitrogen and oxygen was right outside but it was in the form of nitrogen dioxide gas the airmaker could convert it three times as fast as men could use it but if carter tore the dome again that would be too slow but carter wouldnt alf would see to that the emergency was over this time and so lieutenantmajor shute could go back to worrying about the emergencys underlying causes his report on those causes had been finished a month ago he had reread it several times since and always it had seemed complete and to the point yet he had the feeling it could be written better he ought to make it as effective as possible what he had to say could only be said once and then his career would be over and voice silenced cousins had sold some fiction once writing as a hobby perhaps he would help but shute was reluctant to involve anyone else in what amounted to his own rebellion yet hed have to rewrite that report now or at least add to it lew harness was dead murdered john carter would be dead within two days all shutes responsibility all pertinent the decision wasnt urgent it would be a month before earth was in reach of the bubbletowns sending station most of the asteroids spend most of their time between mars and jupiter and it often happens that one of them crosses a planet where theretofore it had crossed only an orbit there are asteroid craters all over mars old eroded ones sharp new ones big ones little ones ragged and smooth ones the bubbletown was at the center of a large fairly recent crater four miles across an enormous poorly cast ashtray discarded on the reddish sand the buggies ran over cracked glass avoiding the occasional tilted blocks running uphill toward the broken rim a sky the color of blood surrounded a tiny brilliant sun set precisely at the zenith inevitably alf was getting closer when they crossed the rim and started downhill they would pull apart it was going to be a long chase now was the time for regrets if there ever was such a time but carter wasnt the type and he had nothing to be ashamed of anyway lew harness had needed to die had as much as asked to die carter was only puzzled that his death should have provoked so violent a reaction could thay all be the way lew had been unlikely if hed stayed and explained theyd have torn him apart those vulpine faces with the distended nostrils and the bared teeth and now he was being chased by one man but that man was lews brother here was the rim and alf was still well behind carter slowed as he went over knowing that the way down would be rougherhe was just going over the edge when a rock ten yards away exploded in white fire alf had a flare pistol carter just stopped himself from scrambling out of the buggy to hide in the rocks the buggy lurched downward and like it or not carter had to forget his terror to keep the vehicle upright the rubble around the craters rim slowed him still further carter angled the buggy for the nearest rise of sloping sand as he reached it alf came over the rim a quartermile behind his silhouette hesitated there against the bloody sky and another flare exploded blinding bright and terrifingly close then carter was on the straightaway rolling down sloping sand to a perfectly flat horizon the radio said gonna be a long one jack carter pushed to transmit right how many flares do you have left dont worry about it i wont not the way youre throwing them away alf didnt answer carter left the radio band open knowing that ultimately alf must talk to the man he needed to kill the crater which was home dropped behind and was gone endless flat desert rose before the buggies flowed under the oversized wheels and dropped behind gentle crescent dunes patterned the sand but they were no barrier to a buggy once there was a martian well it stood all alone on the sand a weathered cylindrical wall seven feet high and ten in circumference made of cut diamond blocks the wells and the slanting script written deep into their dedication blocks were reponsible for the towns presence on mars since the only martian ever found a mummy centuries dead at least had exploded at the first contact with water it was generally assumed that the wells were crematoriums but it wasnt certain nothing was certain about mars the radio maintained an eerie silence hours rolled past the sun slid toward the deep red horizon and still alf did not speak it was as if alf had said everything there was to say to jack carter and that was wrong alf should have needed to justify himself it was carter who sighed and gave up you cant catch me alf no but i can stay behind you as long as i need to you can stay behind me just twentyfour hours youve got fortyeight hours of air i dont believe youll kill yourself just to kill me dont count on it but i wont need to noon tomorrow youll be chasing me you need to breathe just like i do watch this said carter the tank resting against his knee was empty he tipped it over the side and watched it roll away i had an extra tank he said he smiled in relief at his release from that damning weight i can live four hours longer than you can want to turn back alf no hes not worth it alf he was nothing but a queer does that mean hes got to die it does if the son of a bitch propositions me maybe youre a little that way yourself no and lew wasnt queer till he came here they should have sent half men half women amen you know lots of people got a little sick to their stomachs about homosexuals i do myself and it hurt to see it happening to lew but theres only one type who goes looking for em so he can beat up on em carter frowned latents guys who think they might turn queer themselves if you gave em the opportunity they cant stand queers around because queers are temptation youre just returning the compliments maybe anyway the town has enough problems withoutthings like that going on this whole project could have been wrecked by someone like your brother how bad do we need killers pretty badly this time suddenly carter knew that he was now his own defense attorney if he could convince alf that he shouldnt be executed he could convince the rest of them if he couldnt then he must destroy the bubble or die he went on talking as persuasively as he knew how you see alf the town has two purposes one is to find out if we can live in an environment as hostile as this one the other is to contact the martians now there are just fifteen of us in town twelve thirteen when i get back fourteen if we both do okay each of us is more or less a necessary to the functioning of the town but im needed in both fields im the ecologist alf i not only have to keep the town from dying from some sort of imbalance i also have to figure out how the martians live what they live on how martian life forms depend on each other you see sure how bout lew was he necessary we can get along without him he was the radio man at least a couple of us have training enough to take over communications you make me so happy doesnt the same go for you carter thought hard and fast yes gondot in particular could keep the towns lifesupport system going with little help but not with the martian ecology there isnt there isnt any martian ecology jack has anyone ever found any life on mars besides that manshaped mummy you cant be an ecologist without something to make deductions from youve got nothing to investigate so what good are you carter kept talking he was still arguing as the sun dropped into the sea of sand and darkness closed down with a snap but he knew now it was no use alfs mind was closed by sunset the bubble was taut and the tortured scream of incoming breathingair had dropped to a tired sigh lieutenantmajor shute unfastened the clamps at his shoulders and lifted his helmet ready to jam it down fast if the air was too thin it wasnt he set the helmet down and signaled thumbsup to the men watching him ritual those dozen men had known the air would be safe but rituals had grown fast where men worked in space and the most rigid was that the man in charge fastened his helmet last and unfastened it first now suits were being removed men moved about their duties some moved toward the kitchen to clean up the vacuuminduced havoc so hurley could get dinner shute stopped lee cousins as he went by lee could i see you a minute sure mayor shute was the mayor to all bubbletown i want your help as a writer said shute im going to send in a quite controversial report when we get within range of earth and id like you to help me make it convincing fine lets see it the ten streetlamps came on dispelling the darkness which had fallen so suddenly shute led the way to his prefab bungalow unlocked the safe and handed cousins the manuscript cousins hefted it big he said might pay to cut it by all means if you can find anything unnecessary ill bet i can cousins grinned he dropped on the bed and began to read ten minutes later he asked just what is the incidence of homosexuals in the navy i havent the faintest idea then its not powerful evidence you might quote a limerick to show that the problems proverbial i know a few good a little later cousins said a lot of schools in england are coeducational more every year i know but the present problem is among men who graduated from boys schools when they were much younger make that clearer incidentally was your highschool coeducational no any queers a few at least one in every class the seniors used to use paddles on the ones they suspected did it help no of course not okay youve got two sets of circumstances under which a high rate of homosexuality occurs in both cases youve got three conditions a reasonable amount of leisure no women and a disciplinary pecking order you need a third example i couldnt think of one the nazi organization h ill give you details cousins went on reading he finished the report and put it aside thisll cause merry hell he said i know the worst thing about it is your threat to give the whole thing to the newspapers if i were you id leave that out if you were me you wouldnt said shute everyone who had anything to do with wargod knew they were risking everything thats happened they preferred to let us take that risk rather than risk public opinion themselves there are hundreds of decency leagues in the united states maybe thousands i dont know but theyll all come down on the government like harpies if anyone tried to send a mixed crew to mars or anywhere else in space the only way i can make the government act is to give them a greater threat you win this is a greater threat did you find anything else to cut out oh hell yes ill go through this again with a red pencil you talk too much and use too many words that are too long and you generalize youll have to give details or youll lose impact ill be ruining some reputations cant be helped weve got to have women on mars and right now rufe and timmy are building up to a real spitting fight rufe thanks he caused lews death by leaving him timmy keeps taunting him with it all right said shute he stood up he had been sitting erect throughout the discussion as if sitting at attention are the buggies still in radio range they cant hear us but we can hear them timmys working the radio good well keep him on it until they go out of range shall we get dinner phobos rose where the sun had set a scatttering of moving dots of light like a crescent of dim stars it grew brighter as it rose a new moon becoming a halfmoon in hours then it was too high to look at carter had to keep his eyes on the triangle of desert lit by his headlights the headlight beams were the color of earthly sunlight but to carters marsadapted eyes they turned everything blue he had chosen his course well the desert ahead was flat for more than seven hundred miles there would be no low hills rising suddenly before him to trap him into jetjumping in faint moonlight or waiting for alf to come down on him alfs turnover point would come at high noon tomorrow and then carter would have won for alf would turn back toward the bubble and carter would go on into the desert when alf was safely over the horizon carter would turn left or right go on for an hour and then follow a course parallel to alfs he would be in sight of the bubble an hour later than alf with three hours in which to plan then would come the hardest part certainly there would be someone on guard carter would have to charge past the guard who might be armed with a flare pistol tear the bubble open and somehow confiscate the supply of tanks ripping the bubble open would probably kill everyone inside but there would be men in suits outside he would have to load some of the tanks on his buggy and open the stopcocks of the rest all before anyone reached him what bothered him was the idea of charging a flare pistol but perhaps he could just aim the buggy and jump out he would have to see his eyelids were getting heavy and his hands were cramped but he dare not slow down and he dared not sleep several times he had thought of smashing the come hither in his suit radio with that thing constantly beeping alf could find him anytime he pleased but alf could find him anyway his headlights were always behind never catching up never dropping away if he ever got out of alfs sight that comehither would have to go but there was no point in letting alf know that not yet stars dropped into the black western horizon phobos rose again brighter this time and again became too high to watch deimos now showed above the steady shine of alfs headlights suddenly it was day and there were thin black shadows pointing to a yellow horizon stars still glowed in a redblack sky there was a crater ahead a glass dish set in the desert not too big to circle around carter angled left the buggy behind him also angled if he kept turning like this alf couldnt help but gain on himcarter sucked water and nutrient solution from the nipples in his helmet and concentrated on steering his eyes felt gritty and his mouth belonged to a martian mummy morning said alf morning get plenty of sleep not enough i only slept about six hours in snatches i kept worrying youd turn off and lose me for a moment carter went hot and cold then he know that alf was needling him hed no more slept than carter had look to your right said alf to their right was the crater wall and carter looked again to be sure there was a silhouette on the rim a manshaped shadow against the red sky with one hand it balanced something tall and thin a martian carter said softly without thinking he turned his buggy to climb the wall two flares exploded in front of him a second apart and he frantically jammed the tuler bar hard left god damn it alf that was a martian weve got to go after it the silhouette was gone no doubt the martian had run for its life when it saw the flares alf said nothing nothing at all and carter rode on past the crater with a murderous fury building in him it was eleven oclock the tips of a range of hills were pushing above the western horizon im just curious alf said but what would you have said to that martian carters voice was tight and bitter does it matter yah the best you could have done was scare him when we get in touch with the martians well do it just the way we planned carter ground his teeth even without the accident of lew harness death there was no telling how long the translation plan would take it involved three steps sending pictures of the writings on the crematory wells and other artifacts to earth so that computers could translate the language writing messages in that language to leave near the wells where martians would find them and then waiting for the martians to make a move but there was no reason to believe that the script on the wells wasnt from more than one language or from the same language as it had changed over thousands of years there was no reason to assume the martians would be interested in strange beings living in a glorified balloon regardless of whether the invaders knew how to write and could the martians read their own ancestors script an idea youre a linguist said carter no answer alf weve talked about whether the town needed lew and weve talked about whether the town needs me how about you without you wed never get the wellscript translated i doubt that the cal tech computers are doing most of the work and anyhow i left notes but so what if you keep chasing me you force me to kill you can the town afford to lose you you cant do it but ill make you a deal if you want its eleven now give me two of your tanks and well go back to town well stop two hours from town leave your buggy and youll ride the rest of the way tied up in the air bin then you can stand trial you think theyll let me off not after the way you ripped the bubble open on your way out that was a blunder jack why dont you just take one tank if alf did that carter would get back with two hours to spare he knew now that he would have to wreck the bubble he had no alternative but alf would be right behind him with the flare gun no deal i wouldnt feel safe if i didnt know youd ran out of air two hours before we got back you want me to feel safe dont you it was better the other way let alf turn back in an hour let alf be in the bubble when carter returned to tear it open carter turned him down said timmy he hunched over the radio holding his earphones with both hands listening with every nerve for voices which had almost died into the distance hes planning something gondot said uneasily naurally said shute he wants to lose alf return to the bubble and wreck it what other hope has he but hed die too said timmy not necessarily if he killed us all he could mend the new rip while he lived on the tanks weve got left i think he could keep the bubble in good enough repair to keep one man alive my lord what can we do relax timmy its simple math it was easy for lieutenantmajor shute to keep his voice light and he didnt want timmy to start a panic if alf turns back at noon carter cant get here before noon tomorrow at four hell be out of air well just keep everyone in suits for four hours privately he wondered if twelve men could repair even a small rip before they used up the bottled air it would be one tank every twenty minutes but perhaps they wouldnt be tested five minutes of twelve said carter turn back alf youll only get home with ten minutes to spare the linguist chuckled a quarter mile behind the blue dot of his buggy didnt move you cant fight mathematics alf turn back too late in five minutes it will be i started this trip short of an tank i should have turned two hours ago carter had to wet his lips from the water nipple before he answered youre lying will you stop bugging me stop it alf laughed watch me turn back his buggy came on it was noon and the chase would not end at twentyfive miles per two marsbuggies a quarter of a mile apart moved serenely through an orange desert chemical stains of green rose ahead and fell behind crescent dunes drifted by as regular as waves on an ocean the ghostly path of a meteorite touched the northern horizon in a momentary white flash the hills were higher now humps of smooth rock like animals sleeping beyond the horizon the sun burned small and bright in a sky reddened by nitrogen dioxide and near the horizon blackened by its thinness to the color of bloody india ink had the chase really started at noon exactly noon but it was twelvethirty now and he was sure that was too late alf had doomed himself to doom carter but he wouldnt great minds think alike he told the radio really alfs tone said he couldnt have cared less you took an extra tank just like me no i didnt jack you must have if theres one thing im sure of in life its that you are not the type to kill yourself all right alf i quit lets go back lets not wed have three hours to chase that martian a flare exploded behind his buggy carter sighed raggedly at two oclock both buggies would turn back to bubbletown where carter would probably be executed but suppose i turn back now thats easy alf will shoot me with the flare gun he might miss if i let him choose my course ill die for certain carter sweated and cursed himself but he couldnt do it he couldnt deliberately turn into alfs gun at two oclock the base of the range came over the horizon the hills were incredibly clear almost as clear as they would have been on the moon but they were horribly weathered and the sea of sand lapped around them as if eager to finish them off to drag them down carter rode with his eyes turned behind his watch hands moved on minute to minute and carter watched in disbelief as alfs vehicle continued to follow as the time approached and reached twothirty cartees disbelief faded it didnt matter now how much oxygen alf had they had passed carters turnover point youve killed me he said no answer i killed lew in a fistfight what youve done to me is much worse youre killing me by slow torture youre a demon alf fistfight my aunts purple asterisk you hit lew in the throat and watched him drown in his own blood dont tell me you didnt know what you were doing everybody in town knows you know karate he died in minutes ill need a whole day you dont like that turn around and rush my gun its right here waiting we could get back to the crater in time to search for that martian thats why i came to mars to learn whats here so did you alf come on lets turn back you first but he couldnt he couldnt karate can defeat any handtohand weapon but a quaterstaff and carter had quarterstaff training too but he couldnt charge a flare gun not even if alf meant to turn back and alf didnt a faint whine vibrated through the bubble the sandstorm was at the height of its fury which made it about as dangerous as an enraged caterpillar at worst it was an annoyance the shrill barely audible whine could get on ones nerves and the darkness made streetlamps necessary tomorrow the bubble would be covered a tenth of an inch deep in fine moondry silt inside the bubble it would be darker than night until someone blew the silt away with an tank to shute the storm was depressing here on mars was lieutenantmajor shute boy hero facing terrifying dangers on the frontiers of human exploration a sandstorm that wouldnt have harmed an infant nobody here faced a single danger that he had not brought with him would it be like this forever men traveling enormous distances to face themselves there had been little work done since noon today shute had given up on that on a stack of walls sat timmy practically surrounding the buggypickup radio surrounded in turn by the bubbles population timmy stood up as shute approached the group theyre gone he announced sounding very tired he turned off the radio the men looked at each other and some got to their feet tim howd you lose them timmy noticed him theyre too far away mayor they never turned around they never did they just kept going out into the desert alf must have gone insane carters not worth dying for shute thought but he was once carter had been one of the best tough fearless bright enthusiastic shute had watched him deteriorate under the boredom and the close quarters aboard ship he had seemed to recover when they reached mars when all of them suddenly had work to do then yesterday mourning murder alf it was hard to lose alf lew had been little loss but alf cousins dropped into step beside him ive got that redpencil work done thanks lee ill have to do it all over now dont do it over write an addendum show how and why three men died then you can say i told y so you think so my professional judgment whens the funeral day after tomorrow thats sunday i thought it would be appropriate you can say all three services at once good timing to all bubbletown jack carter and alf harness were dead but they still breathed the mountains came toward them the only fixed points in an ocean of sand alf was closer now something less than four hundred yards behind at five oclock carter reached the base of the mountains they were too high to go over on the air jet he could see spots where he might have landed the buggy while the pump filled the jet tank for another hop but for what better to wait for alf suddenly carter knew that that was the one thing in the world alf wanted to roll up alongside in his buggy to watch carters face until he was sure carter knew exactly what was to come and then to blast carter down in flames from ten feet away and watch while a bright magnesiumoxidizer flare burned through his suit and skin and vitals the hills were low and shallow even from yards away he might have been looking at the smooth flank of a sleeping beast except that this beast was not breathing carter took a deep breath noticing how stale the air had become despite the purifier unit and turned on the compressedair jet the air of mars is terribly thin but it can be compressed and a rocket will work anywhere even a compressedair rocket carter went up leaning as far back in the cabin as he could to compensate for the loss of weight in the tanks behind him to put as little work as possible on gyroscopes meant to spin only in emergencies he rose fast and he tilted the buggy to send it skating along the thirtydegree slope of the hill there were flat places along the slope but not many he should reach the first one easily a flare exploded in his eyes carter clenched his teeth and fought the urge to look behind he tilted the buggy backward to slow him down the jet pressure was dropping he came down like a feather two hundred feet above the desert when he turned off the jet he could hear the gyros whining he turned the stabilizer off and let them run down now there was only the chugging of the compressor vibrating through his suit alf was out of his buggy standing at the base of the mountains looking up come on said carter what are you waiting for go on over if you want to whats the matter are your gyros fouled your brain is fouled carter go on over alf raised one arm stiffly out the hand showed flame and carter ducked instinctively the compressor had almost stopped which meant the tank was nearly full but carter would be a fool to take off before it was completely full you got the greatest acceleration from an air jet during the first seconds of flight the rest of the flight you got just enough pressure to keep you going but alf was getting into his buggy now the buggy was rising carter turned on his jet and went up he came down hard three hundred feet high and only then dared to look down he heard alfs nasty laugh and he saw that alf was still at the foot of the mountains it had been a bluff but why wasnt alf coming after him the third hop took him to the top the first downhill hop was the first hed ever made and it almost killed him he had to do his decelerating on the last remnants of pressure in the jet tank he waited until his hands stopped shaking then continued the rest of the way on the wheels there was no sign of alf as he reached the foot of the range and started out into the desert already the sun was about to go faint bluish stars in a redblack sky outlined the yellow hills behind him still no sign of alf alf spoke in his ear gently almost kindly youll just have to come back jack dont hold your breath id rather not have to thats why im telling you this look at your watch it was about sixthirty did you look now count it up i started with fortyfour hours of air you started with fiftytwo that gave us ninetysix breathing hours between us together weve used up sixtyone hours that leaves thirtyfive between us now i stopped moving an hour ago from where i am its almost thirty hours back to base sometime in the next two and a half hours youve got to get my air and stop me from breathing or ive got to do the same for you it made sense finally everything made sense alf are you listening listen said carter and he opened his radio panel and moving by touch found a wire hed located long ago he jerked it loose his radio crackled deafeningly then stopped did you hear that alf i just jerked my comehither loose now you couldnt find me even if you wanted to i wouldnt have it any other way then carter realized what hed done there was now no possibility of alf finding him after all the miles and hours of the chase now it was carter chasing alf all alf had to do was wait the dark fell on the west like a heavy curtain carter went south and he went immediately it would take him an hour or more to cross the range he would have to leapfrog to the top with only his headlights to guide him his motor would not take him uphill over such a slope he could use the wheels going down with luck but he would have to do so in total darkness deimos would not have risen phobos was not bright enough to help it had gone exactly as alf had planned chase carter to the range if he attacks there take his tanks and go home if he makes it show him why he has to come back time it so he has to come back in darkness if by some miracle he makes it this time well theres always the flare gun carter could give him only one surprise he would cross six miles south of where he was expected and approach alfs buggy from the southeast or was alf expecting that too it didnt matter carter was beyond free will the first jump was like jumping blindfolded from a ships airlock hed pointed the headlights straight down and as he went up he watched the circle of light expand and dim he angled east first he wasnt moving at all then the slope slid toward him far too fast he backangled nothing seemed to happen the pressure under him died slowly but it was dying and the slope was a wavering blur surrounded by dark it came up clarifying fast the landing jarred him from coccyx to cranium he held himself rigid waiting for the buggy to tumble end forend down the hill but though the buggy was tilted at a horrifying angle it stayed carter sagged and buried his helmet in his arms two enormous hanging tears swollen to pinballs in the low gravity dropped onto his faceplate and spread for the first time he regretted all of it killing lew when a kick to the kneecap would have put him out of action and taught him a permanent memorable lesson snatching the buggy instead of surrendering himself for trial driving through the bubble and making every man on mars his mortal enemy hanging around to watch what would happen when perhaps he could have run beyond the horizon before alf came out the vehicular airlock he clenched his fists and pressed them against his faceplate remembering his attitude of mild interest as he sat watching alfs buggy roll into the lock time to go carter readied himself for another jump this one would be horrible hed be taking off with the buggy canted thirty degrees backward wait a minute there was something wrong with that picture of alfs buggy as it rolled toward the lock surrounded by trotting men definitely something wrong there but what it would come to him he gripped the jet throttle and readied his other hand to flip on the gyros the moment he was airborne alf had planned so carefully how had he come away with one tank too few and if he really had everything planned how did alf expect to get carters tanks if carter crashed suppose carter crashed his buggy against a hill right now on his second jump how would alf know he wouldnt not until nine oclock came and carter hadnt shown up then hed know carter had crashed somewhere but it would be too late unless alf had lied that was it that was what was wrong with his picture of alf in the vehicular airlock put one tank in the air bin and it would stand out like a sore thumb fill the air bin and then remove one tank and the hole in the hexagonal array would show like sammy davis jr on the berlin nazis football team there had been no such hole let carter crash now and alf would know it with four hours in which to search for his buggy carter swung his headlights up to normal position then moved the buggy backward in a deadslow half circle the buggy swayed but didnt topple now he could move down behind his headlights nine oclock if carter was wrong then he was dead now even now alf might be unfastening his helmet his eyes blank with the ultimate despair still wondering where carter had got to but if he was right then alf was nodding to himself not smiling merely confirming a guess now he was deciding whether to wait another five minutes on the chance that carter was late or to start searching now carter sat in his dark cabin at the foot of the black mountains his left hand clutching a wrench his eyes riveted on the luminous needle of the direction finder the wrench had been the heaviest in his toolbox hed found nothing sharper than a screwdriver and that wouldnt have penetrated suit fabric the needle pointed straight toward alf and it wasnt moving alf had decided to wait how long would he wait carter caught himself whispering not loudly move idiot youve got to search both sides of the range both sides and the top move move ye gods had he shut off his radio yes the switch was down move the needle moved it jerked once infinitesimally and was quiet it was quiet a long time seven or eight minutes then it jerked in the opposite direction alf was searching the wrong side of the hills and then carter saw the flaw in his own plan alf must now assume he was dead and if he carter was dead then he wasnt using air alf had two hours extra but he thought he had four the needle twitched and moved a good distance carter sighed and closed his eyes alf was coming over he had sensibly decided to search this side first for if carter was on this side dead then alf would have to cross the range again to reach home twitch twitch he must be at the top then the long slow steady movement down headlights very faint to the north would alf turn north he turned south perfect the headlights grew brighter and carter waited with his buggy buried to the windshield in the sand at the base of the range alf still had the flare gun despite all his certainty that carter was dead he was probably riding with the gun in his hand but he was using his headlights and he was going slowly perhaps fifteen miles per hour he would pass twenty yards west carter gripped the wrench here he comes there was light in his eyes dont see me and then there wasnt carter swarmed out of the buggy and down the slopping sand the headlights moved away and carter was after them leaping as a moonie leaps both feet pushing at once into the sand a second spent in flying legs straddled and feet reaching forward for the landing and another leap one last enormous kangaroo jump and he was on the tanks falling on knees and forearms with feet lifted high so the metal wouldnt clang one arm landed on nothing at all where empty tanks were missing his body tried to roll off onto the sand he wouldnt let it the transparent bubble of alfs helmet was before him the head inside swept back and forth sweeping the triangle created by the headlights carter crept forward he poised himself over alfs head raised the wrench high and brought it down with all his strength cracks starred out in the plastic alf looked up with his eyes and mouth all wide open his amazement unalloyed by rage or terror carter brought the weight down again there were more cracks longer cracks alf winced and finally brought up the flare gun carters muscles froze for an instant as he looked into its hellish mouth then he struck for what he knew must be the last time the wrench smashed through transparent plastic and scalp and skull carter knelt on the tanks for a moment looking at the unpleasant thing hed done then he lifted the body out by the shoulders tumbled it over the side and climbed into the cabin to stop the buggy it took him a few minutes to find his own buggy where hed buried it in the sand it took longer to uncover it that was all right he had plenty of time if he crossed the range by twelvethirty he would reach bubbletown on the last of his air there would be little room for finesse on the other hand he would be arriving an hour before dawn theyd never see him they would have stopped expecting him or alf at noon tomorrow even assuming they didnt know alf had refused to turn back the bubble would be empty of air before anyone could get into a suit later he could repair and fill the bubble in a month earth would hear of the disaster how a meteorite had touched down at a corner of the dome how john carter had been outside at the time the only man in a suit theyd take him home and he could spend the rest of his life trying to forget he knew which tanks were his empties like every man in town he had his own method of arranging them in the air bin he dumped six and stopped it was a shame to throw away empties the tanks were too hard to replace he didnt know alfs arrangement scheme hed have to test alfs empties individually already alf had thrown some away one by one carter turned the valve of each tank if it hissed he put it in his own air bin if it didnt he dropped it one of them hissed just one five tanks he couldnt possibly make a thirty hour trip on five tanks somewhere alf had left three tanks where he could find them again just on the off chance just in case something went terribly wrong for alf and carter captured his buggy carter still wouldnt go home alive alf must have left the tanks where he could find them easily he must have left them near here for he had never been out of carters sight until carter crossed the range and furthermore hed kept just one tank to reach them the tanks were nearby and carter had just two hours to find them in fact he realized they must be on the other side of the range alf hadnt stopped anywhere on this side but he could have left them on the hillside during his jumps to the top in a sudden frenzy of hurry carter jumped into his buggy and took it up the headlights showed his progress to the top and over the first red rays of sunlight found lee cousins and rufe doolittle already outside the bubble they were digging a grave cousins dug in stoic silence in a mixture of pity and disgust he endured rufes constant compulsive flow of words first man to be buried on another planet do you think lew would have liked that no hed hate it hed say it wasnt worth dying for he wanted to go home he would have too on the next ship the sand came up in loose dry shovelfuls practice was needed to keep it on the shovel it tried to flow like a viscous liquid i tried to tell the mayor hed have liked a well burial the mayor wouldnt listen he said the martians might not hey cousins eyes jerked up and the movement caught them a steadily moving fleck on the crater wall martian was his first thought what else could be be moving out there and then he saw that it was a buggy to lee cousins it was like a corpse rising from its grave the buggy moved like a blind thing down the tilted blocks of old glass touched the drifted sand in the crater floor all while he stood immobile at the corner of his eye he saw doolittles shovel flying wide as doolittle ran for the bubble the buggy only grazed the sand then began reclimbing the crater cousins paralysis left him and he ran for the towns remaining buggy the ghost was moving at half speed he caught it a mile beyond the crater rim carter was in the cockpit his helmet was in his lap clutched in a rigid deathgrip cousins reported he must have aimed the buggy along his direction finder when he felt his air going give him credit he added and lifted a shovelful from the second grave he did that much he sent back the buggy just after dawn a small biped form came around a hill to the east it walked directly to the sprawled body of alf harness picked up a foot in both delicate looking hands and began to tug the corpse across the sand looking rather like an ant tugging a heavy bread crumb in the twenty minutes it needed to reach alfs buggy the figure never stopped to rest dropping its prize the martian climbed the pile of empty tanks and peered into the air bin then down at the body but there was no way such a small weak being could lift such a mass the martian seemed to remember something it scrambled down the tanks and crawled under the buggys belly minutes later it came out dragging a length of nylon line it tied each end of the line to one of alfs ankles then dropped the loop over the buggys trailerattachment knob for a time the figure stood motionless above alfs broken helmet contemplating its work alfs head might take a beating riding that way but as a specimen alfs head was useless wherever nitrogen dioxide gas had touched moisture red fuming nitric acid had formed by now the rest of the body was dry and hard fairly well preserved the figure climbed into the buggy a little fumbling surprisingly little and the buggy was rolling twenty yards away it stopped with a jerk the martian climbed out and walked back it knelt beside the three tanks which had been tied beneath the buggy with the borrowed nylon line and it opened the stopcocks of each in turn it leapt back in horrified haste when the noxious gas began hissing out minutes later the buggy was moving south the tanks hissed for a time then were quiet at the bottom of a hole twelve stories below the roof gardens were citrus groves grazing pastures and truck farms they curved out from the base of the hotel in neat little squares curved out and up and up and up and over five miles overhead was the fusion sunlight tube running down the radius of the slightly bulging cylinder that was farmers asteroid five miles above the sunlight tube the sky was a patchwork of small squares split by a central wedding ring of lake and by tributary rivers a sky alive with the tiny red glints of selfguided tractors lucas garner was halfdaydreaming letting his eyes rove the solid sky at the belt governments invitation he had entered a bubbleworld for the first time combining a vacation from united nations business with a chance at a brand new experience rare thing for a man seventeen decades old he found it pleasantly kooky to look up into a curved sky of fused rock and imported topsoil theres nothing immoral about smuggling said lit shaeffer the surface overhead was dotted with hotels as if the bubbleworld were turning to city garner knew it wasnt those hotels and the scattered hotels in the other bubbleworld served every belters occasional need for an earthlike environment belters dont need houses a belters home is the inside of his pressure suit garner returned his attention to his host you mean smugglings like picking pockets on earth thats just what i dont mean shaeffer said the belter reached into his coverall pocket pulled out something flat and black and laid it on the table ill want to play that in a minute garner picking pockets is legal on earth has to be the way you crowd together you couldnt enforce a law against picking pockets in the belt smuggling is against the law but it isnt immoral its like a flatlander forgetting to feed the parking meter theres no loss of selfrespect if you get caught you pay the fine and forget it h if a man wants to send his earnings through ceres thats up to him it costs him a straight fifty percent if he thinks he can get past the goldskins that too is his choice but if we catch him well confiscate his cargo and everybody will be laughing at him nobody pities an inept smuggler is that what muller tried to do yah he had a valuable cargo twenty kilos of pure north magnetic poles the temptation was too much for him he tried to get past us and we picked him up on radar then he did something stupid he tried to whip around a hole he must have been on course for luna when we found him ceres was behind him with the radar our ships were ahead of him matching course at two gee his mining ship wouldnt throw more than point five gee so eventually theyd pull alongside him no matter what he did then he noticed mars was just ahead of him the hole garner knew enough belters to have learned a little of their slang the very one his first instinct must have been to change course belters learn to avoid gravity wells a man can get killed half a dozen ways coming too close to a hole a good autopilot will get him safely around it or program an inandout spin or even land him at the bottom god forbid but miners dont carry good autopilots they carry cheap autopilots and they stay clear of holes youre leading up to something garner said regretfully business youre too old to fool sometimes garner believed that himself sometime between the first world war and the blowing of the second bubbleworld garner had learned to read faces as accurately as men read print often it saved timeand in garners view his time was worth saving go on he said mullers second thought was to use the hole an inandout spin would change his course more then he could hope to do with the motor he could time it so mars would hide him from ceres when he curved out he could damn near touch the surface too mars atmosphere is as thin as a flatlanders dreams thanks a lot lit isnt mars un property only because we never wanted it then muller had been trespassing go on what happened to muller ill let him tell it this is his log lit shaeffer did something to the flat box and a mans voice spoke april the sky is flat the land is flat and they meet in a circle at infinity no star shows but the big one a little bigger than it shows through most of the belt but dimmed to red like the sky its the bottom of a hole and i must have been crazy to risk it but im here i got down alive i didnt expect to not there at the end it was one crazy landing imagine a universe half of which has been replaced by an ocher abstraction too distant and far too big to show meaningful detail moving past you at a hell of a clip a strange singing sound comes through the walls like nothing youve ever heard before like the sound of the wings of the angel of death the walls are getting warm you can hear the thermosystem whining even above the shriek of air whipping around the hull then because you dont have enough problems the ship shakes itself like a mortally wounded dinosaur that was my fuel tanks tearing loose all at once and nothing first the four of them sheered their mooring bars and went spinning down ahead of me cherry red that faced me with two bad choices i had to decide fast if i finished the hyperbola id be heading into space on an unknown course with what fuel was left in my inboard cooling tank my lifesystem wouldnt keep me alive more than two weeks there wasnt much chance i could get anywhere in that time with so little fuel and id seen to it the goldskins couldnt come to me but the fuel in the cooling tank would get me down even the ships of earth use only a little of their fuel getting in and out of their pet gravity well most of it gets burned getting them from place to place fast and mars is lighter than earth but what then id still have two weeks to live i remembered the old lacis solis base deserted seventy years ago surely i could get the old lifesystems working well enough to support one man i might even find enough water to turn some into hydrogen by electrolysis it was a better risk than heading out into nowhere right or wrong i went down the stars are gone and the land around me makes no sense now i know why they call planet dwellers flatlanders i feel like a gnat on a table im sitting here shaking afraid to step outside beneath a redblack sky is a sea of dust punctuated by scattered badly cast glass ashtrays the smallest just outside the port are a few inches in diameter the largest are miles across as i came down the deepradar showed me fragments of much larger craters deep under the dust the dust is soft and fine almost like quicksand i came down like a feather but the ship is buried to halfway up the lifesystem i set down just beyond the lip of one of the largest craters the one which houses the ancient flatlander base from above the base looked like a huge transparent raincoat discarded on the cracked bottom its a weird place but ill have to go out sometime how else can i use the base lifesystem my uncle bat used to tell me stupidity carries the death penalty ill go outside tomorrow april my clock says its morning the suns around on the other side of the planet leaving the sky no longer bloody it looks almost like space if you remember to look away from gravity though the stars are dim as if seen through fogged plastic a big star has come over the horizon brightening and dimming like a spinning rock must be phobos since it came from the sunset region im going out later a sort of concave glass shell surrounds the ship where the fusion flame splashed down the ships lifesystem the half that shows above the dust rests in the center like a frog on a lillypad in confinement asteroid the splashdown shell is all a spiderweb of cracks but its firm enough to walk on not so the dust the dust is like thick oil the moment i stepped onto it i started to sink i had to swim to where the crater rim slopes out like the shore of an island it was hard work fortunately the splashdown shell reaches to the crater rock at one point so i wont have to do that again its queer this dust i doubt you could find its like anywhere in the system its meteor debris condensed from vaporized rock on earth dust this fine would be washed down to the sea by rain and turned to sedimentary rock natural cement on the moon there would be vacuum cementing the bugaboo of the belts microminiaturization industries but here theres just enough air to be absorbed by the dust surface to prevent vacuum cementing and not nearly enough to stop a meteorite result it wont cement nohow so it behaves like viscous fluid probably the only rigid surfaces are the meteor craters and mountain ranges going up the crater lip was rough its all cracked tilted blocks of volcanic glass the edges are almost sharp this crater must be geologically recent at the bottom halfsubmerged in a shallow lake of dust is bubbletown i can walk okay in this gravity its something less than my ships gee max but i almost broke my ankles a couple of times getting down over those tilted slippery dustcovered blocks as a whole the crater is a smashed ashtray pieced loosely together like an impromptu jigsaw puzzle the bubble covers the base like a deflated tent with the airmaking machinery just outside the airmaker is in a great cube of black metal blackened by seventy years of martian atmosphere its huge it must have been a bitch to lift how they moved that mass from earth to mars with only chemical and ion rockets ill never know also why what was on mars that they wanted if ever there was a useless world this is it its not close to earth like the moon the gravitys inconveniently high there are no natural resources lose your suit pressure and itd be a race against time whether you died of blowout or of red fuming nitrogen dioxide eating your lungs the wells somewhere on mars there are wells the first expedition found one in the s a mummified something was nearby it exploded when it touched water so nobody ever knew more about it including just how old it was did they expect to find live martians if so so what outside the bubble are two twoseater marsbuggies they have an enormous wheelbase and wide broad wheels probably wide enough to keep the buggy above the dust while its moving youd have to be careful where you stopped i wont be using them anyway the airmaker will work i think if i can connect it to the ships power system its batteries are drained and its fusion plant must be mainly lead by now thousands of tons of breathingair are all about me tied up in nitrogen dioxide n the airmaker will release oxygen and nitrogen and will also pick up what little water vapor there is ill pull hydrogen out of the water for fuel but can i get the power there may be cables in the base its for sure i cant call for help my antennas burned off coming down i looked through the bubble and saw a body male a few feet away hed died of blowout odds are ill find a rip in the bubble when i get around to looking wonder what happened here april i went to sleep at first sunlight mars rotation is just a fraction longer than a ships day which is convenient i can work when the stars show and the dust doesnt and thatll keep me sane but ive had breakfast and done cleanship chores and still itll be two hours before sundown am i a coward i cant go out there in the light near the sun the sky is like fresh blood tinged by nitrogen dioxide on the other side its almost black not a sip of a star the desert is flat broken only by craters and by a regular pattern of crescent dunes so shallow that they can be seen only near the horizon something like a straight lunar mountain range angles away into the desert but its terribly eroded like something that died a long time ago could it be the tilted lip of an ancient asteroid crater the gods must have hated mars to put it right in the middle of the belt this shattered pulverized land is like a symbol of age and corruption erosion seems to live only at the bottom of holes later almost dawn i can see red washing out the stars after sundown i entered the base through the airlock which still stands ten bodies are sprawled in what must have been the village square another was halfway into a suit in the administration building and the twelfth was a few feet from the bubble wall where i saw him yesterday a dozen bodies and they all died of blowout explosive decompression if you want to be technical the circular area under the bubble is only half full of buildings the rest is a carefully fused sand floor other buildings lie in stacks of walls ceilings floors ready to be put up i suppose the base personnel expected others from earth one of the buildings held electrical wiring ive hooked a cable to the airmaker battery and was able to adapt the other end to the contact on my fusion plant theres a lot of sparking but the airmaker works im letting it fill the stack of empty tanks i found against a pile of walls the nitrogen dioxide is draining into the bubble i know now what happened to the flatlander base bubbletown died by murder no question of it when nitrogen dioxide started pouring into the bubble i saw dust blowing out from the edge of town there was a rip it was sharpedged as if cut by a knife i can mend it if i can find a bubble repair kit there must be one somewhere meanwhile im getting oxygen and water the oxygen tanks i can empty into the lifesystem as they fill the ship takes it back out of the air and stores it if i can find a way to get the water here i can just pour it into the john can i carry it here in the tanks april dawn the administration building is also a tape library they kept a record of the base doings very complete and so far very boring it reads like ships log sounds but more gossipy and more detailed later ill read it all the way through i found some bubble plastic and contact cement and used them to patch the rip the bubble still wouldnt inflate so i went out and found two more rips just like the first i patched them and looked for more found three when i got them fixed it was nearly sunup the tanks hold water but i have to heat them to boil the water to get it out thats hard work question is it easier to do that or to repair the dome and do my electrolysis inside how many rips are there ive found six so how many killers were there no more than three ive accounted for twelve inside and according to the log there were fifteen in the second expedition no sign of the goldskins if theyd guessed i was here theyd have come by now with several months worth of air in my lifesystem ill be home free once i get out of this hole april two more rips in the bubble a total of eight theyre about twenty feet apart evenly spaced around the transparent plastic fabric it looks like at least one man ran around the dome slashing at the fabric until it wasnt taut enough to cut i mended the rips when i left the bubble it was swelling with air im halfway through the town log and nobodys seen a martian yet i was right thats what they came for thus far theyve found three more wells like the first these are made of cut diamond building blocks fairly large very well worn probably tens or hundreds of thousands of years old two of the four have dirty nitrogen dioxide at the bottoms the others are dry each of the four has a dedication block covered with queer partially eroded writing from a partial analysis of the script it seems that the wells were actually crematoriums a deceased martian would explode when he touched water in the nitrogen dioxide at the bottom it figures martians wouldnt have fire i still wonder why they came the men of the base what could martians do for them if they wanted someone to talk to someone not human there were dolphins and killer whales right in their own oceans the trouble they took and the risks just to get from one hole to another april strange for the first time since the landing i did not return to the ship when the sky turned light when i did start back the sun was up it showed as i went over the rim i stood there between a pair of sharp obsidian teeth staring down at my ship it looked like the entrance to confinement asteroid confinement is where they take women when they get pregnant a bubble of rock ten miles long and five miles across spinning on its axis to produce one gee of outward pull the children have to stay there for the first year and the law says they have to spend a month out of each year there until theyre fifteen ive a wife named letty waiting there now waiting for the year to pass so she can leave with our daughter janice most miners they pay the fatherhood fee in one lump sum if theyve got the money its about sixty thousand commercials so some have to pay in installments and sometimes its the woman who pays but when they pay they forget about it and leave the women to raise the kids but ive been thinking about letty and janice the monopoles in my hold would buy gifts for letty and raise janice with enough left over so she could do some traveling and still id have enough commercials left for more children id have them with letty if shed agree i think she would howd i get onto that as i was saying before i was so rudely interrupted my ship looks like the entrance to confinement or to farmers asteroid or any underground city with the fuel tanks gone theres nothing left but the drive and the lifesystem and a small magnetically insulated cargo hold only the top half of the lifesystem shows above the sea of dust a blunt steel bubble with a thick door not streamlined like a ship of earth the heavy drive tube bangs from the bottom far beneath the dust i wonder how deep the dust is the splashdown shell will leave a rim of congealed glass around my lifesystem i wonder if itll affect my takeoff anyway im losing my fear of daylight yesterday i thought the bubble was inflating it wasnt more rips were hidden under the pool of dust and when the pressure built up the dust blew away and down went the bubble i repaired four rips today before sunlight caught me one man couldnt have made all those slashes that fabrics tough would a knife go through it or would you need something else like an electric carving knife or a laser april i spent most of today reading the bubbletown log there was a murder tensions among fifteen men with no women around can grow pretty fierce one day a man named carter killed a man named harness then ran for his life in one of the marsbuggies chased by the victims brother neither came back alive they must have run out of air three dead out of fifteen leaves twelve since i counted twelve bodies whos left to slash the dome martians in the entire log i find no mention of a martian being seen bubbletown never ran across any martian artifact except the wells if there are martians where are they where are their cities mars was subjected to all kinds of orbital reconnaissance in the early days even a city as small as bubbletown would have been seen maybe there are no cities but where do the diamond blocks come from diamonds as big as the well material dont form naturally it takes a respectable technology to make them that big which implies cities i think that mummy could it have been hundreds of thousands of years old a man couldnt last that long on mars because the water in his body would react with the nitrogen dioxide around him on the moon he could last millions of years the mummified martians body chemistry was and is a complete mystery barring the napalmlike explosion when water touched it perhaps it was that durable and perhaps one of the pair who left to die returned to cut the dome instead and perhaps im seeing goblins this is the place for it if i ever get out of here you try and catch me near another hole april the sun shows clear and bright above a sharpedged horizon i stand at the port looking out nothing seems strange anymore ive lived here all my life the gravity is settling in my bones i no longer stumble as i go over the crater lip the oxygen in my tanks will take me anywhere give me hydrogen and youll find me on luna selling my monopoles without benefit of a middleman but it comes slowly i can get hydrogen only by carrying water here in the base tanks and then electrolyzing it into the fuelcooling tank where it liquifies the desert is empty except for a strange rosy cloud that covers one arm of horizon dust probably i heard the wind singing faintly through my helmet as i returned to the ship naturally the sound cant get through the hull the desert is empty i cant repair the bubble today i found four more rips before giving up they must circle the bubble all the way round one man couldnt have done it two men couldnt it looks like martians but where are they they could walk on the sand if their feet were flat and broad and webbed and thered be no footprints the dust hides everything if there were cities here the dust must have covered them ages ago the mummy wouldnt have shown webbing it would have been worn away now its starlessly black outside the thin wind must have little trouble lifting the dust i doubt it will bury me anyway the ship would rise to the surface gotta sleep april its ohfourhundred by the clock and i havent slept at all the sun is directly overhead blinding bright in a clear red sky no more dust storm the martians exist im sure of it nobody else was left to murder the base but why dont they show themselves im going to the base and im taking the log with me im in the village square oddly enough it was easier making the trip in sunlight you can see what youre stepping on even in shadow because the sky diffuses the light a little like indirect lighting in a dome city the crater lip looks down on me from all sides splintered shards of volcanic glass its a wonder i havent cut my suit open yet making that trip twice a day why did i come here i dont know my eyes feel rusty and theres too much light mummies surround me with faces twisted by anguish and despair and with fluids dried on their mouths blowout is an ugly death ten mummies here and one by the edge of town and one in the admin building i can see all of the crater lip from here the buildings are low bungalows and the square is big true the deflated bubble distorts things a little but not much so the martians came over the lip in a yelling swarm or a silent one brandishing sharp things nobody would have heard them if they yelled but ten men were in a position to see them eleven men theres a guy at the edge no they might have come from the other direction but still ten men and they just waited here i dont believe it the twelfth man hes half into a suit what did he see that they didnt im going to go look at him by god i was right hes got two fingers on a zipper and hes pulling down hes not half into a suit hes half out of it no more goblins but who cut the dome the hell with it im sleepy april a day and a half of log to catch up on my cooling tank is full or nearly im ready to try the might of the goldskins again theres air enough to let me take my time and less chance of a radar spotting me if i move slowly goodbye mars lovely paradise for the manicdepressive thats not funny consider the men in the base item it took a lot of knives to make those slits item everyone was inside item no martians they would have been seen therefore the slits were made from inside if someone was running around making holes in the bubble why didnt someone stop him it looks like mass suicide facts are facts they must have spread evenly out around the dome slashed and then walked to the town square against a driving wind of breathingair roaring out behind them why ask em the two who arent in the square may have been dissenters if so it didnt help them being stuck at the bottom of a hole is not good for a man look at the insanity records on earth i am now going back to a minutetominute log ready to prime drive the dust wont hurt the fusion tube nothing could do that but backblast might damage the rest of the ship have to risk it the first shot of plutonium didnt explode priming again the drives dead i dont understand it my instruments swear the fusion shield is drawing power and when i push the right button the hot uranium gas sprays in there whats wrong maybe a break in the primer line how am i going to find out the primer lines way down there under the dust ive sprayed enough uranium into the fusion tube to make a pinch bomb by now the dust must be hotter than washington how am i going to repair the primer line lift the ship in my strong capable hands swim down through the dust and do it by touch i havent anything thall do a welding job under ten feet of fine dust i think ive had it maybe theres a way to signal the goldskins a big black sos spread on the dust if i could find something black to spread around have to search the base again nothing in the town signaling devices in plenty for suits and marsbuggies and orbital ships but only the laser was meant to reach into space i cant fix a seventyyearold comm laser with spit and wire and good intentions im going off minutetominute therell be no takeoff april ive been stupid those ten suicides what did they do with their knives after they were through cutting where did they get them in the first place kitchen knives wont cut bubble plastic a laser might but there cant be more than a couple of portable lasers in the base i havent found any and the airmakers batteries were stone dead maybe the martians kill to steal power they wouldnt have fire then they took my uranium for the same reason slicing my primer line under the sand and running it into their own container but how would they get down there dive under the dust oh im getting out of here i made it to the crater god knows why they didnt stop me dont they care theyve got my primer fuel theyre under the dust they live there safe from meteors and violent temperature changes and they build their cities there too maybe theyre heavier than the dust so they can walk around on the bottom why there must be a whole ecology down there maybe onecelled plants on top to get energy from the sun to be driven down by currents in the dust and by dust storms to feed intermediate stages of life why didnt anybody look oh i wish i could tell someone i havent time for this the town tanks wont fit my suit valves and i cant go back to the ship within the next twentyfour hours ive got to repair and inflate the bubble or die of runout later done ive got my suit off and im scratching like a madman there were just three slits left to patch none at all along the edge of the bubble where i found the lone mummy i patched those three and the bubble swelled up like instant city when enough water flows in ill take a bath but ill take it in the square where i can see the whole rim i wonder how long it would take a martian to get over the rim and down here to the bubble wondering wont help i could still be seeing goblins april the water feels wonderful at least these early tourists took some luxuries with them i can see perfectly in all directions time has filmed the bubble a little merely enough to be annoying the sky is jet black cut raggedly in half by the crater rim ive turned on all the base lights they light the interior of the crater dimly but well enough so id see anything creeping down on me unfortunately they also dim out the stars the goblins cant get me while im awake but im getting sleepy is that a ship no just a meteor the skys lousy with meteors ive got nothing to do but talk to myself until something happens later i strolled up to the rim to see if my ship was still there the martians might have dragged it into the dust they hadnt and theres no sign of tampering am i seeing goblins i could find out all id have to do is peep into the base fusion plant either theres a pile there mostly lead by now or the pile was stolen seventy years ago either way the residual radiation would punish my curiosity im watching the sun rise through the bubble wall it has a strange beauty unlike anything ive seen in space ive seen saturn from an plenty of angles when i pulled monopoles in the rings but it cant compare to this now i know im crazy its a hole im at the bottom of the lousy hole the sun writes a jagged white line along the crater rim i can see the whole rim from here no fear of that no matter how fast they move i can get into my suit before they get down to me it would be good to see my enemy why did they come here the fifteen men who lived and died here i know why im here for love of money them too a hundred years ago the biggest diamonds men could make looked like coarse sand they may have come after the diamond wells but travel was fiendishly expensive then could they have made a profit or did they think they could develop mars the way they developed the asteroids ridiculous but they didnt have my hindsight and holes can be useful like the raw lead deposits along mercurys dawnside crescent pure lead condensed from dayside vapor free for the hauling wed be doing the same with martian diamonds if it werent so cheap to make them heres the sun an anticlimax i cant look into it though its dimmer than the rock miners sun no more postcard scenery till wups id never reach my suit one move and the bubble will be a sieve just now theyre as motionless as i am staring at me without eyes i wonder how they sense me their spears are poised and ready can they really puncture bubble fabric but the martians must know their own strength and theyve done this before all this time ive been waiting for them to swarm over the rim they came out of the dust pool in the bottom of the crater i should have realized the obsidian would be as badly cracked down there as elsewhere they do look like goblins for moments the silence was broken only by the twin humming of a nearby bumblebee and a distant tractor then lit reached to turn off the log he said wed have saved him if he could have held out you knew he was there yah the deimos scope watched him land we sent in a routine request for permission to land on un property unfortunately flatlanders cant move as fast as a drugged snail and we knew of no reason to hurry them up a telescope would have tracked muller if hed tried to leave was he nuts oh the martians were real enough but we didnt know that until way too late we saw the bubble inflate and stay that way for a while and we saw it deflate all of a sudden it looked like mullerd had an accident we broke the law and sent a ship down to get him if he was still alive and thats why im telling you all this garner as first speaker for the belt political section i hereby confess that two belt ships have trespassed on united nations property you had good reasons go on youd have been proud of him garner he didnt run for his suit he knew perfectly well it was too far away instead he ran toward an tank full of water the martians must have slashed the moment he turned but he reached the tank stepped through one of the holes and turned the tank on the martians in the low pressure it was like using a fire hose he got six before he fell they burned they did but not completely there are some remains we took three bodies along with their spears and left the others in situ you want the corpses damn right why what do you mean lit why do you want them we took three mummies and three spears as souvenirs to you theyre not souvenirs it was a belter who died down there im sorry lit but those bodies are important we can find out what a martians made of before we go down it could make all the difference go down lit made a rude noise luke why do you want to go down there what could you possibly want from mars revenge a million tons of dust abstract knowledge for what lit you amaze me why did earth go to space in the first place if not for abstract knowledge words crowded over each other to reach lits mouth they jammed in his throat and he was speechless he spread his hands made frantic gestures gulped twice and said its obvious tell me slow im a little dense theres everything in space monopoles metal vacuum for the vacuum industries a place to build cheap without all kinds of bracing girders free fall for people with weak hearts room to test things that might blow up a place to learn physics where you can watch it happen controlled environments was it all that obvious before we got here of course it was lit glared at his visitor the glare took in garners withered legs his drooping mottled hairless skin the decades that showed in his eyes and lit remembered his visitors age wasnt it bordered in black only one figure stood in the airlock though it was a cargo lock easily big enough to hold both men lean and sandy haired the tiny figure was obviously carver rappaport a bushy beard now covered half his face he waited patiently while the ramp was run up and then he started down turnbull waiting at the bottom suppressed growing uneasiness something was wrong hed known it the moment he heard that the overcee was landing the ship must have been in the solar system for hours why hadnt she called in and where was wall kameon returning spacers usually sprinted down the ramp eager to touch honest concrete again rappaport came down with slow methodical speed seen close his beard was ragged unkempt he reached bottom and turnbull saw that the square features were set like cement rappaport brushed past him and kept walking turnbull ran after him and fell into step looking and feeling foolish rappaport was a good head taller and where he was walking turnbull was almost running he shouted above the background noise of the spaceport rappaport wheres kameon like turnbull rappaport had to raise his voice dead dead was it the ship rappaport did the ship kill him no then what is his body aboard turnbull i dxont want to talk about it no his body isnt aboard his rappaport ground the heels of his hands into his eyes like a man with a blinding headache his grave he said emphasizing the word has a nice black border around it lets leave it at that but they couldnt of course two security officers caught up with them near the edge of the field stop him said turnbull and they each took an arm rappaport stopped walking and turned have you forgotten that im carrying a destruct capsule what about it for the moment turnbull really didnt understand what he meant any more interference and ill use it understand this turnbull i dont care any more project overcee is over i dont know where i go from here the best thing we can do is blow up that ship and stay in our own solar system man have you gone crazy what happened out there you meet aliens no comment no ill answer that one we didnt meet aliens now tell your comedian friends to let go turnbull let himself realize that the man wasnt bluffing rappaport was prepared to commit suicide turnbull the instinctive politician weighed changes and gambled if you havent decided to talk in twentyfour hours well let you go i promise that well keep you here til then by force if necessary just to give you an opportunity to change your mind rappaport thought it over the security men still held his arms but cautiously now standing as far back as they could in case his personal bomb went off seems fair he said at last if youre honest sure ill wait twentyfour hours good turnbull turned to lead the way back to his office instead he merely stared the overcee was red hot at the nose glaring white at the tail mechs and techs were running in all directions as turnbull watched the solar systems first fasterthanlight spacecraft slumped and ran in a spreading glowing pool it had started a century ago when the first ramrobots left the solar system the interstellar ramscoop robots could make most of their journey at near lightspeed using a conical electromagnetic fleld two hundred miles across to scoop hydrogen fuel from interstellar space but no man had ever ridden a ramrobot none ever would the ramscoop magnetic field did horrible things to chordate organisms each ramrobot had been programmed to report back only if it found a habitable world near the star to which it had been assigned twentysix had been sent out three had reported back so far it had started twelve years ago when a wellknown mathematician worked out a theoretical hyperspace over einsteinian fourspace he did it in his spare time he considered the hyperspace a toy an example of pure mathematics and when has pure mathematics been anything but good clean fun it had started ten years ago when ergstroms brother carl demonstrated the experimental reality of ergstroms toy universe within a month the un had financed project overcee put winston turnbull in charge and set up a school for fasterthanlight astronauts the vast number of applicants was winnowed to ten hypernauts two were belters all were experienced spacers the training began in earnest it lasted eight years while project overcee built the ship it had started a year and a month ago when two men climbed into the almost luxurious lifesystem of the overcee ran the ship out to neptunes orbit under escort and vanished one was back now his face was no stonier than turnbulls turnbull had just watched his work of the last ten years melt and run like quicksilver he was mad clean through but his mind worked furiously part of him the smaller part was wondering how he would explain the loss of ten billion dollars worth of ship the rest was reviewing everything it could remember about carver geoffrey rappaport and william kameon turnbull entered his office and went straight to the bookshelf sure that rappaport was following he pulled out a leatherbound volume did something to the binding and poured two paper cups full of amber fluid the fluid was bourbon and it was more than ice cold rappaport had seen this bookcase before yet he wore a faintly puzzled frown as he took a cup he said i didnt think id ever anticipate anything again the bourbon rappaport didnt answer his first swallow was a gulp did you destroy your ship yes i set the controls so it would only melt i didnt want anyone hurt commendable and the overcee motor you left it in orbit i hardlanded it on the moon its gone thats great just great carver that ship cost ten billion dollars to build we can duplicate it for four i think because we wont be making any false starts but you hell you wouldnt rappaport swirled the bourbon in his cup looking down into the miniature whirlpool he was twenty to thirty pounds lighter than he had been a year ago you build another overcee and youll be making one enormous false start we were wrong turnbull its not our universe theres nothing out there for us it is our universe turnbull let the quiet certainty show in his politicians voice he needed to start an argument he needed to get this man to talking but the certainty was real and always had been it was humanitys universe ready for the taking over the rim of his cup rappaport looked at him in exasperated pity turnbull cant you take my word for it its not our universe and its not worth having anyway whats out there is he clamped his mouth shut and turned away in the visitors chair turnbull waited ten seconds to point up the silence then he asked did you kill kameon kill wall youre out of your mind could you have saved him rappaport froze in the act of turning around no he said and again no i tried to get him moving but he wouldnt stop it stop needling me i can walk out anytime and you couldnt stop me its too late youve aroused my curiosity what about kameons blackbordered grave no answer rappaport you seem to think that the un will just take your word and dismantle project overcee theres not a prayer of that probability zero in the last century weve spent tens of billions of dollars on the ramrobots and the overcee and now we can rebuild her for four the only way to stop that is to tell the un exactly why they shouldnt rappaport didnt answer and turnbull didnt speak again he watched rappaports cigarette burning unheeded in the ashtray leaving a strip of charred wet paper it was uncharacteristic of the former carver rappaport to forget burning cigarettes or to wear an untrimmed beard and sloppily cut hair the man had been always clean shaven that man had lined up his shoes at night every night even when staggering drunk could he have killed kameon for being sloppy and then turned messy himself as he lost his selfrespect stranger things had happened in the days when it took eight months to reach mars no rappaport had not done murder turnbull would have bet high on that and kameon would have won any fair fight newspapermen had nicknamed him the wall when he was playing guard for the berlin nazis youre right where do i start turnbull was jerked out of his abstraction start at the beginning when you went into hyperspace we had no trouble there except with the windows you shouldnt have put windows on the overcee why not what did you see nothing well then you ever try to find your blind spot you put two dots on a piece of paper maybe an inch apart and you close one eye focus on one dot and slowly bring the paper up to your face at some point the other dot disappears looking at the window in overcee is like your blind spot expanding to a twofoot square with rounded corners i assume you covered them up sure would you believe it we had trouble finding those windows when you wanted them they were invisible we got them covered with blankets then every so often wed catch each other looking under the blankets it bothered wall worse than me we could have made the trip in five months instead of six but we had to keep coming out for a look around just to be sure the universe was still there right but you did reach sirius yes we reached sirius ramrobot had reported from sirius b half a century ago the sirius stars are an unlikely place to look for habitable worlds since both stars are bluewhite giants still the ramrobots had been programmed to test for excessive ultraviolet sirius b was worth a look the ship came out where sirius was two bright stars it turned its sharp nose toward the dimmer star and remained motionless for twenty minutes a silver torpedo shape in a great ungainly cradle studded with heavy electromagnetic motors then it was gone again now sirius b was a searing ball of light the ship began to swing about like a hound sniffing the breeze but slowly ponderously we found four planets said rappaport maybe there were more but we didnt look number four was the one we wanted it was a cloudy ball about twice the size of mars with no moon we waited until wed found it before we started celebrating champagne hah cigars and drunk pills and wall shaved off his grubby beard my god we were glad to be out in space again near the end it seemed like those blind spots were growing around the edges of the blankets we smoked our cigars and sucked our drunk pills and yakked about the broads wed known not that we hadnt done that before then we slept it off and went back to work the cloud cover was nearly unbroken rappaport moved the telescope a bit at a time trying to find a break he found several but none big enough to show him anything ill try infrared he said just get us down wall said irritably he was always irritable lately i want to get to work and i want to be sure weve got a place to land carvs job was the ship he was pilot astrogator repairman and everything but the cook wall was the cook wall was also the geologist astrophysicist biologist and chemist the expert on habitable planets in theory each man had been trained nine years for his job and each had some training as backup man for the other and in each case the training had been based largely on guesswork the picture on the scopescreen changed from a featureless disk to a patterned ball as carv switched to infrared now which is water he wondered the waters brighter on the night side and darker on the day side see wall was looking over his shoulder looks like about forty percent land carv those clouds might cut out enough of the ultraviolet to let people live in what gets through whod want to you couldnt see the stars carv turned a knob to raise the magnification hold it right there carv look at that theres a white line around the edge of that continent dried salt no its warmer than whats around it and its just as bright on the night side as on the day ill get us a closer look the overcee was in orbit three hundred miles up by now the continent with the hot border was almost entirely in shadow of the three supercontinents only one showed a white shoreline under infrared wall hung at the window looking down to rappaport be looked like a great ape can we do a reentry glide in this ship the overcee would come apart like a cheap meteor well have to brake to a full stop above the atmosphere want to strap down kameon did and carv watched him do it before he went ahead and dropped the overcee motor ill be glad to be out of here he thought its getting so wall and i hate the sight of each other the casual uncaring way kameon fastened his straps jarred his teeth he knew that kameon thought he was finicky to the point of psychasthenia the fusion drive started and built up to one gee carv swung the ship around only the night side showed below with the faint blue light of sirius a shining softly off the cloud cover then the edge of dawn came up in torn bluewhite cloud carv saw an enormous rift in the cloud bank and turned ship to shift their path over it mountains and valleys and a wide river patches of wispy cloud shot by obscuring the view but they could see down suddenly there was a black line a twisting ribbon of india ink and beyond that the ocean only for a moment the ocean showed and then the rift jogged east and was gone but the ocean was an emerald green walls voice was soft with awe carv theres life in that water you sure no it could be copper salts or something carv weve got to get down there oh wait your turn did you notice that your hot border is black in visible light yah but i cant explain it would it be worth our while to turn back after you get the ship slowed carv fingered his neatly trimmed vandyke itd be night over the whole continent before we got back there lets spend a few hours looking at that green ocean the overcee went down on her tail slowly like a cautious crab layer after layer of cloud swallowed her without trace and darkness fell as she dropped the key to this world was the word moonless sirius biv had had no oversized moon to strip away most of her atmosphere her air pressure would be comfortable at sea level but only because the planet was too small to hold more air that same low gravity produced a more gentle pressure gradient so that the atmosphere reached three times as high as on earth there were cloud layers from ground to kilometers up the overcee touched down on a wide beach on the western shore of the smallest continent wall came out first then carv lowered a metal oblong as large as himself and followed it down they wore lightly pressurized vac suits carv did nothing for twenty minutes while wall opened the box out flat and set the carefully packed instruments into their grooves and notches finally wall signaled in an emphatic manner by taking off his helmet carv waited a few seconds then followed suit wall asked were you waiting to see if i dropped dead better you than me carv sniffed the breeze the air was cool and humid but thin smells good enough no no it doesnt it smells like something rotting then im right theres life here lets get down to the beach the sky looked like a raging thunderstorm with occasional vivid blue flashes that might have been lightning they were flashes of sunlight penetrating tier upon tier of cloud in that varying light carv and wall stripped off their suits and went down to look at the ocean walking with shuffling steps in the light gravity the ocean was thick with algae algae were a bubbly green blanket on the water a blanket that rose and fell like breathing as the insignificant waves ran beneath the smell of rotting vegetation was no stronger here than it had been a quarter of a mile back perhaps the smell pervaded the whole planet the shore was a mixture of sand and green scum so rich that you could have planted crops in it time i got to work said wall you want to fetch and carry for me later maybe right now ive got a better idea lets get the hell out of each others sight for an hour that is brilliant but take a weapon to fight off maddened algae take a weapon carv was back at the end of an hour the scenery had been deadly monotonous there was water below a green blanket of scum six inches deep there was loamy sand and beyond that dry sand and behind the beach were white cliffs smoothed as if by countless rainfalls he had found no target for his laser cutter wall looked up from a binocular microscope and grinned when he saw his pilot he tossed a depleted pack of cigarettes and dont worry about the air plant he called cheerfully carv came up beside him what news its algae i cant name the breed but theres not much difference between this and any terrestrial algae except that this sample is all one species thats unusual carv was looking around him in wonder he was seeing a new side to wall aboard ship wall was sloppy almost to the point of being dangerous at least in the eyes of a belter like carv but now he was at work his small tools were set in neat rows on portable tables bulkier instruments with legs were on flat rock the legs carefully adjusted to leave their platforms exactly horizontal wall handled the binocular microscope as if it might dissolve at a touch it is said wall no little animalcules moving among the strands no variations in structure i took samples from depths up to six feet all i could find was the one algae but otherwise i even tested for proteins and sugars you could eat it we came all this way to find pond scum they came down on an island five hundred miles south this time carv helped with the collecting they got through faster that way but they kept getting in each others way six months spent in two small rooms had roused tempers too often it would take more than a few hours on ground before they could bump elbows without a fight again carv watched wall go through his routines he stood just within voice range about fifty yards away because it felt so good to have so much room the care wall exercised with his equipment still amazed him how could he reconcile it with walls ragged fingernails and his thirty hours growth of beard well wall was a flatlander all his life hed had a whole planet to mess up and not a crowded pressure dome or the cabin of a ship no flat ever learned real neatness same breed wall called did you test for radiation no why this thick air must screen out a lot of gamma rays that means your algae cant mutate without local radiation from the ground carv it had to mutate to get to its present form how could all its cousins just have died out thats your field a little later wall said i cant get a respectable background reading anywhere you were right but it doesnt explain anything shall we go somewhere else yah they set down in deep ocean and when the ship stopped bobbing carv went out the airlock with a glass bucket its a foot thick out there he reported no place for a disneyland i dont think id want to settle here wall sighed his agreement the green scum lapped thickly at the overcees gleaming metal hull two yards below the sill of the airlock a lot of planets must be like this said carv habitable but who needs it and i wanted to be the first man to found an interstellar colony and get your name in the newstapes the history books and my unforgettable face on every trivis in the solar system tell me shipmate if you hate publicity so much why have you been trimming that vandyke so prettily guilty i like being famous just not as much as you do cheer up then we may yet get all the hero worship we can stand this may be something bigger than a new colony what could be bigger than that set us down on land and ill tell you on a chunk of rock just big enough to be called an island wall set up his equipment for the last time he was testing for food content again using samples from carvs bucket of deep ocean algae carv stood by a comfortable distance away watching the weird variations in the clouds the very highest were moving across the sky at enormous speeds swirling and changing shape by the minutes and seconds the noonday light was subdued and early no doubt about it sirius biv had a magnificent sky okay im ready wall stood up and stretched this stuff isnt just edible id guess it would taste as good as the food supplements they were using on earth before the fertility laws cut the population down to something reasonable im going to taste it now the last sentence hit carv like an electric shock he was running before it was quite finished but long before he could get there his crazy partner had put a dollup of green scum in his mouth chewed and swallowed good he said youutterdamnedfool not so i knew it was safe the stuff had an almost cheesy flavor you could get tired of it fast i think but thats true of anything just what are you trying to prove that this alga was tailored as a food plant by biological engineers carv i think weve landed on somebodys private farm carv sat heavily down on a rainwashed white rock better spell that out he said and heard that his voice was hoarse i was going to suppose there was a civilization that had cheap fast interstellar travel most of the habitable planets they found would be sterile wouldnt they i mean life is an unlikely sort of accident we dont have the vaguest idea how likely it is all right pass that say somebody finds this planet sirius biv and decides it would make a nice farm planet it isnt good for much else mainly because of the variance in lighting but if you dropped a specially bred food alga in the ocean youd have a dandy little farm in ten years thered be oceans of algae free for the carting later if they did decide to colonize they could haul the stuff inland and use it for fertilizer best of all it wouldnt mutate not here carv shook his head to clear it youve been in space too long carv the plant looks bred like a pink grapefruit and where did all its cousins go now i can tell you they got poured out of the breeding vat because they werent good enough low waves rolled in from the sea low and broad beneath their blanket of cheesy green scum all right said carv how can we disprove it wall looked startled disprove it why would we want to do that forget the glory for a minute if youre right were trespassing on somebodys property without knowing anything about the owner except that hes got dirtcheap interstellar travel which would make him a tough enemy were also introducing our body bacteria onto his pure edible algae culture and how would we explain if he suddenly showed up i hadnt thought of it that way we ought to cut and run right now its not as if the planet was worth anything no no we cant do that why not the answer gleamed in walls eyes turnbull listening behind his desk with his chin resting in one hand interrupted for the first time in minutes a good question id have gotten out right then not if youd just spent six months in a tworoom cell with the end of everything creeping around the blankets i see turnbulls hand moved almost imperceptibly writing no windows in overcee oversized viewscreen it hadnt hit me that hard i think id have taken off if id been sure wall was right and if i could have talked him into it but i couldnt of course just the thought of going home then was enough to set wall shaking i thought i might have to knock him on the head when it came time to leave we had some hibernation drugs aboard just in case he stopped as usual turnbull waited him out but then id have been all alone rappaport finished his drink his second and got up to pour a third the bourbon didnt seem to affect him so we stood there on that rocky beach both of us afraid to leave and both afraid to stay abruptly wall got up and started putting his tools away we cant disprove it but we can prove it easily enough the owners must have left artifacts around if we find one we run i promise theres a big area to search if we had any sense wed run now will you drop that all weve got to do is find the ramrobot probe if theres anyone watching this place they must have seen it come down well find footprints all over it and if there arent any footprints does that make the whole planet clean wall closed his case with a snap then he stood motionless looking very surprised i just thought of something he said oh not again no this is for real carv the owners must have left a long time ago why it must be thousands of years since there were enough algae here to use as a food supply we should have seen ships taking off and landing as we came in theyd have started their colony too if they were going to now its gone beyond that the planet isnt fit for anything to live on with the soupy oceans and the smell of things rotting no dammit it makes sense its thin it sounds thin even to me and i want to believe it also its too pat its just too close to the best possible solution we could dream up you want to bet our lives on it wall hoisted his case and moved toward the ship he looked like a human tank moving in a stormy darkness lit by shifting glaring beams of blue light abruptly he said theres one more point that black border it has to be contaminated algae maybe a landliving mutant thats why it hasnt spread across the oceans it would have been cleaned away if the owners were still interested all right hoist that thing up and lets get inside hmph youve finally said something we can check the eastern shore must be in daylight by now lets get aboard at the border of space they hovered and the sun rappaport burned small and blinding white at the horizon to the side sirius a was a tiny dot of intense brilliance below where gaps in the cloud cover penetrated all the way to the surface a hairthin black line ran along the twisting beach of sirius bivs largest continent the silver thread of a major river exploded into a forking delta and the delta was a black triangle shot with lines of silvery green going to use the scope carv shook his head well see it close in a few minutes youre in quite a hurry carv you bet according to you if that black stuff is some form of life then this farms been deserted for thousands of years at least if it isnt then what is it its too regular to be a natural formation maybe its a conveyor belt thats right calm me down reassure me if it is we go up fast and run all the way home carv pulled a lever and the ship dropped from under them they fell fast speaking with only half his attention carv went on weve met just one other sentient race and they had nothing like hands and no mechanical culture im not complaining mind you a world wouldnt be fit to live in without dolphins for company but why should we get lucky twice we dont want to meet the farmer wall the clouds closed over the ship she dropped more slowly with every kilometer ten kilometers up she was almost hovering now the coast was spread below them the black border was graded black as night on pluto along the sea shading off to the color of the white sand and rocks along the landward side wall said maybe the tides carry the dead algae inland theyd decay there no that wont work no moon nothing but solar tides they were a kilometer up and lower and lower the black was moving flowing like tar away from the drives fusion flame rappaport had been talking down into his cup his words coming harsh and forced his eyes refusing to meet turnbulls now he raised them there was something challenging in that gaze turnbull understood you want me to guess i wont what was the black stuff i dont know if i want to prepare you or not wall and i we werent ready why should you be all right carver go ahead and shock me it was people turnbull merely stared we were almost down when they started to scatter from the downblast until then it was just a dark field but when they started to scatter we could see moving specks like ants we sheered off and landed on the water offshore we could see them from there carver when you say people do you mean people human yes human of course they didnt act much like it a hundred yards offshore the overcee floated nose up even seen from the airlock the natives were obviously human the telescope screen brought more detail they were no terrestrial race nine feet tall men and women both with wavy black hair growing from the eyebrows back to halfway down the spine hanging almost to the knees their skins were dark as dark as the darkest negro but they had chisel noses and long heads and small thinlipped mouths they paid no attention to the ship they stood or sat or lay where they were men and women and children jammed literally shoulder to shoulder most of the seaside population was grouped in large rings with men on the outside and women and children protected inside all around the continent said wall carv could no more have answered than he could have taken his eyes off the scope screen every few minutes there was a seething in the mass as some group that was too far back pulled forward to reach the shore the food supply the mass pushed back on the fringes of the circles there were bloody fights slow fights in which there were apparently no rules at all how said carv how wall said maybe a ship crashed maybe there was a caretakers family here and nobody ever came to pick them up they must be the farmers children carv how long have they been here thousands of years at least maybe tens or hundreds of thousands wall turned his empty eyes away from the screen he swiveled his couch so he was looking at the back wall of the cabin his dreary words flowed out into the cabin picture it carv nothing in the world but an ocean of algae and a few people then a few hundred people then hundreds of thousands theyd never have been allowed near here unless theyd had the bacteria cleaned out of them to keep the algae from being contaminated nothing to make tools out of nothing but rock and bone no way of smelting ores because they wouldnt even have fire theres nothing to burn they had no diseases no contraceptives and no recreation but breeding the population would have exploded like a bomb because nobody would starve to death carv for thousands of years nobody would starve on sirius biv theyre starving now some of them the ones that cant reach the shore wall turned back to the scope screen one continual war he said after awhile ill bet their height comes from natural selection carv hadnt moved for a long time he had noticed that there were always a few men inside each protective circle and that there were always men outside going inside and men inside going outside breeding more people to guard each circle more people for sirius biv the shore was a seething blackness in infrared light it would have shown brightly at a temperature of degrees fahrenheit lets go home said wall okay and did you no in gods name why not we couldnt we had to see it all turnbull i dont understand it but we did both of us so i took the ship up and dropped it a kilometer inshore and we got out and started walking toward the sea right away we started finding skeletons some were clean a lot of them looked like egyptian mummies skeletons with black dried skin stretched tight over the bones always there was a continuous low rustle of well i guess it was conversation from the beach i dont know what they could have had to talk about the skeletons got thicker as we went along some of them had daggers of splintered bone one had a chipped stone fist ax you see turnbull they were intelligent they could make tools if they could find anything to make tools out of after wed been walking awhile we saw that some of the skeletons were alive dying and drying under that overcast blue sky id thought that sky was pretty once now it was horrible you could see a shifting blue beam spear down on the sand and sweep across it like a spotlight until it picked out a mummy sometimes the mummy would turn over and cover its eyes walls face was livid like a dead mans i knew it wasnt just the light wed been walking about five minutes and the dead and living skeletons were all around us the live ones all stared at us apathetically but still staring as if we were the only things in the world worth looking at if they had anything to wonder with they must have been wondering what it was that could move and still not be human we couldnt have looked human to them we had shoes and coveralls on and we were too small wall said ive been wondering about the clean skeletons there shouldnt be any decay bacteria here i didnt answer i was thinking how much this looked like a combination of hell and belsen the only thing that might have made it tolerable was the surrealistic blue lighting we couldnt really believe what we were seeing there werent enough fats in the algae said wall there was enough of everything else but no fats we were closer to the beach now and some of the mummies were beginning to stir i watched a pair behind a dune who looked like they were trying to kill each other and then suddenly i realized what wall had said i took his arm and turned to go back some of the long skeletons were trying to get up i knew what they were thinking there may be meat in those limp coverings wet meat with water in it there just may i pulled at wall and started to run he couldnt run he tried to pull loose i had to leave him they couldnt catch me they were too starved and i was jumping like a grasshopper but they got wall all right i heard his destruct capsule go off just a muffled pop so you came home uh huh rappaport looked up like a man waking from a nightmare it took seven months all alone any idea why wall killed himself you crazy he didnt want to get eaten then why wouldnt he run it wasnt that he wanted to kill himself turnbull he just decided it wasnt worthwhile saving himself another six months in the overcee with the blind spots pulling at his eyes and that nightmare of a world constantly on his mind it wasnt worth it ill bet the overcee was a pigpen before you blew it up rappaport flushed whats that to you you didnt think it was worthwhile either when a belter stops being neat its because he wants to die a dirty ship is deadly the air plant gets fouled things float around loose ready to knock your brains out when the drive goes on you forget where you put the meteor patches all right i made it didnt i and now you think we should give up space rappaports voice went squeaky with emotion turnbull arent you convinced yet weve got a paradise here and you want to leave it for that why why to build other paradises maybe ours didnt happen by accident our ancestors did it all starting with not much more than what was on sirius biv they had a helluva lot more a faint slurring told that the bourbon was finally getting to rappaport maybe they did at that but now theres a better reason these people you left on the beach they need our help and with a new overcee we can give it to them what do they need most carver trees or meat animals animals rappaport shuddered and drank well that could be argued but pass it first well have to make soil turnbull leaned back in his chair face upturned talking half to himself algae mixed with crushed rock bacteria to break the rock down earthworms then grass got it all planned out do you and youll talk the un into it too turnbull youre good but youve missed something better tell me now then rappaport got carefully to his feet he came over to the desk just a little unsteadily and leaned on it so that he stared down into turnbulls eyes from a foot away youve been assuming that those people on the beach really were the farmers race that sirius biv has been deserted for a long long time but what if some kind of carnivore seeded that planet then what the algae wouldnt be for them theyd let the algae grow plant food animals then go away until the animals were jammed shoulder to shoulder along the coast food animals you understand turnbull yes i hadnt thought of that and theyd breed them for size the room was deadly quiet well well well simply have to take that chance wont we like banquos ghost on a hot lovely fall day i drove out to stardrive laboratories if all went well that was the day the snarkhunter probe would send its final message from alpha centauri the times had assigned me to cover the event there were coffee and donuts in the anteroom a diverse lot milled about and introduced each other and shook hands and talked pretty secretaries moved briskly through the crowd i recognized people id talked to when i was here two months ago and one i knew only from his picture jubal hendricks senior had managed stardrive labs thirty years ago when snarkhunter was launched hed retired just afterward but here he was emaciated and tottering to watch his projects end i headed for the coffee table the man everyone called butch saw me coming and drew me a cup he was five feet tall the color of mahogany his bright blond hair cut short in a butch cut how good to see you again mr lane he pumped my hand with enthusiasm you do remember me of course butch very well indeed i didnt remember his full name but then nobody did and nobody else seemed to want to talk to him how have you been very well mr lane despite my allergies i have been taking shots they seem to help i said last time id seen him his nose had dripped constantly your accent has improved too he laughed selfconsciously it is nearly eight oclock shall we move into the his tongue stumbled and he had to point the auditorium yes lets two months ago wed been here to catch the first signals from the snarkhunter probe as it entered the vicinity of alpha centauri the probe had been flying since before i was born but that had been its first message since leaving the solar system on that occasion it had switched itself on on schedule then given us the sizes and locations of the centaurus planets the speed of light barred us from controlling the snarkhunter from earth the probe had been programmed to choose the planet most likely to be earthlike and to home on it we had named that planet centaura even before we knew it existed thirty years ago when it was known only that the centauri suns had planets centaura did exist we knew that now for the last two months the snarkhunter should have been moving toward it the auditorium hadnt changed much in that time stardrive labs uses the same building for all its publicity on all the probes it currently has flying but none of those probes had done anything interesting since the snarkhuners last report there were seventy chairs with ashtrays fixed to the backs set up to face a lighted screen the screen showed a plot of the sharkhunters presumed position with respect to the planet centaura arrows pointed in the directions of earth and alpha centauri a naturally the plot was years out of date due to light lag hanging from the ceiling were eight tv screens each presently showing a diagram of the alpha centauri a system in one corner of the big room was a blank sphere eight feet across with a clear plastic hyperbola mounted near it that was new butch pointed the curve is the projected course of the snarkhunter mr hendricks junior tells me they will draw continents on the sphere as the data arrives naturally i said we found seats i manfully resisted the urge to smoke that being one of butchs allergies time stopped i took my coffee in gulps id been up at six oclock for the first time in years my eyes felt gummy my mouth was centuries old most of the seats were empty even under the circumstances the lack of excitement was remarkable on screen were a blank circle and a hyperbola and a couple of arrows and a little rectangle showing the time remaining until perihelion the rectangle changed every five minutes and a new point appeared on the hyperbola showing the new position of the snarkhunter instrument package from time to time a blurred radio voice echoed in the auditorium i am amazed butch said fervently to think that it has come so far do you think it will fulfill its purpose as you say its come this far i cannot understand why there is so little excitement he couldnt could he its partly the time lag i said who can get excited about old news i suppose so still so much hinges on the success of the project my caps empty can i get you some coffee oh no no thank you i went out and filled my cup then stayed in the anteroom to smoke a cigarette things were happening too slowly thirty years the probe had been on its way but the hours it needed to round centaura were far too long maybe butch was getting on my nerves not his fault of course he was unfailingly polite you couldnt quarrel with his enthusiasm it was genuine it only seemed a mockery and i had to stick with him butchs reactions were bigger news by far than the snarkhunter itself i spent ten minutes by the coffee dispenser waiting for interviewees it was the one sure place to find anyone you wanted to see i caught hendricks senior and hendricks junior markham who had launched the snarkhunter and duryodhana who ran the project now and several others butch couldnt stand coffee what had he been doing out here by the coffee dispenser just what i was doing of course waiting for people to speak to him and nobody wanted to i was heading for my seat when the radio cleared its throat we are receiving the carrier wave from snarkhunter snarkhunter has located sol and is transmitting correctly repeat location successful we are now receiving snarkhunter the air was full of a twotone musical note the sound of the carrier wave low and sweet butch was hugging his knees in delight wonderful what is it telling them why doesnt he say the snarkhunter isnt saying anything i told him id gotten that information from my interviews its just a locator wave to alert us what kind of wave is the probe using a light beam a ruby laser hear that musical tone thats the laser translated into sound and then stepped down to the audible range the point on the screen moved another notch ten minutes to perihelion the radio voice said we have received our first burst of data from snarkhunter composition of centauras atmosphere is as follows oxygen sixteen percent nitrogen eightythree percent it continued detailing carbon dioxide noble gases water vapor ozone surface pressure and the planees surface temperature and magnetic field butch hugged his knew and made sounds of pleasure marvelous he enthused marvelous from such a distance how sensitive how versatile the instruments to me it all seems anticlimactic i fear that is my own fault i am sorry the radio saved me from having to answer decoding of snarkhunters transmission is now in progress in a few minutes we should have a rough map of centauras surface it added snarkhunter is about to pass behind the planet it will reach perihelion three minutes later the auditorium became silent i made a shushing motion at butch we heard only the musical sound of the carrier wave the sound cut off abruptly it will not reappear butch said sadly thats a pity it was programmed to take another set of measurements at perihelion they would have been a little more accurate the point on the screen moved a notch to its point of closest approach to centaura is that where you shot it down yes at perihelion said butch how were we to know it was not hostile we would not have believed it was possible at all an instrument package with no external guidance finding its way over such a distance he stood up a remarkable achievement remarkable to have done so much with so little thanks i said thanks for the pat on the head then youll go ahead with the trade i will have to wait said butch to see if your map of our world is accurate thus far your measurements have been excellent unbelievably so if your map is as good we have a bargain we will trade you our fasterthanlight drive for your incredible probes together we will explore space fine i had what i came for i rose to leave it has been a lonely year said butch i do not think i knew why until now mr lane please dont be offended did my landing a year ago cause your people to regard their own technology as inferior of course why wouldnt it our lousy little probe took thirty years to reach centaura your ship took six months and here you are like the ghost at the banquet oh damn im sorry butch i lost my head and so you all tend to avoid me but my own people felt the same way when your probe reached us four point three years ago our fasterthanlight drive was a single lucky discovery your probe was the combined result of centuries of singleminded terribly expensive labor and experimentation we are awed we are not capable of such sustained effort but you cannot believe that can you i couldnt and i cant one face an alarm rang a rising falling crescendo a mechanical shriek of panic the baritone voice of the ships brain blared strac astrophysics is not in his cabin strac astrophysics report to your cabin immediatelyl the hogans goat will jump in sixty seconds verd sat bolt upright then forced himself to lie down again the hogans goat had not lost a passenger through carelessness in all the nearly two centuries of verds captaincy passengers were supposed to be careless if strac didnt reach his room verd would have to postpone jump to save his life a serious breach of custom above the green coffin which was his jump couch the brain said strac astrophysics is in his cabin and protected verd relaxed five said the brain four three in various parts of the ship twentyeight bodies jerked like springs released oof came a complaint from the jump couch next to verds that felt strange damn strange um said verd lourdi coursefinder tumbled out of her jump couch she was a blend of many subdivisions of man bearing the delicate willowy beauty born of lowgravity worlds she was verds wife and an experienced traveler now she looked puzzled and disturbed jump never felt like that what do you suppose verd grunted as he climbed out he was a few pounds overweight his face was beefy smooth and unlined fashionably hairless so was his scalp except for a narrow strip of black brush which ran straight up from between his brow ridges and continued across his scalp and downward until it faded out near the small of his back most of the hair had been surgically implanted neither wrinkled skin nor width of hair strip could number a mans years and superficially verd might have been anywhere from twenty to four hundred years old it was in his economy of movement that his age showed he did things the easy way the fast way he never needed more than seconds to find it and he always took that time the centuries had taught him well i dont know he said lets find out what it was brain he snapped at a wall speaker the silence stretched like a nerve brain one wall arced over to become the ceiling another jogged inward to leave room for a piece of the total conversion drive a third was all controls and indicators for the ships brain this was the crew common room it was big and comfortable a good place to relax and no crewman minded its odd shape flat ceilings were for passengers verd spacercaptain lourdi coursefinder and parliss lifesystems sat along one wall watching the fourth member of the crew chanda metalminds was a tall plain woman whose major beauty was her wavy black hair a strip three inches wide down the center of her scalp had been allowed to grow until it hung to the region of her coccyx satin black and satin smooth it gleamed and rippled as she moved she stood before the biggest of the brain screens which now showed a diagram of the hogans goat and she used her finger as a pointer the rock hit here chandas finger rested almost halfway back along the spinal maze of lines and little black squares which represented the jumper section the hogans goat was a sculptured torpedo and the jumper machinery was its rounded nose and its thick spine and its trailing wasplike sting you could see it in the diagram the rest of the goat had been designed to fit the jumper and the jumper was cut by a slanting line bright red next to chandas fingertip it was a chunk of dirty ice a typical piece of comet head said chanda the meteor gun never had a chance at it it was too close for that when we came out of overspace impact turned the intruder to plasma in the jumper the plasma cone knocked some secondary bits of metal loose and they penetrated here that rained droplets of highspeed molten metal all through the ships brain parliss whistled he was tall ash blond and very young thatll soften her up he murmured irreverently he winced under chandas glare and added sorry chanda held the glare a moment before she continued theres no chance of repairing the brain ourselves there are too many points of injury and most of them too small to find fortunately the brain can still solve problems and obey orders our worst problem seems to be this motor aphasia the brain cant speak not in any language ive circumvented that by instructing the brain to use winsel code since i dont know the extent of the damage precisely i recommend we land the passengers by tug instead of trying to land the goat verd cringed at the thought of what the tug captains would say is that necessary yes verd i dont even know how long the brain will answer to winsel code it was one of the first things i tried i didnt really expect it to work and i doubt it would on a human patient thanks chanda verd stood up and the brain surgeon sat down all i have to say group is that were going to take a bad loss this trip the brain is sure to need expensive repairs and the jumper will have to be almost completely torn out it gave one awful discharge when the meteor hit and a lot of parts are fused lourdi whats wrong we can afford it lourdis face was bloodless her delicate surgeons fingers strangled the arms of her chair come on verd said gently what could have driven her into such a panic we land on earth and take a vacation while the orbital repair companies do the worrying whats wrong with that lourdi gave her head a spastic shake we cant do that oh eye of kdapt i didnt dare believe it verd weve got to fix the jumper out here not a chance but then weve got trouble lourdi had calmed a little but it was the calm of defeat i couldnt ask the brain to do it so i used the telescope myself thats not sol the others looked at her its not the sun its a greenishwhite dwarf a dead i star i couldnt find the sun once it had its orders the brain was much faster with the telescope than lourdi it confirmed her description of the star which was where sol should have been and added that it was no star in the brains catalogue furthermore the brain could not recognize the volume of space around it it was still scanning stars hoping to find its bearings but the rock hit after we came out of overspace after verd said between his teeth how could we have gone anywhere else nobody was listening they sat in the crew common room drinking droobleberry juice and vodka well have to tell the passengers something said chanda nobody answered though she was dead right interstellar law gave any citizen free access to a computer in space the appropriate computer was a ships brain by now the passengers must have discovered that the brain was incommunicado lourdi stopped using her glass to make rings on the tabletop chanda will you translate for me chanda looked up of course ask the brain to find the planet in this system which most resembles saturn saturn chandas homely face lost its hopeful expression nonetheless she began tapping on the rim of a brain speaker with the end of a stylus tapping in therhythms of winsel code almost immediately a line of short and long white dashes began moving left to right across the top of the brain screen the screen itself went white cleared showed what looked like a picture of saturn but the ring showed too many gaps too well defined chanda said fifth major planet from primary six moons period years distance from sun au diameter miles type gas giant so lourdi nodded verd and parliss were watching her intently ask it to show us the second and third planets the second planet was in its quarter phase the brain screen showed it looking like a large moon but less badly pocked and with a major difference the intensely bright area across the middle chanda translated the marching dots distance au period diameter miles no moons no air the third planet thats mars said lourdi it was and the second planet was earth i believe i know what has happened verd was almost shouting twentyseven faces looked back at him across the dining room he was addressing crew and passengers and he had to face them in person for the brain could no longer repeat his words over the stateroom speakers you know that a jumper creates an overspace in which the speed of light becomes infinite in the neighborhood of the ship when almost infinite said a passenger thats a popular misconception verd snapped he found that he did not like public speaking not under these conditions with an effort he resumed his speaking voice the speed of light goes all the way to infinity our speed is kept finite by the braking spine which projects out of the effective neighborhood otherwise wed go simultaneous wed be everywhere at once along a great circle of the universe the braking spine is that thing like a long stinger that points out behind the ship well there was a piece of ice in our way inside the range of our meteor gun when we came out of overspace it went through the jumper and into the brain the damage to the brain is secondary something happened to the jumper while the meteor was in there maybe some metal vaporized and caused a short circuit anyway the goat jumped back into the counterpart of overspace verd stopped was he talking over their heads you understand that when we say we travel in an overspace of einsteinian space we really mean a subspace of that overspace a score of blank faces looked back at him doggedly verd went on we went into the counterpart of that subspace the speed of light went to zero a murmur of whispering rose and fell nobody laughed the braking spine stuck out or wed have been in there until the bitter end of time well then in a region around the ship the speed of light was zero our mass was infinite our clocks and hearts stopped the ship became an infinitely thin disk this state lasted for no time in ships time but when it ended several billion years had passed a universal gasp then pandemonium verd had expected it he waited it out billion kdapt stomp it oh my god practical joke marna i must say shut up and let him finish the shouting died away a last voice shouted but if our mass was infinite only in a region around the ship oh said a dark stick figure verd recognized as strac astrophysics visibly he shrugged off a vision of suns and galaxies snatched brutally down upon his cringing head by the goats infinite gravity the zero effect has been used before verd continued in the relative quiet for suspended animation for very longrange time capsules et cetera to my knowledge it has never happened to a spacecraft our position is very bad the sun has become a greenishwhite dwarf the earth has lost all its air and has become a oneface world it turns one side forever to the sun mercury isnt there anymore neither is the moon you can forget the idea of going home and say goodbye to anyone you knew outside this ship this is the universe ourselves and nobody else and our only duty is to survive we will keep you informed of developments anyone who wishes his passage money refunded is welcome to it in a crackle of weak graveyard laughter verd bobbed his head in dismissal the passengers werent taking the hint hearing the captain in person was as unique to them as it was to verd they sat looking at each other and a few got up changed their minds and sat down again one called what will you do next ask the brain for suggestions said verd out now wed like to stay and listen said the same man he was short and broad and big footed probably from one of the heavier planets and he had the roughedged compactness of a landtank weve the legal right to consult the brain at my time if it takes a translator we should have a translator verd nodded thats true without further comment he turned to chanda and said ask the brain what actions will maximize our chance of survival for maximal time chanda tapped her stylus rhythmically against the rim of the brain speaker the dining area was raucous with the sound of breathing and the stealthy shuffling of feet everyone seemed to be leaning forward the brain answered in swiftly moving dots of light chanda said immediately replace eye of kdapt chanda looked very startled then grinned around at verd sorry captain immediately replace verd spacercaptain with strac astrophysics in supreme command over hogans goat in the confusion that followed verds voice was easily the loudest everybody out everybody but strac astrophysics miraculously he was obeyed strac was a long tall oldster old in habits and manners and mode of dress a streak of blackenameled steel wool emphasized his chocolate scalp and his ears spread like wings once verd had wondered why strac didnt have them fixed lafer he had stopped wondering strac obviously made a fetish of keeping what he was born with his hairline began not between his eyes but at the very top of his forehead and it petered out on his neck his fingernails grew naturally they must have needed constant trimming he sat facing the members of the crew waiting without impatience i believe youve traveled on my ship before said verd have you ever said or done anything to give the brain or any passenger the idea that you might want to command the hogans goat certainly not strac seemed as ruffled by the suggestion as verd himself the brain must be insane he muttered venomously then his own words backlashed him and in fear he asked could the brain be insane no chanda answered brains of this type can be damaged they can be destroyed but if they come up with an answer its the right one theres a builtin doubt factor any ambiguity gives you an insufficient data then why would it try to take my command i dont know captain theres something i should tell you whats that the brain has stopped answering questions there seems to be some progressive deterioration going on it stopped even before the passengers left if i give it orders in winsel it obeys but it wont answer back oh kdapt take the brain verd rubbed his temples with his fingertips parliss what did the brain know about strac same as any other passenger name profession medical state and history mass world of origin thats all hmph strac where were you born the canyon said strac is that germane i dont know canyon is a lonely place to grow up i imagine it is in a way three hundred thousand is a tiny population for a solar system but theres no room for more above the canyon rim the airs too thin to breathe i got out as soon as i could havent been back in nearly a century i see captain i doubt that in the canyon theres no lack of company its the culture thats lonely everybody thinks just like everybody else youd say theres no cultural crossfertilization the pressure to conform is brutal interesting said verd but his tone dismissed the subject strac do you have any bright ideas that the brain might have latched onto somehow or do you perhaps have a reputation so large in scientific circles that the brain might know of it im sure thats not the case well do you have any ideas at all we need them badly im afraid not captain just what is our position it seems that everyone is dead but us how do we cope with an emergency like that we dont said verd not without time travel and thats impossible it is isnt it of course chanda exactly what did you ask the brain how did you phrase it maximize the probability of our surviving for maximum time thats what you asked for excuse me captain but the brain almost certainly assumed that maximum time meant forever all right parliss how long will the ship keep us going parliss was only thirty years old and burdened with youths habitual unsureness but he knew his profession well enough a long time captain decades maybe centuries theres some boosterspice seeds in our consignment for the zoo of earth if we could grow boosterspice aboard ship we could keep ourselves young the air plant will work as long as theres sunlight or starlight but the food converter well it cant make elements and eventually theyll get lost somewhere in the circuit and well start getting deficiency diseases and hmmm i could probably keep us alive for a century and a half and if we institute cannibalism we could never mind lets call that our limit if we stay in space weve got other choices strac none of them pleasant we can get to any planet in the solar system using the matterconversion drive weve enough solid chemical fuel in the landing rockets to land us on any world the size of venus or smaller with the matterconversion drive we can take off from anywhere but the photon beam would leave boiling rock behind us we can do all that but theres no point to it because nothing in the solar system is habitable if i may interrupt said strac why do we have a matterconversion drive excuse me the hogans goat has the jumper to move between worlds and the solids to land and take off why does such a ship need another reaction drive is the jumper so imprecise oh no thats not it you see the math of jumper travel postulates a figure for the mass of a very large neighborhood a neighborhood that takes in most of the local group of galaxies that figure is almost twice the actual rest mass in the neighborhood so we have to accelerate until the external universe is heavy enough for us to use the jumper i see even with total mass conversion we have to carry a tremendous mass of fuel we use neutronium anything less massive would take up too much room then without the artificial gravity to protect us it would take over a year to reach the right velocity the drive gives us a good one hundred gee in uncluttered space verd grinned at stracs awed expression we dont advertise that passengers might start wondering what would happen if the artificial gravity went off where was i third choice we can go on to other stars each trip would take decades but by refueling in each system we could reach a few nearby stars in the hundred and fifty years parliss gives us but every world we ever used must be dead by now and the gtype stars we can reach in the time weve got may have no useful worlds it would be a gamble strac shifted uneasily it certainly would we dont necessarily need a gtype sun we can settle under any star that wont roast us with ultraviolet but habitable planets are rare enough cant you order the brain to search out a habitable planet and go there no said lourdi from across the room the telescope isnt that good not when it has to peer out of one gravity well into another the light gets all bent up and finally said verd if we did land on an earthsized planet that looked habitable and then found out it wasnt we wouldnt have the fuel to land anywhere else well what do you think strac appeared to consider i think ill go have a drink i think ill have several i wish youd kept our little predicament secret a few centuries longer he rose with dignity and turned to the door then spoiled the exit by turning back by the way captain have you ever been to a oneface world or have your travels been confined to the habitable worlds ive been to the earths moon but thats all why im not sure said strac and he left looking thoughtful verd noticed that he turned right the bar was aft of the dining room to the left gloom settled over the dining area verd fumbled in his belt pouch brought forth a white tube not much bigger than a cigarette eyes fixed morosely on a wall he hung the tube between his lips sucked through it inhaled at the side of his mouth he exhaled cool thick orange smoke the muscles around his eyes lost a little of their tension chanda spoke up captain ive been wondering why the brain didnt answer me directly why it didnt just give us a set of detailed instructions me too have you got an answer it must have computed just how much time it had before its motor aphasia became complete so instead of trying to give a string of detailed instructions it would never finish it just named the person most likely to have the right answer it gave us what it could in the few seconds it had left but why strac why not me or one of you i dont know chanda said wearily the damage to the brain had hit her hard not surprising she had always treated the brain like a beloved but retarded child she closed her eyes and began to recite name profession mass world of origin medical history strac astrophysics the canyon in the next few days each member of the crew was busy at his own specialty lourdi coursefinder spent most of her time at the telescope it was a powerful instrument and she had the brains limited help but the worlds of even the nearest stars were only circular dots the sky was thick with black suns visible only in the infrared she did manage to find earths moon more battered than ever in a trojan orbit trailing sixty degrees behind the parent planet in her path around the sun parliss lifesystems spent his waking hours in the ships library looking up tomes on the medical aspects of privation gradually he was putting together a detailed program that would keep the passengers healthy for a good long time and alive for a long time after that with safety factors allowing for breakdown of the more delicate components of the lifesupport system later he planned to prepare a similar program using cannibalism to its best medical advantage that part would be tricky involving subtle psychological effects from moral shock slowly and painfully with miniature extensible waldos chanda searched out the tiny burns in the brains cortex and scraped away the charred semiconducting ash probably wont help much she admitted grimly but the ash may be causing short circuits it cant hurt to get it out i wish i had some fine wire once he was convinced that the jumper was stonecold dead verd left it alone that gave him little to do but worry he worried about the damage to the brain and wondered if chanda was being overoptimistic like a surgeon forced to operate on a sick friend she refused even to consider that the brain might get worse instead of better verd worried and he checked the wiring in the manual override systems for the various drives moving along outside the hull in a vac suit he was startled by the sight of the braking spine its ultrahard metal was as shiny as ever but it was twothirds gone sublimation over several billion years he worried about the passengers too without the constant entertainment provided by the brain they would be facing the shock of their disaster virtually unaided the log had a list of passengers and chanda got the brain to put it on the screen but verd could find few useful professions among them strac astrophysics jimm farmer avran zooman the other professions were all useless here taxer carmaker adman he was lucky to find anything at all all the same he told lourdi one night id give anything to find a jak ftlsystems aboard how bout a harlan alltrades on this tub specializing nonspecialists ride the luxury liners he twisted restlessly in the air between the sleeping plates wanta buy an aircar it was owned by a sniveling coward jimm farmer was the heavyplanet man with long smooth muscles and big broad feet his anxian accent implied that he could probably kick holes in hullmetal ive never worked without machinery he said farming takes an awful lot of machinery diggers plowers seeders transplanters aerators you name it even if you gave me seeds and a world to grow them on i couldnt do anything by myself he scratched his bushy eyebrows for some reason hed let them grow outward from the end of his hairline like the crossbar on an upsidedown t but if all the passengers and crew pitched in and followed directions and if they didnt mind working like robots i think we could raise something if we had a planet with good dirt and some seeds at least weve got the seeds said verd thanx mr farmer verd had first seen avran zooman walking through the hall at the beginning of the trip zooman was a shocking sight histhin strip of hair was bleachedbone white and started halfway back on his scalp his skin had faint lines in it like the preliminary grooves in tooled leather verd had avoided him until now obviously the man belonged to one of those strange nearly extinct religious orders which prohibit the taking of boosterspice but he didnt behave like a religious nut verd found him friendly alert helpful and likable his thick we made it accent was heavy with stressed esses in this one respect we are lucky avran was saying or you are lucky i should have been lucky enough to miss my ship i came to protect your cargo which is a selection of fertile plant seeds and frozen animal eggs for the zoo of earth authority exactly whats in the consignment nearly everything you could think of captain the central government wished to establish a zoo to show all the life that earth has lost as a result of her intense population compression i suspect they wished to encourage emigration this is the first consignment and it contains samples of every variety of nondomestic life on we made it there were to be other shipments from other worlds including some expensive mutations from wunderland designed to imitate the long extinct big cats we do not have those nor the useless decorative plants such as orchids and cactus but we do have everything we need for farming have you got an incubator for the animals unfortunately not perhaps i could show you how to make one out of other machinery avran smiled humorously but there is a problem i am fatally allergic to boosterspice extract thus i will be dead in less than a century which unfortunately limits the length of any journey that i cail make verd felt his face go numb he was no more afraid of death than the next man but frantically he tried to sort his climbing emotions before they strangled him admiration wonder shame horror fear how could avran live so casually with death how could he have reached such a state of emotional maturity in what could be no more than fifty years shame won out shame at his own reaction and verd felt himself flushing awan looked concerned perhaps i should come back later he suggested no im all right verd had found his tabac stick without thinking he pulled in a deep cooling draft of orange smoke and held it in his lungs for a long moment a few more questions he said briskly does the zoo consignment have grass seed are there any bacteria or algae grass yes fortythree varieties no bacteria im afraid thats not good it takes bacteria to turn rock dust into fertile soil yes avran considered we could start the process with sewage from the ship mixed with intestinal flora then add the rock dust we have earthworms it might work good now i have a question captain what is that verd followed his pointing finger never seen a tabac stick avran shook his head theres a funny tranquilizer in tobacco that helps you concentrate lets you block out distractions people used to have to inhale tobacco smoke to get it that caused lung cancer now we do it better are there tobacco plants in the consignment im afraid not can you give up the habit if i have to but ill hate it verd sat for a moment after avran had left then got up and hunted down parliss avran claims to be allergic to boosterspice i want to know if its true can you find out sure captain itll be in the medical record good why would he lie captain he may have a religious ban on boosterspice if so he might think id shoot him full of it just because i need him and hed be right there was no point in interviewing strac astrophysics again parliss told him that strac spent most of his time in his room and that he had found a pocket computer somewhere he must have something in mind said parliss the next day parliss came to the cabin ive gone through the medical histories he said were all in good shape except avran zooman and laspia waitress avran told the truth hes allergic to boosterspice laspia has a pair of cultured arms no telling how she lost the old ones and both ulnas have machinery in them ones a dooper ones a multirange sonic i wonder what that sweet girl is doing armed to the teeth like that so do i can you sabotage her i put an extensionrecharger in her room if she tries to shoot anyone shell find her batteries are drained the sixth day was the day of mutiny veid and parliss were in the crew common room going over parliss hundredandfiftyyear schedule for shipboard living when the door opened to admit chanda the first hint came from chandas taut determined expression then verd saw that someone had followed her in he stood up to protest then stood speechless as a line of passengers trooped into the crew common room filling it nearly to bursting im sorry captain said chanda weve come to demand your resignation verd still standing let his eyes run over them the pretty auburnhaired woman in front the one who held her arms in an inconspicuously strained attitudeshe must be laspia waitress jimm farmer was also in the front rank and strac astrophysics looking acutely embarrassed many looked embarrassed and many looked angry verd wasnt sure what they were angry at or who he gave himself a few seconds to think let em wait it out on what grounds he asked mildly on the ground that its the best chance we have to stay alive said chanda thats not sufficient grounds you know that you need a criminal charge to bring against me dereliction of duty sloppiness with the drive beam murder violation of religious tenets drug addiction do you wish to make such a charge captain youre talking about impeachment legal grounds for mutiny we dont have such grounds we dont want to impeach you regardless well just what did you think this was chanda an election were inviting you to resign thanx but i think not we could impeach you you know jimm farmer was neither angry nor embarrassed merely interested we could charge you with addiction to tabac sticks try you and convict you tabac sticks sure everybody knows theyre not addictive the point is that you cant find a higher court to reverse our decision i guess thats true very well go ahead parliss broke in in a harsh whisper chanda what are you doing his face scalp and ears burned sunset red the tall woman said quiet parl were only doing what needs to be done youre crazy with grief over that damn mechanical moron chanda flashed him a smoking glare parliss returned it she turned away aloofly ignoring him strac spoke for the first time dont make us use force captain why not do you idiots realize what youre asking verds control was going hed been a young man when the hogans goat was built in nearly two centuries hed flown her further than the total distance to andromeda nursed her and worried about her and lived his life in her lighted rushing womb what he felt must have showed in his face for the girl with the auburn hair raised her left arm and held it innocently bent pointed right at him probably it was the sonic no doubt he would have been swathed in calming vibrations if her batteries had worked but all he felt was nausea and a growing rage i do strac said quietly were asking you to make it possible for us to give you back your ship after this is over verd jumped at him a cold corner of his mind wag amazed at himself but most of him only wanted to get his hands around stracs bony fragile throat he glimpsed laspia waitress staring in panic at her forearms and then a steel band closed around his ankle and jerked verd stopped in midair it was jimm farmer he had jumped across the room like a kangaroo verd looked back over his shoulder and carefully kicked him under the jaw jimm looked surprised and hurt he squeezed all right verd yelped more softly all right ill resign the autodoc mended two cracked ankle bones injected mysterious substances into the badly bruised lower terminal of his achilles tendon and ordered a week of bed rest stracs plans were compatible he had ordered the ship to earth since the goat was still moving at nearly lightspeed and had gone well past the solar system the trip would take about two weeks verd began to enjoy himself for the first time since the last disastrous jump he was able to stop worrying for more than minutes at a time the pressure was off the responsibility was no longer his he even persuaded lourdi to cooperate with strac at first she would have nothing to do with the mutineers but verd convinced her that the passengers depended on her professional pride was a powerful argument after a week on his back verd started moving around the ship trying to get an idea of the state of the ships morale he did little else he was perversely determined not to interfere with the new captain once laspia waitress stopped him in the hall captain ive decided to take you into my confidence i am an arm a member of the central government police of earth theres a badly wanted man aboard this ship and before verd could try to humor her out of it she had produced authenticlooking credentials hes involved in the free wunderland conspiracy she went on yes it still exists we had reason to believe he was aboard the hogans goat but i wasnt sure of it until he found some way to disarm me i still havent identified him yet he could be anyone even easy easy verd soothed her i did that i didnt want anyone wandering around my ship with concealed weapons her voice cracked you fool how am i going to arrest him why should you who would you turn him over to if you did what harm can he do now what harm hes a revolutionary a a seditionist sure hes fanatically determined to free wunderland from the tyranny of the central government of earth but wunderland and the central government have been dead for ages and we havent a single earthman on board unless youre one he left her sputtering helplessly when he thought about it later it didnt seem so funny many of the passengers must be clinging to such an outmoded cause unwilling to face the present reality when that defense gave out he could expect cases of insanity surprisingly strac had talked to nobody except to ask questions of the crew members if he had plans they were all his own perhaps he wanted one last look at earth ancient grandmother earth dead now of old age many passengers felt the same verd did not he and lourdi had last seen earth twelve years ago subjective time when the goat was getting her lifesupport systems rejuvenated they had spent a wonderful two months in rio de janeiro a hive of multicolored human beings moving among buildings that reached like frustrated spacecraft toward the sky once they had even seen two firemanes natives of lelephant shouldering their way unconcerned among the bigger humans but shying like fawns at the sight of a swooping car perhaps firemanes still lived somewhere in the smoky arms of this galaxy or another perhaps even humans lived though they must be changed beyond recognition but verd did not want to look on the corpse face of earth he preferred to keep his memories unspoiled he was not asked on the tenth day the goat made turnover verd thought of the drive beam sweeping its arc across deserted asteroidal cities neutronium converted to a destroying blast of pure light in civilized space a simple turnover required seconds of calculation on the part of the brain just to keep the drive beam pointed safely anything that light touched would vanish but now there was nothing to protect on the fifteenth shipsday morning the earth was a wide brilliant crescent blinding bright where the seas had dried across her sunward face the sun shone with eerie greenishwhite radiance beyond the polarized windows verd and lourdi were finishing breakfast when strac appeared outside the oneway transparent door lourdi let him in i thought id better come personally said strac ive called for a meeting in the crew common room in an hour id appreciate it if youd be there verd id just as soon not said verd thanx anyway have a roast dove strac politely declined and left he had not repeated his invitation he wasnt just being polite lourdi told him he needs you let im suffer lourdi took him gently by the ears and turned him to face her a trick she had developed to get his undivided attention friend this is the wrong time to play prima donna you talked me into serving the usurper on grounds that the passengers needed my skills im telling you they need yours dammit lourdi if they needed me id still be captain they need you as a crewman verd set his jaw and looked stubborn lourdi let go patted his ears gently and stepped back thats my say think it through lord and master six people circled the table verd was there and lourdi and parliss and chanda strac occupied the captains chair beneath the brain screen the sixth man was jimm farmer i know what we have to do now said strac his natural dignity had deepened lately though his shoulders sagged as if ships gravity were too much for him and his thin dark face had lost the ability to smile but i want to consider alternatives first to that end i want you all to hear the answers to questions ive been asking you individually lourdi will you tell us about the sun lourdi stood up she seemed to know exactly what was wanted its very old she said terribly old and almost dead after our jumper went funny the sun seems to have followed the main sequence all the way for awhile it got hotter and brighter and bigger until it blew up into a red giant thats probably when mercury disappeared absorbed sol could have left the main sequence then by going nova for example but if it had there wouldnt be any inner planets so it stayed a red giant until there wasnt enough fuel to bum to maintain the pressure and then the structure collapsed the sun contracted to a white dwarf what with unradiated heat working its way out and heat of contraction and fusion reactions still going on inside it continued to give off light and still does even though for all practical purposes theres no fuel left you cant burn iron so now the suns a greenish dwarf and in a few million years itll be a black one only millions yes strac only millions how much radiation is being put out now lourdi considered about the same as in our time but its bluer light the sun is much hotter than we knew it but all its light has to radiate through a smaller surface area do you want figures no thanx lourdi jimm farmer could you grow foodstuffs under such a star peculiar question thought verd he sat up straighter fighting a horrible suspicion jimm looked puzzled but answered readily if the air was right and i had enough water sure i could plants like ultraviolet the animals might need protection from sunburn strac nodded lourdi whats the state of the galaxy lousy she said promptly too many dead stars and most of whats left are bluewhite and white giants too hot ill bet that any planet in this neighborhood that has the right temperature for life will be a gas giant the young stars are all in the tips of the galactic arms and theyve been scattered by the spin of the galaxy we can find some young stars in the globular clusters do you want to hear about them wed never reach them said verd his suspicion was a certainty he blew orange smoke and waited silently daring strac to put his intention into words right said strac chanda how is the brain very very sick it might stop working before the decades end itll never lost out the century crippled as it is chanda wasnt looking so good herself her eyes were red underlined with blue shadows verd thought she had lost mass her hair hadnt had its usual care she continued as if to herself twice ive given it ordinary commands and gotten the insufficient data sign thats very bad it means the brain is starting to distrust the data in its own memory banks just how bad is that its a oneway street with a wiped mind at the end theres no way to stop it thanx chanda strac was carrying it off but beneath his battered dignity he looked determined and frightened verd thought he had reason now you know everything he told them any comments parliss said if were going star hunting we should stop on pluto and shovel up an air reserve itd give us a few decades leeway uh huh anything else nobody answered well thats that strac drew a deep breath let it out slowly theres too much risk in searching the nearby stars well have to make do with what weve got chanda please order the brain to set us down on the highest flat point in earths noonequator region chanda didnt move nobody moved i knew it verd said very quietly his voice echoed in the greater quiet the crew common room was like a museum exhibit everyone seemed afraid to move everyone but jimm farmer who in careful silence was getting to his feet didnt you understand strac verd paused and tried to make his voice persuasive the brain put you in charge because you had more useful knowledge than the rest of us you were supposed to find a new home for the human race they were all staring at strac with varying degrees of horror all but jimm who stood patiently waiting for the others to make up their minds you were not supposed to give up and take us home to die verd snapped but strac was ignoring him strac was glaring at them all in rage and contempt parliss normally nordicpale was white as moonlight strac its dead leave it we can find another world you mewling litter of blind idiots even jimm farmer looked shocked do you think id kill us all for a twinge of homesickness verd you know better than that even if nobody else does they were on your back twentyseven adults and all their potential children all waiting for you to tell them how to die then came the mutiny now youre free theyve all shifted to my back his eyes left verds and ranged over his shocked silent crew idiots blindly taking orders from a damaged mechanical brain believing everything youre told lourdi he snapped what does one face mean lourdi jumped it means the body doesnt rotate with respect to its primary it doesnt mean the planet has only one face whaat the earth has a back side to it sure what does it look like i dont know lourdi thought a moment the brain knows you remember you asked chanda to make the brain use the radar to check the back side then she couldnt get the brain to show us the picture we cant use the telescope because theres no light not even infrared it must be terribly cold colder than pluto you dont know said strac but i do were going down chanda tell us about it said jimm farmer no said verd he had not known that he was going to speak he had known only that they had given strac the responsibility without the power to match it but strac felt the responsibility he carried it in his bent shoulders and bleak expression in his deep painful breathing in his previous attempts to pass the buck to someone else why would strac want to land on earth verd didnt know but strac must know what he was doing otherwise he couldnt have moved at all someone had to back him up no verd spoke with all the authority he could muster chanda take her down tell us about it jimm repeated the authority backing his flat menacing tone was his own titanic physical strength no shut up jimm or well let you make all the decisions from now on jimin farmer thought it over suddenly laughed and sat down chanda picked up her stylus and began tapping on the speaker the hogans goat lay on her side nearly in the center of a wide ancient asteroid crater there marring the rounded spine with its long stinger was the ragged heatstained hole that marked a meteor strike there along twothirds of the length of her belly was the gash a rock had made in the last seconds of the landing and at the tail forward of the braking spine that static explosion of curved metal strips was where the photon drive had been torn free a small fiercely bright sun burned down from a black sky it had been a bad landing even at the start the brain was a fraction of a second slow in adjusting ships gravity so that the floor had bucked queasily under them as they dropped then when they were already falling toward the crater strac had suddenly added a new order the photon drive had to be accessible after landing chanda had started tappingand the ship had flipped on its side the hogans goat had never been built to land on its side many of the passengers sported bruises avran zooman had broken an arm without boosterspice the bone would be slow to heal a week of grinding labor was nearly over only servomachinery now moved on the crater floor from verds viewpoint most of the activity seemed to center around a gigantic silver tube which was aimed like a cannon at a point ten degrees above the horizon the drive tube had been towed up against the crater wall and a mountain of piled heatfused earth now buried its lower end cables and fuel pipes joined it higher up hi is that you captain verd winced im on top of the crater wall he said because strac couldnt locate him from the sound of his voice the indeterminate voice had to be strac only strac would bellow into a suit radio and im not the captain strac floated down beside him i thought id see the sights good have a seat i find it strange to have to call you verd said the astrophysicist it used to be just captain serves you right for staging a mutiny captain i always knew my thirst for power would get me in trouble they watched as a tractormounted robot disconnected a fuel pipe from the drive then rolled back a moment later a wash of smoky flame burst from the pipe the flame changed color and intensity a dozen times within a few seconds then died as abruptly as it had begun the robot waited for the white heat to leave the pipe then rolled forward to reconnect it verd asked why are you so calm all of a sudden my jobs over strac said with a shrug in his voice now its in the lap of kdapt arent you taking an awful chance oh youve guessed what im trying to do i hope it wasnt a secret theres only one thing you could be doing with the photon drive all laid out and braced like that youre trying to spin the earth why strac baited him you must be hoping theres air and water frozen on the dark side but it seems like a thin chance why were you afraid to explain you put it that way then ask why i didnt put it to a vote verd would you have done what i did no its too risky suppose i tell you that i know the air and water is there it has to be there i can tell you what it looks like its a great shallow cap of ice stratified out according to freezing points with water ice on the bottom then carbon dioxide all the way up through a thick nitrogen layer to a few shifting pools of liquid helium surely you dont expect a oneface world to have a gaseous atmosphere it would all freeze out on the night side it has to its there theres air there your professional word my word as an astrophysicist theres frozen gas back there verd stretched like a great cat he couldnt help himself he could actually feel the muscles around his eyes and cheeks rippling as they relaxed and a great grin crawled toward his ears you comedian he laughed why didnt you say so suppose i kept talking verd turned to look at him youll have thought of some of these things yourself can we breathe that air billions of years have passed maybe the composition of the air changed before it froze maybe too much of it boiled off into space while the sun was a red giant maybe theres too much generated by outgasing after the moon was too far away to skim it off lourdi said the sun is putting out about the right amount of heat but just how close will it be to a livable temperature can jimm farmer make us topsoil therell be live soil on the nightside possibly containing frozen live bacteria but can we get there if we have to worst of all can we spin the earth in the first place i know the drives strong enough i dont know about the earth there cant be any radioactivity left in the earths core so the planet should be solid rock all the way to the center but solid rock flows under pressure well get earthquakes kdapt only knows how bad well captain would you have taken all those risks she blows the drive was on traces of hydrogen too thin to stop a meteor glowed faintly in the destroying light a beam like a spotlight beam reached out over the sharp horizon pointing dead east anything that light touched would flame and blow away on the wings of a photon wind the drive nosed a little deeper into its tomb of lava the ground trembled verd turned on his flying unit and strac rose after him together they hovered over the quivering earth other silver specks boated above the plain in space the drive would be generating over a hundred savage gravities here almost none almost little quick ripples came running in from the eastern horizon they ran across the crater floor in parallel lines of dancing dust coming closer and closer together rocks showered down from the old ringwall maybe i wouldnt have risked it said verd i dont know thats why the brain put me in charge did you see the oxygen ice as we went by the night side or was it too dark to you this frozen atmosphere is pure imagination isnt it ill take your professional word but i dont need to i know its there lines of dust danced over the shaking ground but the ripples were less violent and were coming less frequently the brain was damaged verd said softly yes said strac frowning down into the old crater suddenly he touched his controls and dropped come on verd in a few days therell be air weve got to be ready for wind and rain the meddler someone was in my room it had to be one of sincs boys hed been stupid id left the lights off the yellow light now seeping under the door was all the warning i needed he hadnt used the door the threads were still there that left the fire escape outside the bedroom window i pulled my gun moved back a little in the corridor to get elbow room then id practiced it often enough to drive the management crazy i kicked the door open and was into the room in one smooth motion he should have been behind the door or crouching behind a table or hidden in the closet with his eye to the keyhole instead he was right out in the middle of the living room facing the wrong way hed barely started to turn when i pumped four gyrojet slugs into him i saw the impacts twitching his shirt one over the heart he was finished so i didnt slow down to watch him fall i crossed the livingroom rug in a diving run and landed behind the couch he couldnt be alone there had to be others if one had been behind the couch he might have gotten me but there wasnt i scanned the wall behind me but there was nothing to bide under so i froze waiting listening where were they the one id shot couldnt have come alone i was peeved at sinc as long as hed sent goons to waylay me he might have sent a few who knew what they were doing the one id shot hadnt had time to know he was in a fight why did you do that impossibly the voice came from the middle of the living room where id left a falling corpse i risked a quick look and brought my head down fast the afterimage he hadnt moved there was no blood on him no gun visible but i hadnt seen his right hand bulletproof vest sincs boys had no rep for that kind of thing but that had to be it i stood up suddenly and fired aiming between the eyes the slug smashed his right eye off by an inch and i knew hed shaken me i dropped back and tried to cool off no noises still no sign that he wasnt alone i said why did you do that mild curiosity colored his highpitched voice he didnt move as i stood up and there was no hole in either eye why did i do what i asked cleverly why did you make holes in me my gratitude for the gift of metal of course but he stopped suddenly like hed said too much and knew it but i had other worries anyone else here only we two are present i beg pardon for invasion of privacy and will indemnify he stopped again as suddenly and started over who were you expecting sincs boys i guess they havent caught on yet sincs boys want to make holes in me why could he be this stupid to turn me off to kill me he looked surprised then furious he was so mad he gurgled i should have been informed someone has been unforgivably sloppy yeah me i thought you must be with sinc i shouldnt have shot at you sorry nothing he smiled instantly calm again but i ruined your suit i trailed off holes showed in his jacket and shirt but no blood just what are you he stood about five feet four a round little man in an oldfashioned brown onebutton suit there was not a hair on him not even eyelashes no warts no wrinkles no character lines a nebbish one of these guys whose edges are all round like someone forgot to put in the fine details he spread smoothly manicured hands i am a man like yourself nuts well he said angrily you would have thought so if the preliminary investigation team had done their work properly youre a martian i am not a martian i am he gurgled also i am an anthropologist your world i am here to study your species youre from outer space very the direction and distance are secret of course my very existence should have been secret he scowled deeply rubber face i thought not knowing the half of it yet i wont talk i reassured him but you came it a bad time any minute now sincs going to figure out who it is thats on his tail then hell be on mine and this dumpll be ground zero i hate to brush you ive never met a whatever i too must terminate this interview since you know me for what i am but first tell me of your quarrel why does sinc want to make holes in you his name is lester dunhaven sinclair the third he runs every racket in this city look weve got time for a drinkmaybe ive got scotch bourbon he shuddered no i thank you just trying to set you at ease i was a little miffed then perhaps i may adapt a more comfortable form while you drink whatever you choose if you dont mind please yourself i went to the rolling bar and poured bourbon and tap water no ice the apartment house was dead quiet i wasnt surprised ive lived here a couple of years now and the other tenants have learned the routine when guns go off they hide under their beds and stay there you wont be shocked my visitor seemed anxious if you are shocked please say so at once and he melted i stood there with the paper cup to my lip and watched him flow out of his onebutton suit and take the compact shape of a halfdeflated gray beach ball i downed the bourbon and poured more no water my hands stayed steady im a private cop i told the martian hed extruded a convoluted something i decided was an ear when sinc showed up about three years ago and started taking over the rackets i stayed out of his way he was the laws business i figured then he bought the law and that was okay too im no crusader crusader his voice had changed now it was deep and it sounded like something bubbling up from a tar pit never mind i tried to stay clear of sinc but it didnt work sinc had a client of mine killed morrison his name was i was following morrisons wife getting evidence for a divorce she was shacking up with a guy named adler i had all the evidence i needed when morrison disappeared then i found out adler was sincs right hand right hand nothing was said of hive cultures huh one more thing the prelim team will have to answer for continue talking you fascinate me i kept working on it what could i do morrison was my client and he was dead i collected plenty of evidence against adler and i turned it over to the cops morrisons body never turned up but i had good corpus delicti evidence anyway sincs bodies never do turn up they just disappear i turned what i had over to the cops the case was squashed somehow the evidence got lost one night i got beat up beat up almost any kind of impact i told him can damage a human being really he gurgled all that water i suppose maybe in my line you have to heal fast well that tore it i started looking for evidence against sinc himself a week ago i sent xeroxes off to the feds i let one of sincs boys find a couple of the copies bribery evidence nothing exciting but enough to hurt i figured it wouldnt take sinc long to figure out who made them the xerox machine i borrowed was in a building he owns fascinating i think i will make holes in the lady of preliminary investigation will that hurt she is not a gurgle she is a loud shrill bird whistle i get it anyway you can see how busy im going to be much too busy to talk about uh anthropology any minute now ill have sincs boys all over me and the first one i kill ill have the cops on me too maybe the copsll come first i dunno may i watch i promise not to get in your path why he cocked his ear if that was what it was an example your species has developed an extensive system of engineering using alternating current we were surprised to find you transmitting electricity so far and using it in so many ways some may even be worth imitating thats nice so perhaps there are other things we can learn from you i shook my head sorry short stuff this partys bound to get rough and i dont want any bystanders getting hurt what the hell am i talking about holes dont hurt you very little hurts me my ancestors once used genetic engineering to improve their design my major weaknesses are susceptibility to certain organic poisons and a voracious appetite okay stay then maybe after its all over you can tell me about mars or wherever you came from id like that where i come from is classified i can tell you about mars sure sure howd you like to raid the fridge while we wait if youre so hungry all the time hold it sliding footsteps they were out there a handful of them if they were trying to keep it a secret and these had to be from sinc because all the neighbors were under their beds by now the martian heard it too what shall i do i cannot reach human form fast enough i was already behind the easy chair then try something else something easy a moment later i had two matching black leather footstools they both matched the easy chair but maybe nobodyd notice the door slammed wide open i didnt pull the trigger because nobody was there just the empty hallway the fire escape was outside my bedroom window but that window was locked and bolted and rigged with alarms they wouldnt get in that way unless i whispered hey how did you get in under the door so that was all right the window alarms were still working did any of the tenants see you no good i get enough complaints from the management without that more faint rustling from outside the door then a hand and gun appeared for an instant fired at random vanished another hole in my walls hed had time to see my head to place me i ran low for the couch i was getting set again both eyes on the door when a voice behind me said stand up slow you had to admire the guy hed got through the window alarms without a twitch into the living room without a sound he was tall oliveskinned with straight black hair and black eyes his gun was centered on the bridge of my nose i dropped the gyrojet and stood up pushing it now would only get me killed he was very relaxed very steady thats a gyrojet isnt it why not use a regular heater i like this i told him maybe hed come too close or take his eyes off me or anything its light as a toy with no recoil the gun is just a launching chamber for the rocket slugs and they pack the punch of a fortyfive but man the slugs cost a buck fortyfive each i dont shoot that many people at those prices i believe it okay turn around slow hands in the air his eyes hadnt left me for a moment i turned my back next would be a sap something metal brushed against my head featherlight i whirled struck at his gun hand and his larynx pure habit id moved the instant the touch told me he was in reach he was stumbling back with his hand to his throat i put a fist in his belly and landed the other on his chin he dropped trying to curl up and sure enough he was holding a sap but why hadnt he hit me with it from the feel of it hed laid it gently on top of my head carefully as if he thought the sap might shatter all right stand easy the hand and gun came through the doorway attached to six feet of clean living i knew him as handel he looked like any blond brainless hero but he wasnt brainless and he was no hero he said youre going to hate yourself for doing that the footstool behind him began to change shape dammit i said thats not fair handel looked comically surprised then smiled winningly two to one i was talking to my footstool turn around weve got orders to bring you to sinc if we can you could still get out of this alive i turned around id like to apologize save it for sinc no honest it wasnt my idea to have someone else mix in this especially again i felt something brush against the side of my head the martian must be doing something to stop the impact i could have taken handel then i didnt move it didnt seem right that i could break handels neck when he couldnt touch me two to one i dont mind especially when the other guys the one sometimes ill even let some civicminded bystander help if theres some chance hell live through it but this whats not fair asked a high complaining voice handel screamed like a woman i turned to see him charge into the door jamb back up a careful two feet try for the door again and make it then i saw the footstool he was already changing softening in outline but i got an idea of the shape handel had seen no wonder it had softened his mind i felt it softening my bones melting the marrow and i closed my eyes and whispered dammit you were supposed to watch you told me the impact would damage you thats not the point detectives are always getting hit on the head we expect it but how can i learn anything from watching you if your little war ends so soon well what do you learn if you keep jumping in you may open your eyes i did the martian was back to his nebbish form he had fished a pair of orange shorts out of his pile of clothes i do not understand your objection he said this sinc will kill you if he can do you want that no but do you believe that your side is in the right yes but then why should you not accept my help i wasnt sure myself it felt wrong it was like sneaking a suitcase bomb into sincs mansion and blowing it up i thought about it while i checked the hall nobody there i closed the door and braced a chair under the knob the dark one was stiff with us he was trying to sit up look i told the martian maybe i can explain maybe i cant but if i dont get your word to stay out of this ill leave town i swear it ill just drop the whole thing understand no will you promise yes the spanish type was rubbing his throat and staring at the martian i didnt blame him fully dressed the martian could have passed for a man but not in a pair of orange undershorts no hair or nipples marked his chest the spanish type turned his flashing white smile on me and asked whos he ill ask the questions whore you don domingo his accent was soft and spanish if he was worried it didnt show hey how come you didnt fall down when i hit you i said ill ask the your face is turning pink are you embarrassed about something dammit domingo wheres sinc where were you supposed to take me the place what place the bel air place thats the one you know you have the hardest head never mind that okay okay what will you do now i couldnt call the law in tie you up i guess after this is over ill turn you in for assault after this is over you wont be doing much i think you will live as long as they shoot at your head but when now drop that the martian came out of the kitchen his hand was flowing around a tin of corned beef engulfing it tin and all domingos eyes went wide and round then the bedroom exploded it was a fire bomb half the living room was in flames in an instant i scooped up the gyrojet stuck it in my pocket the second bomb exploded in the hall a blast of flame blew the door inward picked up the chair id used to brace the door and flung it across the room no domingo yelled handel was supposed to wait now what now we roast i thought stumbling back with my arm raised against the flames a calm tenor voice asked are you suffering from excessive heat yes dammit yes a huge rubber ball slammed into my back hurling me at the wall i braced my arms to take up some of the impact it was still going to knock me silly just before i reached it the wall disappeared it was the outside wall completely off balance i dashed through an eightfoot hole and out into the empty night six floors above concrete i clenched my teeth on the scream the ground came up the ground came up where the hell was the ground i opened my eyes everything was happening in slow motion a second stretched to eternity i had time to see strollers turning to crane upward and to spot handel near a corner of the building holding a handkerchief to his bleeding nose time to look over my shoulder as domingo stood against a flaming background poised in slow motion in an eightfoot circle cut through the wall of my apartment flame licked him he jumped slow motion he went past me like a falling safe i saw him hit i heard him hit its not a good sound living on wall street during november i heard it night after night during the weeks following the election i never got used to it despite everything my belly and groin were telling me i was not falling i was sinking like through water by now half a dozen people were watching me settle they all had their mouths open something poked me in the side and i slapped at it and found myself clutching a slug i plucked another off my cheek handel was shooting at me i fired back not aiming too well if the martian hadnt been helping me id have blown his head off without a thought as it was anyway handel turned and ran i touched ground and walked away a dozen hot curious eyes bored into my back but nobody tried to stop me there was no sign of the martian nothing else followed me either i spent half an hour going through the usual contortions to shake a tail but that was just habit i wound up in a small anonymous bar my eyebrows were gone giving me a surprised look i found myself studying my reflection in the bar mirror looking for other signs that id been in a fight my face never particularly handsome has been dignified by scar tissue over the years and my light brown hair never wants to stay in place i had to move the part a year back to match a bullet crease in my scalp the scars were all there but i couldnt find any new cuts or bruises my clothes werent mussed i didnt hurt anywhere it was all unreal and vaguely dissatisfying but my next brush with sinc would be for real i had my gyrojet and a sparse handful of rocket slugs in one pocket sincs mansion was guarded like fort knox and sinc would be expecting me he knew i wouldnt run we knew a lot about each other considering wed never met sinc was a teetotaler not a fanatic there was liqour on the premises of his mansionfort but it had to be kept out of sincs sight a woman usually shared his rooms sincs taste was excellent he changed his women frequently they never left angry and thats unusual they never left poor either id dated a couple of sincs exes letting them talk about sinc if they cared to the consensus sinc was an allright guy a spender inventive and enthusiastic where it counted and neither particularly wanted to go back sinc paid well and in full hed bail a man out of jail if the occasion arose he never crossed anyone stranger yet nobody ever crossed him id had real trouble learning anything about sinc nobody had wanted to talk but hed crossed domingo that had caught us both by surprise put it different someone had crossed domingo domingo had been waiting for rescue not bombs so had i it was sincs policy to pull his boys out if they got burned either domingo had been crossed against sincs orders or sinc was serious about wanting me dead i meet all kinds of people i like it that way by now i knew enough about sinc to want to know more much more i wanted to meet him and i was damn glad id shaken the martian because just what was it that bugged me about the martian it wasnt the strangeness i meet all kinds the way he shifted shape could throw a guy but i dont bug easy manners he was almost too polite and helpful much too helpful that was part of it the lines of battle had been drawn and then something had stepped in from outer space he was deus ex machina the angel who descends on a string to set everything right and incidentally to ruin the story me tackling sinc with the martians help was like a cop planting evidence it was wrong but more than that it seemed to rob the thing of all its point so that nothing mattered i shrugged angrily and had another drink the bartender was trying to close i drank up fast and walked out in a clump of tired drunks my car had tools i could use but by now thered be a bomb under the hood i caught a cab and gave him an address on bellagio a couple of blocks from sincs place if you can number anything in that area in blocks its all hills and the streets can drive you nuts sincs home ground was a lumpy triangle with twisted sides and big it must have cost the moon to landscape one afternoon id walked past it casing it i couldnt see anything except through the gate the fence was covered by thick climbing ivy there were alarms in the ivy i waited till the taxi was gone then loaded the gyrojet and started walking that left one rocket slug still in my pocket in that neighborhood there was something to duck behind every time a car came by trees hedges gates with massive stone pillars when i saw headlights i ducked in case sincs boys were patrolling a little walking took me to within sight of the ivy fence any closer and id be spotted so i ducked onto the property of one of sincs neighbors the place was an oddity a rectangular pool with a dinky poolhouse at one end a main house that was all right angles and between the two a winding brook with a small bridge across it and trees hanging over the water the brook must have been there before the house and some of the trees too it was a bit of primal wilderness that jarred strangely with all the right angles around it i stuck with the brook naturally this was the easy part a burglary rap was the worst that could happen to me i found a fence beyond was asphalt streetlamps and then the ivy barrier to sincs domain wire cutters in the car id be a sitting duck if i tried to go over it could have been sticky but i moved along the fence found a rusty gate and persuaded the padlock to open for me seconds later i was across the street and huddled against the ivy just where id taken the trouble to hunt out a few of the alarms ten minutes later i went over sifting duck yes i had a clear view of the house huge and mostly dark in the moment before i dropped someone would have had a clear view of me too framed by lamplight at the top of the fence i dropped between inner and outer fence and took a moment to think i hadnt expected an inner fence it was four feet of solid brick topped by six feet of wiring and the wiring had a look of high voltage now what maybe i could find something to short out the fence but that would alert the house just as i was going over still it might be the best chance or i could go back over the ivy and try the gate defenses maybe i could even bluff my way through sinc must be as curious about me by now as i was about him everything i knew about sinc was in the present tense of his past i knew only that there were no records of his past but if sinc had heard about my floating lightly down from a sixthfloor window not unlike mary poppins it might be worth a try at least id live long enough to see what sinc looked like or hello how does your war proceed i sighed he drifted down beside me still manshaped dressed in a dark suit i saw my mistake when he got closer hed altered his skin color to make a suit shirt and tie at a distance it would pass even close up he had nothing that needed hiding i thought id got rid of you i complained are you bigger at a guess his size had nearly doubled yes i became hungry you werent kidding about your appetite the war he reminded me are you planning to invade i was i didnt know about this fence shall i no no you shall not whatever you were thinking about just watch what am i to watch you have done nothing for several minutes ill think of something of course but whatever i do i wont use your help now or ever if you want to watch fine be my guest but dont help i do not understand why not its like bugging a guys telephone sinc has certain rights even if he is a crook hes immune from cruel and unusual punishment the fbi cant bug his phone you cant kill him unless you try him first unless hes breaking a law at the time and he shouldnt have to worry about armed attack by martians surely if sinc himself breaks the rules there are rules for dealing with lawbreakers i snapped the martian didnt answer he stood beside me seven feet tall and pudgy a dark manlike shape in the dim light from the house hey how do you do all those things you do just a talent no i carry implements something poked itself out of his babysmooth chest something hard that gleamed like metal this for instance damps momentum other portable artifacts lessen the pull of gravity or reprocess the air in my lung you keep them all inside you why not i can make fingers of all sizes inside me oh you have said that there are rules for dealing with rule breakers surely you have already broken those rules you have trespassed on private property you have departed the scene of an accident don domingos death you have all right then all right ill try again i was wasting too much time getting over the fence was important but so somehow was this because in a sense the martian was right this had nothing to do with rules it has nothing to do with rules i told him at least not exactly what counts is power sinc has taken over this city and hell want others too later hes got too much power thats why someone has to stop him and you give me too much power a a man who has too much power loses his head i dont trust myself with you on my side im a detective if i break a law i expect to be jailed for it unless i can explain why it makes me careful if i tackle a crook who can whip me i get bruised if i shoot someone who doesnt deserve it i go to prison it all tends to make me careful but with you around you lose your caution said the dark bulk beside me he spoke almost musingly with more of human expression than id heard before you may be tempted to take more power than is good for you i had not expected your species to be so wise you thought we were stupid perhaps i had expected you to be grateful and eager for any help i might give now i begin to understand your attitude we too try to balance out the amount of power given to individuals what is that noise it was a rustling a scampering barely audible but not at all furtive i dont know have you decided upon your next move yes i damn those are dogs what are dogs suddenly they were there in the dark i couldnt tell what breed but they were big and they didnt bark in a rustling of claws scrabbling on cement they rounded the curve of the brick wall coming from both sides terribly fast i hefted the gyrojet and knew there were twice as many dogs as i had shots lights came on bright and sudden all over the grounds i fired and a finger of flame reached out and touched one of the dogs he fell tumbling lost in the pack all the lights went deep red blood red the dogs stopped the noise stopped one dog the nearest was completely off the ground hovering in midleap his lips skinned back from sharp ruby teeth it seems i have cost you time the martian murmured may i return it what did you do i have used the damper of inertia in a projected field the effect is as if time has stopped for all but us in view of the length of time i have kept you talking it is the least i can do dogs to the left and dogs to the right and lights all the hell over the place i found men with rifles placed like statues about the wide lawn i dont know if youre right or wrong i said ill be dead if you turn off that timestopper but this is the last time okay okay we will use only the inertia damper ill move around to the other side of the house then you turn off the gadget itll give me some time to find a tree we went i stepped carefully among the statues of dogs the martian floated behind like a gigantic pudgy ghost the channel between inner and outer fence went all the way around to the gate at the front of the house near the gate the inner fence pinched against the outer and ended but before we reached that point i found a tree it was big and it was old and one thick branch stretched above the fence to hover over our heads okay turn off the gadget the deep red lights glared a sudden white i went up the ivy long arms and oversized hands are a big help to my famous monkey act no point now in worrying about alarms i had to balance standing on the outer fence to reach the branch with my fingers when i put my weight on it it dipped three feet and started to creak i moved along hand over hand and swung up into the leaves before my feet could brush the inner fence at a comfortable crouch i moved along the side of the house looking for a window there were at least three riflemen on the front lawn they were moving in a search pattern but they didnt expect to find anything all the action was supposed to be in back the martian floated into the air and moved across the fence he nicked the top going over a blue spark snapped and he dropped like a sack of wheat he landed against the fence grounded now and electricity leaped and sizzled ozone and burnt meat mixed in the cold night air i dropped out of the tree and ran to him i didnt touch him the current would have killed me it had certainly killed him and that was something id never thought of bullets didnt faze him he could produce miracles on demand how could he be killed by a simple electric fence if hed only mentioned that but hed been surprised even to find that we had electricity id let a bystander be killed the one thing id sworn i would never do again now he was nothing like human metal things poked gleaming from the dead mass that had been an anthropologist from the stars the rustle of current had stopped seconds ago i pulled one of the metal gadgets out of the mass slid it in a pocket and ran they spotted me right away i took a zigzag course around a fenced tennis court running for the front door there were manlength windows on either side of the door i ran up the steps brought the gyrojet down in a hurried slashing blow that broke most of the panes in one window and dove off the steps into a line of bushes when things happen that fast your mind has to fill in the gaps between what you saw and what you didnt all three gunmen chased me frantically up the steps and through the front door shouting at the tops of their lungs i settled myself to take stock somebody must have decided i couldnt go through all that jagged glass he must have outshouted the others too because i heard the hunt start again i climbed a piece of wall found a little ledge outside a darkened secondfloor window i got the window up without too much noise for the first time on this crazy night i was beginning to think i knew what i was doing that seemed odd because i didnt know much about the layout of the house and i hadnt the faintest idea where i was but at least i knew the rules of the game the variable the martian the deus ex machina was out of the picture the rules were whoever saw me would kill me if he could no bystanders no good guys would be here tonight there would be no complex moral choices i would not be offered supernatural help in return for my soul or otherwise all i had to do was try to stay alive the bedroom was empty two doors led to a closet and a bathroom yellow light seeped under a third door no choice here i pulled the gyrojet and eased the third door open a face jerked up over the edge of a reading chair i showed it the gun kept it aimed as i walked around in front of the chair nobody else was in the room the face could have used a shave it was beefy middleaged but symmetrical enough except for an oversized nose i know you it said calmly enough considering the circumstances i know you too it was adler the one whod gotten me into this mess first by cohabiting with morrisons wife and then by killing morrison youre the guy morrison hired said adler the tough private eye bruce cheseborough why couldnt you let well enough alone i couldnt afford to you couldnt afford not to have some coffee thanks you know whatll happen if you yell or anything sure he picked up a water glass dumped the water in the wastebasket he picked up a silver thermos and poured coffee into his own coffee cup and into the water glass moving slowly and evenly he didnt want to make me nervous he himself was no more than mildly worried that was reassuring in a way because he probably wouldnt do anything stupid but id seen this same calm in don domingo and i knew the cause adler and domingo and everyone else who worked for sinc they all had perfect faith in him whatever trouble they were in sinc would get them out i watched adler take a healthy gulp of coffee before i touched the glass the coffee was black and strong heavily laced with good brandy my first gulp tasted so good i damn near smiled at adler adler smiled back his eyes were wide and fixed as if he were afraid to look away from me as if he expected me to explode i tried to think of a way he could have dropped something in the coffee without drinking it himself there wasnt any you made a mistake i told him and gulped more coffee if my name had been rip hammer or mike hero i might have dropped the whole thing when i found out you were with sincs boys but when your name is bruce cheseborough junior you cant afford to back out of a fight you should have you might have lived he said it without concentrating on it a puzzled frown tugged at the corners of his eyes and mouth he was still waiting for something to happen tell you what you write me out a confession and i can leave here without killing anyone wont that be nice sure what should i confess to killing morrison you dont expect me to do that not really im going to surprise you adler got up stiff slow and went behind the desk he kept his hands high until i was around behind him ill write your damn confession you know why because youll never use it sincll see to that if anyone comes through that door i know i know he started writing while he was at it i examined the tool id taken from the martians corpse it was white shiny metal with a complex shape that was like nothing id ever seen like the plastic guts in a toy gun half melted and then cooled so that all the parts were merged and rounded i had no idea what it did anyway it was no good to me i could see slots where buttons or triggers were buried but they were too small for fingers tweezers might have reached them or a hatpin adler handed me the paper hed been writing on hed made it short and pointed motive means details of time most of it i already knew you dont say what happened to the body same thing that happened to domingo domingo domingo sure when the cops came to pick him up in back of your place he was gone even the bloodstains were gone a miracle right adler smiled nastily when i didnt react he looked puzzled how i asked him adler shrugged uncomfortably you already know dont you i wont write it down it would bring sinc in youll have to settle for what youve got okay now i tie you up and wend my way homeward adler was startled he couldnt have faked it now sure you killed my client not sinc he grinned not believing me and he still thought something was about to happen i used the bathrobe sash for his arms and a handkerchief for a gag there were other bathrobes in the closet to finish the job he still didnt believe i was going to leave and he was still waiting for something to happen i left him on the bed in the dark now what i turned off the lights in the sitting room and went to the window the lawn was alive with men and dogs and far too much light that was the direct way out i had adlers hide in my pocket adler who had killed my client was i still chasing sinc or should i try to get clear with that piece of paper get clear of course i stood by the window picking out shadows there was a lot of light but the shadows of bushes and trees were jet black i found a line of hedge lighted on this side but i could try the other or move along that side of the tennis court then hop across to that oddlooking statue the door opened suddenly and i whirled a man in dark slacks and a smoking jacket stood facing my gun unhurriedly he stepped through the door and closed it behind him it was sinc lester dunhaven sinclair iii was a man in perfect condition not a pound overweight or underweight with gymnasium muscles i guessed his age at thirtyfour or so once before id seen him in public but never close enough to see what i saw now that his thick blond hair was a wig he smiled at me cheseborough isnt it yeah what did you do with my lieutenant he looked me up and down i gather hes still with us in the bedroom tied up i moved around to lock the door to the hall i understood now why sincs men had made him into something like a feudal overlord he measured up he inspired confidence his confidence in himself was total looking at him i could almost believe that nothing could stand against him i gather you were too intelligent to try the coffee a pity said sinc he seemed to be examining my gun but with no trace of fear i tried to think it was a bluff but i couldnt no man could put across such a bluff his twitching muscles would give him away i began to be afraid of sinc a pity he repeated every night for the past year adler has gone to bed with a pot of coffee spiked with brandy handel too what was he talking about the coffee hadnt affected me at all youve lost me i said have i smiling as if hed won a victory sinc began to gurgle it was eerily familiar that gurgle i felt the rules changing again too fast to follow smiling gurgling rhythmically sinc put a hand in his pants pocket and pulled out an automatic he took his time about it it was not a big gun but it was a gun and the moment i knew that i fired a gyrojet rocket slug burns its solid fuel in the first twentyfive feet and moves from there on momentum sinc was twentyfive feet away flame reached out to tap him on the shoulder joint and sinc smiled indulgently his gun was steady on the bridge of my nose i fired at his heart no effect the third shot perforated the space between his eyes i saw the hole close and i knew sinc was cheating too he fired i blinked cold fluid trickled down from my forehead stung my eyes dribbled across my lips i tasted rubbing alcohol youre a martian too i said no need for insult sinc said mildly he fired again the gun was a squirtgun a plastic kids toy shaped like an automatic i wiped the alcohol out of my eyes and looked at him well said sinc well he reached up peeled his hair off and dropped it he did the same with his eyebrows and eyelashes well where is he he told me he was an anthropologist was he lying sure cheseborough he was the man the law hes tracked me over distances you couldnt even write down sinc backed up against a wall you wouldnt even understand what my people called my crime and youve no reason to protect him he used you every time he stopped a bullet for you it was to make me think you were him thats why he helped you on a floating act thats why hes disposed of domingos body you were his stalkinghorse im supposed to kill you while hes sneaking up on me hell sacrifice you without a qualm now where is he dead he didnt know about electric fences a voice from the hall handels voice bellowed mr sinclair are you all right in there i have a guest sinc called out he has a gun what do we do dont do anything sinc called to him and then he started to laugh he was losing his human contours relaxing because i already knew what he was i wouldnt have believed it he chuckled he tracked me all that way to die on an electric fence his chuckles cut off like a broken tape making me wonder how real they were how real his laughter could be with his no doubt weird breathing system the current couldnt kill him of course it must have shorted his airmaker and blown the battery the spiked coffee was for him i guessed he said he could be killed by organic poisons he meant alcohol obviously and all i did was give you a free drink he chuckled ive been pretty gullible i believed what your women told me they didnt know he did a pretty accurate double take you thought cheseborough have i made rude comments about your sex life no why then you can leave mine alone he had to be kidding no be didnt he could take any shape he liked wow i thought sincs really gone native maybe he was laughing or thought be was sinc moved slowly toward me i backed away holding the useless gun you realize what happens now i took a guess same thing that happened to domingos body all your embarrassing bodies exactly our species is known for its enormous appetite he moved toward me the squirt gun forgotten in his right hand his muscles had sagged and smoothed now he was like the first step in making a clay model of a man but his mouth was growing larger and his teeth were two sharpedged horse shoes i fired once more something smashed heavily against the door sinc didnt hear it sinc was melting losing all form as he tried to wrap himself around his agony from the fragments of his shattered plastic squirt gun rubbing alcohol poured over what had been his hand and dripped to the floor the door boomed again something splintered sincs hand was bubbling boiling sinc screaming was flowing out of his slacks and smoking jacket and i i snapped out of whatever force was holding me rooted and i picked up the silver thermos and poured hot spiked coffee over whatever it was that writhed on the floor sinc bubbled all over white metal machinery extruded itself from the mass and lay on the rug the door crackled and gave by then i was against the wall ready to shoot anything that looked my way handel burst into the room and stopped dead he stood there in the doorway while the stars grew old and went out nothing i felt could have torn his eyes from that twitching bubbling mass gradually the mass stopped moving and handel gulped got his throat working shrieked and ran from the room i heard the meaty thud as he collided with a guard and i heard him babbling dont go in there dont oh dont and then a sob and the sound of uneven running feet i went into the bedroom and out the window the grounds still blazed with light but i saw no motion anyway there was nothing out there but dogs and men dry run by habit simpson was a onehand driver on this day he drove with both hands wrapped tight around the wheel strangling it he looked straight ahead down the curving length of the freeway and he stayed in the rightcenter lane he wanted a cigarette yet he was almost afraid to let go of the wheel the airconditioning nozzle blew icy air up at his face and down at his belt buckle icy because of the way he was perspiring he felt the weakness in his bowels and he cursed silently trying to relax the dog in the trunk too late now too late to change his mind he stabbed a finger at the cigarette lighter missed jesus hed only been driving the buick for five years found it and pushed it in he fumbled a camel from the central glove compartment onehanded without looking traffic was not too heavy it was past seven oclock though the july sun was still a falling glory below red streamers of cloud a few cars had their lights on unnecessarily were the drivers afraid theyd forget later the cars in this lane were doing sixty to sixtyfive usually simpson chose the fast lane this time was different no risks on this trip too late now too late to back out he wouldnt if he could he lit the cigarette dragged put the lighter back and gripped the wheel again with both hands the cigarette bent and flattened between his fingers red taillights this lane was slowing he touched the brake with his foot eased down harder hard he tried to push the brake through the floor he stopped a foot behind a vintage cadillac and stalled simpson swore and turned the ignition hard over the motor caught instantly it didnt matter nobody was moving overhead were the swooping concrete noodles of the santa monica freeway ramps a carpet of cars was stalled underneath stalled for as far ahead as simpson could see then there was motion in the distance he waited the vintage cadillac jerked half a car length forward simpson followed another ripple of motion another car length forward the freeway shouldnt be this crowded seventhirty on a week night hed picked his time carefully enough what was happening the cad moved again its driver looked back over his shoulder angry middleaged sweaty and somewhat overweight he looked like hed bite anyone who came close enough simpson felt the same way he eased forward murray simpson was six inches too tall for the drivers seat of the buick he banged his elbows and knees getting in and out the drivers seat cramped his legs bending them too far at the knee even when it was as far back as it would go in repose he always looked unhappy he had that kind of face his most genuine laughter looked forced see him now stalled in a traffic jam on the san diego freeway in a car too small for him stalled partway through a murder plan which was too complex to begin with he looked frantic his brown eyes burned his nocolor hair had lost all semblance of civilization his forgotten cigarette burned threateningly between white knuckles ahead of the blue cadillac was a jaguar convertible whose custom paint job glowed with fiery tangerine brilliance ahead of that a long gray anonymous detroit car with huge delta fins the gray car was stalled someone behind simpson was honking madly cars poured into the gap in his lane the gap ahead of the stalled car at hermosa beach the red tide was in trillions and quadrillions of plankton made a dirty redandbrown soup of the ocean by night the breakers glowed with cold blue fire by night and day the ocean air stank of too much life in the trunk of the buick simpsons duncolored great dane lay dead with a hole in his head he was beginning to stiffen no room to get out of this lane simpson clenched his teeth and clung to his temper part of him wanted to stamp on the throttle and swoop out into the next lane and damn the car that got in his way but there was harvey in the trunk with his head in a baggy simpson lit another cigarette what was janet doing now who was she with did simpson know him no janet wasnt stupid nor was the divorce yet final anyone with her now would be female had she missed harvey yet was she searching for him now wondering how hed got out hoping he hadnt reached the street how would janet look in the trunk of the buick with her head in a baggy to hold the blood cars swept by on the left and right going ten and fifteen miles per hour a woman in a peachcolored dress got out of the gray car and opened the hood she fiddled in the guts of the motor then got back in the gray car lurched forward shed fixed it amazing and the whole lane crawled off at ten miles per hour southbound on the san diego freeway toward simpsons tiny house on the strand at hermosa beach driving was torture ripples crawled backward along the lines of cars some deadhead in front was moving in spurts and the spurts became waves traveling backward communicating their motion to every car behind him accelerator brake accelerator brake brake accelerate maddeningly slow there was the car that had blocked the lanes twisted across the right lanes with its side smashed in a police car alongside now the lanes moved faster on simpsons left they were getting up to speed simpson saw a gap he twisted the wheel depressed the throttle and looked quickly over his shoulder nobody coming he stamped on the throttle and brought his eyes back to the road every car in his lane must have stopped dead the moment he turned his head his foot was still on the throttle when he hit discontinuity he knew he was about to crash and he was getting out to look at the damage hed bumped his head and his ribs must have smacked hard into the steering wheel but he had no trouble walking he walked through a nightmare the buicks hood looked like a squashed banana the fat man in the cadillac was getting out rubbing his thick neck his eyes squinted against pain whiplash thought simpson and moved toward him then the weakness came and simpson dropped hard on his knees the shock should have hurt but it didnt sorry simpson told the man sorry about your car your neck sorry to be such a fool sorry i feel weak sorry he fainted he knew he had fainted though he had not felt his chin hit concrete now without transition he was totally alert but alert to what there was darkness around him and a lack of sensation no sound nothing to see or feel no up or down the position of his body was a mystery he visualized himself in a hospital bed his spinal cord severed at the neck his eyes bandaged the thought should have frightened him it didnt once hed smoked marijuana it was unplanned hed seen some friends smoking a smallbowled cigarette pipe using a mechanical roller to make their own cigarettes and curiosity had got the better of him he remembered the awful taste at the back of his nose and the deep allembracing peace and a queer somatic hallucination the feeling that all the mass of his body had withdrawn into his feet below a line drawn at the ankles it seemed that he could lean as far as he liked in any direction and he would not fall because his center of mass was only an inch above the floor the deep peace was the same but now his body was entirely massless as before his memory was unimpaired the body in the trunk the crash how now could he keep harveys death a secret but it didnt seem to matter suddenly he knew why he was dead murray simpson was a dead issue an embarrassing mass of tissue associated with an equally embarrassing mass of torn metal and that didnt matter either the voice spoke close in front of him that was silly simpson simpson tried to move massless body he had no body at all he was a viewpoint blind motionless without sensation he waited the worst possible time to die is when youre involved in a murder there was no character to that voice no accent no timbre no emphasis no loudness or softness it was neither sharp nor dull neither hoarse nor smooth a voice with no handle like print in a typewriter that voice simpson said murder to his own horror his voice was exactly like the others do you deny it i admit to killing a dog my own dog harvey a great dane not your own harvey belonged to you and to janet grey simpson your wife your wife has had possession of harvey for seven months ever since the two of you separated do you deny your intent to commit murder life after death reward and punishment simpson said i refuse to answer are you my judge no another will judge you i collect only evidence and you simpson didnt answer the strange peace was still with him and he felt that hed already found the right answer well we must find out said the voiceless voice what a weird nightmare simpson thought and tried to pull himself awake i dreamed i was in an accident at the worst possible time id already killed harvey poor harvey why would i pick harvey there were voices around him cold reality touched him icy cold icy and rough against his cheek he lay on hard concrete his chin hurt and his belly hurt below the edge of his rib cage he looked up into the face of a policeman am i dying ambulance will be here moment the car harvey he tried to say what did you do with the car the policeman spoke calmly take it to get it whenever address his voice faded in and out and out he woke again thinking nightmare and again it was too real there was a cloth under his cheek someone had been a good samaritan he asked nobody am i dying just take it easy two men folded his arms around him and picked him up in a peculiar grip that supported his innards the pain under his ribs was not great but it felt unnatural terrifying i think he could walk himself said one i dont dare simpson got out trying to convey his fear something broken in my belly or in my skull broken bleeding slowly bleeding away my life with nothing to show on the outside he was convinced he was dying it was all that remained of a part of the nightmare that he could not visualize at all the men put him on a stretcher and unfolded him into prone position the rest of it was hazy the ride in the ambulance the doctor asking him questions the same questions asked earlier by the police questions he answered without thought almost without memory he didnt become fully aware until an intern said nothing broken just bruises simpson was startled are you sure have your own doctor take a look tomorrow for tonight youll be all right no broken bones is that the only pain under your ribs my chin hurts oh thats just a scrape did you faint yes probably got it then youre lucky you know your spleen is right under those bruised ribs jesus you think you can get up your wife is coming for you janet coming here janet ill take a taxi said simpson he rolled onto his side sat up on the high operating table and climbed down to the floor treating himself like a sackful of expensive raw eggs where did they take my car the police gave me the address the man tapped his pockets one crackled here simpson took the slip looked at it and shoved it in his pocket there was a chance he could get the car transferred to his own company before the police looked in the trunk or was there they might have looked already what would the police do about a great dane with a bullet in his head undoubtedly theyd tell janet he must get the car tomorrow the intern showed him to a telephone and loaned him a cigarette after he called the cab someone else showed him where to wait hed waited five minutes when janet came her hair was back to auburn the dress she wore was severe almost a suit and it was new she looked competent and sure of herself how did you know he asked her how do you think the police called my house they must have found the number on your license if you didnt tell them ive got a taxi coming let it come youre going with me how did you manage to bang yourself up there was a traffic jam i got can you stand up she was always interrupting once hed thought she did it deliberately once she had perhaps but it was a habit shed never lose he stood the pain under his ribs made him walk carefully he dreaded what it would feel like tomorrow ill take you to the beach she said okay he lived in the beach house now janet had been awarded the main house he reached the car by leaning on janets shoulder the touch of her was disturbing and her perfume roused sharp memories aside from premarital prostitutes he had never carnally known a woman other than janet now she distracted him and he kept landing hard on his feet and jarring his ribs but her strength was an asset in settling him into the passenger seat now how did it happen he told her in detail reaction made him want to babble somehow he managed to leave the dog out of it but he told her how sure he had been that he was going to die and he spoke of his surprise when the intern told him he wasnt by the time he finished they were back on the freeway the lights the flying lights he planted his feet and tried to push himself through the seat janet didnt notice harveys missing she said he should have said oh instead he stopped with the word on his lips he had suddenly realized that it didnt matter it hadnt mattered since the accident though he hadnt realized it until now i killed harvey he said she glanced across at him with distaste she didnt believe him hes in the trunk of my car thats why i was in such a hurry tonight thats ridiculous you like harvey it was a sort of dry ran i was planning to kill you i dont understand i had it all planned out he said theres a red tide down at the beach maybe you knew no she was beginning to believe him he thought at night its lovely the breakers glow like blue fire in the daytime it stinks and the waters filthy i could bury a body anywhere on the beach and nobody would notice the smell but i had to know i could go through with it wouldnt i be seven kinds of idiot if i murdered you and then froze up yes she said very coldly so i went up to the house and shot harvey it was sort of a dry run if it had worked you would have been next the gun in the pillow the drive to the beach what an idiotic idea didnt it occur to you that theyd search harder for a missing woman than a missing dog well and why harvey why not pick up a dog at the pound suppose they were searching for my body on the beach and found harveys instead theyd trace me right to you then theyd know they were on the right track i i suppose you planned to use the same gun on us both yes i did as a and how long do you think a red tide lasts anymway the ocean always stinks theres always a breeze too remember the seal that washed up last year it probably weighed less than seventy pounds remember the smeli think how much worse all right all right it was a stupid plan the angry silence was very very familiar it didnt help simpson to know that his wife was probably right it never had they turned toward the beach janet asked why would you want to kill me the alimonys bleeding me white thats all no personal reasons she laughed he had wondered before was her laughter always scornful or did it only sound that way my god murray surely you can tell me your intended victim she sobered suddenly never mind i dont want to know why do you still plan to kill me no not after that the accident of course i dont have the nerve suppose i did it and then froze up my cars in a police lot with a dogs body in the trunk well that wont get me killed but suppose it was you thafs almost funny said janet want a real laugh i may never drive the freeway again either i was so sure i was dying i think id better tell someone else about this conversation just in case go ahead then said simpson and he had an odd thought this was his last chance to go through with it before she told someone and then an odder thought her tone too light she still didnt believe him he was beginning to doubt it himself had he really intended to kill janet shed hurt him badly shed hurt him by leaving him she the only woman for murray simpson she might as well have taken his testicles along and he wanted to hurt her badly they had reached the house janet pulled into the garage and shut off the ignition do you always leave the door open sometimes i forget very uncomfortably janet asked shall i come in and make you some coffee no no thanks simpson opened the door and got out and felt it end deep peace massless body without sensation the darkness of the blind simpson said what happened you didnt kill her said the voice without character no of course not am i dead again you are dead still how loss of blood through a ruptured spleen symptoms masked by shock your most recent memories were a dry run simpson you did not kill your wife with abstracted logic simpson said but i would have if there hadnt been an accident that is debatable in any case it was your own accident you caused it without help deliberately simpson didnt know your judge will decide shall we go yes they went convergent series it was a girl in my anthropology class who got me interested in magic her name was ann and she called herself a white witch though i never saw her work an effective spell she lost interest in me and married somebody at which point i lost interest in her but by that time magic had become the subject of my thesis in anthropology i couldnt quit and wouldnt if i could magic fascinated me the thesis was due in a month i had a hundred pages of notes on primitive medieval oriental and modern magic modern magic meaning psionics devices and such did you know that certain african tribes dont believe in natural death to them every death is due to witchcraft and in every case the witch must be found and killed some of these tribes are actually dying out due to the number of witchcraft trials and executions medieval europe was just as bad in many ways but they stopped in time id tried several ways of conjuring christian and other demons purely in a spirit of research and id put a taoist curse on professor pauling it hadnt worked mrs miller was letting me use the apartmenthouse basement for experiments notes i had but somehow the thesis wouldnt move i knew why for all id learned i had nothing original to say about anything it wouldnt have stopped everyone but it stopped me until one thursday night i get the damndest ideas in bars this one was a beaut the bartender got my untouched drink as a tip i went straight home and typed for four solid hours it was ten minutes to twelve when i quit but i now had a complete outline for my thesis based on a genuinely new idea in christian witchcraft all id needed was a hook to hang my knowledge on i stood up and stretched and knew id have to try it out all my equipment was in mrs millers basement most of it already set up id left a pentagram on the floor two nights ago i erased that with a wet rag a former washcloth wrapped around a wooden block robes special candles lists of spells new pentagram i worked quietly so as not to wake anyone mrs miller was sympathetic her sense of humor was such that theyd have burned her three centuries ago but the other residents needed their sleep i started the incantations exactly at midnight at fourteen past i got the shock of my young life suddenly there was a demon spreadeagled in the pentagram with his hands and feet and head occupying all five points of the figure i turned and ran he roared come back here i stopped halfway up the stairs turned and came back down to leave a demon trapped in the basement of mrs millets apartment house was out of the question with that amplified basso profundo voice hed have wakened the whole block he watched me come slowly down the stairs except for the horns he might have been a nude middleaged man shaved and painted bright red but if hed been human you wouldnt have wanted to know him he seemed built for all of the seven deadly sins avaricious green eyes enormous gluttonous tank of a belly muscles soft and drooping from sloth a dissipated face that seemed permanently angry lecherous never mind his horns were small and sharp and polished to a glow he waited until i reached bottom thats better now what kept you its been a good century since anyone called up a demon theyve forgotten how i told him nowadays everyone thinks youre supposed to draw the pentagram on the floor the floor they expect me to show up lying on my back his voice was thick with rage i shivered my bright idea a pentagram was a prison for demons why id thought of the five points of a pentagram and the five points of a spreadeagled man well i know it doesnt make sense would you go away now please he stared you have forgotten a lot slowly and patiently as to a child he began to explain the implications of calling up a demon i listened fear and sick hopelessness rose in me until the concrete walls seemed to blur i am in peril of my immortal soul this was something id never considered except academically now it was worse than that to hear the demon talk my soul was already lost it had been lost since the moment i used the correct spell i tried to hide my fear but that was hopeless with those enormous nostrils he must have smelled it he finished and grinned as if inviting comment i said lets go over that again i only get one wish right if you dont like the wish ive got to choose another right that doesnt seem fair who said anything about fair or traditional why hasnt anyone heard about this deal before this is the standard deal jack we used to give a better deal to some of the marks the others didnt have time to talk because of that twentyfourhour clause if they wrote anything down wed alter it we have power over written things which mention us that twentyfourhour clause if i havent taken my wish in twentyfour hours youll leave the pentagram and take my soul anyway thats right and if i do use the wish you have to remain in the pentagram until my wish is granted or until twentyfour hours are up then you teleport to hell to report same and come back for me immediately reappearing in the pentagram i guess teleports a good word i vanish and reappear are you getting bright ideas like what ill make it easy on you if you erase the pentagram i can appear anywhere you can erase it and draw it again somewhere else and ive got to appear inside it a question hovered on my tongue i swallowed it and asked another suppose i wished for immortality youd be immortal for whats left of your twentyfour hours he grinned his teeth were coal black better hurry times running out time i thought okay all or nothing heres my wish stop time from passing outside of me easy enough look at your watch i didnt want to take my eyes off him but he just exposed his black teeth again so i looked down there was a red mark opposite the minute hand on my rolex and a black mark opposite the hour hand the demon was still there when i looked up still spreadeagled against the wall still wearing that knowing grin i moved around him waved my hand before his face when i touched him he felt like marble time had stopped but the demon had remained i felt sick with relief the second hand on my watch was still moving i had expected nothing less time had stopped for me for twentyfour hours of interior time if it had been exterior time id have been safe but of course that was too easy id thought my way into this mess i should be able to think my way out shouldnt i i erased the pentagram from the wall scrubbing until every trace was gone then i drew a new one using a flexible metal tape to get the lines as straight as possible making it as large as i could get it in the confined space it was still only two feet across i left the basement i knew where the nearby churches were though i hadnt been to one in too long my car wouldnt start neither would my roommates motorcycle the spell which enclosed me wasnt big enough i walked to a mormon temple three blocks away the night was cool and balmy and lovely city lights blanked out the stars but there was a fine werewolfs moon hanging way above the empty lot where the mormon temple should have been i walked another eight blocks to find the bnai brith synagogue and the all saints church all i got out of it was exercise i found empty lots for me places of worship didnt exist i prayed i didnt believe it would work but i prayed if i wasnt heard was it because i didnt expect to be but i was beginning to feel that the demon had thought of everything long ago what i did with the rest of that long night isnt important even to me it didnt feel important twentyfour hours against eternity i wrote a fast outline on my experiment in demon raising then tore it up the demons would only change it which meant that my thesis was shot to hell whatever happened i carried a real but rigid scotch terrier into professor paulings room and posed it on his desk the old tyrant would get a surprise when he looked up but i spent most of the night outside walking looking my last on the world once i reached into a police car and flipped the siren on thought about it and flipped it off again twice i dropped into restaurants and ate someones order leaving money which i wouldnt need paperclipped to notes which read the shadow strikes the hour hand had circled my watch twice i got back to the basement at twelve ten with the long hand five minutes from brenschluss that hand seemed painted to the face as i waited my candles had left a peculiar odor in the basement an odor overlaid with the stink of demon and the stink of fear the demon hovered against the wall no longer in a pentagram trapped halfway through a widearmed leap of triumph i had an awful thought why had i believed the demon everything hed said might have been a lie and probably was id been tricked into accepting a gift from the devil i stood up thinking furiously id already accepted the gift but the demon glanced to the side and grinned wider when he saw the chalk lines gone he nodded at me said back in a flash and was gone i waited id thought my way into this but a cheery bass voice spoke out of the air i knew youd move the pentagram made it too small for me didnt you tsk tsk couldnt you guess id change my size there were rustlings and a shimmering in the air i know its here somewhere i can feel it ah he was back spreadeagled before me two feet tall and three feet off the ground his black knowitall grin disappeared when he saw the pentagram wasnt there then he was seven inches tall eyes bugged in surprise yelling in a contralto voice whereinhells the he squealed he was two inches of bright red toy soldier id won tomorrow id get to a church if necessary have somebody lead me in blindfold he was a small red star a buzzing red housefly gone its odd how quickly you can get religion let one demon tell you youre damned could i really get into a church somehow i was sure id make it id gotten this far id outthought a demon eventually hed look down and see the pentagram part of it was in plain sight but it wouldnt help him spreadeagled like that he couldnt reach it to wipe it away he was trapped for eternity shrinking toward the infinitesimal but doomed never to reach it forever trying to appear inside a pentagram which was forever too small i had drawn it on his bulging belly the deadlier weapon he was standing just off overland drive at the mouth of the onramp to the santa monica freeway eastbound he waited with an air of ready confidence and his thumbsmanship seemed practiced his placement was perfect a few yards further up the ramp and no car could have stopped for him without being hit by the car behind a few yards closer and no driver would have known which route he wanted the freeway or the street going past the ramp that was what caught my attention the perfect placement not too far not too near a traveler for sure i dropped my arm out the window to signal hit the brakes and pulled up an easy foot and a half beyond him he was running before the car stopped i pulled the lock knob and he threw the door open and was in grinning wasting no time good again nobody waits for a lazy hitchhiker you trot or you dont ride as soon as he was in i swung between two cars and headed up the ramp accelerating the traffic wasnt bad not at three in the afternoon still when you enter a freeway you concentrate on the traffic everything else gets ignored i hardly knew what my passenger looked like id seen only a poised silhouette with its thumb raised against the afternoon sky but i gave him points again he didnt speak until i was firmly settled in the middleright lane and could afford to relax a little i dont pick up riders often when i do i follow the whim of the moment the ones who look chatty when i want peace and quiet and the ones who look glum or taciturn when im after conversation these get left standing i like the unusual ones the ones who seem to have a kind of salesmanship six months ago thered been a college girl on wilshire carrying a bright red christmas package almost as big as she was she was homesick for kansas shed told me what freezing rains are like when water falls from the sky at night and freezes where it hits so that in the morning all the trees and bushes are tinkling crystal crackling in the wind that would be something to see but i expect i never will once thered been a negro on the freeway carrying a gas can and smoking as soon as he was in the car hed tipped the ash off his cigarette into the gas can okay id said to prove i was alert so you didnt run out of gas where you heading san francisco hed told me hed started in louisiana there was the guy who did run out of gas stranded on the left of the freeway with his wife and four kids oh the kids are no trouble on a trip hed told me we know how to keep them interested we play a game the first kid to spot an edsel gets a double icecream cone immediately must make for frequent stops how long since you last saw an edsel right id never seen two in the same day the hitchhiker said thanks for the lift traffic was fast and easy the cars evenly spaced i risked a look to the side he was young somewhere in his midtwenties his nose was a touch too large and a touch too pointed and his brown hair a touch too long gray plastic sunglasses dark blue windbreaker over a white shirt serviceable gray slacks shoes which looked rugged enough but which were not hiking shoes hed shaved recently despite the long hair he looked too neat to have been on the road long perhaps he was just starting a trip thats okay i said youve used that thumb a lot havent you thats true i heard a click then but it didnt register until later his voice was college educated with a little too much tenor how far you going this time just far enough an odd answer i glanced over at him and found the point of a knife just touching my larynx watch the road he said i turned back now i remembered the click the knife was a switchblade with a sixinch blade not very clean but sharp with the marks of a whetstone along the edge id caught all of that in one glance neither of us is going to get hurt the man with the knife said soothingly he held the point at the side of my neck just touching when you get the chance youre going to pull over to the side and im going to take your watch and the money in your wallet nothing else ill leave the wallet i dont want your credit cards the lane to my left was clear imagine how relieved i must be to hear it i said and eased over my passenger pushed gently with the knife point wrong direction he told me you want to go right i shifted into the far left lane a little too fast the knife point was an itch over my carotid artery my hands wanted to scratch it and i had to fight to keep them on the wheel youve done this before i said keeping my voice light what makes you think so your wording seems too practiced on the one hand the knife on the other youve told me just what youll take and youll leave me the rest the other cars will be going too fast to notice us right thats right hed kept his voice soft and slow while making his pitch but now an edge crept in this isnt rush hour even if someone notices something hell be a mile past us before he decides to stop and do something about it now he put on a touch more pressure and the itch became a burn move over dont do that i said at the increase in pressure id turned to look him full in the face he set his jaw and held the stare and the knife was still at my throat except for that and one other thing it would have been a comic scene two grown men trying to outstare each other watch the road he said not soothingly and then i said watch the road dammit watch the damn road suddenly he turned and braced himself against the padded dash with both hands i looked forward hit the brake and swerved a navy blue riviera missed us by a foot and dropped behind weaving the driver shouting soundlessly and leaning on his horn keep that knife out of my neck i said some of the itch remained and i reached up to scratch it for my trouble i got a sharp stab of pain and a film of blood on my fingertips and you can tell me something else how do i know you wont kill me before you take my wallet cooperate and you wont get hurt why not he lost patience with a smooth quick motion too fast for me to grab at his arm even if i wanted to he had the knife tip at my neck now pull over yeee he jerked back as if hed touched something red hot because id been less quick but i didnt have as far to move at the touch of the knife id yanked the wheel sixty degrees left and instantly back again i pulled the car out of the emergency lane at the left of the freeway fighting the drag of the gravel dont do that i told him whats with you just in a bad mood i guess he was backed up against the right front door of the cadillac he held the knife at ready as if he were the defender and i the attacker he licked his lips and asked do you always drive this way when youre in a bad mood ive never been in this bad a mood before i was trying to sound neither frightened nor belligerent my smile must have looked peculiar twisted as if id put it on wrong look all i want is your shut up you can keep your watch imagine my gratitude now will you shut up youve got nothing to do with this i he couldnt speak he was half strangling on his own indignation and i saw the overpass ahead and i came alert more than alert id passed here before ignoring the scenery now i peered forward to get details some major highway crossed the freeway here the overpass rose gently up a landscaped slope leaped across eight lanes of empty space and dropped as gently back halfway across the gap between the eastbound and westbound lanes were massive concrete pillars ramps curved out to join freeway with highway and there were green signs to tell what turnoff this was if id cared whats wrong my passenger said edgily and i realized how rigidly i was sitting and how hard i was gripping the wheel i didnt relax see that bridge sure okay what about it nothing i wasnt even trying to smile now all i want is some cash the hitchhiker explained patiently you pull over to the side and stop and and you cut my throat and take the car too the cops get nothing but a missingperson report no no no honest all i want i dont care what you want what do you want do you want to live amazing how his voice had lost those soothing overtones i didnt answer the overpass was closer the hitchhiker clamped his lips together nerving himself to something suddenly snakelike he reached with the knife i jerked the wheel and he pulled back against the door the wheel damn near jerked out of my hands as we hit gravel to make it worse the freeway was curving right i fought us around and the bridge was almost on us there were no cars near me maybe they didnt like the way i drove still the freeway curved right gently as always i didnt curve with it i had the accelerator on the floor and we went faster and faster the hitchhiker and the cadillac and me edging over onto the gravel up ahead the gravel safety lane ended and there was the concrete supporting pillar of the bridge with two redfaceted reflectors shining in the midafternoon sunlight i aimed the car right at the reflectors my passenger seemed frozen only his head moved swiveling to look at the supporting pillar and then back to my face and then to the pillar and back to me the pillar was coming up like a creamcolored wall i was terrified i made no attempt to hide it considering the way the wheel was jumping trying to pull across the gravel and into the divider fence before we could reach the bridge support i must have looked like a man wrestling an alligator there was sweat in my eyes and at the last moment i whipped the edge of my right hand across my forehead and back to the wheel now my hand was dripping wet the concrete came at me i whipped the wheel hard over putting my whole body into it the car slewed tried to move sideways tried to roll over we were going to hit sideways through the fragile guard rail and into the supporting pillar then with utmost reluctance the car moved skidding to the right suddenly the concrete was behind us my passenger made a high whimpering sound hesitation marks i gasped i couldnt get enough air reality was a blur was i about to faint i certainly didnt want to faint youre crazy crazy i fumbled for a cigarette and managed to get it to my mouth theres always hesitation marks a man shoots himself in the head you find holes in the wall where he jerked the gun away the first four times if he cuts his throat you find three or four slashes where he didnt cut deep enough i was gasping out the words fighting for air i had to have air youre out of your mind the thing is if i have to die i might as well pick the way i want to go right what are you talking about i was going to marry a girl congratulations if my passenger was trying for sarcasm it didnt come through he only sounded scared he sat facing straight toward me with one leg on the seat and his back hard up against the door watching thanks thanks a whole hell of a lot only she decided i wasnt her type she she tried to tell me wed both known it all along wed just been fooling ourselves she said liar they do that said my passenger everybody does that you know how my dad told me he and mom were getting divorced my cigarette was still in my mouth unlit i reached and stabbed at the car lighter i was fifteen they called me into the living room and i dont care what your father told you when you were fifteen i do my dad walked a few times around the room and then finally he said i suppose you know your mother and i are separated liar theyd kept it from me because they thought it might interfere with my finals at school all i saw of him i saw with the corner of my eye but i saw him start to say something stop close his eyes tight to think the lighter popped out he blurted youre crazy you cant kill yourself just because some bitch gives you the shaft i pulled the lighter out and reached across the seat to touch it to the tip of his nose he never moved to stop me he couldnt believe what i was doing not until he actually felt the heat then he screamed and threw his arms over his face he missed grabbing my arm because id already pulled it back and was lighting my cigarette shes not a bitch i told him and if she was you wouldnt be the one to say it keep your dirty mouth off her let me off said the hitchhiker hed forgotten he had the knife hed tried it before and it hadnt worked why should i i never tried to kill you its not fair who said anything about fair my grin felt natural now after all we were even the blood on my neck matched the burn on his nose look you dont want to kill yourself you dont want to die youre just kidding yourself just wait just wait until tomorrow youll feel different really you will ive felt like that myself i really have but it always went away sometimes it lasted for days but it always its too late its not too late youre still alive this isnt my car what do i look like a cadillac driver eyes see what theyre trained to see what they expect to see a polo shirt is just a tshirt with a collar except for the material pants are pants except to the guy who wears them he knows if they bind or if theyre too loose or if theyre tailored to fit just right if the seat looks shiny then theyre too old but how can you tell when hes sitting down you stole it he said i bobbed my head a couple of times jerkily let me out i dont want to get knifed please fasten your seat belt why but he knew he knew were going to have an accident let me out first look i will you please look i found i was strangling the wheel again because up ahead was where the freeway became a bowl of concrete noodles id driven this route before here in downtown los angeles was where the santa monica freeway led into the harbor santa ana and san bernardino freeways the ramps led up and over and around and under each other and most of the time there was nothing but empty space to left and right speeding cars and empty space separated by fragile metal rails and common sense my passenger knew it too he was swiveling his head toward the road toward me toward the road toward me then he snapped out of it he yelled will you look at me i looked and he twitched because now i wasnt watching the road he was holding the knife out the window holding it with two fingers around the tip of the handle he let it drop ostentatiously and i saw it bounce once in the mirror i dropped the knife he said you saw it now let me out i nodded i braked and swung to the left the car lurched and jerked and tried to pull free and slowed and stopped not too far from where there wouldnt have been gravel to stop on cars whizzed past and the wind of their passing sounded like blows against the side of the cadillac not here ill be killed i touched the accelerator and the car jumped forward he was out and around the side and behind the trunk in one smooth lithe motion and if thered been a car coming it would have hit him i touched the accelerator again to get beyond him then reached across to slam the door hed left open at the next gap in the traffic i was off accelerating hard to keep from being hit from behind the last i saw of the hitchhiker he was hunched over the guard rail actually using it for support not looking at the four lanes of traffic hed have to pass alive i edged to the right across four lanes of hurtling cars being careful i saw no point in getting killed now i took the next turnoff slowing feeling my hands begin to shake my cigarette was still going and i dragged on it practically breathing through it amazingly it was mostly unburned i turned in at the first gas station i saw stopped alongside the pumps and rested my head on the wheel i rubbed my forehead against the smooth surface harder and harder because the sensation told me i was still alive what can we do for you i said hey mister are you all right im fine wheres a telephone over there they were in plain sight i couldnt have missed them if id bothered to look first good fill it up ive got to call the police i had trouble getting the coin in the slot about his height i told the desk sergeant five eleven say you wouldnt call him skinny but hes not fat brown hair a little too long parted on the left long thin face by the time you get to him he should have a great big blister on the end of his nose why at one point i touched him there with a cigarette lighter you did ha id surprised him at first hed sounded like someone who could never be surprised by anything go on mr ruch hes wearing dark glasses a dark blue windbreaker gray slacks i left him stranded on the wrong side of the eastbound lane just west of the olympic turnoff well find him mr ruch can you come down to the station and give us a signed statement he told me how to get there okay fine but will you give me an hour and a half i need a drink i can believe that no hurry mr ruch but we do need that statement one fast drink stopped my shakes at least on the outside i thought i could trust my voice now so i called carla in garden grove ive had some car trouble honey nothing expensive but i wont be home for dinner tell stan and eva im sorry and ill be in around eight if im lucky oh thats a shame what kind of trouble tell you later you have to get up early tomorrow remember rehearsal no problem ill be home in plenty of time by the time i got home id know how to tell carla the truth in a way that wouldnt scare the pants off her two drinks and i began to giggle thinking about the blister on the end of the hitchhikers nose thinking about the hopeful look on his face when he dropped the knife out the window how he had to make so damn sure i was watching him giggles was too much of a good thing so i had a sandwich and a glass of milk to drown the second drink i could legitimately tell carla that the hitchhiker had never had a chance it would reassure her and it was true id been better armed from the beginrung hed had nothing but a knife i had had a car much deadlier i reached the station half an hour late theyd changed desk men i was explaining why i was there when they brought in the hitchhiker he wasnt struggling he seemed completely exhausted he actually had trouble walking but his head came up when he saw me the tip of his nose was a small white bubble surrounded by angry red flesh so you didnt have the guts he snarled you chickened out you yellowbellied he paused to think up an adequately insulting noun ignoring the police officer who jerked warningly at his arm i couldnt go through with it i admitted and looked sheepishly down at the toes of my shoes why tell him he had enough troubles the preceding story was not autobiographical i daydreamed it while driving the santa monica freeway the guy who asked me that question tells me that he was once threatened by a hitchhiker with a knife and that a friend of his tells the same story neither of the two tried that fancy suicide approach they explained to their assailants that if they didnt see total surrender damn quick they were going to obliterate the right side of the car against a tree at sixty mph the left side of the car would have to take its chances it worked for them i hope i wont ever have to try that approach myself death by ecstasy first came the routine request for a breach of privacy permit a police officer took down the details and forwarded the request to a clerk who saw that the tape reached the appropriate civic judge the judge was reluctant for privacy is a precious thing in a world of eighteen billion but in the end he could find no reason to refuse on november nd he granted the permit the tenants rent was two weeks in arrears if the manager of monica apartments had asked for eviction he would have been refused but owen jennison just did not answer his doorbell or his room phone nobody could recall seeing him in many weeks apparently the manager wanted to know that he was all right and so he was allowed to use his passkey with an officer standing by and so they found the tenant of and when they looked in his wallet they called me i was at my desk in arms headquarters making useless notes and wishing it were lunchtime at this stage the loren case was all correlateandwait it involved an organlegging gang apparently run b y a single man yet big enough to cover half the north american west coast we had considerable data on the gangmethods of operation centers of activity a few former customers even a tentative handful of names but nothing that would give us an excuse to act so it was a matter of shoving what we had into the computer watching the few suspected associates of the ganglord loren and waiting for a break the months of waiting were ruining my sense of involvement my phone buzzed i put the pen down and said gil hamilton a small dark face regarded me with soft black eyes i am detectiveinspector julio ordaz of the los angeles police department are you related to an owen jennison owen no were not related is he in trouble you do know him then sure i know him is he here on earth it would seem so ordaz had no accent but the lack of colloquialisms in his speech made him sound vaguely foreign we will need positive identification mr hamilton mr jennisons ident lists you as next of kin thats funny i back in a minute whats happened is owen dead somebody is dead mr hamilton he carried mr jennisons ident in his wallet okay now owen jennison was a citizen of the belt this may have interworid complications that makes it arms business wheres the body we found him in an apartment rented under his own name monica apartments lower los angeles room good dont move anything you havent moved already ill be right over monica apartments was a nearly featureless concrete block eighty stories tall a thousand feet across the edges of its square base lines of small balconies gave the sides a sculptured look above a fortyfoot inset ledge that would keep tenants from drop ping objects on pedestrians a hundred buildings just like it made lower los angeles look lumpy from the air inside was a lobby done in anonymous modern lots of metal and plastic showing lightweight comfortable chairs without arms big ash trays plenty of indirect lighting a low ceiling no wasted space the whole room might have been stamped out with a die it wasnt supposed to look small but it did and that warned you what the rooms would look like i found the managers office and the manager a softlooking man with wateryblue eyes his conservative paper suit dark red seemed chosen to render him invisible as did the style of his brown hair worn long and combed straight back without a part nothing like this has ever happened here he confided as he led me to the elevator banks nothing it would have been bad enough without his being a belter but now he cringed at the thought newsmen theyll smother us the elevator was coffinsized but with the handrails on the inside it went up fast and smooth i stepped out into the long narrow hallway what would owen have been doing in a place like this machinery lived here not people maybe it wasnt owen ordaz had been reluctant to commit himself besides theres no law against picking pockets you couldnt enforce such a law on this crowded planet everyone on earth was a pickpocket sure someone had died carrying owens wallet i walked down the hallway to it was owen who sat grinning in the armchair i took one good look at him enough to be sure and then i looked away and didnt look back but the rest of it was even more unbelievable no belter could have taken that apartment i was born in kansas but even i felt the awful anonymous chill it would have driven owen bats i dont believe it i said did you know him well mr hamilton about as well as two men can know each other he and i spent three years mining rocks in the main asteroid belt you dont keep secrets under those conditions yet you didnt know he was on earth thats what i cant understand why the blazes didnt he phone me if he was in trouble youre an arm said ordaz an operative in the united nations police he had a point owen was as honorable as any man i knew but honor isnt the same in the belt belters think flatlanders are all crooks they dont understand that to a flatlander picking pockets is a game of skill yet a belter sees smuggling as the same kind of game with no dishonesty involved he balances the thirty percent tariff against possible confiscation of his cargo and if the odds are right he gambles owen could have been doing something sticky i admitted but i cant see him killing himself over it and not here he wouldnt have come here was a living room and a bathroom and a closet id glanced into the bathroom knowing what i would find it was the size of a comfortable shower stall an adjustment panel outside the door would cause it to extrude various appurtenances in memory plastic to become a washroom a shower stall a toilet a dressing room a steam cabinet luxurious in everything but size if you pushed the right buttons the living room was more of the same a king bed was invisible behind a wall the kitchen alcove with basin and oven and grill and toaster would fold into another wall the sofa chairs and tables would vanish into the floor one tenant and three guests would make a crowded cocktail party a cozy dinner gathering a closed poker game card table dinner table coffee table were all there surrounded by the appropriate chairs but only one set at a time would emerge from the floor there was no refrigerator no freezer no bar if a tenant needed food or drink he phoned down and the supermarket on the third floor would send it up the tenant of such an apartment had his comfort but he owned nothing there was room for him there was none for his possessions this was one of the inner apartments an age ago there would have been an air shaft but air shafts took up expensive room the tenant didnt even have a window he lived in a comfortable box just now the items extruded were the overstuffed reading armchair two small side tables a footstool and the kitchen alcove owen jennison sat grinning in the armchair naturally he grinned little more than dried skin covered the natural grin of his skull its a small room said ordaz but not too small millions of people live this way in any case a belter would hardly be a claustrophobe no owen flew a singleship before he joined us three months at a stretch in a cabin so small you couldnt stand up with the airlock closed not claustrophobia but i swept my arm about the room what do you see thats his small as it was the closet was nearly empty a set of street clothes a paper shirt a pair of shoes a small brown overnight case all new the few items in the bathroom medicine chest had been equally new and equally anonymous ordaz said well belters are transients they dont own much but what they do own they guard small possessions relics souvenirs i cant be lieve he wouldnt have had something ordaz lifted an eyebrow his space suit you think thats unlikely its not the inside of his pressure suit is a beliers home sometimes its the only home hes got he spends a fortune decorating it if he loses his suit hes not a belter any more no i dont insist hed have brought his suit but hed have had something his phial of marsdust the bit of nickeliron they took out of his chest or if he left all his souvenirs home hed have picked up things on earth but in this roomtheres nothing perhaps ordaz suggested delicately he didnt notice his surroundings and somehow that brought it all home owen jennison sat grinning in a waterstained silk dressing gown his spacedarkened face lightened abruptly beneath his chin giving way to normal suntan his blond hair too long had been cut earth style no trace remained of the belter strip cut hed worn all his life a months growth of untended beard covered half his face a small black cylinder protruded from the top of his head an electric cord trailed from the top of the cylinder and ran to a small wall socket the cylinder was a droud a current addicts transformer i stepped closer to the corpse and bent to look the droud was a standard make but it had been altered your standard current addicts droud will pass only a trickle of current into the brain owen must have been getting ten times the usual charge easily enough to damage his brain in a months time i reached out and touched the droud with my imaginery hand ordaz was standing quietly beside me letting me make my examination without interruption naturally he had no way of knowing about my restricted psi powers restricted was the operative word i had two psychic powers telekinesis and esper with the esper sense i could sense the shapes of objects at a distance but the distance was the reach of an extra right arm i could lift small objects if they were no further away than the fingertips of an imaginary right hand the restriction was a flaw in my own imagination since i could not believe my imaginary hand would reach further than that it wouldnt even so limited a psi power can be useful with my imaginary fingertips i touched the droud in owens head then ran them down to a tiny hole in his scalp and further it was a standard surgical job owen could have had it done anywhere a hole in his scalp invisible under the hair nearly im possible to find even if you knew what you were looking for even your best friends wouldnt know unless they caught you with the droud plugged in but the tiny hole marked a bigger plug set in the bone of the skull i touched the ecstasy plug with my imaginary fingertips then ran them down the hairfine wire going deep into owens brain down into the pleasure center no the extra current hadnt killed him what had killed owen was his lack of wifi power he had been unwilling to get up he had starved to death sitting in that chair there were plastic squeezebottles all around his feet and a couple still on the end table all empty they must have been full a month ago owen hadnt died of thirst he had died of starvation and his death had been planned owen my crewmate why hadnt he come to me fm half a belter myself whatever his trouble id have gotten him out somehow a little smugglingwhat of it why had he arranged to tell me only after it was over the apartment was so clean so clean you had to bend close to smell the death the air conditioning whisked it all away hed been very methodical the kitchen was open so that a catheter could lead from owen to the sink hed given himself enough water to last out the month hed paid his rent a month in advance hed cut the droud cord by hand and hed cut it short deliberately tethering himself to a wall socket beyond reach of the kitchen a complex way to die but rewarding in its way a month of ecstasy a month of the highest physical pleasure man can attain i could imagine him giggling every time he remembered he was starving to death with food only a few footsteps away but hed have to pull out the droud to reach it perhaps he postponed the decision and postponed it again owen and i and homer chandrasekhar we had lived for three years in a cramped shell surrounded by vacuum what was there to know about owen jennison that i hadnt known where was the weakness we did not share if owen had done this so could i and i was afraid very neat i whispered belter neat typically belter would you say i would not belters dont commit suicide certainly not this way if a belter had to go hed blow his ships drive and die like a star the neatness is typical the result isnt well said ordaz well he was uncpmfortable the facts spoke for themselves yet he was reluctant to call me a liar he fell back on formality mr hamilton do you identify this man as owen jennison its him hed always been a touch overweight yet id recognized him the moment i saw him but lets be sure id pulled the dirty dressing gown back from owens shoulder a nearperfect circle of scar tissue eight inches across spread over the left side of his chest see that we noticed it yes an old burn owens the only man i know who could show you a meteor scar on his skin it blasted him in the shoulder one day while he was outside the ship sprayed vaporized pressuresuit steel all over his skin the doc pulled a tiny grain of nickeliron from the center of the scar just below the skin owen always carried that grain of nickeliron always i said looking at ordaz we didnt find it okay im sorry to put you through this mr hamilton it was you who insisted we leave the body in situ yes thank you owen grinned at me from the reading chair i felt the pain in my throat and in the pit of my stomach once i had lost my right arm losing owen felt the same way id like to know more about this i said will you let me know the details as soon as you get them of course through the arms office yes this wasnt arms business despite what id told ordaz but arms prestige would help i want to know why owen died maybe he just cracked up culture shock or something but if someone hounded him to death ill have his blood surely the administration of justice is better left to ordaz stopped confused did i speak as an arm or as a citizen i left him wondering the lobby held a scattering of tenants entering and leaving elevators or just sitting around i stood outside the elevator for a moment searching passing faces for the erosion of personality that must be there massproduced comfort room to sleep and eat and watch tridee but no room to be anyone living here one would own nothing what kind of people would live like that they should have looked all alike moved in unison like the string of images in a barbers mirrors then i spotted wavy brown hair and a dark red paper suit the manager i had to get close before i was sure his face was the face of a permanent stranger he saw me coming and smiled without enthusiasm oh hello mr uh did you find he couldnt think of the right question yes i said answering it anyway but id like to know some things owen jennison lived here for six weeks right six weeks and two days before we opened his room did he ever have visitors the mans eyebrows went up wed drifted in the direction of his office and i was close enough to read the name on the door jasper miller manager of course not he said anyone would have noticed that something was wrong you meant he took the room for the express purpose of dying you saw him once and never again i suppose he might no wait the manager thought deeply no he registered on a thursday i noticed the belter tan of course then on friday he went out i happened to see him pass was that the day he got the droud no skip it you wouldnt know that was it the last time you saw him go out yes it was then he could have had visitors late thursday or early friday the manager shook his head very positively why not you see mr uh hamilton we have a holocamera on every floor mr hamilton it takes a picture of each tenant the first time he goes to his room and then never again privacy is one of the services a tenant buys with his room the manager drew himself up a little as he said this for the same reason the holocamera takes a picture of anyone who is not a tenant the tenants are thus protected from unwarranted intrusions and there were no visitors to any of the rooms on owens floor no sir there were not your tenants are a solitary bunch perhaps they are i suppose a computer in the basement decides who is and is not a tenant of course so for six weeks owen jennison sat alone in his room in all that time he was totally ignored miller tried to turn his voice cold but he was too nervous we try to give our guests privacy if mr jennison had wanted help of any kind he had only to pick up the house phone he could have called me or the pharmacy or the supermarket downstairs well thank you mr miller thats all i wanted to know i wanted to know how owen jennison could wait six weeks to die while nobody noticed miller swallowed he was dying all that time we had no way of knowing how could we i dont see how you can blame us i dont either i said and brushed by miller had been close enough so i had lashed out at him now i was ashamed the man was perfectly right owen could have had help if hed wanted it i stood outside looking up at the jagged blue line of sky that showed between the tops of the buildings a taxi floated into view and i beeped my clicker at it and it dropped i went back to arm headquarters not to worki could not have done any work not under the circumstancesbut to talk to julie julie a tall girl pushing thirty with green eyes and long hair streaked red and gold and two wide brown forceps marks above her right knee but they werent showing now i looked into her office through the oneway glass and watched her at work she sat in a contour couch smoking her eyes were closed sometimes her brow would furrow as she concentrated sometimes she would snatch a glance at the clock then close her eyes again i didnt interrupt her i knew the importance of what she was doing julie she wasnt beautiful her eyes were a little too far apart her chin too square her mouth too wide it didnt matter because julie could read minds she was the ideal date she was everything a man needed a year ago the day after the night i killed my first man i had been in a terribly destructive mood somehow julie had turned it into a mood of manic exhilaration wed run wild through a supervised anarchy park running up an enormous bill wed hiked five miles without going anywhere facing backward on a downtown slidewalk at the end wed been utterly fatigued too tired to think but two weeks ago it had been a warm cuddly comfortable night two people happy with each other no more than that julie was what you needed anytime anywhere her male harem must have been the largest in history to pick up on the thoughts of a male arm julie had to be in love with him luckily there was room in her for a lot of love she didnt demand that we be faithful a good half of us were married but there had to be love for each of julies men or julie couldnt protect him she was protecting us now each fifteen minutes julie was making contact with a specific arm agent psi powers are notoriously undependable but julie was an exception if we got in a hole julie was always there to get us out provided some idiot didnt interrupt her at work so i stood outside waiting with a cigarette in my imaginary hand the cigarette was for practise to stretch the mental muscles in its way my hand was as dependable as julies mindtouch possibly because of its very limitations doubt your psi powers and theyre gone a rigidly defined third arm was more reasonable than some warlock ability to make objects move by wishing at them i knew how an arm felt and what it would do why do i spend so much time lifting cigarettes well its the biggest weight i can lift without strain and theres another reason something taught me by owen at ten minutes to fifteen julie opened her eyes rolled out of the contour couch and came to the door hi gil she said sleepily trouble yah a friend of mine just died i thought youd better know i handed her a cup of coffee she nodded we had a date tonight and this would change its character knowing that she probed lightly my god she said recoiling how how horrible im terribly sorry gil dates off right unless you want to join the ceremonial drunk she shook her head vigorously i didnt know him it wouldnt be proper besides youll be wallowing in your own memories gil a lot of them will be private id cramp your style if you knew i was there to probe now if homer chandrasekhar were here itd be different i wish he were hell have to throw his own drunk maybe with some of owens girls if theyre around you know what i feel she said just what i do i wish i could help you always help i glanced at the clock your coffee breaks about over slave driver julie took my earlobe between thumb and forefinger do him proud she said and went back to her soundproof room she always helps she doesnt even have to speak just knowing that julie has read my thoughts that someone understands thats enough all alone at three in the afternoon i started my ceremonial drunk the ceremonial drunk is a young custom not yet tied down by formality there is no set duration no specific toasts must be given those who participate must be close friends of the deceased but there is no set number of participants i started at the luau a place of cool blue light and running water outside it was fifteenthirty in the afternoon but inside it was evening in the hawaiian islands of centuries ago already the place was half full i picked a corner table with considerable elbow room and dialed for a luau grog it came cold brown and alcoholic its straw tucked into a cone of ice there had been three of us at cubes forsythes ceremonial drunk one black ceres night four years ago a sorry group we were too owen and me and the widow of our third crewman gwen forsythe blamed us for her husbands death i was just out of the hospital with a right arm that ended at the shoulder and i blamed cubes and owen and myself all at once even owen had turned dour and introspective we couldnt have picked a worse trio or a worse night for it if wed tried but custom called and we were there then as now i found myself probing my own personality for the wound that was a missing crewman a missing friend introspecting gilbert hamilton born of flatlander parents in april in topeka kansas born with two arms and no sign of wild talents flatlander a belter term referring to earthmen and particularly to earthmen who had never seen space im not sure my parents ever looked at the stars they managed the third largest farm in kansas ten square miles of arable land between two wide strips of city paralleling two strips of turnpike we were city people like all flatlanders but when the crowds got to be too much for my brothers and me we had vast stretches of land to be alone in ten square miles of playground with nothing to hamper us but the crops and automachinery we looked at the stars my brothers and i you couldnt see stars from the city the lights hide them even in the fields you couldnt see them around the lighted horizon but straight overhead they were there black sky scattered with bright dots and sometimes a flat white moon at twenty i gave up my un citizenship to become a belter i wanted stars and the belt government holds title to most of the solar system there are fabulous riches in the rocks riches belonging to a scattered civilization of a few hundred thousand belters and i wanted my shareof that too it wasnt easy i wouldnt be eligible for a singleship license for ten years meanwhile i would be working for others and learning to avoid mistakes before they killed me half the flatlanders who join the belt die in space before they can earn their licenses i mined tin on mercury and exotic chemicals from jupiters atmosphere i hauled ice from saturns rings and quicksilver from europa one year our pilot made a mistake pulling up to a new rock and we damn near had to walk home cubes forsythe was with us then he managed to fix the com laser and aim it at icarus to bring us help another time the mechanic who did the maintenance job on our ship forgot to replace an absorber and we all got roaring drunk on the alcohol that built up in our breathingair the three of us caught the mechanic six months later i hear he lived most of the time i was part of a threeman crew the members changed constantly when owen jennison joined us he replaced a man who had finally earned his singleship license and couldnt wait to start hunting rocks on his own he was too eager i learned later that hed made one round trip and half of another owen was my age but more experienced a belter born and bred his blue eyes and blond cockatoos crest were startling against the dark of his belter tan the tan that ended so abruptly where his neck ring cut off the spaceintense sunlight his helmet let through he was permanently chubby but in free fall it was as if hed been born with wings i took to copying his way of moving much to cubes amusement i didnt make my own mistake until i was twentysix we were using bombs to put a rock in a new orbit a contract job the technique is older than fusion drives as old as early belt colonization and its still cheaper and faster than using a ships drive to tow the rock you use industrial fusion bombs small and clean and you get them so that each explosion deepens the crater to channel the force of later blasts wed set four blasts already four white fireballs that swelled and faded as they rose when the fifth blast went off we were hovering nearby on the other side of the rock the fifth blast shattered the rock cubes had set the bomb my own mistake was a shared one because any of the three of us should have had the sense to take off right then instead we watched cursing as valuable oxygenbearing rock became nearvalueless shards we watched the shards spread slowly into a cloud and while we watched one fastmoving shard reached us moving too slowly to vaporize when it hit it nonetheless sheered through a triple crystaliron hull slashed through my upper arm and pinned cubes forsythe to a wall by his own heart a couple of nudists came in they stood blinking among the booths while their eyes adjusted to the blue twilight then converged with glad cries on the group two tables over i watched and listened with an eye and an ear thinking how different flatlander nudists were from belter nudists these all looked alike they all had muscles they had no interesting scars they carried their credit cards in identical shoulder pouches and they all shaved the same areas we always went nudist in the big bases most people did it was a natural reaction to the pressure suits we wore day and night while out in the rocks get him into a shortsleeve environment and your normal belter sneers at a shirt but its only for comfort give him a good reason and your belter will don shirt and pants as quickly as the next guy but not owen after he got that meteor scar i never saw him wear a shirt not just in the ceres domes but anywhere there was air to breath he just had to show that scar a cool blue mood settled on me and i remembered owen jennison lounging on a corner of my hospital bed telling me of the trip back i could not remember anything after that rock sheered through my arm i should have bled to death in seconds owen hadnt given me the chance the wound was ragged owen had sliced it clean to the shoulder with one swipe of a corn laser then hed tied a length of fiberglass curtain over the flat surface and knotted it tight under my remaining armpit he told me about putting me under two atmospheres of pure oxygen as a substitute for replacing the blood id lost he told me how hed reset the fusion drive for four gees to get me back in time by rights we should have gone up in a cloud of starfire and glory so there goes my reputation the whole belt knows how i rewired our drive a lot of em figure if im stupid enough to risk my own life like that id risk theirs too so youre not safe to travel with just so theyre starting to call me four gee jennison you think youve got problems i can just see how itll be when i get back to this bed you do something stupid gil the hell of it is it was stupid so lie a little uh huh can we sell the ship nope gwen inherited a third interest in it from cubes she wont sell then were effectively broke except for the ship we need another crewman correction you need two crewmen unless you want to fly with a onearmed man i cant afford a transplant owen hadnt tried to offer me a loan that would have been insuiting even if hed had the money whats wrong with a prosthetic an iron arm sorry no owen had looked at me strangely but all hed said was well well wait a bit maybe youll change your mind he hadnt pressured me not then and not later after id left the hospital and taken an apartment while i waited to get used to a missing arm if he thought i would eventually settle for a prosthetic he was mistaken why its not a question i can answer others obviously feel differently there are millions of people walking around with metal and plastic and silicone parts part man part machine and how do they themselves know which is the real person id rather be dead than part metal call it a quirk call it even the same quirk that makes my skin crawl when i find a place like monica apartments a human being should be all human he should have habits and possessions peculiarly his own he should not try to look like or to behave like anyone but himself so there i was gil the arm learning to eat with my left hand an amputee never entirely loses what hes lost my missing fingers itched i moved to keep from barking my missing elbow on sharp corners i reached for things then swore when they did not come owen had hung around though his own emergency funds must have been running low i hadnt offered to sell my third of the ship and he hadnt asked there had been a girl now id forgotten her name one night i was at her place waiting for her to get dresseda dinner date and id happened to see a nail file shed left on the table id picked it up id almost tried to file my nails but remembered in time irritated i had tossed the ifie back on the tableand missed like an idiot id tried to catch it with my right hand and id caught it id never suspected myself of having psychic powers you have to be in the right frame of mind to use a psi power but who had ever had a better opportunity than i did that night with a whole section of brain tuned to the nerves and muscles of my right arm and no right arm id held the nail ifie in my imaginary hand id felt it just as id felt my missing fingernails getting too long i had run my thumb along the rough steel surface i had turned the ifie in my fingers telekinesis for lift esper for touch thats it owen had said the next day thats all we need one crewman and you with your eldritch powers you practice see how strong you can get that lift ill go find a sucker hell have to settle for a sixth of net cubes widow will want her share dont worry ill swing it dont worry id waved a pencil stub at him even in ceres gentle gravity it was as much as i could liftthen you dont think tk and esper can make do for a real arm do you its better than a real arm youll see youll be able to reach through your suit with it without losing pressure what belter can do that sure what the hell do you want gil someone should give you your arm back you cant have that you lost it fair and square through stupidity now its your choice do you fly with an imaginary arm or do you go back to earth i cant go back i dont have the fare well okay okay go find us a crewman someone i can impress with my imaginary arm i sucked meditatively on a second luau grog by now all the booths were full and a second layer was forming around the bar the voices made a continuous hypnotic uproar cocktail hour had arrived hed swung it all right on the strength of my imaginary arm owen had talked a kid named homer chandrasekhar into joining our crew hed been right about my arm too others with similar senses can reach further up to halfway around the world my unfortunately literal imagination had restricted me to a psychic hand but my esper fingertips were more sensitive more dependable i could lift more weight today in earths gravity i can lift a full shot glass i found i could reach through a cabin wall to feel for breaks in the circuits behind it in vacuum i could brush dust from the outside of my faceplate in port i did magic tricks id almost ceased to feel like a cripple it was all due to owen in six months of mining i had paid off my hospital bills and earned my fare back to earth with a comfortable stake left over finagles black humor owen had exploded when i told him of all places why earth because if i can get my un citizenship back earth will replace my arm free oh thats true hed said dubiously the belt had organ banks too but they were always undersupplied belters didnt give things away neither did the belt government they kept the prices on transplants as high as they would go thus they dropped the demand to meet the supply and that kept taxes down to boot in the belt id have had to buy my own arm and i didnt have the money on earth there was social security and a vast supply of transplant material what owen had said couldnt be done id done id found someone to hand me my arm back sometimes id wondered if owen held the choice against me hed never said anything but homer chandrasekhar had spoken at length a belter would have earned his ann or done without never would he have accepted charity was that why owen hadnt tried to call me i shook my head i didnt believe it the room continued to lurch after my head stopped shaking id had enough for the moment i finished my third grog and ordered dinner dinner sobered me for the next lap it was something of a shock to realize that id run through the entire lifespan of my friendship with owen jennison id known him for three years though it had seemed like half a lifetime and it was half my sixyear lifespan as a belter i ordered coffee grog and watched the man pour it hot milky coffee laced with cinnamon and other spices and highproof rum poured in a stream of blue fire this was one of the special drinks served by a human headwaiter and it was the reason they kept him around phase two of the ceremonial drunk blow half your fortune in the grand manner but i called ordaz before i touched the drink i wont keep you long have you found out anything new ordaz took a closer look at my phone image his disapproval was plain i see that you have been drinking perhaps you should go home now and call me tomorrow i was shocked dont you know anything about belt customs i do not understand i explained the ceremonial drunk look ordaz if you know that little about the way a belter thinks then wed better have a talk soon otherwise youre likely to miss something you may be right i can see you at noon over lunch good what have you got considerable but none of it is very helpful your friend landed on earth two months ago arriving on the pillar of fire operating out of outback field australia he was wearing a haircut in the style of earth from there thats funny hed have had to wait two months for his hair to grow out that occurred even to me i understand that a belter com monly shaves his entire scalp except for a strip two inches wide running from the nape of his neck forward the strip cut yah it probably started when someone decided hed live longer if his hair couldnt fall in his eyes during a tricky landing but owen could have let his hair grow out during a singleship mining trip thered be nobody to see still it seems odd did you know that mr jennison had a cousin on earth one harvey peele who manages a chain of supermarkets so i wasnt his next of kin even on earth mr jennison made no attempt to contact him anything else ive spoken to the man who sold mr jennison his droud and plug kenneth graham owns an office and operating room on gayley in near west los angeles graham claims that the droud was a standard type that your friend must have altered it himself do you believe him for the present his permits and his records are all in order the droud was altered with a soldering iron just an amateurs tool uh huh as far as the police are concerned the case will probably be closed when we locate the tools mr jennison used tell you what ill wire homer chandrasekhar tomorrow maybe he can find out thingswhy owen landed without a strip haircut why he came to earth at all ordaz shrugged with his eyebrows he thanked me for my trouble and hung up the coffee grog was still hot i gulped at it savoring the sugary bittery sting of it trying to forget owen dead and remember him in life he was always slightly chubby i remembered but he never gained a pound and he never lost a pound he could move like a whippet when he had to and now he was terribly thin and his deathgrin was ripe with obscene joy i ordered another coffee grog the waiter a showman made sure he had my attention before he lit the heated rum then poured from a foot above the glass you cant drink that drink slowly it slides down too easily and theres the added spur that if you wait too long it might get cold rum and strong coffee two of these and id be drunkenly alert for hours midnight found me in the mars bar runncng on scotch and soda in between id been barhopping irish coffee at bergins cold and smoking concoctions at the moon pool scotch and wild music at beyond i couldnt get drunk and i couldnt find the right mood there was a barrier to the picture i was trying to rebuild it was the memory of the last owen grinning in an armchair with a wire leading down into his brain i didnt know that owen i had never met the man and never would have wanted to from bar to night club to restaurant i had run from the image waiting for the alcohol to break the barrier between present and past so i sat at a corner table surrounded by d panoramic views of an impossible mars crystal towers and long straight blue canals sixlegged beasts and beautiful impossibly slender men and women looked out at me across nevernever land would owen have found it sad or funny hed seen the real mars and had not been impressed i had reached that stage where time becomes discontinuous where gaps of seconds or minutes appear between the events you can remember somewhere in that period i found myself staring at a cigarette i must have just lighted it because it was near its original twohundredmillimeter length maybe a waiter had snuck up behind me there it was at any rate burning between my middle and index fingers i stared at the coal as the mood settled on me i was calm i was drifting i was lost in time wed been two months in the rocks our first trip out since the accident back we came to ceres with a holdful of gold fifty percent pure guaranteed suitable for rustproof wiring and conductor plates at nightfall we were ready to celebrate we walked along the city limits with neon blinking and beckoning on the right a melted rock cliff to the left and stars blazing through the dome overhead homer chandrasekhar was practically snorting on this night his first trip out culminated in his first homecoming and homecoming is the best part well want to split up about midnight he said he didnt need to enlarge on that three men in company might conceivably be three singleship pilots but chances are theyre a ships crew they dont have their singleship licenses yet theyre too stupid or too inexperienced if we wanted companions you havent thought this through owen answered i saw homers double take then his quick look at where my shoulder ended and i was ashamed i did not need my crewmates to hold my hand and in this state id only slow them down before i could open my mouth to protest owen went on think it through weve got a draw here that wed be idiots to throw away gil pick up a cigarette no not with your left hand i was drunk gloriously drunk and feeling immortal the attenuated martians seemed to move in the walls the walls that seemed to be picture windows on a mars that never was for the first time that night i raised my glass in toast to owen from gil the arm thanks i transferred the cigarette to my imaginary hand by now youve got the idea i was holding it in my imaginary fingers most people have the same impression but it isnt so i held it clutched ignominiously in my fist the coal couldnt burn me of course but it still felt like a lead ingot i rested my imaginary elbow on the table and that seemed to make it easierwhich is ridiculous but it works truly id expected my imaginary arm to disappear after i got the transplant but id found i could dissociate from the new arm to hold small objects in my invisible hand to feel tactile sensations in my invisible fingertips id earned the title gil the arm that night in ceres it had started with a floating cigarette owen had been right everyone in the place eventually wound up staring at the floating cigarette smoked by the onearmed man all i had to do was find the prettiest girl in the room with my peripheral vision then catch her eye that night we had been the center of the biggest impromptu party ever thrown in ceres base it wasnt planned that way at all id used the cigarette trick three times so that each of us would have a date but the third girl already had an escort and he was celebrating something hed sold some kind of patent to an earthbased industrial firm he was throwing money around like con fetti so we let him stay i did tricks reaching esper fingers into a closed box to tell what was inside and by the time i finished all the tables had been pushed together and i was in the center with homer and owen and three girls then w e got to singing old songs and the bartenders joined us and suddenly everything was on the house eventually about twenty of us wound up in the orbiting mansion of the first speaker for the belt government the goldskin cops had tried to bust us up earlier and the first speaker had behaved very rudely indeed then compensated by inviting them to join us and that was why i used tkon so many cigarettes across the width of the mars bar a girl in a peach colored dress sat studying me with her chin on her fist i got up and went over my head felt fine it was the first thing i checked when i woke up apparently id remembered to take a hangover pill a leg was hooked over my knee it felt good though the pressure had put my foot to sleep fragrant dark hair spilled beneath my nose i didnt move i didnt want her to know i was awake its damned embarrassing when you wake up with a girl and cant remember her name well lets see a peach dress hung neatly from a doorknob i remembered a whole lot of traveling last night the girl at the mars bar a puppet show music of all kinds id talked about owen and shed steered me away from that because it depressed her then hah taffy last name forgotten morning i said morning she said dont try to move were hooked together in the sober morning light she was lovely long black hair brown eyes creamy untanned skin to be lovely this early was a neat trick and i told her so and she smiled my lower leg was dead meat until it started to buzz with renewed circulation and then i made faces until it calmed down taffy kept up a running chatter as we dressed that third hand is strange i remember you holding me with two strong arms and stroking the back of my neck with the third very nice it reminded me of a fritz leiber story the wanderer the panther girl mm hnim how many girls have you caught with that cigarette trick none as pretty as you and how many girls have you told that to cant remember it always worked before maybe this time its for real we exchanged grins a minute later i caught her frowning thoughtfully at the back of my neck something wrong i was just thinking you really crashed and burned last night i hope you dont drink that much all the time why you worried about me she blushed then nodded i should have told you in fact i think i did last night i was on a ceremonial drunk when a good friend dies its obligatory to get smashed taffy looked relieved i didnt mean to get personal why not youve the right anyway i like i meant maternal types but i couldnt say that people who worry about me taffy touched her hair with some kind of complex comb a few strokes snapped her hair instantly into place static electricity it was a good drunk i said owen would have been proud and thats all the mourning ill do one drunk and i spread my hands out its not a bad way to go taffy mused reflectively current stimulus i mean i mean if youve got to bow out now drop that i dont know how i got so angry so fast ghoulthin and grinning in a reading chair owens corpse was suddenly vivid to me id fought that image for too many hours walking off a bridge is enough of a copout i snarled dying for a month while current burns out your brain is nothing less than sickening taffy was hurt and bewildered but your friend did it didnt he you didnt make him sound like a weakling nuts i heard myself say he didnt do it he was just like that i was sure i must have realized it while i was drunk or sleeping of course he hadnt kified himself that wasnt owen and current addiction wasnt owen either i made a dive for the phone good morning mr hamilton detectiveinspector ordaz looked very fresh and neat this morning i was suddenly aware that i hadnt shaved i see you remembered to take your hangover pills right ordaz has it occurred to you that owen might have been murdered naturally but it isnt possible i think it might be suppose he mr hamilton yah we have an appointment for lunch shall we discuss it then meet me at headquarters at twelve hundred okay one thing you might take care of this morning see if owen registered for a nudists license do you think he might have yah ill tell you why at lunch very well dont hang up you said you had found the man who sold owen his droudandplug what was his name again kenneth graham thats what i thought i hung up sure i said to myself somebody killed him and that meansyah yah i turned around to get my shirt and found myself face to face with taffy id forgotten about her completely she said killed as if shed never heard the word yah see the whole setup depended on his not being able to no wait i dont really want to know about it she really didnt the very subject of a strangers death was making her sick to her stomach okay look im a ratfink not to at least offer you breakfast but ive got to get on this right away can i call you a cab when the cab came i dropped a tenmark coin in the slot and helped her in i got her address before it took off arm headquarters hummed with early morning activity hellos came my way and i answered them without stopping to talk anything important would ifiter down to me eventually as i passed julies cubicle i glanced in she was hard at work limply settled in her contour couch jotting notes with her eyes closed kenneth graham a hookup to the basement computer formed the greater part of my desk learning how to use it had taken me several months i typed an order for coffee and doughnuts then information retrieval kenneth graham limited license surgery general license direct current stimulus equipment sales address near west los angeles tape chattered out of the slot an instant response loop after loop of it curling on my desk i didnt need to read it to know i was right new technologies create new customs new laws new ethics new crimes about half the activity of the united nations police the arms dealt with control of a crime that hadnt existed a century ago the crime of organlegging was the result of thousands of years of medical progress of mfflions of lives sefflessly dedicated to the ideal of healing the sick progress had brought these ideals to reality and as usual had created new problems ad was the year carl landsteiner classified human blood into four types giving patients their first real chance to survive a transfusion the technology of transplants had grown with the growing of the twentieth century whole blood dry bone skin live kidneys live hearts could all be transferred from one body to another donors had saved tens of thousands of lives in that hundred years by willing their bodies to medicine but the number of donors was limited and not many died in such a way that anything of value could be saved the deluge had come something less than a hundred years ago one healthy donor could save a dozen lives why then should a condemned ax murderer die to no purpose first a few states then most of the nations of the world had passed new laws criminals condemned to death must be executed in a hospital with surgeons to save as much as could be saved for the organ banks the worlds bfflions wanted to live and the organ banks were life itself a man could live forever as long as the doctors could shove spare parts into him faster than his own parts wore out but they could do that only as long as the worlds organ banks were stocked a hundred scattered movements to abolish the death penalty died silent unpublicized deaths everybody gets sick sometime and still there were shortages in the organ banks still patients died for the lack of parts to save them the worlds legislators had responded to steady pressure from the worlds people death penalties were established for first second and third degree murder for assault with a deadly weapon then for a multitude of crimes rape fraud embezzlement having children without a license four or more counts of false advertising for nearly a century the trend had been growing as the worlds voting citizens acted to protect their right to live forever even now there werent enough transplants a woman with kidney trouble might wait a year for a transplant one healthy kidney to last the rest of her life a thirtyfiveyearold heart patient must live with a sound but fortyyearold heart one lung part of a liver prosthetics that wore out too fast or weighed too much or did too little there werent enough criminals not surprisingly the death penalty was a deterrent people stopped committing crimes rather than face the donor room of a hospital for instant replacement of your ruined digestive system for a young healthy heart for a whole liver when youd ruined yours with alcohol you had to go to an organlegger there are three aspects to the business of organlegging one is the business of kidnapmurder its risky you cant fill an organ bank by waiting for volunteers executing condemned criminals is a government monopoly so you go out and get your donors on a crowded city slidewalk in an air terminal stranded on a freeway by a car with a busted capacitor anywhere the selling end of the business is just as dangerous because even a desperately sick man sometimes has a conscience hell buy his transplant then go straight to the arms curing his sickness and his conscience by turning in the whole gang thus the sales end is somewhat anonymous but as there are few repeat sales that hardly matters third is the technical medical aspect probably this is the safest part of the business your hospital is big but you can put it anywhere you wait for the donors who arrive still alive you ship out livers and glands and square feet of live skin correctly labeled for rejection reactions its not as easy as it sounds you need doctors good ones that was where loren came in he had a monopoly where did he get them we were still trying to find out somehow one man had discovered a foolproof way to recruit talented but dishonest doctors practically en masse was it really one man all our sources said it was and he had half the north american west coast in the palm of his hand loren no holographs no fingerprints or retina prints not even a description all we had was that one name and a few possime contacts one of these was kenneth graham the holograph was a good one probably it had been posed in a portrait shop kenneth graham had a long scottish face with a lantern jaw and a small dour mouth in the holo he was trying to smile and look dignified simultaneously he only looked uncomfortable his hair was sandy and close cut above his light gray eyes his eyebrows were so light as to be nearly invisible my breakfast arrived i dunked a doughnut and bit it and found out i was hungrier than id thought a string of holos had been reproduced on the computer tape i ran through the others fairly quickly eating with one hand and ifipping the key with the other some were fuzzy they had been taken by spy beams through the windows of grahams shop none of the prints were in any way incriminating not one showed graham smiling he had been seffing electrical joy for twelve years now a current addict has an advantage over his supplier electricity is cheap with a drug your supplier can always raise the price on you but not with electricity you see the ecstasy merchant once when he sells you your operation and your droud and never again nobody gets hooked by accident theres an honesty to current addiction the customer always knows just what hes getting into and what it wifi do for himand to him still youd need a certain lack of empathy to make a living the way kenneth graham did else hed have had to turn away his customers nobody becomes a current addict gradually he decides all at once and he buys the operation before he has ever tasted its joy each one of kenneth grahams customers had reached his shop after deciding to drop out of the human race what a stream of the hopeless and the desperate must have passed through grahams shop how could they help but haunt his dreams and if kenneth graham slept well at night then then small wonder if he had turned organlegger he was in a good position for it despair is characteristic of the wouldbe current addict the unknown the unloved the people nobody knew and nobody needed and nobody missed these passed in a steady stream through kenneth grahams shop so a few didnt come out who would notice i ffipped quickly through the tape to find out who was in charge of watching graham jackson bera i called down through the desk phone sure said bera weve had a spy beam on him about three weeks now its a waste of good salaried arm agents maybe he is clean maybe hes been tipped then why not stop watching him bera looked disgusted because weve only been watching for three weeks how many donors do you think he needs a year two read the reports gross profit on a single donor is over a million un marks graham can afford to be careful who he picks yah at that he wasnt careful enough at least two of his customers disappeared last year customers with families thats what put us on him so you could watch him for the next six months without a guarantee he could be just waiting for the right guy to walk in sure he has to write up a report on every customer that gives him the right to ask personal questions if the guy has relatives graham lets him walk out most people do have relatives you know then again bera said disconsolately he could be clean sometimes a current addict disappears without help how come i didnt see any holos of graham at home you cant be watching just his shop jackson bera scratched his hair he had hair like black steel wool worn long like a bushmans mop sure were watching his place but we cant get a spy beam in there its an inside apartment no windows you know anything about spy beams not much i know theyve been around a while theyre as old as lasers oldest trick in the book is to put a mirror in the room you want to bug then you run a laser beam through a window or even through heavy drapes and bounce it off the mirror when you pick it up its been distorted by the vibrations in the glass that gives you a perfect recording of anything thats been said in that room but for pictures you need something a little more sophisticated how sophisticated can we get we can put a spy beam in any room with a window we can send one through some kinds of wall give us an optically flat surface and we can send one around corners but you need an outside wall yup whats graham doing now just a sec bera disappeared from view someone just came in grahams talking to him want the picture sure leave it on ill turn it off from here when im through with it the picture of bera went dark a moment later i was looking into a doctors office if id seen it cold id have thought it was run by a podiatrist there was the comfortable tiltback chair with the headrest and the footrest the cabinet next to it with instruments lying on top on a clean white cloth the desk over in one corner kenneth graham was talking to a homely washedoutlooking girl i listened to grahams wouldbefatherly reassurances and his glowing description of the magic of current addiction when i couldnt take it any longer i turned the sound down the girl took her place in the chair and graham placed something over her head the girls homely face turned suddenly beautiful happiness is beautiful all by itself a happy person is beautiful per se suddenly and totally the girl was full of joyand i realized that i hadnt known everything about droud sales apparently graham had an inductor to put the current where he wanted it without wires he could show a customer what current addiction felt like without first implanting the wires what a powerful argument graham turned off the machine it was as if hed turned off the girl she sat stunned for a moment then reached frantically for her purse and started scrabbling inside i couldnt take any more i turned it off small wonder if graham had turned organlegger he had to be totally without empathy just to sell his merchandise even there i thought hed had a head start so he was a little more callous than the rest of the worlds billions but not much every voter had a bit of the organlegger in him in voting the death penalty for so many crimes the lawmakers had only bent to pressure from the voters there was a spreading lack of respect for life the evil side of transplant technology the good side was no longer life for everyone one condemned criminal could save a dozen deserving lives who could complain about that we hadnt thought that way in the belt in the belt survival was a virtue in itself and life was a precious thing spread so thin among the sterile rocks hurthng in single units through all that killing emptiness between the worlds so id had to come to earth for my transplant my request had been accepted two months after i landed so quickly later id learned that the banks always have a surplus of certain items few people lose their arms these days i had also learned a year after the transplant had taken that i was using an arm from a captured organleggers storage tank that had been a shock id hoped my arm had come from a depraved murderer someone whod shot fourteen nurses from a rooftop not at all some faceless nameless victim had had the bad luck to encounter a ghoul and i had benefited thereby did i turn in my new arm in a fit of revulsion no surprising to say i did not but i had joined the arms once the amalgamation of regional militia now the united nations police though i had stolen a dead mans arm i would hunt the kin of those who had killed him the noble urgency of that resolve had been drowned in paperwork these last few years perhaps i was becoming callous like the flatlandersthe other flatlanders around me voting new death penalties year after year income tax evasion operating a flying vehicle on manual controls over a city was kenneth graham so much worse than they sure he was the bastard had put a wire in owen jennisons head i waited twenty minutes for julie to come out i could have sent her a memorandum but there was plenty of time before noon and too little time to get anything accomplished and i wanted to talk to her hi she said taking the coffee thanks how went the ceremonial drunk oh i see mmm very good almost poetic conversation with julie has a way of taking shortcuts poetic right i remembered how inspiration had struck like lightning through a mild high glow owens floating cigarette lure what better way to honor his memory than to use it to pick up a girl right julie agreed but theres something you may have missed whats taffys last name i cant remember she wrote it down on what does she do for a living how should i know what religion is she is she a pro or an anti where did she grow up danimit half an hour ago you were very complacently musing on how depersonalized all us flatlanders are except you whats taffy a person or a foldout julie stood with her hands on her hips looking like a schoolteacher how many people is julie some of us have never seen this guardian aspect shes frightening the guardian if it ever appeared on a date the man she was with would be struck impotent forever it never does when a reprimand is deserved julie delivers it in broad daylight this serves to separate her functions but it doesnt make it easier to take no use pretending it wasnt her business either id come here to ask for julies protection let me turn unlovable to julie even a little bit unlovable and as far as julie was concerned i would have an unreadable mind how then would she know when i was in trouble how could she send help to rescue me from whatever my private life was her business her single vastly important job i like taffy i protested i didnt care who she was when we met now i like her and i think she likes me what do you want from a first date you know better you can remember other dates when two of you talked all night on a couch just from the joy of learning about each other she mentioned three names and i flushed julie knows the words that will turn you inside out in an instant taffy is a person not an episode not a symbol of apything not just a pleasant night whats your judgment of her i thought about it standing there in the corridor funny ive faced the guardian julie on other occasions and it has never occurred to me to just walk out of the unpleasant situation later i think of that at the time i just stand there facing the guardian judge teacher i thought about taffy shes nice i said not depersonalized squeamish even she wouldnt make a good nurse shed want to help too much and it would tear her apart when she couldnt id say she was one of the vulnerable ones go on i want to see her again but i wont dare talk shop with her in fact id better not see her till this business of owen is over loren might take an interest in her or she might take an interest in me and i might get hurt have i missed anything i think so you owe her a phone call if you wont be dating her for a few days call her and tell her so check i spun on my heel spun back finagles jest i almost forgot the reason i came here i know you want a time slot suppose i check on you at oh nine fortyfive every morning thats a little early when i get in deadly danger its usually at night im off at night oh nine fortyfive is all ive got im sorry gil but it is sold nine fortyfive good let me know if you get real proof owen was murdered ill give you two slots youll be in a little more concrete danger then good i love you yeep im late and she dodged back into her office while i went to call taffy taffy wasnt home of course and i didnt know where she worked or even what she did her phone offered to take a message i gave my name and said id call back and then i sat there sweating for five minutes it was half an hour to noon here i was at my desk phone i couldnt decently see any way to argue myself out of sending a message to homer chandrasekhar i didnt want to talk to him then or ever hed chewed me out but good last time id seen him my free arm had cost me my belier life and it had cost me homers respect i didnt want to talk to him even on a oneway message and i most particularly didnt want to have to tell him owen was dead but someone had to tell him and maybe he could find out something and id put it off nearly a full day for five minutes i sweated and then i called long distance and recorded a message and sent it off to ceres more accurately i recorded six messages before i was satisfied i dont want to talk about it i tried taffy again she might come home for lunch wrong i hung up wondering if julie had been fair what had we bargained for taffy and i beyond a pleasant night and wed had that and would have others with luck but julie would find it hard not to be fair if she thought taffy was the vulnerable type shed take her information from my own mind mixed feelings youre a kid and your mother has just laid down the law but it is a law something you can count on and she is paying attention to you and she does care when for so many of those outside nobody cares at all naturally i thought of murder said ordaz i always consider murder when my sainted mother passed away after three years of the most tender care by my sister maria angela i actually considered searching for evidence of needle holes about the head find anything unusual ordazs face froze he put down his beer and started to get up cool it i said hurriedly no offense intended he glared a moment then sat down half mollified wed picked an outdoor restaurant on the pedestrian level on the other side of a hedge the shoppers were carried past in a steady oneway stream beyond them a slidewalk carried a similar stream in the opposite direction i had the dizzy feeling that it was we who were moving a waiter like a bellbottomed chess pawn produced steaming dishes of chili from its torso put them precisely in front of us and slid away on a cushion of air naturally i considered murder believe me mr hamilton it does not hold up i think i could make a pretty good case you may try of course better i will start you on your way first we must assume that kenneth graham the happiness peddler did not sell a droudandplug to owen jennison rather owen jennison was forced to undergo the operation grahams records including the written permission to operate were forged all this we must assume is it not so right and before you tell me grahams escutcheon is unblemished let me tell you that it isnt oh hes connected with an organlegging gang thats classified information were watching him and we dont want him tipped that is news ordaz rubbed his jaw organlegging well what would owen jennison have to do with organlegging owens a belter the belts always drastically short of transplant materials yes they import quantities of medical supplies from earth not only organs in storage but also drugs and prosthetics so owen ran a good many cargoes past the goldskins in his day he got caught a few times but hes still way ahead of the government hes on the records as a successful smuggler if a big organlegger wanted to expand his market he might very well send a feeler out to a belter with a successful smuggling record you never mentioned that mr jennison was a smuggler what for all belters are smugglers if they think they can get away with it to a belter smuggling isnt immoral but an organlegger wouldnt know that hed think owen was already a criminal do you think your friend ordaz hesitated delicately no owen wouldnt turn organlegger but he might he just might try to turn one in the rewards for information leading to the capture and conviction of et cetera are substantial if someone contacted owen owen might very well have tried to trace the contact by himself now the gang were after covers half the west coast of this continent thats big its the loren gang the one graham may be working for suppose owen had a chance to meet loren himself you think he might take it do you i think he did i think he let his hair grow out so hed look like an earthman to convince loren he wanted to look inconspicuous i think he collected as much information as he could then tried to get out with a whole skin but he didnt make it did you find his application for a nudist license no i saw your point there said ordaz he leaned back ignoring the food in front of him mr jennisons tan was uniform except for the characteristic darkening of the face i presume he was a practicing nudist in the belt yah we dont need licenses there hed have been one here too unless he was hiding something remember that scar he never missed a chance to show it off could he really have thought to pass for a ordaz hesitated a flatlander with that belter tan no he was overdoing it a little with the haircut maybe he thought loren would underestimate him but he wasnt advertising his presence or he wouldnt have left his most personal possessions home so he was dealing with organleggers and they found him out before he could reach you yes mr hamilton this is well thought out but it wont work why not im not trying to prove its murder not yet im just trying to show you that murder is at least as likely as suicide but its not mr hamilton i looked at the question consider the details of the hypothetical murder owen jennison is drugged no doubt and taken to the office of kenneth graham there an ecstasy plug is attached a standard droud is fitted and is then amateurishly altered with soldering tools already we see on the part of the killer a minute attention to details we see it again in kenneth grahams forged papers of permission to operate they were impeccable owen jennison is then taken back to his apartment it would be his own would it not there would be little point in moving him to another the cord from his droud is shortened again in amateurish fashion mr jennison is tied up i wondered if youd see that but why should he not be tied up he is tied up and allowed to waken perhaps the arrangement is explained to him perhaps not that would be up to the killer the killer then plugs mr jennison into a wall a current trickles through his brain and owen jennison knows pure pleasure for the first time in his life he is left tied up for let us say three hours in the first few minutes he would be a hopeless addict i think you must have known more current addicts than i have even i would not want to be pinned down your normal current addict is an addict after a few minutes but then your normal current addict asked to be made an addict knowing what it would do to his life current addiction is symptomatic of despair your friend might have been able to fight free of a few minutes exposure so they kept him tied up for three hours then they cut the ropes i felt sickened ordazs ugly ugly picture matched mine in every detail no more than three hours by our hypothesis they would not dare stay longer than a few hours they would cut the ropes and leave owen jennison to starve to death in the space of a month the evidence of his drugging would vanish as would any abrasions left by ropes lumps on his head mercy needle punctures and the like a carefully detailed well thought out plan dont you agree i told myself that ordaz was not being ghoulish he was just doing his job still it was difficult to answer objectively it fits our picture of loren hes been very careful with us hed love carefully detailed well thought out plans ordaz leaned forward but dont you see a carefully detailed plan is all wrong there is a crucial flaw in it suppose mr jennison pulls out the droud could he do that would he could he certainly a simple tug of the fingers the current wouldnt interfere with motor coordination would he ordaz pulled meditatively at his beer i know a good deal about current addiction but i dont know what it feels like mr hamilton your normal addict pulls his droud out as often as he inserts it but your friend was getting ten times normal current he might have pulled the droud out a dozen times and instantly plugged it back each time yet belters are supposed to be strongwilled men very in dividualistic who knows whether even after a week of addiction your friend might not have pulled the droud loose coiled the cord slipped it in his pocket and walked away scotfree there is an individual risk that someone might walk in on him an automachinery service man for instance or someone might notice that he had not bought any food in a month a suicide would take that risk suicides routinely leave themselves a chance to change their minds but a murderer no even if the chance were one in a thousand the man who created such a detailed plan would never have taken such a chance the sun burned hotly down on our shoulders ordaz suddenly remembered his lunch and began to eat i watched the world ride by beyond the hedge pedestrians stood in little conversational bunches others peered into shop windows on the pedestrian strip or glanced over the hedge to watch us eat there were the few who pushed through the crowd with set expressions impatient with the tenmileperhour speed of the slidewalk maybe they were watching him maybe the room was bugged we searched the room thoroughly said ordaz if there had been observational equipment we would have found it it could have been removed ordaz shrugged i remembered the spyeyes in monica apartments someone would have had to physically enter the room to carry a bug out he could ruin it with the right signal maybe but it would sure leave traces and owen had had an inside room no spyeyes theres one thing youve left out i said presently and what would that be my name in owens wallet listed as next of kin he was directing my attention to the thing i was working on the loren gang that is possible you cant have it both ways ordaz lowered his fork i can have it both ways mr hamilton but you wont like it im sure i wont let us incorporate your assumption mr jennison was contacted by an agent of loren the organlegger who intended to sell transplant material to belters he accepted the promise of riches was too much for him a month later something made him realie what a terrible thing he had done he decided to die he went to an ecstasy peddler and he had a wire put in his head later before he plugged in the droud he made one attempt to atone for his crime he listed you as his next of kin so that you might guess why he had died and perhaps so that you could use that knowledge against loren ordaz looked at me across the table i see that you will never agree i cannot help that i can only read the evidence me too but i knew owen hed never have worked for an organlegger hed never have killed himself and if he had hed never have done it that way ordaz didnt answer what about fingerprints in the apartment none none but owens even his were found only on the chair and end tables i curse the man who invented the cleaning robot every smooth surface in that apartment was cleaned exactly fortyfour times during mr jennisons tenancy ordaz went back to his chill then try this assume for the moment that im right assume owen was after loren and loren got him owen knew he was doing something dangerous he wouldnt have wanted me to get onto loren before he was ready he wanted the reward for himself but he might have left me something just in case something in a locker somewhere an airport or spaceport locker evidence not under his own name or mine either because im a known arm but some name you both know right like homer chandrasekhar orwe got it cubes forsythe owen would have thought that was apt cubes is dead we will look you must understand that it will not prove your case sure anything you find owen could have arranged in a fit of conscience screw that let me know what you get i said and stood up and left i rode the slidewalk not caring where it was taking me it would give me a chance to cool off could ordaz be right could he but the more i dug into owens death the worse it made owen look therefore ordaz was wrong owen work for an organlegger hed rather have been a donor owen getting his kicks from a wall socket he never even watched tridee owen kill himself no if so not that way but even if i could have swallowed all that owen jennison letting me know hed worked with organleggers me gil the arm hamilton let me know that the slidewalk rolled along past restaurants and shopping centers and churches and banks ten stories below the hum of cars and scooters drifted faintly up from the vehicular level the sky was a narrow vivid slash of blue between shadows of skyscrapers let me know that never but ordazs strangely inconsistent murderer was no better i thought of something even ordaz had missed why would loren dispose of owen so elaborately owen need only disappear into the organ banks never to bother loren again the shops were thinning out now and so were the crowds the slidewalk narrowed entered a residential area and not a very good one id let it carry me a long way i looked around trying to decide where i was and i was four blocks from grahams place my subconscious had done me dirty i wanted to look at kenneth graham face to face the temptation to go on was nearly irresistible but i fought it off and changed direction at the next disc a slidewalk intersection is a rotating disc its rim tangent to four slidewaiks and moving with the same speed from the center you ride up an escalator and over the slidewalks to reach stationary walks along the buildings i could have caught a cab at the center of the disc but i still wanted to think so i just rode halfway around the rim i could have walked into grahams shop and gotten away with it maybe id have looked hopeless and bored and hesitant told graham i wanted an ecstasy plug worried loudly about what my wife and friends would say then changed my mind at the last moment hed have let me walk out knowing id be missed maybe but loren had to know more about the arms than we knew about him some time or other had graham been shown a holo of yours truly let a known arm walk into his shop and graham would panic it wasnt worth the risk then dammit what could i do ordazs inconsistent killer if we assumed owen was murdered we couldnt get away from the assumptions the case the nitpicking detailand then owen left alone to pull out the plug and walk away or to be discovered by a persistent salesman or a burglar or no ordazs hypothetical killer and mine would have watched owen like a hawk for a month that did it i stepped off at the next disc and got a taxi the taxi dropped me on the roof of monica apartments i took an elevator to the lobby if the manager was surprised to see me he didnt show it as he gestured me into his office the office seemed much roomier than the lobby had possibly because there were things to break the anonymous modern decor paintings on the wall a small black wormtrack in the rug that must have been caused by a visitors cigarette a holo of mifier and his wife on the wide nearly empty desk he waited until i was settled then leaned forward expectantly im here on arms business i said and passed him my ident he passed it back without checking it i presume its the same business he said yah im convinced owen jennison must have had visitors while he was here the manager smiled thats ridicimpossible nope its not your holo cameras take pictures of visitors but they dont snap the tenants do they of course not then owen could have been visited by any tenant in the building the manager looked shocked no certainly not really i dont see why you pursue this mr hamilton if mr jennison had been found in such a condition it would have been reported i dont think so could he have been visited by any tenant in the building no no the cameras would have taken a picture of anyone from another floor how about someone from the same floor reluctantly the manager bobbed his head yees as far as the holo cameras are concerned thats possible but then id like to ask for pictures of any tenant who lived on the eighteenth floor during the last six weeks send them to the arms building central la can do of course youll have them within an hour good now something else occurred to me suppose a man got out on the nineteenth floor and walked down to the eighteenth hed be holoed on the nineteenth but not on the eighteenth right the manager smiled indulgently mr hamilton there are no stairs in this building just the elevators isnt that dangerous not at all there is a separate selfcontained emergency power source for each of the elevators its common practice after all who would want to walk up eighty stories if the elevator failed okay fine one last point could someone tamper with the computer could someone make it decide not to take a certain picture for instance i am not an expert on how to tamper with computers mr hamilton why dont you go straight to the company cauffield brains inc okay whats your model just a moment he got up and leafed through a drawer in a filing cabinet eq okay that was all i could do here and i knew it and still i didnt have the will to get up there ought to be something finally miller cleared his throat wifi that be all sir yes i said no can i get into ill see if weve rented it yet the police are through with it certainly he went back to the ffling cabinet no its stifi available ill take you up how long will you be i dont know no more than half an hour no need to come up very well he handed me the key and waited for me to leave the merest flicker of blue light caught my eye as i left the elevator i would have thought it was my optic nerve not in the real world if i hadnt known about the holo cameras maybe it was you dont need laser light to make a holograph but it does get you clearer pictures owens room was a box everything was retracted there was nothing but the bare walls i had never seen anything so desolate unless it was some asteroidal rock too poor to mine too badly placed to be worth a base the control panel was just beside the door i turned on the lights then touched the master button lines appeared outlined in red and green and blue a great square on one wall for the bed most of another wall for the kitchen various outlines across the floor very handy you would not want a guest to be standing on the table when you expanded it id come here to get the feel of the place to encourage a hunch to see if id missed anything translation i was playing playing i reached through the control panel to find the circuits the printed circuitry was too small and too detailed to tell me anything but i ran imaginary fingertips along a few wires and found that they looped straight to their action points no detours no sensors to the outside you would have to be in the room to know what was expanded what retracted so a supposedly occupied room had had its bed retracted for six weeks but youd have to be in the room to know it i pushed buttons to expand the kitchen nook and the reading chair the wall slid out eight feet the floor humped itself and took form i sat down in the chair and the kitchen nook blocked my view of the door nobody could have seen owen from the hall if only someone had noticed that owen wasnt ordering food that might have saved him i thought of something else and it made me look around for the air conditioner there was a grill at floor level i felt behind it with my imaginary hand some of these apartment airconditioning units go on when the co level hits half a percent this one was geared to temperature and manual control with the other kind our careful killer could have tapped the air conditioner to find out if owen was still alive and present as it was had behaved like an empty room for six weeks i flopped back in the reading chair if my hypothetical kifier had watched owen hed done it with a bug unless he actually lived on this floor for the four or five weeks it took owen to die there was no other way okay think about a bug make it small enough and nobody would find it except the cleaning robot who would send it straight to the incinerator youd have to make it big so the robot would not get it no worry about owen finding it and then when you knew owen was dead youd use the selfdestruct but if you burned it to slag youd leave a bum hole somewhere ordaz would have found it so an asbestos pad youd want the selfdestruct to leave something that the cleaning robot would sweep up and if youll believe that you will believe anything it was too chancy nobody knows what a cleaning robot will decide is garbage theyre made stupid because its cheaper so theyre programmed to leave large objects alone there had to be someone on this floor either to watch owen himself or to pick up the bug that did the watching i was betting everything i had on a human watcher id come here mainly to give my intuition a chance it wasnt working owen had spent six weeks in this chair and for at least the last week hed been dead yet i couldnt feel it with him it was just a chair with two end tables he had left nothing in the room not even a restless ghost the call caught me halfway back to headquarters you were right ordaz told me over the wristphone we have found a locker at death valley port registered to cubes forsythe i am on my way there now will you join me ill meet you there good i am as eager as you to see what owen jennison left us i doubted that the port was something more than two hundred and thirty miles away an hour at taxi speeds it would be a big fare i typed out a new address on the destination board then called in at headquarters an arm agent is fairly free he doesnt have to justify every little move there was no question of getting permission to go at worst they might disallow the fare on my expense account oh and therell be a set of holos coming in from monica apartments i told the man have the computer check them against known organleggers and associates of loren the taxi rose smoothly into the sky and headed east i watched tridee and drank coffee until i ran out of coins for the dispenser if you go between november and may when the climate is ideal death valley can be a tourists paradise there is the devils golf course with its fantastic ridges and pinnacles of salt zabriskie point and its weird badlands topography the old borax mining sites and all kinds of strange rare plants adapted to the heat and the deathdry climate yes death valley has many points of interest and someday i was going to go see them so far all id seen was the spaceport but the port was impressive in its own way the landing field used to be part of a sizable inland sea it is now a sea of salt alternating red and blue concentric circles mark the field for ships dropping from space and a centurys developments in chemical fission and fusion reaction motors have left blast pits striped like rainbows by esoteric often radioactive salts but mostly the field retains its ancient white glare and out across the salt are ships of many sizes and many shapes vehicles and machinery dance attendance and if youre willing to wait you may see a ship land its worth the wait the port building at the edge of the major salt flat is a pastel green tower set in a wide patch of fluorescent orange concrete no ship has ever landed on ityet the taxi dropped me at the entrance and moved away to join others of its kind and i stood inhaling the dry balmy air four months of the year death valleys climate is ideal one august the furnace creek ranch recorded f shade temperature a man behind the desk told me that ordaz had arrived before me i found him and another officer in a labyrinth of pay lockers each big enough to hold two or three suitcases the locker ordaz had opened held only a lightweight plastic briefcase he may have taken other lockers he said probably not belters travel light have you tried to open it not yet it is a combination lock i thought perhaps maybe i squatted to look at it funny i felt no surprise at all it was as if id known all along that owens suitcase would be here and why not he was bound to try to protect himself somehow through me because i was already involved in the un side of organlegging by leaving something in a spaceport locker because loren couldnt find the right locker or get into it if he did and because i would naturally connect owen with spaceports under cubes name because id be looking for that and loren wouldnt hindsight is wonderful the lock had five digits he must have meant me to open it lets see and i moved the tumblers to april the day cubes died stapled suddenly to a plastic partition the lock clicked open ordaz went instantly for the manila folder more slowly i picked up two glass phials one was tightly sealed against earths air and half full of an incredibly fine dust so fine was it that it slid like oil inside the glass the other phial held a blackened grain of nickeliron barely big enough to see other things were in that case but the prize was that folder the story was in there at least up to a point owen must have planned to add to it a message had been waiting for him in the ceres mail dump when he returned from his last trip out owen must have laughed over parts of that message loren had taken the trouble to assemble a complete dossier of owens smuggling activities over the past eight years did he think he could ensure owens silence by threatening to turn the dossier over to the goldskins maybe the dossier had given owen the wrong idea in any case hed decided to contact loren and see what developed ordinarily hed have sent me the entire message and let me try to track it down i was the expert after all but owens last trip out had been a disaster his fusion drive had blown somewhere beyond jupiters orbit no explanation the safeties had blown his lifesystem capsule free of the explosion barely a rescue ship had returned him to ceres the fee had nearly broken him he needed money loren may have known that and counted on it the reward for information leading to lorens capture would have bought him a new ship hed landed at outback field following lorens instructions from there lorens men had moved him about a good deal to london to bombay to amberg germany owens personal written story ended in amberg how had he reached california he had not had a chance to say but in between he had learned a good deal there were snatches of detail on lorens organization there was lorens full plan for shipping illicit transplant materials to the belt and for finding and contacting customers owen had made suggestions there most of them sounded reasonable and would be workable in practice typically owen i could find no sign that hed overplayed his hand but of course he hadnt known it when he did and there were bolos twentythree of them each a member of lorens gang some of the pictures had markings on the back others were blank owen had been unable to find out where each of them stood in the organization i leafed through them twice wondering if one of them could be loren himself owen had never known it would seem you were right said ordaz he could not have collected such detail by accident he must have planned from the beginning to betray the loren gang just as i told you and he was murdered for it it seems he must have been what motive could he have had for suicide ordazs round calm face was doing its best to show anger i find i cannot believe in our inconsistent murderer either you have ruined my digestion mr hamilton i told him my idea about other tenants on owens floor he smiled and nodded possibly possibly this is your department now organlegging is the business of the arms right i closed the briefcase and hefted it lets see what the computer can do with these ill send you photocopies of everything in here youll let me know about the other tenants of course i walked into arm headquarters swinging that precious briefcase feeling on top of the world owen had been murdered he had died with honor if notoh definitely notwith dignity even ordaz knew it now then jackson bera snarling and panting went by at a dead run whats up i called after him maybe i wanted a chance to brag i had twentythree faces twentythree organleggers in my briefcase bera slid to a stop beside me where in hell have you been working honest whats the hurry remember that pleasure peddler we were watching graham kenneth graham thats the one hes dead we blew it and bera took off hed reached the lab by the time i caught up with him kenneth grahams corpse was faceup on the operating table his long lanternjawed face was pale and slack without expression empty machinery was in place above and below his head how you doing bera demanded not good the doctor answered not your fault you got him into the deepfreeze fast enough its just that the current he shrugged i shook beras shoulder what happened bera was panting a little from his run something must have leaked graham tried to make a run for it we got him at the airport you could have waited put someone on the plane with him flooded the plane with ty remember the stink the last time we used ty on civilians damn newscasters bera was shivering i dont blame him arms and organleggers play a funny kind of game the organleggers have to turn their donors in alive so theyre always armed with hypo guns firing slivers of crystalline anesthetic that melt instantly in the blood we use the same weapon for somewhat the same reason a criminal has to be saved for trial and then for the government hospitals so no arm ever expects to kill a man there was a day i learned the truth a smalltime organlegger named raphael haine was trying to reach a call button in his own home if hed reached it all kinds of hell would have broken loose haines men would have hypoed me and i would have regained consciousness a piece at a time in haines organ storage tanks so i strangled him the report was in the computer but only three human beings knew about it one was my immediate superior lucas garner the other was julie so far he was the only man id ever killed and graham was beras first killing we got him at the airport said bera he was wearing a hat i wish id noticed that we might have moved faster we started to close in on him with hypo guns he turned and saw us he reached under his hat and then he fell killed himself uh huh how just look at his head i edged closer to the table trying to stay out of the doctors way the doctor was going through the routine of trying to pull information from a dead brain by induction it wasnt going well there was a flat oblong box on top of grahams head black plastic about half the size of a pack of cards i touched it and knew at once that it was attached to grahams skull a droud not a standard type too big uh huh liquid helium ran up my nerves theres a battery in it right right i often wonder what the vintners buy et cetera a cordless droud man thats what want for christmas bera twitched all over dont say that did you know he was a current addict no we were afraid to bug his home he might have found it and been tipped take another look at that thing the shape was wrong i thought the black plastic case had been half melted heat i mused oh uh huh he blew the whole battery at once sent the whole killing charge right through his brain right through the pleasure center of his brain and jesus gil the thing i keep wondering is what did it feel like gil what could it possibly have felt like i thumped him across the shoulders in lieu of giving him an intelligent answer hed be a long time wondering and so would i here was the man who had put the wire in owens head had his death been momentary hell or all the delights of paradise in one singing jolt hell i hoped but i didnt believe it at least kenneth graham wasnt somewhere else in the world getting a new face and new retinae and new fingertips from lorens illicit organ banks nothing said the doctor his brains too badly burned theres just nothing there that isnt too scrambled to make sense keep trying said bera i left quietly maybe later id buy bera a drink he seemed to need it bera was one of those with empathy i knew that he could almost feel that awful surge of ecstasy and defeat as kenneth graham left the world behind the bolos from monica apartments had arrived hours ago miller had picked not only the tenants who had occupied the eighteenth floor during the past six weeks but tenants from the nineteenth and seventeenth floors too it seemed an embarrassment of riches i toyed with the idea of someone from the nineteenth floor dropping over his balcony to the eighteenth every day for five weeks but hadnt had an outside wall let alone a window not to mention anything resembling a balcony had miller played with the same idea nonsense he didnt even know the problem hed just overkilled with the holos to show how cooperative he was none of the tenants during the period in question matched known or suspected loren men i said a few appropriate words and went for coffee then i remembered the twentythree possible loren men in owens briefcase id left them with a programmer since i wasnt quite sure how to get them into the computer myself he ought to be finished by now i called down he was i persuaded the computer to compare them with the holos of the tenants from monica apartments nothing nobody matched anybody i spent the next two hours writing up the owen jennison case a programmer would have to translate it for the machine i wasnt that good yet we were back with ordazs inconsistent killer that and a tangle of dead ends owens death had bought us a handful of new pictures pictures which might even be obsolete by now organleggers changed their faces at the drop of a hat i finished the case outline sent it down to a programmer and called julie i wouldnt need her protection now julie had left for home i started to call taffy stopped with her number half dialed there are times not to make a phone call i needed to sulk i needed a cave to be alone in my expression wctuld probably have broken a phone screen why inflict it on an innocent girl i left for home it was dark when i reached the street i rode the pedestrian bridge across the slidewaiks waited for a taxi at the intersection disc presently one dropped the white free sign blinking on its belly i stepped in and deposited my credit card owen had collected his bolos from all over the eurasian continent most of them if not all had been lorens foreign agents why had i expected to find them in los angeles the taxi rose into the white night sky city lights turned the cloud cover into a flat white dome we penetrated the clouds and stayed there the taxi autopilot didnt care if i had a view or not so what did i have now someone among dozens of tenants was a loren man that or ordazs inconsistent killer the careful one had left owen to die for five weeks alone and unsupervised was the inconsistent kifier so unbelievable he was after all my own hypothetical loren and loren had committed murder the ultimate crime hed murdered routinely over and over with fabulous profits the arms hadnt been able to touch him wasnt it about time he started getting careless like graham how long had graham been selecting donors among his customers choosing a few nonentities a year and then twice within a few months he took clients who were missed careless most criminals are not too bright loren had brains enough but the men on his payroll would be about average loren would deal with the stupid ones the ones who turned to crime because they didnt have enough sense to make it in real life if a man like loren got careless this is how it would happen unconsciously he would judge arm intelligence by his own men seduced by an ingenious plan for murder he might ignore the single loophole and go through with it with graham to advise him he knew more about current addiction than we did perhaps enough to trust the effects of current addiction on owen then owens killers had delivered him to his apartment and never seen him again it was a small gamble loren had taken and it had paid off this time next time hed grow more careless one day wed get him but not today the taxi settled out of the traffic pattern touched down on the roof of my apartment building in hollywood hills i got out and moved toward the elevators an elevator opened someone stepped out something warned me something about the way he moved i turned quickdrawing from the shoulder the taxi might have made good coverif it hadnt been already rising other figures had stepped from the shadows i think i got a couple before something stung my cheek mercybullets slivers of crystaffine anesthetic melting in my bloodstream my head spun and the roof spun and the centrifugal force dropped me limply to the room shadows loomed above me then receded to infinity fingers on my scalp shocked me awake i woke standing upright bound like a mummy in soft swaddling bandages i couldnt so much as twitch a muscle below my neck by the time i knew that much it was too late the man behind me had finished removing the electrodes from my head and stepped into view out of reach of my imaginary arm there was something of the bird about him he was tall and slender smallboned and his triangular face reached a point at the chin his wild silken blond hair had withdrawn from his temples leaving a sharp widows peak he wore impeccably tailored wool street shorts in orange and brown stripes smiling brightly with his arms folded and his head cocked to one side he stood waiting for me to speak and i recognized him owen had taken a holo of him where am i i groaned trying to sound groggy what time is it time its already morning said my captor as for where you are ill let you wonder something about his manner i took a guess and said loren loren bowed not overdoing it and you are gilbert hamilton of the united nations police gil the arm had he said arm or arm i let it pass i seem to have slipped you underestimated the reach of my own ar n you also underestimated my interest i had it isnt much harder to capture an arm than any other citizen if you catch him off guard and if youre willing to risk the men in this case his risk had cost him nothing cops use hypo guns for the same reason organleggers do the men id shot if id hit anyone in those few seconds of battle would have come around long ago loren must have set me up in these bandages then left me under russian sleep until he was ready to talk to me the electrodes were the russian sleep one goes on each eyelid one on the nape of the neck a small current goes through the brain putting you right to sleep you get a full nights sleep in an hour if its not turned off you can sleep forever so this was loren at long last he stood watching me with his head cocked to one side birdlike with his arms folded one hand held a hypo gun rather negligently i thought what time was it i didnt dare ask again because loren might guess something but if i could stall him until julie could send help she could send help where finagle in hysterics where was i if i didnt know that julie wouldnt know either and loren intended me for the organ banks one crystalline sliver would knock me out without harming any of the delicate infinitely various parts that made me gil hamilton then lorens doctors would take me apart in government operating rooms they flashburn the criminals brain for later urn burial god knows what loren would do with my own brain but the rest of me was young and healthy even considering lorens overhead i was worth more than a million un marks on the hoof why me i asked it was me you wanted not just any arm why the interest in me it was you who were investigating the case of owen jennison much too thoroughly not thoroughly enough dammit loren looked puzzled you really dont understand i really dont i find that highly interesting loren mused highly all right why am i still alive i was curious mr hamilton i hoped youd tell me about your imaginary arm so hed said arm nat arm i bluffed anyway my what no need for games mr hamilton if i think im losing ill use this he wiggled the hypo gun youll never wake up damn he knew the only things i could move were my ears and my imaginary arm and loren knew all about it id never be able to lure him into reach provided he knew all about it i had to draw him out okay i said but id like to know how you found out about it a plant in the arivis loren chuckled i wish it were so no we captured one of your men some months ago quite by accident when i realized what he was i induced him to talk shop with me he was able to tell me something about your remarkable arm i hope youll tell me more who was it really mr hamil who was it do you really expect me to remember the name of every donor who had gone into lorens organ banks stranger acquaintance friend does the manager of a slaughterhouse remember every slaughtered steer socalled psychic powers interest me said loren i remembered you and then when i was on the verge of concluding an agreement with your belter friend jennison i remembered something unusual about a crewman he had shipped with they called you gil the arm didnt they prophetic in port your drinks came free if you could use your imaginary arm to drink them then damn you you thought owen was a plant did you because of me me breast beating will earn you nothing mr hamilton loren put steel in his voice entertain me mr hamilton id been feeling around for anything that might release me from my upright prison no such luck i was wrapped like a mummy in bandages too strong to break all i could feel with my imagi nary hand were cloth bandages up to my neck and a bracing rod along my back to hold me upright beneath the swathing i was naked ill show you my eldritch powers i told loren if youll loan me a cigarette maybe that would draw him close enough he knew something about my arm he knew its reach he put one single cigarette on the edge of a small tableonwheels and slid it up to me i picked it up and stuck it in my mouth and waited hopefully for him to come light it my mistake he murmured and he pulled the table back and repeated the whole thing with a lighted cigarette no luck at least id gotten my smoke i pitched the dead one as far as it would go about two feet i had to move slowly with my imaginary hand otherwise what im holding simply slips through my fingers loren watched in fascination a floating disembodied cigarette obeying my will his eyes held traces of awe and horror that was bad maybe the cigarette had been a mistake some people see psi powers as akin to witchcraft and psychic people as servants of satan if loren feared me then i was dead interesting said loren how far will it reach he knew that as far as my real arm of course but why others can reach much further why not you he was clear across the room a good ten yards away sprawled in an armchair one hand held a drink the other held the hypo gun he was superbly relaxed i wondered if id ever see him move from that comfortable chair much less come within reach the room was small and bare with the look of a basement lorens chair and a small portable bar were the only furnishings unless there were others behind me a basement could be anywhere anywhere in los angeles or out of it if it was really morning i could be anywhere on earth by now sure i said others can reach farther than me but they dont have my strength its an imaginary arm sure enough and my imagination wont make it ten feet long maybe someone could convince me it was if he tried hard enough but maybe hed ruin what belief i have then id have two arms just like everyone else im better off i let it trail away because loren was going to take all my danm arms anyway my cigarette was finished i pitched it away want a drink sure if youve got a jigger glass otherwise i cant lift it he found me a shot glass and sent it to me on the edge of the rolling table i was barely strong enough to pick it up lorens eyes never left me as i sipped and put it down the old cigarette lure last night id used it to pick up a girl now it was keeping me alive did i really want to leave the world with something gripped tightly in my imaginary fist entertaining loren holding his interest until where was i where and suddenly i knew we are at monica apartments i said nowhere else i knew youd guess that eventually loren smiled but its too late i got to you in time dont be so damn complacent it was stupidity not your luck i should have smelled it owen would never have come here of his own choice you ordered him here and so i did by then i already knew he was a traitor so you sent him here to die who was it that checked on him every day to see hed stay put was it miller the manager he has been working for you hes the one who took the holographs of you and your men out of the computer he was the one said loren but it wasnt every day i had a man watching jennison every second through a portable camera we took it out after he was dead and then waited a week nice touch the wonder was that it had taken me so long the atmosphere of the places what kind of people would live in monica apartments the faceless ones the ones with no identity the ones who would surely be missed by nobody they would stay put in their apartments while loren checked on them to see that they really did have nobody to miss them those who qualified would disappear and their papers and possessions with them and their holo would vanish from the computer loren said i tried to sell organs to the belters through your friend jennison i know he betrayed me hamilton i want to know how badly badly enough hed guess that weve got detailed plans for getting up an organ bank dispensary in the belt it would not have worked anyway loren belters dont think that pay no pictures no i didnt want him changing his face i was sure hed left something said loren otherwise we would have made him a donor much simpler more profitable too i needed the money hamilton do you know what it costs the organization to let a donor go a million or so whyd you do it hed left something there was no way to get at it all we could do was try to keep the arms from looking for it ah i had it then when anyone disappears without a trace the first thing an idiot thinks of is organleggers naturally so he couldnt just disappear could he the police would go to the arms the ifie would go to you and youd start looking for a spaceport locker oh under the name of cubes forsythe i knew that name loren said between teeth i should have tried that you know after we had him hooked on current we tried pulling the plug on him to get him to talk it didnt work he couldnt concentrate on anything but getting the droud back in his head we looked high and low im going to kill you i said and meant every word loren cocked his head frowning on the contrary mr hamil ton another cigarette yah he sent it to me lighted on the rolling table i picked it up holding it a trifle ostentatiously maybe i could focus his attention on iton his only way to find my imaginary hand because if he kept his eyes on the cigarette and i put it in my mouth at a crucial momentid leave my hand free without his noticing what crucial moment he was still in the armchair i had to fight the urge to coax him closer any move in that direction would make him suspicious what time was it and what was julie doing i thought of a night two weeks past remembered dinner on the balcony of the highest restaurant in los angeles just a fraction less than a mile up a carpet of neon that spread below us to touch the horizon in all directions maybe shed pick it up shed be checking on me at you must have made a remarkable spaceman said loren think of being the only man in the solar system who can adjust a hull antenna without leaving the cabin antennas take a little more muscle than ive got so he knew i could reach through things if hed seen that fari should have stayed i told loren i wish i were on a mining ship right this minute all i wanted at the time was two good arms pity now you have three did it occur to you that using psi powers against men was a form of cheating what remember raphael haine lorens voice had become uneven he was angry and holding it down with difficulty sure smalltime organlegger in australia raphael haine was a friend of mine i know he had you tied up at one point tell me mr hamilton if your imaginary hand is as weak as you say how did you untie the ropes i didnt i couldnt have haine used handcuffs i picked his pocket for the key with my imaginary hand of course you used psi powers against him you had no right magic anyone whos not psychic himself feels the same way just a little a touch of dread a touch of envy loren thought he could handle arms hed killed at least one of us but to send warlocks against him was grossly unfair that was why hed let me wake up loren wanted to gloat how many men have captured a warlock dont be an idiot i said i didnt volunteer to play your silly game or haines either my rules make you a wholesale murderer loren got to his feet and i suddenly realized my time was up he was in a white rage his silky blond hair seemed to stand on end i looked into the tiny needle hole in the hypo gun there was nothing i could do the reach of my tk was the reach of my fingers i felt all the things i would never feel the quart of trastine in my blood to keep the water from freezing in my cells the cold bath of halffrozen alcohol the scalpels and the tiny accurate surgical lasers most of all the scalpels and my knowledge would die when they thiew away my brain i knew what loren looked like i knew about monica apartments and who knew how many others of the same kind i knew where to go to find all the loveliness in death valley and someday i was going to go what time was it what time loren had raised the hypo gun and was sighting down the stiff length of his arm obviously he thought he was at target practice it really is a pity he said and there was only the slightest tremor in his voice you should have stayed a spaceman what was he waiting for i cant cringe unless you loosen these bandages i snapped and i jabbed what was left of my cigarette at him for emphasis it jerked out of my grip and i reached and caught it and stuck it in my left eye at another time id have examined the idea a little more closely but id still have done it loren already thought of me as his property as live skin and healthy kidneys and lengths of artery as parts in lorens organ banks i was property worth a million un marks and i was destroying my eye organleggers are always hurting for eyes anyone who wears glasses could use a new pair and the organleggers themselves are constantly wanting to change retina prints what i hadnt anticipated was the pain id read somewhere that there are no sensory nerves in the eyeball then it was my lids that hurt terribly but i only had to hold on loren swore and came for me at a dead run he knew how terribly weak my imaginary arm was what could i do with it he didnt know hed never known though it stared him in the face he ran at me and slapped at the cigarette a full swing that half knocked my head off my neck and sent the now dead butt ricocheting off a wall panting snarling speechless with rage he stoodwithin reach my eye closed like a small tormented fist i reached past lorens gun through his chest wall and found his heart and squeezed his eyes became very round his mouth gaped wide his larynx bobbed convulsively there was time to fire the gun instead he clawed at his chest with a halfparalyzed arm twice he raked his fingernails across his chest gaping upward for air that would not come he thought he was having a heart attack then his rolling eyes found my face my face i was a oneeyed carnivore snarling with the will to murder i would have his life if i had to tear the heart out of his chest how could he help but know he knew he fired at the floor and fell i was sweating and shaking with reaction and disgust the scars he was all scars id felt them going in his heart was a transplant and the rest of himhed looked about thirty from a distance but this close it was impossible to tell parts were younger parts older how much of loren was loren what parts had he taken from others and none of the parts quite matched he must have been chronically ill i thought and the board wouldnt give him the transplants he needed and one day hed seen the answers to all his problems loren wasnt moving he wasnt breathing i remembered the way his heart had jumped and wriggled in my imaginary hand and then suddenly given up he was lying on his left arm hiding his watch i was all alone in an empty room and i stifi did not know what time it was i never found out it was hours before miller finally dared to interrupt his boss he stuck his round blank face around the doorjamb saw loren sprawled at my feet and darted back with a squeak a minute later a hypo gun came around the jamb followed by a watery blue eye i felt the sting in my cheek i checked you early said julie she settled herself uncomfortably at the foot of the hospital bed rather you called me when i came to work you werent there and i wondered why and wham it was bad wasnt it pretty bad i said id never sensed anyone so scared well dont tell anyone about it i hit the switch to raise the bed to sitting position ive got an image to maintain my eye and socket around it were bandaged and numb there was no pain but the numbness was obtrusive a reminder of two dead men who had become part of me one arm one eye if julie was feeling that with me then small wonder if she was nervous she was she kept shifting and twisting on the bed i kept wondering what time it was what time was it about nine ten julie shivered i thought rd faint when that that vague little man pointed his hypo gun around the corner oh dont dont gil its over that close was it that close look i said you go back to work i appreciate the sick call but this isnt doing either of us any good if we keep it up well both wind up in a state of permanent terror she nodded jerkily and got up thanks for coming thanks for saving my life too julie smiled from the doorway thanks for the orchids i hadnt ordered them yet i flagged down a nurse and got her to tell me that i could leave tonight after dinner provided i went straight home to bed she brought me a phone and i used it to order the orchids afterward i dropped the bed back and lay there a while it was nice being alive i began to remember promises i had made promises i might never have kept perhaps it was time to keep a few i called down to surveillance and got jackson bera after letting him drag from me the story of my heroism i invited him up to the infirmary for a drink his bottle but id pay he didnt like that part but i bulked him into it i had dialed half of taffys number before as i had last night i changed my mind my wristphone was on the bedside table no pictures lo taffy this is gil can you get a weekend free sure starting friday good come for me at ten did you ever find out about your friend yah i was right organleggers killed him its over now we got the guy in charge i didnt mention the eye by friday the bandages would be off about that weekend how would you like to see death valley youre kidding right im kidding wrong listen but its hot its dry its as dead as the moon you did say death valley didnt you its not hot this month listen and she did listen she listened long enough to be convinced ive been thinking she said then if were going to see a lot of each other wed better make aa bargain no shop talk all right a good idea the point is i work in a hospital said taffy surgery to me organic transplant material is just the tools of my trade tools to use in healing it took me a long time to get that way i dont want to know where the stuff comes from and i dont want to know anything about organleggers okay weve got a covenant see you at ten hundred friday a doctor i thought afterward well the weekend was going to be a good one surprising people are always the ones most worth knowing bera came in with a pint of j b my treat he said no use arguing cause you cant reach your wallet anyway and the fight was on
