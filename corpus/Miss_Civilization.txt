hatch this is the last time i take you out alice arranging the food upon the table now why are you so peevish to everybody why dont you be sociable and take some supper glances at sideboard you seem to have taken everything else oh that reminds me would you object to loaning me about four six about six of our knives and forks just for the supper i suppose we can borrow from the neighbors for breakfast unless youve been calling on the neighbors too hatch oh anything to oblige a lady threateningly but no tricks now alice oh i cant promise that because i mightnt be able to keep my promise hatch brings silver knives and forks from the bag hatch ill risk all the tricks you know nobodys got much the better of me in the last twenty years alice have you been a burglar twenty years you must have begun very young i cant see your face very well but i shouldnt say you were over forty do take that mask off it looks so unsociable dont be afraid of me ive a perfectly shocking memory for faces now im sure that under that unbecoming and terrifying exterior you are hiding a kind and fatherly countenance am i right laughs why do you wear it hatch roughly to keep my face warm alice oh pardon me my mistake a locomotive whistle is heard at a distance alice listens eagerly as the whistle dies away and is not repeated her face shows her disappointment hatch what was that theres no trains this time of night alice speaking partly to herself it was a freight train going the other way hatch suspiciously the other way the other way from where alice from where it started do you know ive always wanted to meet a burglar but its so difficult they go out so seldom hatch yes and they arrive so late alice laughingly now thats much better its so nice of you to have a sense of humor while youre there just close those blinds please so that the neighbors cant see what scandalous hours we keep and then you can make a light this is much too gloomy for a supper party hatch closing shutters yes if those were shut it might be safer he closes shutters and turns on the two electric lights reddy and harry enter carrying plates harry we arent regular waiters miss but we think were pretty good for amateurs reddy we havent forgot nothing not even napkins have some napkins places a pile of folded napkins in front of alice then sits at head of table harry to lower right of table alice moves her chair away from the table but keeping reddy on her right hatch sits still further away from the table on her left alice thanks put the plates down there and may i help you to some reddy taking food in fingers oh well help ourselves alice of course youre accustomed to helping yourselves arent you to hatch wont you join them hatch no through the scene which follows reddy and harry continue to eat and drink heartily alice no well then while theyre having supper you and i will talk if youre going to gag me soon i want to talk while i can rises and hands box to him have a cigar hatch takes cigar thanks alice standing with hand on back of chair now i want to ask you some questions you are an intelligent man of course you must be or you couldnt have kept out of jail for twenty years to get on in your business a man must be intelligent and he must have nerve and courage now with those qualities why may i ask why are you so stupid as to be a burglar harry stupid reddy well i like that hatch stupid why i make a living at it alice how much of a living hatch ten thousand a year alice ten thousand well suppose you made fifty thousand what good is even a hundred thousand for one year if to get it you risk going to prison for twenty years thats not sensible merely as a business proposition to take the risk you do for ten thousand dollars is stupid isnt it i can understand a mans risking twenty years of his life for some things a man like peary or dewey or santosdumont they took big risks for big prizes but theres thousands of men in this country not half as clever as you are earning ten thousand a year without any risk of going to jail none of them is afraid to go out in public with his wife and children theyre not afraid to ask a policeman what time it is they dont have to wear black masks nor ruin their beautiful complexions with burnt cork reddy ah go on whod give me a job alice whom did you ever ask for one reddy to harry pass me some more of that pie like mother used to make hatch yes there are clerks and shopkeepers working behind a counter twentyfour hours a day but they dont make ten thousand a year and no one ever hears of them theres no fame in their job alice fame oh how interesting are you a celebrity hatch im quite as well known as i care to be now tomorrow all the papers will be talking about this therell be columns about us three no one will know we are the ones theyre talking about reddy i hope not hatch but the men in our profession will know and theyll say that was a neat job of soandsos last night thats fame why weve got a reputation from one end of this country to the other harry thats right theres some of us just as well known as mister santos dumont reddy and we fly just as high too alice to hatch i suppose you i suppose youre quite a famous burglar reddy him why hes as well known as billy the kid alice billy the kid really he sounds so attractive but im afraid i dont think that i ever heard of him reddy never heard of billy the kid what do you think of that hatch well then im as well known as brace phillips the manhattan bank robber reddy sure he is hatch dont tell me you never heard of him alice im afraid not hatch why hes a headliner hes as well known as george post coppy farrell billy porter alice no there you are now you claim there is fame in this profession and you have named five men who are at the top of it and ive never heard of one of them and i read the papers too reddy well theres other ladies who have heard of us real ladies when i was doing my last bit in jail i got a thousand letters from ladies asking for me photograph and offering to marry me alice really well that only proves that men as husbands are more desirable in jail than out to hatch no its a poor life hatch its a poor life you people lead with us to worry you theres seventy millions of you in the united states and only a few of us and yet we keep you guessing all the year round why were the last thing you think of at night when you lock the doors were the first thing you think of in the morning when you feel for the silver basket were just a few up against seventy millions i tell you theres fame and big money and a free life in my business alice yes its a free life until you go to jail its this way youre barbarians and theres no place for you in a civilized community except in jail everybody is working against you every city has its police forcealmost every house nowadays has a private watchman and if we want to raise a hue and cry after you there are the newspapers and the telegraph and the telephone nods at telephone and the cables all over the hatch grimly thank you one moment please throws open overcoat showing that it is lined with burglars jimmies chisels and augers alice my what an interesting coat

hatch sorry i had to bust up your still alarm but after we go we cant have you chatting with the police if you hadnt so kindly given me a tip about the telephone i might have gone off and clean forgot that harry takes curtain cords from window curtains reddy im afraid pretty polly talked too much that time we aint all stupid alice no so i see so i see it was careless of me but everybody you call upon may not be so careless hatch well ive won out for twenty years ive never been in jail alice dont worry youre young i told you you looked young your time is coming in these days theres no room for burglars you belong to the days of stagecoaches youre oldfashioned now youre trying to fight civilization thats what youre trying to do you may keep ahead for a time but in a long race ill back

that than for anything in this world her husband used to wear this points thats a lock of their childs hair the childs dead and the husbands dead and thats all she has left of either of them and you
