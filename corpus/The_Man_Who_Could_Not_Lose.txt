 the man who could not lose by richard harding davis the carters had married in haste and refused to repent at leisure so blindly were they in love that they considered their marriage their greatest asset the rest of the world as represented by mutual friends considered it the only thing that could be urged against either of them while single each had been popular as a bachelor young champ carter had filled his modest place acceptably hostesses sought him for dinners and weekend parties men of his own years for golf and tennis and young girls liked him because when he talked to one of them he never talked of himself or let his eyes wander toward any other girl he had been brought up by a rich father in an expensive way and the rich father had then died leaving champneys alone in the world with no money and with even a few of his fathers debts these debts of honor the son ever since leaving yale had been paying off it had kept him very poor for carter had elected to live by his pen and though he wrote very carefully and slowly the editors of the magazines had been equally careful and slow in accepting what he wrote with an income so uncertain that the only thing that could be said of it with certainty was that it was too small to support even himself carter should not have thought of matrimony nor must it be said to his credit did he think of it until the girl came along that he wanted to marry the trouble with dolly ingram was her mother her mother was a really terrible person she was quite impossible she was a social leader and of such importance that visiting princes and society reporters even among themselves did not laugh at her her visiting list was so small that she did not keep a social secretary but it was said wrote her invitations herself stylites on his pillar was less exclusive nor did he take his exalted but lonely position with less sense of humor when ingram died and left her many millions to dispose of absolutely as she pleased even to the allowance she should give their daughter he left her with but one ambition unfulfilled that was to marry her dolly to an english duke hungarian princes french marquises italian counts german barons mrs ingram could not see her soninlaw must be a duke she had her eyes on two one somewhat shopworn and the other a bankrupt and in training she had one just coming of age already she saw her self a sort of a dowager duchess by marriage discussing with real dowager duchesses the way to bring up teething earls and viscounts for three years in europe mrsingram had been drilling her daughter for the part she intended her to play but on returning to her native land dolly who possessed all the feelings thrills and heartthrobs of which her mother was ignorant ungratefully fell deeply in love with champneys carter and he with her it was always a question of controversy between them as to which had first fallen in love with the other as a matter of history honors were even he first saw her during a thunder storm in the paddock at the races wearing a raincoat with the collar turned up and a panama hat with the brim turned down she was talking in terms of affectionate familiarity with cuthberts twoyearold the scout the scout had just lost a race by a nose and dolly was holding the nose against her cheek and comforting him the two made a charming picture and as carter stumbled upon it and halted the racehorse lowered his eyes and seemed to say wouldnt you throw a race for this and the girl raised her eyes and seemed to say what a nicelooking brightlooking young man why dont i know who you are so carter ran to find cuthbert and told him the scout had gone lame when on their return miss ingram refused to loosen her hold on the scouts nose cuthbert apologetically mumbled carters name and in some awe miss ingrams name and then to his surprise both young people lost interest in the scout and wandered away together into the rain after an hour when they parted at the club stand for which carter could not afford a ticket he asked wistfully do you often come racing and miss ingram said do you mean am i coming tomorrow i do said carter then why didnt you say that inquired miss ingram otherwise i mightnt have come i have the holland house coach for tomorrow and if youll join us ill save a place for you and you can sit in our box ive lived so long abroad she explained that im afraid of not being simple and direct like other american girls do you think ill get on here at home if you get on with every one else as well as youve got on with me said carter morosely i will shoot myself miss ingram smiled thoughtfully at eleven then she said in front of the holland house carter walked away with a flurried heated suffocation around his heart and a joyous lightness in his feet of the first man he met he demanded who was the beautiful girl in the raincoat and when the man told him carter left him without speaking for she was quite the richest girl in america but the next day that fault seemed to distress her so little that carter also refused to allow it to rest on his conscience and they were very happy and each saw that they were happy because they were together the ridiculous mother was not present at the races but after carter began to call at their house and was invited to dinner mrs ingram received him with her habitual rudeness as an impediment in the success of her ambition she never considered him as a boy friend of her daughters she classed him with her lawyer and her architect and a little higher than the person who arranged the flowers nor in her turn did dolly consider her mother for within two months another matter of controversy between dolly and carter was as to who had first proposed to the other carter protested there never had been any formal proposal that from the first they had both taken it for granted that married they would be but dolly insisted that because he had been afraid of her money or her mother he had forced her to propose to him you could not have loved me very much she complained if youd let a little thing like money make you hesitate its not a little thing suggested carter they say its several millions and it happens to be yours if it were mine now money said dolly sententiously is given people to make them happy not to make them miserable wait until i sell my stories to the magazines said carter and then i will be independent and can support you the plan did not strike dolly as one likely to lead to a hasty marriage but he was sensitive about his stories and she did not wish to hurt his feelings lets get married first she suggested and then i can buy you a magazine well call it carters magazine and we will print nothing in it but your stories then we can laugh at the editors not half as loud as they will said carter with three thousand dollars in bank and three stories accepted and seventeen still to hear from and with dolly daily telling him that it was evident he did not love her carter decided they were ready hand in hand to leap into the sea of matrimony his interview on the subject with mrs ingram was most painful it lasted during the time it took her to walk out of her drawingroom to the foot of her staircase she spoke to herself and the only words of which carter was sure were preposterous and intolerable insolence later in the morning she sent a note to his flat forbidding him not only her daughter but the house in which her daughter lived and even the use of the united states mails and the new york telephone wires she described his conduct in words that had they come from a man would have afforded carter every excuse for violent exercise immediately in the wake of the note arrived dolly in tears and carrying a dressingcase i have left mother she announced and i have her car downstairs and a clergyman in it unless he has run away he doesnt want to marry us because hes afraid mother will stop supporting his flower mission you get your hat and take me where he can marry us no mother can talk about the man i love the way mother talked about you and think i wont marry him the same day carter with her mothers handwriting still red before his eyes and his selflove shaken with rage flourished the letter and no mother he shouted can call me a fortunehunter and a cradlerobber and think ill make good by marrying her daughter not until she begs me to dolly swept toward him like a summer storm her eyes were wet and flashing until who begs you to she demanded who are you marrying mother or me if i marry you cried carter frightened but also greatly excited your mother wont give you a penny and that taunted dolly perfectly aware that she was ridiculous is why you wont marry me for an instant long enough to make her blush with shame and happiness carter grinned at her now just for that he said i wont kiss you and i will marry you but as a matter of fact he did kiss her then he gazed happily around his small sittingroom make yourself at home here he directed while i pack my bag i mean to make myself very much at home here said dolly joyfully for the rest of my life from the recesses of the flat carter called the rents paid only till september after that we live in a hall bedroom and cook on a gasstove and thats no idle jest either fearing the publicity of the city hall license bureau they released the clergyman much to the relief of that gentleman and told the chauffeur to drive across the state line into connecticut its the last time we can borrow your mothers car said carter and wed better make it go as far as we can it was one of those days in may blue was the sky and sunshine was in the air and in the park little girls from the tenements in white were playing they were queens dolly wanted to kidnap two of them for bridesmaids in harlem they stopped at a jewelers shop and carter got out and bought a weddingring in the bronx were dogwood blossoms and leaves of tender green and beds of tulips and along the boston post road on their right the sound flashed in the sunlight and on their left gardens lawns and orchards ran with the road and the apple trees were masses of pink and white whenever a car approached from the rear carter pretended it was mrs ingram coming to prevent the elopement and dolly clung to him when the car had passed she forgot to stop clinging to him in greenwich village they procured a license and a magistrate married them and they were a little frightened and greatly happy and they both discovered simultaneously outrageously hungry so they drove through bedford village to south salem and lunched at the horse and hounds inn on blue and white china in the same room where major andre was once a prisoner and they felt very sorry for major andre and for everybody who had not been just married that morning and after lunch they sat outside in the garden and fed lumps of sugar to a charming collie and cream to a fat gray cat they decided to start housekeeping in carters flat and so turned back to new york this time following the old coach road through north castle to white plains across to tarrytown and along the bank of the hudson into riverside drive millions and millions of friendly folk chiefly nursemaids and traffic policemen waved to them and for some reason smiled the joke of it is declared carter they dont know the most wonderful event of the century has just passed into history we are married and nobody knows but when the car drove away from in front of carters door they saw on top of it two old shoes and a sign reading we have just been married while they had been at luncheon the chauffeur had risen to the occasion after all said carter soothingly he meant no harm and its the only thing about our wedding yet that seems legal three months later two very unhappy young people faced starvation in the sittingroom of carters flat gloom was written upon the countenance of each and the heat and the care that comes when one desires to live and lacks the wherewithal to fulfill that desire had made them pallid and had drawn black lines under dollys eyes mrs ingram had played her part exactly as her dearest friends had said she would she had sent to carters flat seven trunks filled with dollys clothes eighteen hats and another most unpleasant letter in this on the sole condition that dolly would at once leave her husband she offered to forgive and to support her to this dolly composed eleven scornful answers but finally decided that no answer at all was the most scornful she and carter then proceeded joyfully to waste his three thousand dollars with that contempt for money with which on a honeymoon it should always be regarded when there was no more dolly called upon her mothers lawyers and inquired if her father had left her anything in her own right the lawyers regretted he had not but having loved dolly since she was born offered to advance her any money she wanted they said they felt sure her mother would relent she may said dolly haughtily i wont and my husband can give me all i need i only wanted something of my own because im going to make him a surprise present of a new motorcar the one we are using now does not suit us this was quite true as the one they were then using ran through the subway as summer approached carter had suddenly awakened to the fact that he soon would be a pauper and cut short the honeymoon they returned to the flat and he set forth to look for a position later while still looking for it he spoke of it as a job he first thought he would like to be an assistant editor of a magazine but he found editors of magazines anxious to employ new and untried assistants especially in june were very few on the contrary they explained they were retrenching and cutting down expenses they meant they had discharged all office boys who received more than three dollars a week they further retrenched by taking a mean advantage of carters having called upon them in person by handing him three or four of his stories but by this he saved his postagestamps each day when he returned to the flat dolly who always expected each editor would hastily dust off his chair and offer it to her brilliant husband would smile excitedly and gasp well and carter would throw the rejected manuscripts on the table and say at least i have not returned emptyhanded then they would discover a magazine that neither they nor any one else knew existed and they would hurriedly readdress the manuscripts to that periodical and run to post them at the letterbox on the corner any one of them if accepted carter would point out might bring us in twentyfive dollars a story of mine once sold for forty so tonight we can afford to dine at a restaurant where wine is not included fortunately they never lost their sense of humor otherwise the narrow confines of the flat the evil smells that rose from the baked streets the greasy food of italian and hungarian restaurants and the everhaunting need of money might have crushed their youthful spirits but in time even they found that one still less two cannot exist exclusively on love and the power to see the bright side of things especially when there is no bright side they had come to the point where they must borrow money from their friends and that though there were many who would have opened their safes to them they had agreed was the one thing they would not do or they must starve the alternative was equally distasteful carter had struggled earnestly to find a job but his inexperience and the season of the year were against him no newspaper wanted a dramatic critic when the only shows in town had been running three months and on roof gardens nor did they want a cub reporter when veterans were being laid off by the dozens nor were his services desired as a private secretary a taxicab driver an agent to sell real estate or automobiles or stocks as no one gave him a chance to prove his unfitness for any of these callings the fact that he knew nothing of any of them did not greatly matter at these rebuffs dolly was distinctly pleased she argued they proved he was intended to pursue his natural career as an author that their friends might know they were poor did not affect her but she did not want them to think by his taking up any outside job that they were poor because as a literary genius he was a failure she believed in his stories she wanted every one else to believe in them meanwhile she assisted him in so far as she could by pawning the contents of five of the seven trunks by learning to cook on a kitchenette and to laundry her handkerchiefs and iron them on the lookingglass they faced each other across the breakfasttable it was only nine oclock but the sun beat into the flat with the breath of a furnace and the air was foul and humid i tell you carter was saying fiercely you look ill you are ill you must go to the seashore you must visit some of your proud friends at east hampton or newport then ill know youre happy and i wont worry and ill find a job i dont mind the heatand ill write you love letters he was talking very fast and not looking at dolly like those i used to write you before dolly raised her hand listen she said suppose i leave you what will happen ill wake up in a cool beautiful brass bed wont i with cretonne windowcurtains and salt air blowing them about and a maid to bring me coffee and instead of a bathroom like yours next to an elevator shaft and a fireescape ill have one as big as a church and the whole blue ocean to swim in and ill sit on the rocks in the sunshine and watch the waves and the yachts and grow well again cried carter but youll write to me he added wistfully every day wont you in her wrath dolly rose and from across the table confronted him and what will i be doing on those rocks she cried you know what ill be doing ill be sobbing and sobbing and calling out to the waves why did he send me away why doesnt he want me because he doesnt love me thats why he doesnt love me and you dont cried dolly you dont it took him all of three minutes to persuade her she was mistaken very well then sobbed dolly thats settled and therell be no more talk of sending me away there will not said champneys hastily we will now he announced go into committee of the whole and decide how we are to face financial failure our assets consist of two stories accepted but not paid for and fifteen stories not accepted in cash he spread upon the table a meagre collection of soiled bills and coins we have twentyseven dollars and fourteen cents that is every penny we possess in the world dolly regarded him fixedly and shook her head is it wicked she asked to love you so havent you been listening to me demanded carter again dolly shook her head i was watching the way you talk when your lips move fast they do such charming things do you know roared carter that we havent a penny in the world that we have nothing in this flat to eat i still have five hats said dolly we cant eat hats protested champneys we can sell hats returned dolly they cost eighty dollars apiece when you need money explained carter i find its just as hard to sell a hat as to eat it twentyseven dollars and fourteen cents repeated dolly she exclaimed remorsefully and you started with three thousand what did i do with it we both had the time of our lives with it said carter stoutly and thats all there is to that postmortems he pointed out are useful only as guides to the future and as our future will never hold a second three thousand dollars we neednt worry about how we spent the first one no what we must consider now is how we can grow rich quick and the quicker and richer the better pawning our clothes or whats left of them is bad economics theres no use considering how to live from meal to meal we must evolve something big picturesque that will bring a fortune you have imagination im supposed to have imagination we must think of a plan to get money much money i do not insist on our plan being dignified or even outwardly respectable so long as it keeps you alive it may be as desperate as i see cried dolly like sending mother black hand letters blackmail began that ladys soninlaw doubtfully or cried dolly we might kidnap mr carnegie when hes walking in the park alone and hold him for ransom or she rushed on we might forge a codicil to fathers will and make it say if mother shouldnt like the man i want to marry all of fathers fortune must go to my husband forgery exclaimed champneys is going further than i and another plan interrupted dolly that i have always had in mind is to issue a cheaper edition of your book the dead heat the reason the first edition of the dead heat didnt sell dont tell me why it didnt sell said champneys i wrote it that book declared dolly loyally was never properly advertised no one knew about it so no one bought it eleven people bought it corrected the author we will put it in a paper cover and sell it for fifty cents cried dolly its the best detective story i ever read and people have got to know it is the best so well advertise it like a breakfast food the idea interrupted champneys is to make money not throw it away besides we havent any to throw away dolly sighed bitterly if only she exclaimed we had that three thousand dollars back again id save so carefully it was all my fault the races took it but it was i took you to the races no one ever had to drag me to the races said carter it was the way we went that was extravagant automobiles by the hour standing idle and a box each day and and always backing dromedary suggested dolly carter was touched on a sensitive spot that horse he protested loudly is a mighty good horse some day thats what you always said remarked dolly but he never seems to have his day its strange said champneys consciously i dreamed of dromedary only last night same dream over and over again hastily he changed the subject for some reason i dont sleep well i dont know why dolly looked at him with all the love in her eyes of a mother over her ailing infant its worrying over me and the heat she said and the garage next door and the skyscraper going up across the street might have something to do with it and you she mocked tenderly wanted to send me to the seashore carter was frowning as though about to speak he opened his lips and then laughed embarrassedly out with it said dolly with an encouraging smile did he win seeing she had read what was in his mind carter leaned forward eagerly the ruling passion and a touch of superstition held him in their grip he win each time he whispered i saw it as plain as i see you each time he came up with a rush just at the same place just as they entered the stretch and each time he won he slapped his hand disdainfully upon the dirty bills before him if i had a hundred dollars there was a knock at the door and carter opened it to the elevator boy with the morning mail the letters save one carter dropped upon the table that one with clumsy fingers he tore open he exclaimed breathlessly its from plymptons magazine maybe ive sold a story he gave a cry almost of alarm his voice was as solemn as though the letter had announced a death dolly he whispered its a check a check for a hundred dollars guiltily the two young people looked at each other weve got to breathed dolly got to if we let two signs like that pass wed be flying in the face of providence with her hands gripping the arms of her chair she leaned forward her eyes staring into space her lips moving come on you dromedary she whispered they changed the check into five and ten dollar bills and as carter was far too excited to work made an absurdly early start for the racetrack we might as well get all the fresh air we can said dolly thats all we will get from their reserve fund of twentyseven dollars which each had solemnly agreed with the other would not be risked on racehorses dolly subtracted a twodollar bill this she stuck conspicuously across the face of the clock on the mantel why asked carter when we get back this evening dolly explained that will be the first thing well see its going to look awfully good this day there was no scarlet car to rush them with refreshing swiftness through brooklyns parkways and along the ocean avenue instead they hung to a strap in a crosstown car changed to the ferry and again to the long island railroad when carter halted at the special car of the turf club dolly took his arm and led him forward to the day coach but protested carter when youre spending a hundred dollars with one hand why grudge fifty cents for a parlorcar seat if youre going to be a sport be a sport and if youve got to be a piker said dolly dont be ashamed to be a piker were not spending a hundred dollars because we can afford it but because you dreamt a dream you didnt dream you were riding in parlorcars if you did its time i woke you this day there was for them no box overlooking the finish no clubhouse luncheon with the other pikers they sat in the free seats with those who sat coatless and tucked their handkerchiefs inside their collars and with those who mopped their perspiring countenances with ricepaper and marked their cards with a hatpin their lunch consisted of a massive ham sandwich with a top dressing of mustard dromedary did not run until the fifth race and the long wait before they could learn their fate was intolerable they knew most of the horses and to pass the time on each of the first races dolly made imaginary bets of these mental wagers she lost every one if you turn out to be as bad a guesser when youre asleep as i am when im awake said dolly were going to lose our fortune im weakening declared carter a hundred dollars is beginning to look to me like an awful lot of money twentyseven dollars and theres only twenty of that left now is mighty small capital but twenty dollars plus a hundred could keep us alive for a month did you or did you not dream that dromedary would win demanded dolly sternly i certainly did several times said carter but it may be i was thinking of the horse ive lost such a lot on him my mind may have did you interrupted dolly say if you had a hundred dollars youd bet it and did a hundred dollars walk in through the door instantly carter reassured breathed again it certainly did he repeated even in his proud days carter had never been able to bet heavily and instead of troubling the clubhouse commissioners with his small wagers he had in the ring bet ready money moreover he believed in the ring he obtained more favorable odds and when he won it pleased him instead of waiting until settling day for a check to stand in a line and feel the real money thrust into his hand so when the fourth race started he rose and raised his hat the time has come he said without looking at him dolly nodded she was far too tremulous to speak for several weeks dromedary had not been placed and carter hoped for odds of at least ten to one but when he pushed his way into the arena he found so little was thought of his choice that as high as twenty to one was being offered and with few takers the fact shattered his confidence here were two hundred bookmakers trained to their calling anxious at absurd odds to back their opinion that the horse he liked could not win in the face of such unanimous contempt his dream became fantastic fatuous he decided he would risk only half of his fortune then should the horse win he still would be passing rich and should he lose he would at least have all of fifty dollars with a bookmaker he wagered that sum and then in unhappy indecision stood in one hand clutching his ticket that called for a potential thousand and fifty dollars and in the other an actual fifty it was not a place for meditation from every side men more or less sane swept upon him jostled him and stamped upon him and still struggling for a foothold he swayed hesitating then he became conscious that the ring was nearly empty that only a few shrieking individuals still ran down the line the horses were going to the post he must decide quickly in front of him the bookmaker cleaned his board and as a final appeal opposite the names of three horses chalked thirty to one dromedary was among them such odds could not be resisted carter shoved his fifty at the man and to that sum added the twenty dollars still in his pocket they were the last dollars he owned in the world and though he knew they were his last he was fearful lest the bookmaker would refuse them but mechanically the man passed them over his shoulder and twentyone hundred to seventy he chanted when carter took his seat beside dolly he was quite cold still dolly did not speak out of the corner of her eyes she questioned him i got fifty at twenty to one replied carter and seventy at thirty in alarm dolly turned upon him seventy she gasped carter nodded all we have he said we have sixty cents left to start life over again as though to encourage him dolly placed her finger on her racecard his colors she said are green cap green jacket green and white hoops through a maze of heat a halfmile distant at the startinggate little spots of color moved in impatient circles the big goodnatured crowd had grown silent so silent that from the high sunwarmed grass in the infield one could hear the lazy chirp of the crickets as though repeating a prayer or an incantation dollys lips were moving quickly green cap she whispered green jacket green and white hoops with a sharp sigh the crowd broke the silence theyre off it cried and leaned forward expectant the horses came so fast to carter their conduct seemed outrageous it was incredible that in so short a time at a pace so reckless they would decide a question of such moment they came bunched together shifting and changing with through the dust flashes of blue and gold and scarlet a jacket of yellow shot out of the dust and showed in front a jacket of crimson followed so they were at the half so they were at the threequarters the goodnatured crowd began to sway to grumble and murmur then to shout in sharp staccato can you see him begged dolly no said carter you dont see him until they reach the stretch one could hear their hoofs could see the crimson jockey draw his whip at the sight for he rode the favorite the crowd gave a great gasp of concern oh you gold heels it implored under the whip gold heels drew even with the yellow jacket stride by stride they fought it out alone gold heels cried the crowd behind them in a curtain of dust pounded the field it charged in a flying wedge like a troop of cavalry dolly searching for a green jacket saw instead a rainbow wave of color that as it rose and fell sprang toward her in great leaps swallowing the track gold heels yelled the crowd the field swept into the stretch without moving his eyes carter caught dolly by the wrist and pointed as though giving a signal he shot his free hand into the air now he shouted from the curtain of dust as lightning strikes through a cloud darted a great rawboned ugly chestnut like the empire express he came rocking thundering spurning the ground at his coming gold heels to the eyes of the crowd seemed to falter to slacken to stand still the crowd gave a great cry of amazement a yell of disgust the chestnut drew even with gold heels passed him and swept under the wire clinging to his neck was a little jockey in a green cap green jacket and hoops of green and white dollys hand was at her side clutching the bench carters hand still clasped it neither spoke or looked at the other for an instant while the crowd no longer so goodnatured mocked and jeered at itself the two young people sat quite still staring at the green field at the white clouds rolling from the ocean dolly drew a long breath lets go she gasped lets thank him first and then take me home they found dromedary in the paddock and thanked him and carter left dolly with him while he ran to collect his winnings when he returned he showed her a sheaf of yellow bills and as they ran down the covered board walk to the gate they skipped and danced dolly turned toward the train drawn up at the entrance not with me shouted carter were going home in the reddest most expensive fastest automobile i can hire in the hack line of motorcars was one that answered those requirements and they fell into it as though it were their own to the night and day bank commanded carter with the genial democracy of the racetrack the chauffeur lifted his head to grin appreciatively that listens good to me he said i like him whispered dolly lets buy him and the car on the way home they bought many cars every car they saw that they liked they bought they bought also several houses and a yacht that they saw from the ferryboat and as soon as they had deposited the most of their money in the bank they went to a pawnshop in sixth avenue and bought back many possessions that they had feared they never would see again when they entered the flat the thing they first beheld was dollys twodollar bill what demanded carter with repugnance is that strange piece of paper dolly examined it carefully i think it is a kind of money she said used by the lower classes they dined on the roof at delmonicos dolly wore the largest of the five hats still unsold and carter selected the dishes entirely according to which was the most expensive every now and again they would look anxiously down across the street at the bank that held their money they were nervous lest it should take fire we can be extravagant tonight said dolly because we owe it to dromedary to celebrate but from tonight on we must save weve had an awful lesson what happened to us last month must never happen again we were down to a twodollar bill now we have twentyfive hundred across the street and you have several hundreds in your pocket on that we can live easily for a year meanwhile you can write the great american novel without having to worry about money or to look for a steady job and then your book will come out and you will be famous and rich and passing on from that interrupted carter the thing of first importance is to get you out of that hot beastly flat i propose we start tomorrow for cape cod i know a lot of fishing villages there where we could board and lodge for twelve dollars a week and row and play tennis and live in our bathing suits dolly assented with enthusiasm and during the courses of the dinner they happily discussed cape cod from pocasset to yarmouth and from sandwich to provincetown so eager were they to escape that carter telephoned the hallman at his club to secure a cabin for the next afternoon on the fall river boat as they sat over their coffee in the cool breeze with in the air the scent of flowers and the swing of music and with at their feet the lights of the great city the world seemed very bright it has been a great day sighed carter and if i hadnt had nervous prostration i would have enjoyed it that racecourse is always cool and there were some fine finishes i noticed two horses that would bear watching her highness and glowworm if we werent leaving tomorrow id be inclined dolly regarded him with eyes of horror champneys carter she exclaimed as she said it it sounded like great jehoshaphat carter protested indignantly i only said he explained if i were following the races id watch those horses dont worry he exclaimed i know when to stop the next morning they took breakfast on the tiny terrace of a restaurant overlooking bryant park where during the first days of their honeymoon they had always breakfasted for sentimental reasons they now revisited it but dolly was eager to return at once to the flat and pack and carter seemed distraught he explained that he had had a bad night im so sorry sympathized dolly but tonight you will have a fine sleep going up the sound any more nightmares she asked nightmares exploded carter fiercely nightmares they certainly were i dreamt two of the nightmares won i saw them all night just as i saw dromedary her highness and glowworm winning winning winning those were the horses you spoke about last night said dolly severely after so wonderful a day of course you dreamt of racing and those two horses were in your mind thats the explanation they returned to the flat and began industriously to pack about twelve oclock carter coming suddenly into the bedroom where dolly was alone found her reading the morning telegraph it was open at the racing page of past performances she dropped the paper guiltily carter kicked a hatbox out of his way and sat down on a trunk i dont see he began why we cant wait one more day wed be just as near the ocean at sheepshead bay racetrack as on a fall river boat and he halted and frowned unhappily we neednt bet more than ten dollars he begged of course declared dolly if they should win youll always blame me carters eyes shone hopefully and continued dolly i cant bear to have you blame me so get your hat shouted carter or well miss the first race carter telephoned for a cab and as they were entering it said guiltily ive got to stop at the bank you have not announced dolly that money is to keep us alive while you write the great american novel im glad to spend another day at the races and im willing to back your dreams as far as ten dollars but for no more if my dreams come true warned carter youll be awfully sorry not i said dolly ill merely send you to bed and you can go on dreaming when her highness romped home an easy winner the look dolly turned upon her husband was one both of fear and dismay i dont like it she gasped its its uncanny it gives me a creepy feeling it makes you seem sort of supernatural and oh she cried if only i had let you bet all you had with you i did stammered carter in extreme agitation i bet four hundred i got five to one dolly he gasped in awe weve won two thousand dollars dolly exclaimed rapturously well put it all in bank she cried well put it all on glowworm said her husband champ begged dolly dont push your luck stop while carter shook his head its not luck he growled its a gift its second sight its prophecy ive been a fullfledged clairvoyant all my life and didnt know it anyway im a sport and after two of my dreams breaking right ive got to back the third one glowworm was at ten to one and at those odds the bookmakers to whom he first applied did not care to take so large a sum as he offered carter found a bookmaker named sol burbank who at those odds accepted his two thousand when carter returned to collect his twentytwo thousand there was some little delay while burbank borrowed a portion of it he looked at carter curiously and none too genially wasnt it you he asked that had that thirtytoone shot yesterday on dromedary carter nodded somewhat guiltily a man in the crowd volunteered and he had her highness in the second too for four hundred youve made a good day said burbank give me a chance to get my money back tomorrow im sorry said carter im leaving new york tomorrow the same scarlet car bore them back triumphant to the bank twentytwo thousand dollars gasped carter in cash how in the name of all thats honest can we celebrate winning twentytwo thousand dollars we cant eat more than one dinner we cant drink more than two quarts of champagne not without serious results ill tell you what we can do cried dolly excitedly we can sail tomorrow on the campania hurrah shouted carter well have a second honeymoon well shoot up london and paris well tear slices out of the map of europe youll ride in one motorcar ill ride in another well have a maid and a valet in a third and well race each other all the way to monte carlo and there ill dream of the winning numbers and well break the bank when does the campania sail at noon said dolly at eight we will be on board said carter but that night in his dreams he saw king pepper confederate and red wing each win a race and in the morning neither the engines of the campania nor the entreaties of dolly could keep him from the racetrack i want only six thousand he protested you can do what you like with the rest but i am going to bet six thousand on the first one of those three to start if he loses i give you my word ill not bet another cent and well sail on saturday if he wins out ill put all i make on the two others cant you see begged dolly that your dreams are just a rehash of what you think during the day you have been playing in wonderful luck thats all each of those horses is likely to win his race when he does you will have more faith than ever in your silly dreams my silly dreams said carter grinning are carrying you to europe first class by the next steamer they had been talking while on their way to the bank when dolly saw she could not alter his purpose she made him place the nineteen thousand that remained after he had taken out the six thousand in her name she then drew out the entire amount you told me said dolly smiling anxiously i could do what i liked with it maybe i have dreams also maybe i mean to back them she drove away mysteriously refusing to tell him what she intended to do when they met at luncheon she was still much excited still bristling with a concealed secret did you back your dream asked carter dolly nodded happily and when am i to know you will read of it said dolly tomorrow in the morning papers its all quite correct my lawyers arranged it lawyers gasped her husband youre not arranging to lock me in a private madhouse are you no laughed dolly but when i told them how i intended to invest the money they came near putting me there didnt they want to know how you suddenly got so rich asked carter they did i told them it came from my husbands books it was a very near falsehood it was worse said carter it was a very poor pun as in their honeymoon days they drove proudly to the track and when carter had placed dolly in a box large enough for twenty he pushed his way into the crowd around the stand of sol burbank that veteran of the turf welcomed him gladly coming to give me my money back he called no to take some away said carter handing him his six thousand without apparently looking at it burbank passed it to his cashier king pepper twelve to six thousand he called when king pepper won and carter moved around the ring with eighteen thousand dollars in thousand and five hundred dollar bills in his fist he found himself beset by a crowd of curious eager pikers they both impeded his operations and acted as a bodyguard confederate was an almost prohibitive favorite at one to three and in placing eighteen thousand that he might win six carter found little difficulty when confederate won and he started with his twentyfour thousand to back red wing the crowd now engulfed him men and boys who when they wagered five and ten dollars were risking their all found in the sight of a young man offering bets in hundreds and thousands a thrilling and fascinating spectacle to learn what horse he was playing and at what odds racing touts and runners for other bookmakers and individual speculators leaped into the mob that surrounded him and then squirming their way out ran shrieking down the line in ten minutes through the bets of carter and those that backed his luck the odds against red wing were forced down from fifteen to one to even money his approach was hailed by the bookmakers either with jeers or with shouts of welcome those who had lost demanded a chance to regain their money those with whom he had not bet found in that fact consolation and chaffed the losers some curtly refused even the smallest part of his money not with me they laughed from stand to stand the layers of odds taunted him or each other dont touch it its tainted they shouted look out joe hes the jonah man or come at me again they called and once more they challenged as they reached for a thousanddollar bill and when in time each shook his head and grumbled thats all i want or looked the other way the mob around carter jeered hes fought em to a standstill they shouted jubilantly in their eyes a man who alone was able and willing to wipe the name of a horse off the blackboards was a hero to the horror of dolly instead of watching the horses parade past the crowd gathered in front of her box and pointed and stared at her from the clubhouse her men friends and acquaintances invaded it has carter gone mad they demanded hes dealing out thousanddollar bills like cigarettes hes turned the ring into a wheat pit when he reached the box a sunburned man in a sombrero blocked his way im the owner of red wing he explained bred him and trained him myself i know hell be lucky if he gets the place youre backing him in thousands to win what do you know about him know he will win said carter the veteran commissioner of the club stand buttonholed him mr carter he begged why dont you bet through me ill give you as good odds as they will in that ring you dont want your clothes torn off you and your money taken from you they havent taken such a lot of it yet said carter when red wing won the crowd beneath the box the men in the box and the people standing around it most of whom had followed carters plunge cheered and fell over him to shake hands and pound him on the back from every side excited photographers pointed cameras and landers band played every little bit added to what youve got makes just a little bit more as he left the box to collect his money a big man with a brown mustache and two smoothshaven giants closed in around him as tackles interfere for the man who has the ball the big man took him by the arm carter shook himself free whats the idea he demanded im pinkerton said the big man genially you need a bodyguard if youve got an empty seat in your car ill drive home with you from cavanaugh they borrowed a bookmakers handbag and stuffed it with thousanddollar bills when they stepped into the car the crowd still surrounded them hes taking it home in a trunk they yelled that night the sporting extras of the afternoon papers gave prominence to the luck at the races of champneys carter from cavanaugh and the bookmakers the racing reporters had gathered accounts of his winnings they stated that in three successive days starting with one hundred dollars he had at the end of the third day not lost a single bet and that afternoon on the last race alone he had won sixty to seventy thousand dollars with the text they ran pictures of carter at the track of dolly in her box and of mrs ingram in a tiara and balldress motherinlaw will be pleased cried carter in some alarm as to what the newspapers might say on the morrow he ordered that in the morning a copy of each be sent to his room that night in his dreams he saw clouds of dustcovered jackets and horses with sweating flanks and one of them named ambitious led all the rest when he woke he said to dolly that horse ambitious will win today he can do just as he likes about that replied dolly i have something on my mind much more important than horseracing today you are to learn how i spent your money its to be in the morning papers when he came to breakfast dolly was on her knees for his inspection she had spread the newspapers on the floor opened at an advertisement that appeared in each in the centre of a halfpage of white paper were the lines sold out in one day entire first edition the dead heat by champneys carter second edition one hundred thousand in heavens name roared carter what does this mean it means cried dolly tremulously im backing my dream ive always believed in your book now im backing it our lawyers sent me to an advertising agent his name is spink and he is awfully clever i asked him if he could advertise a book so as to make it sell he said with my money and his ideas he could sell last years telephone book to people who did not own a telephone and who had never learned to read he is proud of his ideas one of them was buying out the first edition your publishers told him your book was waste paper and that he could have every copy in stock for the cost of the plates so he bought the whole edition thats how it was sold out in one day then we ordered a second edition of one hundred thousand and theyre printing it now the presses have been working all night to meet the demand but cried carter there isnt any demand there will be said dolly when five million people read our advertisements she dragged him to the window and pointed triumphantly into the street see that she said mr spink sent them here for me to inspect drawn up in a line that stretched from fifth avenue to broadway were an army of sandwich men on the boards they carried were the words read the dead heat second edition one hundred thousand on the fence in front of the building going up across the street in letters a foot high carter again read the name of his novel in letters in size more modest but in colors more defiant it glared at him from ashcans and barrels how much does this cost he gasped it cost every dollar you had in bank said dolly and before we are through it will cost you twice as much more mr spink is only waiting to hear from me before he starts spending fifty thousand dollars thats only half of what you won on red wing im only waiting for you to make me out a check before i tell spink to start spending it in a dazed state carter drew a check for fifty thousand dollars and meekly handed it to his wife they carried it themselves to the office of mr spink on their way on every side they saw evidences of his handiwork on walls on scaffolding on billboards were advertisements of the dead heat over madison square a huge kite as large as a zeppelin airship painted the name of the book against the sky on dodgers it floated in the air on handbills it stared up from the gutters mr spink was a nervous young man with a bald head and eyeglasses he grasped the check as a general might welcome fifty thousand fresh troops reinforcements he cried now watch me now i can do things that are big national napoleonic we cant get those books bound inside of a week but meanwhile orders will be pouring in people will be growing crazy for it every man woman and child in greater new york will want a copy ive sent out fifty boys dressed as jockeys on horseback to ride neck and neck up and down every avenue the dead heat is printed on the saddlecloth half of them have been arrested already its a little idea of my own but protested carter its not a racing story its a detective story the devil it is gasped spink but whats the difference he exclaimed theyve got to buy it anyway theyd buy it if it was a cookbook and i say he cried delightedly thats great press work youre doing for the book at the races the papers are full of you this morning and every man who reads about your luck at the track will see your name as the author of the dead heat and will rush to buy the book hell think the dead heat is a guide to the turf when carter reached the track he found his notoriety had preceded him ambitious did no run until the fourth race and until then as he sat in his box an eager crowd surged below he had never known such popularity the crowd had read the newspapers and such headlines as he cannot lose young carter wins boy plunger wins again carter makes big killing the ring hit hard the man who cannot lose carter beats bookmakers had whetted their curiosity and filled many with absolute faith in his luck men he had not seen in years grasped him by the hand and carelessly asked if he could tell of something good friends old and new begged him to dine with them to immediately have a drink with them at least to try a cigar men who protested they had lost their all begged for just a hint which would help them to come out even and every one without exception assured him he was going to buy his latest book i tried to get it last night at a dozen newsstands many of them said but they told me the entire edition was exhausted the crowd of hungryeyed racegoers waiting below the box and watching carters every movement distressed dolly i hate it she cried they look at you like a lot of starved dogs begging for a bone lets go home we dont want to make any more money and we may lose what we have and i want it all to advertise the book if youre not careful said carter some one will buy that book and read it and then you and spink will have to take shelter in a cyclone cellar when he arose to make his bet on ambitious his friends from the club stand and a halfdozen of pinkertons men closed in around him and in a flying wedge pushed into the ring the newspapers had done their work and he was instantly surrounded by a hungry howling mob in comparison with the one of the previous day it was as a football scrimmage to a run on a bank when he made his first wager and the crowd learned the name of the horse it broke with a yell into hundreds of flying missiles which hurled themselves at the bookmakers under their attack as on the day before ambitious receded to even money there was hardly a person at the track who did not back the luck of the man who could not lose and when ambitious won easily it was not the horse or the jockey that was cheered but the young man in the box in new york the extras had already announced that he was again lucky and when dolly and carter reached the bank they found the entire staff on hand to receive him and his winnings they amounted to a sum so magnificent that carter found for the rest of their lives the interest would furnish dolly and himself an income upon which they could live modestly and well a distinguishedlooking whitehaired official of the bank congratulated carter warmly should you wish to invest some of this he said i should be glad to advise you my knowledge in that direction may be wider than your own carter murmured his thanks the whitehaired gentleman lowered his voice on certain other subjects he continued you know many things of which i am totally ignorant could you tell me he asked carelessly who will win the suburban tomorrow carter frowned mysteriously i can tell you better in the morning he said it looks like beldame with proper and first mason within call the whitehaired man showed his surprise and also that his ignorance was not as profound as he suggested i thought the keene entry he ventured i know said carter doubtfully if it were for a mile i would say delhi but i dont think he can last the distance in the morning ill wire you as they settled back in their car carter took both of dollys hands in his so far as money goes he said we are independent of your mother independent of my books and i want to make you a promise i want to promise you that no matter what i dream in the future ill never back another horse dolly gave a gasp of satisfaction and whats more added carter hastily not another dollar can you risk in backing my books after this theyve got to stand or fall on their legs agreed cried dolly our plunging days are over when they reached the flat they found waiting for carter the junior partner of a real publishing house he had a blank contract and he wanted to secure the right to publish carters next book i have a few short stories suggested carter collections of short stories protested the visitor truthfully do not sell we would prefer another novel on the same lines as the dead heat have you read the dead heat asked carter i have not admitted the publisher but the next book by the same author is sure to we will pay in advance of royalties fifteen thousand dollars could you put that in writing asked carter when the publisher was leaving he said i see your success in literature is equaled by your success at the races could you tell me what will win the suburban i will send you a wire in the morning said carter they had arranged to dine with some friends and later to visit a musical comedy carter had changed his clothes and while he was waiting for dolly to dress was reclining in a huge armchair the heat of the day the excitement and the wear on his nerves caused his head to sink back his eyes to close and his limbs to relax when by her entrance dolly woke him he jumped up in some confusion youve been asleep she mocked worse said carter ive been dreaming shall i tell you who is going to win the suburban champneys cried dolly in alarm my dear dolly protested her husband i promised to stop betting i did not promise to stop sleeping well sighed dolly with relief as long as it stops at that delhi will win she added delhi will not said carter this is how they will finishhe scribbled three names on a piece of paper which dolly read but that she said is what you told the gentleman at the bank carter stared at her blankly and in some embarrassment you see cried dolly what you think when youre awake you dream when youre asleep and you had a run of luck that never happened before and could never happen again carter received her explanation with reluctance i wonder he said on arriving at the theatre they found their host had reserved a stagebox and as there were but four in their party and as when they entered the house lights were up their arrival drew upon them the attention both of those in the audience and of those on the stage the theatre was crowded to its capacity and in every part were people who were habitual racegoers as well as many racing men who had come to town for the suburban by these as well as by many others who for three days had seen innumerable pictures of him carter was instantly recognized to the audience and to the performers the man who always won was of far greater interest than what for the threehundredth night was going forward on the stage and when the leading woman blanche winter asked the comedian which he would rather be the man who broke the bank at monte carlo or the man who can not lose she gained from the audience an easy laugh and from the chorus an excited giggle when at the end of the act carter went into the lobby to smoke he was so quickly surrounded that he sought refuge on broadway from there the crowd still following him he was driven back into his box meanwhile the interest shown in him had not been lost upon the press agent of the theatre and he at once telephoned to the newspaper offices that plunger carter the bookmaker breaker was at that theatre and if that the newspapers wanted a chance to interview him on the probable outcome of the classic handicap to be run on the morrow he the press agent would unselfishly assist them in answer to these hurry calls reporters of the ten oclock club assembled in the foyer how far what later followed was due to their presence and to the efforts of the press agent only that gentleman can tell it was in the second act that miss blanche winter sang her topical song in it she advised the audience when anxious to settle any question of personal or national interest to put it up to the man in the moon this night she introduced a verse in which she told of her desire to know which horse on the morrow would win the suburban and in the chorus expressed her determination to put it up to the man in the moon instantly from the back of the house a voice called why dont you put it up to the man in the box miss winter laughedthe audience laughed all eyes were turned toward carter as though the idea pleased them from different parts of the house people applauded heartily in embarrassment carter shoved back his chair and pulled the curtain of the box between him and the audience but he was not so easily to escape leaving the orchestra to continue unheeded with the prelude to the next verse miss winter walked slowly and deliberately toward him smiling mischievously in burlesque entreaty she held out her arms she made a most appealing and charming picture and of that fact she was well aware in a voice loud enough to reach every part of the house she addressed herself to carter wont you tell me she begged carter blushing unhappily shrugged his shoulders in apology with a wave of her hand miss winter designated the audience then she coaxed reproachfully wont you tell them again instantly with a promptness and unanimity that sounded suspiciously as though it came from ushers well rehearsed several voice echoed her petition give us all a chance shouted one dont keep the good things to yourself reproached another i want to get rich too wailed a third in his heart carter prayed they would choke but the audience so far from resenting the interruptions encouraged them and carters obvious discomfort added to its amusement it proceeded to assail him with applause with appeals with commands to speak up the handclapping became generalinsistent the audience would not be denied carter turned to dolly in the recesses of the box she was enjoying his predicament his friends also were laughing at him indignant at their desertion carter grinned vindictively all right he muttered over his shoulder since you think its funny ill show you he pulled his pencil from his watchchain and spreading his programme on the ledge of the box began to write from the audience there rose a murmur of incredulity of surprise of excited interest in the rear of the house the press agent after one startled look doubled up in an ecstasy of joy weve landed him he gasped weve landed him hes going to fall for it dolly frantically clasped her husband by the coattail champ she implored what are you doing quite calmly quite confidently carter rose leaning forward with a nod and a smile he presented the programme to the beautiful miss winter that lady all but snatched at it the spotlight was full in her eyes turning her back that she might the more easily read she stood for a moment her pretty figure trembling with eagerness her pretty eyes bent upon the programme the house had grown suddenly still and with an excited gesture the leader of the orchestra commanded the music to silence a man bursting with impatience broke the tense quiet read it he shouted in a frightened voice that in the sudden hush held none of its usual confidence miss winter read slowly the favorite cannot last the distance will lead for the mile and give way to beldame proper takes the place first mason will show beldame will win by a length before she had ceased reading a dozen men had struggled to their feet and a hundred voice were roaring at her read that again the chorused once more miss winter read the message but before she had finished half of those in the front rows were scrambling from their seats and racing up the aisles already the reporters were ahead of them and in the neighborhood not one telephone booth was empty within five minutes in those hotels along the white way where sporting men are wont to meet betting commissioners and handbook men were suddenly assaulted by breathless gentlemen some in evening dress some without collars and some without hats but all with money to bet against the favorite and an hour later men bent under stacks of newspaper extras were vomited from the subway stations into the heart of broadway and in raucous tones were shrieking winner of the suburban sixteen hours before that race was run that night to every big newspaper office from maine to california was flashed the news that plunger carter in a broadway theatre had announced that the favorite for the suburban would be beaten and in order had named the three horses that would first finish up and down broadway from rathskellers to roofgardens in cafes and lobster palaces on the corners of the crossroads in clubs and allnight restaurants carters tip was as a red rag to a bull was the boy drunk they demanded or had his miraculous luck turned his head otherwise why would he so publicly utter a prophecy that on the morrow must certainly smother him with ridicule the explanations were varied the men in the clubs held he was driven by a desire for notoriety the men in the street that he was more clever than they guessed and had made the move to suit his own book to alter the odds to his own advantage others frowned mysteriously with superstitious faith in his luck they pointed to his record has he ever lost a bet how do we know what he knows they demanded perhaps its fixed and he knows it the wise ones howled in derision a suburban fixed they retorted you can fix one jockey you can fix two but you cant fix sixteen jockeys you cant fix belmont you cant fix keene theres nothing in his picking beldame but only a crazy man would pick the horse for the place and to show and shut out the favorite the boy ought to be in matteawan still undisturbed still confident to those to whom he had promised them carter sent a wire nor did he forget his old enemy sol burbank if you want to get some of the money i took he telegraphed wipe out the belmont entry and take all they offer on delhi he cannot win and that night when each newspaper called him up at his flat he made the same answer the three horses will finish as i said you can state that i gave the information as i did as a sort of present to the people of new york city in the papers the next morning carters tip was the frontpage feature even those who never in the racing of horses felt any concern could not help but take in the outcome of this one a curious interest the audacity of the prophecy the very absurdity of it presupposing as it did occult power was in itself amusing and when the curtain rose on the suburban it was evident that to thousands what the man who could not lose had foretold was a serious and inspired utterance this time his friends gathered around him not to benefit by his advice but to protect him theyll mob you they warned theyll tear the clothes off your back better make your getaway now dolly with tears in her eyes sat beside him every now and again she touched his hand below his box as around a newspaper office on the night when a president is elected the people crushed in a turbulent mob some mocked and jeered some who on his tip had risked their every dollar hailed him hopefully on every side policemen fearful of coming trouble hemmed him in carter was bored extremely heartily sorry he had on the night before given way to what he now saw as a perverse impulse but he still was confident still undismayed to all eyes except those of dolly he was of all those at the track the least concerned to her he turned and in a low tone spoke swiftly i am so sorry he begged but indeed indeed i cant lose you must have faith in me in you yes returned dolly in a whisper but in your dreams no the horses were passing on their way to the post carter brought his face close to hers im going to break my promise he said and make one more bet this one with you i bet you a kiss that im right dolly holding back her tears smiled mournfully make it a hundred she said half of the forty thousand at the track had backed delhi the other half following carters luck and his confidence in proclaiming his convictions had backed beldame many hundred had gone so far as to bet that the three horses he had named would finish as he had foretold but in spite of carters tip delhi still was the favorite and when the thousands saw the keene polkadots leap to the front and by two lengths stay there for the quarter the half and for the threequarters the air was shattered with jubilant triumphant yells and then suddenly with the swiftness of a moving picture in the very moment of his victory beldame crept up on the favorite drew alongside drew ahead passed him and left him beaten it was at the mile the night before a man had risen in a theatre and said to two thousand people the favorite will lead for the mile and give way to beldame could they have believed him the men who now cursed themselves might for the rest of their lives have lived upon their winnings those who had followed his prophecy faithfully superstitiously now shrieked in happy riotous selfcongratulation at the mile they yelled he told you at the mile they turned toward carter and shook panama hats at him oh you carter they shrieked lovingly it was more than a race the crowd was watching now it was the working out of a promise and when beldame stood off propers rush and proper fell to second and first mason followed three lengths in the rear and in that order they flashed under the wire the yells were not that a race had been won but that a prophecy had been fulfilled of the thousands that cheered carter and fell upon him and indeed did tear his clothes off his back one of his friends alone was sufficiently unselfish to think of what it might mean to carter champ roared his friend pounding him on both shoulders you old wizard i win ten thousand how much do you win carter cast a swift glance at dolly he said i win much more than that and dolly raising her eyes to his nodded and smiled contentedly
