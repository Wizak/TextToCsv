 i talk with samos she was quite beautiful she knelt near the small low table behind which crosslegged in the hall of samos i sat at this table too crosslegged sat samos he faced me it was early evening in port kar and i had supped with samos first captain in the council of captains that congress of captains sovereign in port kar the hall was lit with burning torches it contained the great map mosaic we had been served our supper by the collared slave who knelt near us i glanced at her she wore a onepiece tunic of repcloth cut high at the thighs to better reveal them her steel collar which was a lock collar and her brand the brand was the common kajira mark of gor the first letter about an inch and a half in height and a half inch in width in cursive script of the expression kajira which is the most common expression in gorean for a female slave it is a simple mark and rather floral a staff with two upturned frondlike curls joined where they touch the staff on its right it bears a distant resemblance to the printed letter k in several of the western alphabets of earth and i suspect in spite of several differences it may owe its origin to that letter the gorean alphabet has twentyeight characters all of which i suspect owe their origin to one or another of the alphabets of earth several show a clearcut resemblance to greek letters for example sidge on the other hand could be cuneiform and tun and val are probably calligraphically drifted from demotic at least six letters suggest influence by the classical roman alphabet and seven do if we count kef the first letter in kajira shu is represented by a sign which seems clearly oriental in origin and homan i speculate may derive from cretan many gorean letters have a variety of pronunciations depending on their linguistic context certain scribes have recommended adding to the gorean alphabet new letters to independently represent some of these sounds which now require alternative pronunciations contextdependent of given letters their recommendations it seems are unlikely to be incorporated into formal gorean in matters such as those of the alphabet conservatism seems unshakable for example there is not likely to be additions or deletions to the alphabets of earth regardless of the rationality of such an alteration in given cases an example of the conservatism in such matters is that goreans and indeed many of those of the earth are taught their alphabets in an order which bears no rational relation whatsoever to the occurrence pattern of the letters that children should be taught the alphabet in an order which reflects the frequency of the occurrence of the letters in the language and thus would expedite their learning appears to be too radical and offensive an idea to become acceptable consider too for example the opposition to an arithmetically convenient system of measurement in certain quarters on earth apparently because of the unwillingness to surrender the techniques of tradition so painfully acquired so long ago do masters desire aught else of linda asked the girl no said samos she put her small hand on the table as though to reach to him to beg his touch no said samos she withdrew head down she picked up the small tray from the stand near the table on it was the small vessel containing a thick sweet liqueur from distant turia the ar of the south and the two tiny glasses from which we had sipped it on the tray too was the metal vessel which had contained the black wine steaming and bitter from far thentis famed for its tarn flocks the small yellowenameled cups from which we had drunk the black wine its spoons and sugars a tiny bowl of mint sticks and the softened dampened cloths on which we had wiped our fingers i had eaten well she stood up she held the tray the gleaming collar snug and locked was very beautiful on her throat i remembered her from several months ago when i had first seen her when she had had about her throat only a simple collar of iron curved about her throat by the blows of a metal workers hammer she looked at samos her lip trembled she had been the girl who had brought to the house of samos the message of the scytale the scytale had been a marked hair ribbon wrapped about the shaft of a spear thus aligning the marks the message had appeared it had been to me from zarendargar or halfear a war general of the kurii inviting me to meet him at the worlds end my speculation that this referred to the pole of the gorean northern hemisphere had proved correct i had met halfear there in a vast northern complex an enormous supply depot intended to arm and fuel and otherwise logistically support the projected invasion of gor the counterearth i think it likely that halfear perished in the destruction of the complex the body however was never recovered the girl who had served us this night slender and blond blueeyed of earth origin had delivered to us the scytale she had not originally even understood it to contain a message how different she seemed now from what she had then been she had been brought to the house of samos still in the inexplicable and barbarous garments of earth in particular in the imitationboy costume the denim trousers and flannel shirt of the contemporary earth girl pathologically conditioned for economic and historical reasons to deny and subvert the richness of her unique sexuality culture decides what is truth but truth unfortunately for culture is unaware of this cultures mad and blind can die upon the rocks of truth why can truth not be the foundation of culture rather than its nemesis can one not build upon the stone cliffs of reality rather than dash ones head against them but how few human beings can think how few dare to inquire how few can honestly question how can one know the answer to a question which one fears to ask samos of course immediately recognized the ribbon as a scytale as for the girl he had promptly to her horror had her clothing removed and had had her put in a brief repcloth slave tunic and a rude neckring of curved iron that she would not escape and anywhere could be recognized as a slave shortly thereafter i had been invited to his house and had received the message i had also questioned the girl who had at that time spoken only english i recalled how arrogant and peremptory she had been until she had learned that she was no longer among men such as those of earth samos had had her taken below and branded and used for the sport of the guards and then penned i had thought that he would have sold her but he had not she had been kept in his own house and taught the meaning of her collar fully i saw the brand on her thigh although the brand was the first letter in cursive gorean script of the most common gorean expression for a slave girl kajira its symbolism i think is much richer than this for example in the slave brand the kef though clearly a kef and in cursive script is more floral in the extended upturned frondlike curls than would be the common cursive kef this tends to make the mark very feminine it is at this point that the symbolism of the brand becomes more clear the two frondlike curls indicate femininity and beauty the staff in its uncompromising severity indicates that the femininity is subject to discipline the upturned curves on the frondlike curls indicate total openness and vulnerability it is a very simple lovely brand simple as befits a slave lovely as befits a woman incidentally there are many brands on gor two that almost never occur on gor by the way are those of the moons and collar and of the chain and claw the first of these commonly occurs in certain of the gorean enclaves on earth which serve as headquarters for agents of priestkings the second tends to occur in the lairs of kurii agents on earth the first brand consists of a locked collar and ascending diagonally above it extending to the right three quarter moons this brand indicates the girl is subject to gorean discipline the chainandclaw brand signifies of course slavery and subjection within the compass of the kur yoke it is apparently difficult to recruit goreans for service on earth either for priestkings or kurii accordingly usually native earthlings are used glandularly sufficient men strong lustful and vital without their slave girls would find earth a very dismal place a miserable and unhappy sexual desert strong men simply need women this will never be understood by weak men a strong man needs a woman at his feet who is truly his anything else is less than his fulfillment when a man has once eaten of the meat of gods he will never again chew on the straw of fools you may withdraw said samos to the girl master she begged him tears in her eyes please master a few months ago she had not been able to speak gorean she now spoke the language subtly and fluently girls learn swiftly to speak the language of their masters samos looked up at her she stood there lovely holding the tray before her on which reposed the vessels the tiny cups and glasses the bowls the spoons the soft dampened cloths on which we had wiped our hands she had served well beautifully effacing herself as a serving slave master she whispered return the things to the kitchen he said i saw from her eyes that she was more than a serving slave it is interesting the power that a man may hold over a woman yes master she said when she had knelt facing samos she had knelt in the position of the pleasure slave when she had knelt facing me she had knelt in the position of the serving slave samos it was said was the first to have brought her to slave orgasm it had happened six days after she had first been brought to his house it is said that a woman who has experienced slave orgasm can never thereafter be anything but a mans slave she then knows what men can do to her and what she herself is a woman never thereafter can she be anything else linda begs masters touch she said the name linda had been her original earth name samos had after it had been removed from her in her reduction to slavery put it on her again but this time as a slave name by his will sometimes a girl is given her own name as a slave name sometimes she is given another name it depends on the masters will she spoke freely before me of her need for his touch she was no longer an inhibited negatively conditioned earth girl she was now open and honest and beautifully clean in her slavery in her confession of her female truths seeing the eyes of samos on her she quickly went to the door to leave but at the door unable to help herself she turned about there were tears in her eyes after you have returned the things to the kitchen said samos yes master she said softly excitedly the small yellowenameled cups moved slightly on the tray she trembled the torchlight glinted from her collar go to your kennel said samos and ask to be locked within yes master she said putting her head down i thought she shook with a sob i hear from the chain master said samos that you have learned the tile dance creditably the tiny cups and glasses shook on the tray i am pleased she said if krobus should think so the tile dance is commonly performed on red tiles usually beneath the slave ring of the masters couch the girl performs the dance on her back her stomach and sides usually her neck is chained to the slave ring the dance signifies the restlessness the misery of a lovestarved slave girl it is a premise of the dance that the girl moves and twists and squirms in her need as if she is completely alone as if her need is known only to herself then supposedly the master surprises her and she attempts to suppress the helplessness and torment of her needs then failing this surrendering her pride in its final shred she writhes openly piteously before him begging him to deign to touch her needless to say the entire dance is observed by the master and this in fact of course is known to both the dancer and her audience the master the tile dance for simple psychological and behavioral reasons having to do with the submission context and the motions of the body can piteously arouse even a captured cold free woman in the case of a slave of course it can make her scream and sob with need i hear that you have worked hard to perfect the tile dance said samos i am only a poor slave she said the last five times you have performed this dance said samos krobus tells me that he could not restrain himself from raping you she put down her head yes master she said smiling after you have been locked in your kennel said samos ask for a vessel of warm water oils and a cloth and perfume bathe and perfume yourself i may summon you later to my chamber yes master she said delightedly yes master slave he said yes master she said turning quickly i am less easy to please than krobus he said yes master she said and then turned and fled swiftly from the room she is a pretty thing i said samos ran his tongue over his lips yes he said i think you like her i said nonsense he said she is only a slave perhaps samos has found a love slave i said an earth girl laughed samos perhaps i said preposterous said samos she is only a slave only a thing to serve and to beat and abuse if it should please me but is not any slave i asked even a love slave that is true said samos smiling gorean men are not easy with their slaves even those for whom they care deeply i think samos first slaver of port kar first captain of the council of captains has grown fond of a blond earth girl samos looked at me angrily then he shrugged she is the first girl i have felt in this fashion toward he said it is interesting it is a strange feeling i note that you did not sell her i said perhaps i shall he said i see i said the first time even that i took her in my arms said samos she was in some way piteously helpless different even from the others is not any slave piteously helpless in the arms of her master i asked yes said samos but she seemed somehow different incredibly so vulnerably so perhaps she knew herself in your touch as her love master i said she felt good in my hands he said be strong samos i smiled i shall he said i did not doubt his word samos was one of the hardest of gorean men the blond earth girl had found a strong uncompromising master but let us not speak of slaves i said girls who serve for our diversion or recreation but of serious matters of the concerns of men agreed said he there was a time for slaves and a time for matters of importance yet there is little to report said he in the affairs of worlds the kurii are quiet i said yes said he beware of a silent enemy i smiled of course said samos it is unusual that you should invite me to your house i said to inform me that you have nothing to report do you think you are the only one upon gor who labors occasionally in the cause of priestkings asked samos i suppose not i said why i asked i did not understand the question how little we know of our world sighed samos i do not understand i said tell me what you know of the cartius he said it is an important subequatorial waterway i said it flows west by northwest entering the rain forests and emptying into lake ushindi which lake is drained by the kamba and the nyoka rivers the kamba flows directly into thassa the nyoka flows into schendi harbor which is the harbor of the port of schendi and moves thence to thassa schendi was an equatorial free port well known on gor it is also the home port of the league of black slavers it was at one time conjectured said samos that the cartius proper was a tributary of the vosk i had been taught that i said we now know that the thassa cartius and the subequatorial cartius are not the same river it had been thought and shown on many maps i said that the subequatorial cartius not only flowed into lake ushindi but emerged northward traversing the sloping western flatlands to join the vosk at turmus turmus was the last major river port on the vosk before the almost impassable marshes of the delta calculations performed by the black geographer ramani of the island of anango suggested that given the elevations involved the two rivers could not be the same his pupil shaba was the first civilized man to circumnavigate lake ushindi he discovered that the cartius as was known enters lake ushindi but that only two rivers flow out of ushindi the kamba and nyoka the actual source of the tributary to the vosk now called the thassa cartius as you know was found five years later by the explorer ramus of tabor who with a small expedition over a period of nine months fought and bartered his way through the river tribes beyond the six cataracts to the ven highlands the thassa cartius with its own tributaries drains the highlands and the descending plains that has been known to me for over a year i said why do you speak of it now we are ignorant of so many things mused samos i shrugged much of gor was terra incognita few knew well the lands on the east of the voltai and thentis ranges for example or what lay west of the farther islands near cos and tyros it was more irritating of course to realize that even considerable areas of territory above schendi south of the vosk and west of ar were unknown there was good reason to speculate that the cartius entered the vosk by way of lake ushindi i said i know said samos tradition and the directions and flow of the rivers who would have understood of the cities that they were not the same even the bargemen of the cartius proper the subequatorial cartius and those of the thassa cartius far to the north thought the rivers to be but one waterway yes said samos and until the calculations of ramani and the expeditions of shaba and ramus who had reason to believe otherwise the rain forests closed the cartius proper for most civilized persons from the south i said and what trading took place tended to be confined to the ubarates of the southern shore of lake ushindi it was convenient then for trading purposes to make use of either the kamba or the nyoka to reach thassa that precluded the need to find a northwest passage from ushindi said samos particularly since it was known of the hostility of the river tribes on what is now called the thassa cartius yes said samos but surely before the expedition of shaba i said others must have searched for the exit of the cartius from ushindi it seems likely they were slain by the tribes of the northern shores of ushindi said samos how is it that the expedition of shaba was successful i asked have you heard of bila huruma asked samos a little i said he is a black ubar said samos bloody and brilliant a man of vision and power who has united the six ubarates of the southern shores of ushindi united them by the knife and the stabbing spear and has extended his hegemony to the northern shores where he exacts tribute kailiauk tusks and women from the confederacy of the hundred villages shabas nine boats had fixed at their masts the tufted shields of the officialdom of bila huruma that guaranteed their safety i said they were attacked several times said samos but they survived i think it true however had it not been for the authority of bila huruma ubar of ushindi they could not have completed their work the hegemony of bila huruma over the northern shores then is substantial hut incomplete i said surely the hegemony is resented said samos as would seem borne out by the fact that some attacks did take place on the expedition of shaba he must be a brave man i said he brought six of his boats through and most of his men said samos i find it impressive i said that a man such as bila huruma would be interested in supporting a geographical expedition he was interested in finding the northwest passage from ushindi said samos it could mean the opening up of a considerable number of new markets the enhancement of trade the discovery of a valuable commercial avenue for the merchandise of the north and the products of the south it might avoid too the dangers of shipment upon thassa i said and provide as well a road to conquest and the acquisition of new territory yes said samos you think like a warrior he said but shabas work i said as i understand it demonstrated that no such passage exists yes said samos that is a consequence of his expedition but surely even if you are not familiar with the role of bila huruma in these things you have heard of the further discoveries of shaba to the west of lake ushindi i said there are floodlands marshes and bogs through which a considerable amount of water drains into the lake with considerable hardship limiting himself to forty men and temporarily abandoning all but two boats which were half dragged and thrust through the marshes eastward after two months shaba reached the western shore of what we now know as lake ngao yes said samos it is fully as large as lake ushindi if not larger i said the second of the great equatorial lakes yes said samos i conjectured that it must have been a marvelous moment when shaba and his men toiling with ropes and poles wading and shoveling brought their two craft to the clear vista of vast deep lake ngao they had returned then exhausted to the balance of their party and boats which had been waiting for them at the eastern shore of ushindi shaba then continued the circumnavigation of lake ushindi said samos he charted accurately for the first time the entry of the cartius proper the subequatorial cartius into ushindi he then continued west until he reached the six ubarates and the heartland of bila huruma he was doubtless welcomed as a hero i said yes said samos and well he should have been the next year i said he mounted a new expedition with eleven boats and a thousand men an expedition financed i now suppose by bila huruma to explore lake ngao to circumnavigate it as he had ushindi precisely said samos and it was there that he discovered that lake ngao was fed incredibly enough by only one major river as its eastern extremity a river vast enough to challenge even the vosk in its breadth and might a river which he called the ua yes said samos it is impassable i said because of various falls and cataracts the extent of these obstacles and the availability of portages the possibility of roads the possibility of side canals are not known said samos shaba himself with his men and boats pursued the river for only a hundred pasangs i said when they were turned back by some falls and cataracts the falls and cataracts of bila huruma as he named them said samos the size of his boats made portage difficult or impossible i said they had not been built to be sectioned said samos and the steepness of the portage the jungle the hostility as it turned out of interior tribes made retreat advisable the expedition of shaba returned then i said to lake ngao completed its circumnavigation and returned later via the swamps to lake ushindi and the six ubarates yes said samos a most remarkable man i said surely one of the foremost geographers and explorers of gor said samos and a highly trusted man trusted i asked shaba is an agent of priestkings said samos i did not know that i said surely you suspected others too served at least upon occasion in the cause of priestkings i had supposed that i said but i had never pressed samos on the matter it seemed to be better that i not know of many agents of priestkings our work was in general unknown to one another this was an elementary security precaution if one of us were captured and tortured he could not if broken reveal what he did not know most agents i did know were primarily engaged in the work of surveillance and intelligence the house of samos was a headquarters to which most of these agents directly or indirectly reported from it the activities of many agents were directed and coordinated it was a clearing house too for information which processed was forwarded to the sardar why do you tell me this i asked come with me said samos getting up he led the way from the room i followed him we passed guards outside the door to the great hall samos did not speak to me for several minutes i followed him lie strode through various halls and then began to descend ramps and staircases at various points and before various portals signs and countersigns were exchanged the thick walls became damp we continued to descend through various levels sometimes treading catwalks over cages the fair occupants of these cages looked up at us frightened in one long corridor we passed two girls naked on their hands and knees with brushes and water scrubbing the stones of the corridor floor a guard with a whip stood over them they fell to their bellies as we passed and then when we had passed rose to their hands and knees to resume their work the pens were generally quiet now for it was time for sleeping we passed barred alcoves and tiers of kennels and rooms for processing training and disciplining slaves the chamber of irons was empty but coals glowed softly in the brazier from which two handles protruded an iron is always ready in a slavers house one does not know when a new girl may be brought in in another room i saw on the walls arranged by size collars chains wrist and ankle rings an inventory of such things is kept in a slavers house each collar each link of chain is accounted for we passed too rooms in which tunics slave silks cosmetics and jewelries were kept normally in the pens girls are kept naked but such things are used in their training there were also facilities for cooking and the storage of food and medical facilities as well as we passed one cell a girl reached forth masters she whimpered then we were beyond her we also passed pens of male slaves these usually criminals and debtors or prisoners taken in war then enslaved are commonly sold cheaply and used for heavy labor we continued to descend through various levels the smell and the dampness never pleasant in the lower levels of the pens now became obtrusive here and there lamps and torches burned these mitigated to some extent the dampness we passed a guards room in which there were several slavers men off duty i glanced within for i heard from within the clash of slave bells and the bright sound of zills or finger cymbals in a bit of yellow slave silk backed into a corner belied and barefoot a collared girl danced swaying slowly before the five men who loomed about her scarcely a yard away then her back touched the stone wall startling her and they seized her and threw her to a blanket for their pleasure i saw her gasping and half fighting half kissing at them squirming in their arms then her arms and legs were held widely separated each of her limbs her small wrists and belled ankles held in the two hands of a captor the leader was first to have her she put her head back helpless crying out with pleasure subdued we were soon on the lowest level of the pens in an area of maximum security there were trickles of water at the walls here and in places water between the stones of the floor an urt slipped between two rocks in the wall samos stopped before a heavy iron door a narrow steel panel slipped back samos uttered the sign for the evening and was answered by the countersign the door opened there were two guards behind it we stopped before the eighth cell on the left samos signaled to the two guards they came forward there were some ropes and hooks and heavy pieces of meat to one side do not speak within said samos to me he handed me a hood with holes cut in it for the eyes is this house or its men known to the prisoner i asked no said samos i donned the hood and samos too donned such a hood the two guards donned such hoods as well they then slid back the observation panel in the solid iron door and after looking through unlocked the door and swung it open it opened inward i waited with samos the two guards then reaching upward with some chains attached above the door lowered a heavy wooden walkway to the surface of the water the room within to the level of the door contained water it was murky and dark i was aware of a rustling in the water the walkway then floating but steadied by its four chains rested on the water on its sides the walkway had metal ridges some six inches in height above the water i heard tiny scratchings at the metal small movements against the metal as though by numerous tiny bodies each perhaps no more than a few ounces in weight samos stood near the door and lifted a torch the two guards went out on the walkway it was some twenty feet in length the flooded cell was circular and perhaps some fortyfive feet in diameter in the center of the cell was a wooden metalsheathed pole some four inches in diameter this pole rose straight some four feet out of the water about this pole encircling it and supported by it was a narrow circular wooden metalsheathed platform it was some ten inches on all sides from the circumference of the pole to the edge of the platform the platform itself was lifted about seven or eight inches out of the water one of the guards carrying a long wooden pole thrust it down into the water the water judging by the pole must have been about eight feet deep the other guard then thrusting a heavy piece of meat on one of the hooks to which a rope was attached held the meat away from the platform and half submerged in the water almost instantly there was a frenzy in the water near the meat a thrashing and turbulence in the murky liquid i felt water splashed on my legs even standing back as i was then the guard lifted the roped hook from the water the meat was gone tiny tharlarion similar to those in the swamp forest south of ar dropped snapping from the bared hook such tiny swift tharlarion in their thousands can take the meat from a kailiauk in an ehn the girl on the platform naked kneeling a metal collar hammered about her neck the metal pole between her leg grasping it with both arms threw back her head and screamed piteously the two guards then withdrew samos hooded walked out on the floating walkway steadied by its chains i similarly hooded followed him he lifted the torch the platforms front edge was about a yard from the tiny wooden metalsheathed circular platform mounted on the wooden metalsheathed pole that tiny platform on which the girl knelt that narrow tiny platform which held her but inches from the tharlarionfilled water she looked up at us piteously blinking against the light of the torch she clutched the pole helplessly she could not have been bound to it more closely if she had been fastened in close chains the small eyes of numerous tharlarion perhaps some two or three hundred of them ranging from four to ten inches in length watching her nostrils and eyes at the water level reflected the light of the torch she clutched the pole even more closely she looked up at us tears in her eyes please please please please please she said she had spoken in english she like samos earth girl linda had blue eyes and blond hair she was slightly more slender than linda she had good ankles they would take an ankle ring nicely i noted that she had not yet been branded please she whimpered samos indicated that we should leave i turned about and preceded him from the walkway the guards behind us raised the walkway secured it in place and swung shut the door they slid shut the observation panel they locked the door samos outside returned his torch to its ring we removed the hoods i followed samos from the lower level and then from the pens back to his hall i do not understand what the meaning of all this is samos i told him there are deep matters here said samos matters in which i am troubled as well as you why did you show me the girl in the cell i asked what do you make of her asked samos i would say about five copper tarsks in a fourthclass market perhaps even an item in a group sale she is beautiful but not particularly beautiful as female slaves go she is obviously ignorant and untrained she does have good ankles she speaks the earth language english does she not asked samos apparently i said do you wish me to question her no said samos does she speak gorean i asked no more than a few words said samos there are ways of determining of course if one speaks a given language one utters phrases significant in the language there are when cognition takes place physiological responses which are difficult or impossible to conceal such things as an increase in the pulse rate and the dilation of the pupils the matter then seems reasonably clear i said give me your thoughts said samos she is a simple wench brought to gor by kur slavers collar meat you would think so he asked it seems likely i said women trained as kur agents are usually well versed in gorean but she is not as beautiful as the average imported slave from earth is she asked samos that matter is rather subjective i would say i smiled i think she is quite lovely whether she is up to the normal standards of their merchandise is another question perhaps she was with a girl who was abducted for enslavement said samos and was simply as it was convenient put in a double tie with her and brought along perhaps i shrugged i would not know it would be my speculation however that she had deep potential for slavery does not any woman asked samos yes i said but some are slaves among slaves i smiled at samos i have great respect for the taste and discrimination of kur slavers i said i think they can recognize the slave in a woman at a glance i have never known them to make a mistake even their kur agents who are female said samos seem to have been selected for their potential for ultimate slavery in mind such as the slaves pepita elicia and arlene they were doubtless intended to be ultimately awarded as gifts and prizes to kur agents who were human males i said they are ours now said samos or theirs to whom we would give or sell them yes i said what of the slave vella he asked she was never in my mind i said strictly an agent of kurii she betrayed priestkings he said and served kurii agents in the tahari that is true i admitted give her to me said samos i want to bind her band and foot and hurl her naked to the urts in the canals she is mine i said if she is to be bound hand and foot and hurled naked to the urts in the canals it is i who will do so as you wish said samos it is my speculation i said that the girl below in the pens in the tharlarion cell in spite of the fact that she is though beautiful less stunning than many slaves is simple collar meat that she was brought to gor for straightforward disposition to a slaver perhaps in a contract lot your speculation given her failures in gorean is intelligent said samos but it is as it happens incorrect speak to me i said you would suppose would you not asked samos that such a girl would have been discovered on some chain after having passed through the hands of one or more masters and simply bought off the chain or purchased at auction of course i said yet she is not yet branded i mused kur slavers do not usually brand their girls usually it is their first gorean master who puts the brand on them that is a perceptive observation said samos how did you come by her i asked quite by accident said samos have you heard of the captain bejar of course i said he is a member of the council he was with us on the th of sekara this was the date of a naval battle which took place in the first year of the sovereignty of the council of captains in port kar it had been also the year ca contasta ar from the founding of ar it was currently year in the sovereignty of the council of captains that year in the chronology of ar which was ca on the th of sekara in the first year of the sovereignty of the council of captains in the naval battle which had taken place on that date the joint fleets of cos and tyros had been turned back from port kar bejar and samos and i and many others as well had been there it was in that same year incidentally that port kar had first had a home stone bejar said samos in an action at sea overtook a ship of cos i listened cos and tyros uneasy allies one island ubarate under largeeyed chendar the sea sleen and the other under gross lurius of jad were nominally at war with port kar there had been however no major engagements in several years cos for some years had been preoccupied with struggles on the vosk these had to do with competitive spheres of influence on the vosk itself and in its basin and adjacent tributarycontaining valleys the products and markets of these areas are quite important commercially whereas most towns on the river are in effect free states few are strong enough to ignore powers such as cos and its major rival in these territories the city of ar cos and ar compete with one another to gain treaties with these river towns control the traffic and dominate the commerce of the river to their respective advantages ar has no navy being an inland power but it has developed a fleet of river ships and these often skirmish with the river ships of cos usually built in cos transported to the continent and carried overland to the river the delta of the vosk for most practical purposes a vast marsh an area of thousands of square pasangs where the vosk washes down to the sea is closed to shipping it is trackless and treacherous and the habitat of marsh tharlarion and the predatory ul a winged lizard with wingspans of several feet it is also inhabited by the rencers who live upon rence islands woven of the rence reed masters of the long bow usually obtained in trade with peasants to the east of the delta they are banded together under the nominal governance of the marsh ubar hohak they are suspicious of strangers as are goreans generally in gorean the same expression is used for stranger and enemy the situation on the vosk is further complicated by the presence of vosk pirates and the rivalries of the river towns themselves the engagement was sharp said samos but the ship its crew passengers and cargo fell to bejar as prize i see now i said the girl was slave cargo on the ship which fell to bejar samos smiled it was not a slave ship i gather i said else it is likely her head and body hair would have been shaved to reduce the degree of infestation by ship lice in the hold i looked at him she could have been of course in a deck cage i said these are small cages fastened on deck at night and in rough weather they are usually covered with a tarpaulin this tends to prevent rust it was not a slave ship said samos i shrugged her thigh was as yet bare of the brand i said which is interesting i looked at samos whose collar did she wear i asked she wore no collar said samos i do not understand i said i was genuinely puzzled she was clothed as a free woman and was among the passengers said samos she was not stripped until she stood on the deck of the ship of bejar and was put in chains with the other captured women she was a passenger i said yes said samos a passenger her passage papers were in order i asked yes he said interesting i said i thought so said samos why would an earth girl almost totally ignorant of gorean unbranded free be traveling on a ship of cos i think clearly it has something to do with the others the kurii said samos that seems likely i said bejar said samos one well known to me discerning that she was both unbranded and barbarian and ignorant of gorean and knowing my interest in such matters called her to my attention i had her hooded brought here from his pens it is an interesting mystery i said are you certain you do not wish me to question her in her own language no said samos or certainly not at present as you wish i said sit down said samos he gestured to a place behind the small table on which we had had supper i sat down crosslegged behind the table and he sat down crosslegged across from me do you recognize this asked samos he reached into his robes and drew forth a small leather packet which he unfolded from this he took a large ring but too large for the finger of a human and placed it on the table of course i said it is the ring which i obtained in the tahari that ring which projects the light diversion field which renders its wearer invisible in the normal visible range of the spectrum is it asked samos i looked at the ring i picked it up it was heavy golden with a silver plate on the outside of the ring opposite the bezel was a recessed circular switch when a kur wore the ring on a digit of his left paw and turned the bezel inward the switch would be exposed he could then depress it with a digit of his right paw the left hemisphere of the kur brain like the left hemisphere of the human brain tends to be dominant most kurii like most men as a consequence of this dominance of the left hemisphere tend to be right pawed or right handed so to speak one press on the switch on the tahari ring had activated the field a second press had resulted in its deactivation within the invisibility shield the spectrum is shifted permitting one to see outward though in a reddish light i would suppose so i said i looked at the ring i had given the tahari ring to samos long ago shortly after returning from the tahari that he might send it to the sardar for analysis i thought such a device might be of use to agents of priestkings i was puzzled that it was not used more often by kurii i had heard nothing more of the ring are you absolutely sure asked samos that this is the ring which you gave me to send to the sardar it certainly seems much like it i said is it the same ring he asked no i said i looked at it more closely no i said it is not the same ring the tahari ring had a minute scratch at the corner of the silver plate i did not think it was said samos if this is an invisibility ring we are fortunate to have it fall into our grasp i said do you think such a ring would be entrusted to a human agent asked samos it is not likely i said it is my belief that this ring does not cast the invisibility shield said samos i see i said take care not to press the switch said samos i will i said i put the ring down let me speak to you of the five rings said samos this is information which i have received but recently from the sardar but it is based on an intelligence thousands of years old obtained then from a delirious kur commander and confirmed by documents obtained in various wreckages the most recent of which dates from some four hundred years ago long ago perhaps as long as forty thousand years ago the kurii possessed a technology far beyond what they now maintain the technology which now makes them so dangerous and so advanced is but the remnants of a technology mostly destroyed in their internecine struggles those which culminated in the destruction of their world the invisibility rings were the product of a great kur scientist one we may refer to in human phonemes for our convenience as prasdak of the cliff of karrash he was a secretive craftsman and before he died he destroyed his plans and papers he left behind him however five rings in the sacking of his city which took place some two years after his death the rings were found what became of the rings i asked two were destroyed in the course of kur history said samos one was temporarily lost upon the planet earth some three to four thousand years ago it being taken from a slain kur commander by a man named gyges a herdsman who used its power to usurp the throne of a country called lydia a country which then existed on earth i nodded lydia i recalled had fallen to the persians in the sixth century bc to utilize one of the earth chronologies that would of course have been long after the time of gyges one is reminded of the name of the river port at the mouth of the laurius said samos yes i said the name of that port was lydius perhaps there is some connection speculated samos perhaps i said perhaps not it was often difficult to know whether isolated phonetic similarities indicated a historical relationship or not in this case i thought it unlikely given the latitude and style of life of lydius on the other hand men of lydia might possibly have been involved in its founding the voyages of acquisition of priestkings i knew had been of great antiquity these voyages now as i understood it following the nest war had been discontinued kurii came later for the ring said samos gyges was slain the ring itself somehow was shortly thereafter destroyed in an explosion interesting i said that left two rings said samos one of them was doubtless the tahari ring i said doubtless said samos i looked at the ring on the table do you think this is the fifth ring i asked no said samos i think the fifth ring would be too precious to be taken from the steel world on which it resides i do not think it would be risked on gor perhaps they have now learned how to duplicate the rings i ventured that seems to me unlikely for two reasons said samos first if the ring could be duplicated surely in the course of kur history particularly before the substantial loss of their technology and their retreat to the steel worlds it would have been secondly given the secretive nature of the rings inventor prasdak of the cliff of karrash i suspect there is an additional reason which mitigates against the dismantlement of the ring and its consequent reproduction the secret doubtless could be unraveled by those of the sardar i said what progress have they made with the ring from the tahari the tahari ring never reached the sardar said samos i learned this only a month ago i did not speak i sat behind the table stunned to whom i then asked did you entrust the delivery of the ring to the sardar to one of our most trusted agents said samos who i asked shaba the geographer of anango the explorer of lake ushindi the discoverer of lake ngao and the ua river said samos doubtless he met with foul play i said i do not think so said samos i do not understand i said this ring said samos indicating the ring on the table was found among the belongings of the girl in the tharlarion cell below it was with her when her ship was captured by bejar it surely then is not the fifth ring i said but what is its purport asked samos i shrugged i do not know i said look said samos he reached to one side of the table to a flat black box of the sort in which papers are sometimes kept in the box too there is an inkwell at its top and a place for quilled pens he opened the box below the portion containing the inkwell and concave surfaces for pens he withdrew from the box several folded papers letters he had broken the seal on them these papers too were found among the belongings of our fair captive below said samos what is their nature i asked there are passage papers here he said and a declaration of cosian citizenship which is doubtless forged too most importantly there are letters of introduction here and the notes for a fortune to be drawn on various banks in schendis street of coins to whom are the letters of introduction i asked and to whom are made out the notes one is to a man named msaliti said samos and the other is to shaba and the notes for the fortunes i asked they are made out to shaba said samos it seems then i said that shaba intends to surrender the ring to agents of kurii receive fees for this and then carry to the sardar this ring we have before us yes said samos but priestkings could surely determine as soon as the switch was depressed that the ring was false i said ah yes i said i fear so said samos i suspect the depression of the switch presumably to be accomplished in the sardar will initiate an explosion it is probable then i said that the ring is a bomb samos nodded he through my discussions with him and his work with the sardar was familiar with certain technological possibilities he had himself however like most goreans never witnessed firsthand an explosion i think it would be like lightning he said picking his words slowly priestkings might be killed i said distrust and dissension might be spread then between men and priestkings said samos and in the meantime the kurii would have regained the ring and shaba would be a rich man it seems so said samos the ship of course was bound for schendi i asked of course he said do you think the girl below knows much of this no said samos i think she was carefully chosen to do little more than convey the notes and the ring probably there are more expert kur agents in schendi to receive the ring once it is delivered perhaps even kurii themselves i said the climate would be cruel upon kurii he said but it is not impossible shaba is doubtless in hiding i said i do not think it likely i could locate him by simply voyaging to schendi probably he can be reached through msaliti said samos it could be a very delicate matter i said samos nodded shaba is a very intelligent man he said msaliti probably does not know where he is if shaba whom we may suppose contacts msaliti rather than the opposite suspects anything is amiss he will presumably not come forth the girl is then the key to locating shaba i said that is why you did not wish me to question her that is why she must not even know she has been in your power precisely said samos she must remain totally ignorant of the true nature of her current captivity it is known or would soon be known that her ship was taken by bejar i said it is doubtless moored prize at his wharfage even now she cannot be simply released and sent upon her way none would believe this all would suspect she was a decoy of some sort a lure to draw forth shaba we must attempt to regain the ring said samos or at worst prevent it from falling into the hands of the kurii shaba will want the notes for the fortunes i said kurii will want the false ring i think he or they or both will be very interested in striking up an acquaintance with our lovely prisoner below my thoughts too said samos it is known or will soon be known she was taken by bejar i said when his other women prisoners are put upon the block let her be put there with them only another woman to be sold they will be sold as slaves said samos of course i said let her too be sold as a slave i will have the iron ring removed from her throat said samos and have her tied in a slave sack sent to bejar i will attend her sale in disguise i said i will see who buys her it could be anyone said samos perhaps she will be bought by an urt hunter or an oar maker what then then she is owned by an oar maker or an urt hunter i said and we shall consider a new plan urt hunters swim slave girls ropes on their necks beside their boats in the dark cool water of the canals as bait for urts which as they rise to attack the girl are speared urt hunters help to keep the urt population in the canals manageable agreed said samos he handed me the ring on the table and the letters of introduction and notes you may need these he said in case you encounter shaba perhaps you could pose as a kur agent for he does not know you and obtain the true ring for the kurii notes the sardar could then be warned to intercept shaba with the false ring and deal as they will with him excellent i said these things will increase our store of possible strategies i placed the ring and the papers in my robes i am optimistic said samos i too i said but beware of shaba he said he is a brilliant man he will not be easily fooled samos and i stood up it is curious i said that the rings were never duplicated doubtless there is a reason said samos i nodded that was doubtless true we went toward the door of his hall but stopped before we reached the heavy door samos wished to speak captain said he yes captain said i do not go into the interior beyond schendi said samos that is the country of bila huruma i understand him to be a great ubar i said he is also a very dangerous man said samos and these are difficult times he is a man of vision i said and pitiless greed said samos but a man of vision i reminded him is he not intending to join the ushindi and ngao with a canal cut through the marshes which then might be drained work on such a project is already proceeding said samos that is vision i said and ambition of course said samos such a canal would be an inestimable commercial and military achievement the ua holding the secret of the interior flows into the ngao which by a canal would be joined with ushindi into ushindi flows the cartius proper the subequatorial cartius out of ushindi flow the kamba and the nyoka and those flow to thassa it would be an incredible achievement i marveled beware of bila huruma said samos i expect to have no dealings with him i said the pole and platform below on which is held prisoner our lovely guest said samos was suggested to me by a peacekeeping device of ella huruma in lake ushindi in certain areas frequented by tharlarion there are high poles criminals political prisoners and such are rowed to these poles and left there clinging to them there are no platforms on the poles i understand i said but i think you have nothing to fear said samos if you remain within the borders of schendi itself i nodded schendi was a free port administered by black merchants members of the caste of merchants it was also the home port of the league of black slavers but their predations were commonly restricted to the high seas and coastal towns well north and south of schendi like most largescale slaving operations they had the good sense to spare their own environs good luck captain said samos we clasped hands as we exited from his hall samos spoke to one of the guards outside the huge double doors linda he said yes captain said the guard and left moving down the hall the earth slave linda was not kept in the pens she was kept in the kennels off the kitchens in spite of this she wore only the common house collar too she was allotted a full share of domestic duties samos did not pamper his slaves even those who knelt often at his slave ring i thought of the girl below imprisoned on the tiny platform in the tharlarion cell she would have the ring on her neck removed and then be placed in a slave sack and taken to the house of bejar i supposed that bejar or the slaver to whom he sold her and the others would mark her slave how piteously and helplessly she had clung to the pole she had already begun to learn that gor was not earth i wish you well captain i said to samos i wish you well captain said he to me again we clasped hands and then i strode from him down the hallway toward the double gates leading from his house at the first of the two gates the one which consists of bars while awaiting its opening i glanced back samos was no longer in sight having gone to his chambers a guard was in the hallway with his spear the gate of bars was unlocked and i slipped through it closed and locked and i waited for the outer gate that of ironsheathed wood to be opened i glanced back again and i saw the slave linda naked on a leash being led to her master she saw me and looked down shyly i exited then through the second gate of the house of samos i had heard that she did the tile dance exquisitely i almost envied samos i decided i would have the dance taught to my own slaves i would be curious to learn which of them could perform it well and which brilliantly greetings captain said thurnock from the boat greetings thurnock i said i stepped down into the boat and took the tiller the boat was thrust off into the dark water and in moments we were rowing quietly toward my house i attend the market of vart the girl screamed fighting the sales collar and the position chain she tried to pull it from her throat the two male slaves to the right turned the crank of the windlass and she was drawn in her turn struggling before the men the men in the crowd regarded her curiously had she never been sold before she tried to turn away and cover herself her feet in the damp sawdust the inside of her left thigh was stained yellow as she had lost water in her terror the auctioneer did not strike her with his whip he merely took her arms and lifted them so that the position chain attached to each side of the sales collar lay across her upper arms then he had her clasp her hands behind the back of her neck so that the chain on each side of the collar was in the crook of her arms and she was exposed in such a way that she could be properly exhibited in a higher class market girls are usually fed a cathartic a few hours before the sale and forced to relieve themselves shortly before their sale a kettle passed down the line in the current market such niceties especially in large sales were seldom observed by the hair the auctioneer pulled her head up and back so that her features might be observed by the men another loot girl taken by our noble captain bejar in his brilliant capture of the blossoms of telnus called the auctioneer he was also the slaver vart once publius quintus of ar banished from that city and nearly impaled for falsifying slave data he had advertised a girl as a trained pleasure slave who as it turned out did not even know the eleven kisses the vart is a small sharptoothed winged mammal carnivorous which commonly flies in flocks a blondhaired blueeyed barbarian called the auctioneer who speaks little or no gorean untrained formerly free a purse not yet rent a thigh not yet kissed by the iron what am i offered a copper tarsk called a man from the floor a fellow who rented chains of work girls i hear one tarsk called the auctioneer do i hear more let us have the next girl called a man the slaves at the windlass tensed but the auctioneer did not tell them to move the chain removing the blond girl and bringing forth the next item on the chain surely i hear more called the auctioneer do i hear two tarsks i suppose he may have paid two or three tarsks for her himself to bejar the girl was beautiful but not as beautiful it was true as most gorean slave girls i did not think she would bring a high price unfortunately then almost anyone might buy her i looked about it seemed a common motley crowd for the house of vart where men came generally to buy cheap girls sometimes in lots at bargain prices his establishment was located in a warehouse near the docks i conjectured there were some two hundred buyers and onlookers present i wore the tunic and leather apron and cap of the metal worker look at her said the man beside me how ugly she is what a shetarsk a true shetarsk agreed another they had seen i gathered few earth girls they did not understand the effects of years of insidious pervasive antibiological conditioning their own culture perhaps because of the limitations imposed on it by priestkings who did not wish to be threatened or destroyed by an animal with which they shared a world had taken different turnings they would not understand a world in which dirty jokes had point a world in which a womans attractiveness was supposedly a function of the utilization of certain commercial products or a world in which men and women were taught that they were the same and in which they attempted to believe it and would hysterically insist it was true bravely ignoring the evidence of their reason senses and experience civilization may be predicated upon the denial of human nature it may also be predicated upon its fulfillment the first word that an earth baby learns is usually no the first word that a gorean baby learns is commonly yes the machine and the flower i suspect will never understand one another let us see another girl called yet another man a new girl cried others many women of course once under the helpless condition of slavery increase considerably in beauty this has to do primarily i think with psychological factors in particular with the destruction of neurotic patterns inculcated in the earth female of maleimitation and the concurrent necessity imposed upon her by the whip if necessary to reveal and manifest her deeper self that of a female on the other hand doubtless the dieting exercise instruction in cosmetics and adornment and the various forms of slave training are also not without their effect do i hear two tarsks asked the auctioneer if a woman truly is in her secret heart a mans slave how can any female who is not a mans slave be truly a woman and how can any woman who is not truly a woman be happy can a woman be free only when she is a slave is this not the paradox of the collar come masters kind sirs called the auctioneer can you not see the promise of this slender blond barbarian beauty there was laughter from the floor what a cheap slovenly man of business is our friend vart said the fellow next to me look he has not even had her branded add that into her price grumbled another at least you do not have to worry about that said a man to me i wore the garb of a metal worker usually girls if not marked by a slaver are marked in the shop of a metal worker i smiled the auctioneer was now calling off her measurements and her collar and wrist and anklering size he had jotted these down on her back with a redgrease marking stick will not an urt hunter give me at least two tarsks for her called out the auctioneer goodhumoredly but with some understandable exasperation i wished that either bejar or vart had had her branded it would be easier to keep track of her that way she is not worth tying at the end of a rope and using in the water as a bait for urts called out a man the fellow who had first suggested that she be removed from the sales position there was laughter perhaps you are right called out the auctioneer agreeably would an urt want her asked another man there was more laughter perhaps an urt laughed a man go down to the canals said another man see if you can get two tarsks from the urts there was again general laughter the auctioneer too seemed amused he apparently recognized that it was futile and a bit amusing to be attempting to get an interesting price on this particular bit of slave meat there were tears now and bitterness in the girls eyes i knew from her general attitudes and responses that she understood very little of what was transpiring and yet clearly she must understand that she was the butt of the laughter of the men who held her in contempt and scorned her who were not interested in her who had not bid hardly upon her who obviously wished her to be taken from their sight she was a poor slave she stood there in the collar with the position chain attached to each side of it the chain on each side over an upper arm held in the crook of her arms her hands clasped behind her neck i hate you she cried suddenly to them in english i hate you they of course did not understand her the hostility of her mien however was clear the auctioneer took handfuls of her long blond hair from the right side of her head rolled it into a ball between his palms and thrust it in her mouth she stood there she knew she must not spit out the hair she knew she was not then to speak i am afraid that you are almost worthless my dear said the auctioneer to her in gorean she looked down bitterly i knew this type of response the woman who fears she cannot please men then sometimes tends to feel hostility toward them perhaps turning her own rage and inward disappointment outward laying the blame upon them and developing the obvious defensive reactions of belittling sexuality and its significance and attempting interestingly to become manlike herself to be one with them though in an aggressive competitive manner often attempting to best them as though one of themselves since she was not found desirable as a woman she attempts to become a more successful man than the men who failed to note her attractiveness this type of response however however natural on earth in such a situation would not be feasible on gor in a slave gorean free women of course may do what they wish the slave girl on the other hand does not compete with the master but serves him the blondhaired girl might or might not hate men but on gor as a slave she would serve them and serve them well the woman who fears that she is unattractive to men of course is generally mistaken she need only learn to please men a woman who pleases men and pleases them on their own terms would on earth be a startling rarity an incredibly unusual treasure on gor of course she would be only another of hundreds of thousands of delicious slaves on gor a readiness to please men and an intention to do so and on their own terms is expected in any girl one buys should a girl prove sluggish in any respect it is simple to put her under discipline eventually of course a woman learns that to please a man on his own terms is the only thing that can ultimately fulfill her own deepest needs those of the owned submitting love slave i am afraid you are almost worthless my blueeyed blondhaired prize said the auctioneer to the girl she looked out dully bitterly at the crowd her hands clasped behind her neck hair from the right side of her bead looping up to her mouth i had little fear for her however her neurotic responses functions of her earth conditioning would have little place on gor they cannot be maintained on gor they would be broken she would learn slavery well like any woman the crowd watched the auctioneer who stood close by the girl i was curious however that kurii had brought her to gor she did not seem objectively of quite the same high quality of beauty as most of the wenches brought by kurii to gor either as agents or as simple immediate slaves the auctioneer made certain her hands were clasped tightly behind the back of her neck he actually took her hands in his and thrust them closely together she looked at him puzzled slightly frightened he stepped behind her i smiled she suddenly screamed and sobbed and gasped her hair wet expelled from her mouth she looked at the auctioneer in terror but dared not release her hands from the back of her neck he with one hand wadded together her hair and thrust it again in her mouth she must not cry out or speak in his right hand coiled he held the whip which he had removed from his belt a moment before he had administered to her the slavers caress with the heavy coils she shook her head wildly she tried to draw back but his left hand behind the small of her back held her in place she threw back her head shaking it wildly negatively then there was a spasm then she sobbed shuddering tensing herself the auctioneer then holding her brought the coils near her again she put her head back her eyes closed but he did not touch her then she opened her eyes looking up at the ceiling of the warehouse in which she was being sold still he did not touch her she whimpered then i saw her legs tense and move slight muscles in the thighs and calves she half rose on her toes still he did not touch her then i saw her with a sob thrust herself toward the coils but still he did not touch her then as she looked at him tears in her eyes he looking at her deigned to lift the coils against her piteous arched pleading body she then writhed at the chain sobbing her hands clenched behind her neck her teeth clenched on her own hair she tried to hold the whip between her thighs he then withdrew the whip and turned to the crowd smiling he fastened the whip at his belt what am i bid he asked the girl whimpered piteously he turned about and with his right hand open cuffed her as one cuffs a slave her head was struck upward and to the left there was a bit of blood at her lip which began to swell there were tears in her eyes she looked at him she was silent what am i bid asked the auctioneer four tarsks said a man six said another fifteen called out another sixteen said a man the girl shuddering standing as she had her hair in her mouth her hands behind her head put her head down miserably she did not dare to look even at the bidders who might own her she knew that her needs had betrayed her i smiled to myself the selection of this woman for service in the kurii cause now seemed clearer than it had before she like others doubtless when their political duties were finished would have been collared and silked and set to the task of learning to please masters i thought she would make in time a good slave she was already adequately beautiful and in time in bondage might become incredibly beautiful her responsiveness though not unusual for a slave girl was surely impressive for an unmarked earth girl in her first sale responsiveness of course is something that can increase and deepen in a woman and under the proper tutelage and discipline does so the female slave in the fullness of her womanhood and helplessness attains heights of passion from which the free woman in her pride and dignity is forever barred she is not a mans slave twentytwo tarsks called a man in the crowd twentyfour called another yes the responsiveness of the girl on sale had been impressive in some months in the proper collar and at the right slave ring i suspected she would become paga hot hot enough to serve even in the paga taverns of gor her head was down twentyseven tarsks called a man how shamed she was why was she so ashamed that she had sexual needs and was sensuously alive of course i reminded myself of course she was an earth girl twentyeight tarsks called a man the girls body shook with an uncontrollable sob her secret doubtless long hidden on earth that she had a deep latent sexuality had been ruthlessly and publicly exposed in a gorean market she had writhed and as a naked slave twentynine tarsks called a man she had writhed not only as a woman but as a slave her head was down her body shook for a moment i almost felt moved to pity then i laughed looking at her her responses had revealed her as a slave forty tarsks said a voice triumphantly it was the voice of procopius minor or little procopius who owned the four chains a tavern near pier sixteen to be distinguished from procopius major or big procopius who owned several such taverns throughout the city the four chains was a dingy tavern located between two warehouses procopius minor owned about twenty girls his establishment had a reputation for brawls cheap paga and hot slaves his girls served nude and chained each ankle and wrist ring had two staples each girls wrists were joined by about eighteen inches of chain and similarly for her ankles further each girls left wrist was chained to her left ankle and her right wrist to her right ankle this arrangement lovely on a girl produces the four chains from which the establishment took its name the fourchain chaining arrangement of course and variations upon it is well known upon gor four other paga taverns in port kar alone used it they could not of course given the registration of the name by procopius minor with the league of taverners use a reference to it in designating their own places of business these four taverns if it is of interest are the veminium the kailiauk the slaves of ar and the silver of tharna forty tarsks repeated procopius minor little procopius he was little it might be mentioned only in commercial significance compared to procopius major or big procopius big procopius was one of the foremost merchants in port kar paga taverns were only one of his numerous interests he was also involved in hardware paper wool and salt little procopius was not little physically he was a large portly fellow to be sure however procopius major was a bit larger even physically the girl looked up now sensing the cessation in the bidding the repeating of a bid the tone of the voice of procopius minor her hands were still behind the back of her neck she had not been given permission to remove them she looked out at procopius minor she shuddered she realized that he might soon own her totally i have heard a bid of forty tarsks said the auctioneer vart i supposed it would be good for the girl to serve for a time in a low paga house it is not a bad place for a girl to begin to learn something of the meaning of her collar do i hear another bid a higher bid called vart yes she would look well in chains kneeling to masters in a paga tavern my hand is open called vart shall i close my hand shall i close my hand he looked about well pleased he had never counted on getting as much as forty tarsks for the blond barbarian i will now close my hand he called do not close your hand said a voice all eyes turned toward the back a tall man stood there lean and black he wore a closely woven seamans aba red striped with white which fell from his shoulders this was worn over an anklelength white robe loosely sleeved embroidered with gold with a golden sash in the sash was thrust a curved dagger on his head he wore a cap on which were fixed the two golden tassels of schendi who is he asked the man next to me i do not know i said yes master asked the auctioneer is there another bid yes said the man yes master asked the auctioneer i take him to be a merchant captain said a man near me i nodded the conjecture was intelligent the fellow wore the white and gold of the merchant beneath a seamans aba it was not likely that a merchant would wear that garment unless he were entitled to it goreans are particular about such matters doubtless he owned and captained his own vessel what is his name and ship i asked i do not know said the man what is masters bid asked the auctioneer there was silence we looked at the man the girl too in the sales collar and position chain her hands behind her neck looked at him what is masters bid asked the auctioneer one tarsk said the man we looked at one another there was some uneasy laughter then there was again silence forgive me master then said the auctioneer master came late to the bidding we have already on the floor a bid of forty tarsks procopius turned about smiling one silver tarsk said the man aiii cried a man a silver tarsk asked the auctioneer procopius turned about again suddenly to regard the fellow in the back incredulously yes he said a silver tarsk i smiled to myself the slave on sale was not a silvertarsk girl there would be no more bidding i have a bid for a silver tarsk said vart is there a higher bid there was silence he looked to procopius procopius shrugged no he said i shall close my hand said the auctioneer he held his right hand open and then he closed it the girl had been sold the girl looked at the closed fist of the auctioneer with horror it was not hard to understand its import the auctioneer went to her and pulled the hair from her mouth then threw it back over her right shoulder he smoothed her hair then on both sides and in the back he might have been a clerk adjusting merchandise on a counter she seemed scarcely conscious of what he was doing she looked out fearfully on the man who had bought her the auctioneer turned to the buyer with whom has the house the honor of doing business he asked i am ulafi said the man captain of the palms of schendi we are truly honored said the auctioneer i knew ulafi of schendi only by reputation as a shrewd merchant and captain i had never seen him before he was said to have a good ship deliver the girl to my ship said ulafi at the pier of the red urt by dawn we will depart with the tide he threw a silver tarsk to the auctioneer who caught it expertly and slipped it into his pouch it will be done master promised the auctioneer the tall black then turned and left the warehouse which was the market of vart suddenly the girl her hands still behind the back of her neck threw back her head and screamed in misery i think it was only then that her consciousness had become fully cognizant of the import of what had been done to her she had been sold vart gestured to the slaves at the windlass and they turned its large twoman crank and the girl who had been sold was drawn from the sales area the next girl was a comely wench from tyros darkhaired and shapely at a word from vart she stood with her hands behind her neck arching her body proudly for the buyers i could see she had been sold before what occurred on the way to the pier of the red urt i hear the ringing of an alarm bar it was near the fifth hour it was still dark along the canals port kar seems a lonely place at such an hour i trod a walkway beside a canal my sea bag over my shoulder the air was damp here and there small lamps set in niches high in stone walls or lanterns hung on iron projections shed small pools of light on the sides of buildings and illuminated too in their secondary ambience the stones of the sloping walkway on which i trod one of many leading down to the wharves i could smell thassa the sea two guardsmen passing me lifted their lanterns tal i said to them and continued on my way i wore as i had the night before the garb of a metal worker i heard an urt splash softly into the water ahead of me and to my left i passed iron doors narrow in the walls these doors usually had a tiny observation panel in them which could be slid back the walls were sheer they were generally windowless until some fifteen feet above the ground yards and gardens and courts if they exist are generally within the house not outside it this is very general in gorean architecture but there were few gardens or courts in port kar it was a crowded city built up from the marshes themselves in the vosks delta and space was scarce and precious there were pilings along the walkway to which here and there small boats were moored the walkway itself varied from some five feet to a yard in width i had stayed at the sales in the warehouse of vart for a time after the sale of the blond barbarian i had not wished to leave immediately after her sale for that might have indicated had there been a curious observer present that that sale had been the one in which i had been interested the darkhaired shapely girl from tyros had gone for twentynine tarsks she had proved under varts touch a hot helpless slave and the bidding then had been quick and meaningful she had been purchased by procopius minor for the four chains he seemed well pleased with the buy she was hot and she had cost him not forty but only twentynine tarsks he had then i conjectured forgotten the blond barbarian tyros is a city enemy to port kar many men in port kar would enjoy having a girl of tyros weep herself slave in their arms she would make good money for procopius minor she had been an excellent buy a superb bargain he might even enjoy using her himself who was the girl who had been previously sold ah yes the blond barbarian purchased by ulafi of schendi the next two women sold had been a mother and daughter from cos they were sold to separate buyers as pot girls the mother brought sixteen tarsks and the daughter fourteen they were among the eleven women including the blond barbarian who had been sold by bejar to vart they had been taken in the capture of the blossoms of telnus the crew and male passengers of the blossoms of telnus had also been sold by bejar to vart but these had been auctioned by vart in the morning on the wharf blocks as work slaves i had then stayed for only two more sales and had then left those of a peasant girl blond from southwest of ar and a merchants daughter from asperiche the peasant girl brought eight tarsks the merchants daughter to her indignation brought only six she had not yet learned slave heat a strong master would teach it to her she would learn it or die frigidity is accepted by goreans only in free women slave fires of course lurk in every woman it is only a question of arousing them once the slave discovers her sexuality a venture in which the humiliated slave to her dismay is forced to participate to the fullest she can never again ignore it once she has begun to learn the orgasms of the slave girl she can never again be contented with anything less she is then a masters girl i beg for your touch master she whispers perhaps he will satisfy her perhaps he will not it is his whim he is the master i stopped on the walkway ahead some yards was a girl darkhaired lying on her belly on the walkway reaching with her hand down to the canal to fish out edible garbage she was barefoot and wore a brief brown rag i did not think she was a slave some free girls runaways vagabonds girls of no family or position live about port cities scavenging as they can begging stealing sleeping at night in crates and under bridges and piers they are called the sheurts of the wharves every once in a while there is a move to have them rounded up and collared but it seldom comes to anything i was not worried about the girl i was more alert to the fact that moments before two guardsmen had passed the rounds of guardsmen are generally randomized usually by the tossing of coins different combinations corresponding to different schedulings one of the most practical strategies for those who would avoid guardsmen of course is to follow them in their rounds i was very aware of the fact that i carried in my sea bag the ring which the blond barbarian had had on the blossoms of telnus and the notes bearing the signatures and seals of schendi bankers who had been made out to shaba the geographer of anango the explorer of lake ushindi and the discoverer of lake ngao and the mysterious ua river i thought these might bring him out of hiding with the tahari ring if i could not locate him by means of the blond earth girl who had been purchased by ulafi captain of the palms of schendi merchant too of that city the girl hearing my approach drew her legs up quickly under her and rose to her feet turning to meet me she smiled brightly she was pretty tal said she tal said i you are strong she said we were in the vicinity of the pier of the red urt it is not a desirable district i put down my sea bag she looked up at me it is dangerous for you here i said you should be home i have no home she said she traced an idle pattern on my left shoulder with her finger tip who would want to hurt a little sheurt she said what do you want i asked i was alert to the tiny sound behind me i will please you for a tarsk bit she said i did not speak she suddenly knelt before me i will please you as a slave girl if you wish she said when i want a slave girl i said i will have a real slave girl not a free woman pretending to be a slave girl she looked up at me angrily on your feet free woman i said she got up angrily she was not a slave why should i accord her the privilege of kneeling at my feet im hot and im pretty she said try me i touched her flanks they were good i then took her by the upper arms i looked into her eyes she lifted her lips to mine no she screamed wildeyed as i suddenly lifted her from her feet and spun about she knowing herself lifted helplessly into the path of the blow i dropped her inert body to one side you should take your breath i told him before you approach too you should have your arm raised early that the movement of the sleeve not be audible too you should have the girl in her diversion keep her eyes closed that could be natural enough and in that way you would not be reflected in the mirror of her eyes it had not been difficult to detect his approach even apart from the more obvious clues i had called to his attention the senses of a warrior are trained his life may depend on it with a cry of rage the man attacked i caught the club hand which was clumsy and twisting it dashed his face first into the walkway i then took him by the hair and thrust the side of his head into the wall he slumped down unconscious i took binding fiber from my sea bag and tied his wrists together behind his back and crossed and tied his ankles i then turned to the girl i tied her hands behind her back and then took her by the ankles and held her upside down thrusting her head and shoulders and upper body under the cold waters of the canal in a few seconds i pulled her up sputtering and sat her tied against the wall across from me she gasped for air she tried to clear water from her eyes she choked her hair and the rag she wore were wet she backed further against the wall drawing her legs up pressing her knees closely together she looked at me frightened please let me go she said dawn would be well glistening now over the marshes to the east it was still rather dark in the canal streets with the buildings on each side there was fog visible on the canals please let me go she said it will mean the collar for me do you recall what you said to me i asked shortly before i turned you about no she said oh i asked yes yes she said say it again i told her please she begged say it i said im hot and im pretty she stammered try me she said she swallowed hard very well i said i drew her to me by the ankles please let me go she said it will mean the collar for me oh oh then in moments she moaned and wept i forced her to yield well to the very limits of the free woman then i was finished with her she looked up at me have i pleased you she asked tears in her eyes yes i said let me go she said i took her ankles crossed and tied them then i threw her beside the man her head to his feet i tied her neck to his feet and her feet to his neck they would wait thus for the guardsmen they will banish him and collar me she said yes i said i knelt down on one knee beside her i took a tarsk bit from my pouch and thrust it in her mouth she was a free woman since i had no intent of enslaving her myself it seemed fit that i should pay her for her use she had asked as i recalled for a tarsk bit had i intended to keep her i might have simply raped her and then put the collar on her a slave has no recourse i rose to my feet and shouldering my sea bag whistling continued on toward the pier of the red urt where ulafis ship the palms of schendi was moored i soon hurried my steps for an alarm bar had begun to ring i heard steps running behind me too and i turned about a black seaman ran past me he too heading toward the wharves i followed him toward the pier of the red urt i recapture an escaped slave i book passage on a ship for schendi how long has she been missing i asked over an ahn said a man but only now have they rung the bar we stood in the vicinity of the high desk of the wharf praetor there seemed no reason to ring it earlier said the man it was thought she would be soon picked up by guardsmen or the crew of the palms of schendi she was to be shipped on that craft i asked yes said the man i suppose now her feet must be cut off is it her first attempt to escape asked another man i do not know said another why is there this bother about an escaped slave demanded a man his clothing torn and blood at his ear i have been robbed what are you doing about this be patient said the wharf praetor we know the pair we have been searching for them for weeks the praetor handed a sheet of paper to one of his guardsmen people were gathered around another guardsman stopped ringing the alarm bar it hung from a projection on a pole the pole fixed upright on the roof of a nearby warehouse be on the watch for an escaped female slave called the guardsman she is blondhaired and blueeyed she is barbarian when last seen she was naked i did not think it would take them long to apprehend her she was a fool to try to escape there was no escape for such as she yet she was unmarked and uncollared it might not prove easy to retake her immediately how did she escape i asked a fellow varts man said he delivered her to the wharf where he knelt her among the cargo to be loaded on the palms of schendi he obtained his receipt for her and then left he did not leave her tied hand and foot among the bales and crates for loading i asked no said the man but who either varts man or those of the palms of schendi would have thought it necessary i nodded there was reason in what he said inwardly i smiled she had simply left the loading area when no one was watching simply slipping away had she been less ignorant of gor she would not have dared to escape she did not yet fully understand that she was a slave girl she did not yet understand that escape was not permitted to such as she return the girl to the praetors station on this pier said the guardsman what of those who robbed me cried the fellow with the torn clothing and the blood behind his ear you are not the first said the praetor looking down at him from the high desk they stand under a general warrant who robbed you i asked the man i think there were two said the man there was a darkhaired sheurt in a brown tunic i was struck from behind apparently there is a male confederate she approached you engaging your attention i asked and then you when diverted were struck from behind yes said the fellow sourly i saw two individuals who may be your friends i said on the north walkway of the rim canal leading to the vicinity of this very pier we shall send two guardsmen to investigate said the praetor thank you citizen for this information they will be gone now said the man with the blood behind his ear perhaps not i said the praetor dispatched a pair of guardsmen who moved swiftly toward the rim canal be on the watch for an escaped female slave repeated the guardsman with the paper he spoke loudly calling out over the crowd i heard him adding to the available information new data had been furnished to him from a wharf runner who had her sales information in hand brought from the records of the house of vart this included however little more than her measurements and the sizes of the collar and wrist and ankle rings that would well fit her i went over to the edge of the pier some hundred yards or so away to where the palms of schendi was moored longshoremen bales and crates on their shoulders were filling her hold they were being supervised by the second officer it was now grayishly light a few ehn past dawn i could not yet see the golden rim of tortugor light upon the home stone rising in the east over the city are you bound for schendi i called to the officer yes said he looking up from his lading list i would take passage with you i said we do not carry passengers said he i can pay as much as a silver tarsk i said it did not seem well to suggest that i could afford more if worse came to worse i could book passage on another vessel it would not be wise to hire a ship for this would surely provoke suspicion similarly it would not be wise to take one of my own ships say the dorna or the tesephone south they might be recognized gorean seamen recognize ships with the same ease that they recognize faces this is common of course among seamen anywhere we do not carry passengers said the second officer i shrugged and turned away i would prefer of course to have passage on this ship for it would be on this ship that the girl when apprehended would be transported i did not wish to risk losing track of her i looked up to the stern castle of the palms of schendi there i saw her captain ulafi engaged in conversation with one whom i took to be the first officer they did not look at me i stood there for a few moments regarding the lines of the palms of schendi she was a mediumclass round ship with a keeltobeam ratio of about six to one that of the long ship is usually about eight to one she had ten oars to a side two rudders and two permanent lateenrigged masts most gorean ships were double ruddered the masts of round ships are usually permanently fixed those of long ships usually singlemasted are removed before battle most gorean ships are lateenrigged this permits sailing closer to the wind the long triangular sail incidentally is very beautiful i turned away from the ship i did not wish to be observed looking at it too closely i wore the garb of the metal workers according to the tide tables the first tide would be full at six ehn past the seventh ahn i wondered if ulafi would sail without the blondhaired barbarian i did not think so i hoped that he had not put out a silver tarsk for her simply because she had struck his fancy that would indeed be infuriating i was certain that he would wait until she was regained if he missed the tide however i did not think he would be pleased there seemed to be something going on now at the post of the wharf praetor so i returned to that area it is she said the fellow in the torn tunic with the blood behind his ear pointing at the small darkhaired girl she stood before the high desk of the praetor her wrists tied behind her back beside her his hands too bound behind him stood the fellow who had been her accomplice they were fastened together by the neck by a guardsmans neck strap the girl interestingly was stripped the brief brown tunic having been taken from her i had not removed it i had only thrust it up over her hips it did not seem likely to me that the guardsman either would have removed it as she was i presumed a free woman yet it was gone and she was naked we found them both trussed like vulos laughed a guardsman who could do such a thing asked a man it was not guardsmen said a guardsman we would have brought them in it seems they picked the wrong fellow to waylay said a man it is she said the fellow with the blood behind his ear she is the one who diverted me while her fellow he i suppose struck me he pointed then to the man the girl shook her head negatively it seemed she wanted to speak what do you have in your mouth girl asked the praetor one of the guardsmen opened her mouth not gently and retrieved the coin a rather large one a tarsk bit ten such coins make a copper tarsk a hundred copper tarsks make a silver tarsk the praetor placed the coin on his desk the surface of which was some seven feet high below the low solid wooden bar the height of the praetors desk he on the high stool behind it permits him to see a goodly way up and down the wharves also of course one standing before the desk must look up to see the praetor which psychologically tends to induce a feeling of fear for the power of the law the wooden bar before the desks front edge makes it impossible to see what evidence or papers the praetor has at his disposal as he considers your case thus you do not know for certain how much he knows similarly you cannot tell what he writes on your papers give me back my coin said the girl be silent said a guardsman she is the one who cooperated in the attack upon you asked the praetor indicating the bound girl yes said the man with blood behind his ear no cried the girl i have never seen him before in my life i see said the praetor he apparently was not unfamiliar with the girl ha snorted the man who had accused her how did you come to be helpless and tied beside the canal inquired the praetor the girl looked about wildly we were set upon by brigands robbed and left tied she said there was laughter you must believe me she said i am a free woman examine the pouch of the man said the praetor it was opened by a guardsman who sifted his hands through coins the girl looked startled at the pouch she had apparently not understood that it had contained as much as it did her small hands pulled futilely angrily at the binding fiber which restrained them it seems that the fellow who robbed you smiled the praetor neglected to take your pouch the bound man said nothing he glared sullenly downward he also left you a tarsk bit said the praetor to the girl it was all i could save she said lamely there was more laughter i was not robbed said the bound man but i was unaccountably from behind struck down i was then tied to this little sheurt her guilt is well known i gather on the wharves clearly enemies have intended to unjustly link me to her guilt turgus she cried i have never seen her before in my life he said turgus she cried no turgus did you see me strike you asked the fellow who had been addressed as turgus no said the fellow who had been struck no i did not it was not i said the bound man unbind me said he then to the praetor set me free for i am innocent it is clear i am the victim of a plot he told me what to do she said he told me what to do who are you you little slut asked the bound man it is obvious he said to the praetor that this sheurt whoever she is wishes to implicate me in her guilt that it will go easier on her i assure you smiled the praetor it will not go easier on her my thanks officer said the man the girl crying out with rage tried to kick at the man tied beside her a guardsman struck her on the right thigh with the butt of his spear and she cried out in pain if you should attempt to do that again my dear said the praetor your ankles will be tied and you will hear the rest of the proceedings while lying on your belly before the tribunal yes officer she said what is your name asked the praetor of the girl sasi she said lady sasi he asked yes she said i am free there was laughter she looked about angrily bound i did not think she would need be worried much longer about her freedom usually smiled the praetor a free woman wears mere than binding fiber and a neck strap my gown was taken when i was tied she said it was torn from me who took it asked the praetor a casual male curious to see your body a girl took it she cried angrily a blond girl she was naked then she took my garment then i was naked find her if you wish to be busy with matters of the law i was the victim of theft it was stolen from me my garment you should be hunting her the little thief not holding me here i am an honest citizen there was more laughter may i be freed my officer asked the bound man a mistake has been made the praetor turned to two guardsmen go to where you found these two tied he said i think our missing slave will be found in the garment of the sheurt two guardsmen left immediately i thought the praetors conjecture was a sound one on the other hand obviously the girl would not be likely to linger in the place where she had stolen the sheurts brief miserable rag still perhaps her trail could be found in that area i demand justice said the girl you will receive it lady sasi said the praetor she turned white at least she will not have to be stripped for the iron said a fellow near me grinning the girl moaned the praetor then addressed himself to the fellow who had the dried blood caked behind his left ear it was dried in his hair too on the left side of his head is this female identified as the lady sasi she who detained you when you were attacked asked the praetor it is she he said i never saw him before she wept it is she he repeated i only wanted to beg a tarsk bit she said i did not know he was going to strike you why did you not warn him of the mans approach behind him asked the praetor i didnt see the man approaching she said desperately but you said you didnt know he was going to strike him said the praetor therefore you must have seen him please let me go she said i was not seen to strike the man said the fellow whom the girl had identified as turgus i claim innocence there is no evidence against me do what you will with the little slut but set me free the girl put down her head miserably please let me go she begged i was robbed of a golden tarn said the fellow with the blood at the side of his head there is a golden tarn in the pouch said a guardsman on the golden tarn taken from me said the man i had scratched my initials bata shu bem shandar and on the reverse of the coin the drum of tabor the guardsman lifted the coin to the praetor it is so said the praetor the bound man suddenly irrationally struggled he tried to throw off his bonds the girl cried out in misery jerked choking from her feet then two guardsmen held the fellow by the arms he is strong said one of the guardsmen the girl gasping regained her feet then she stood again necklinked to him beside him his fellow prisoner the coin was planted in my pouch he said it is a plot you are an urt turgus she said to him an urt it is you who are the sheurt he snarled you have both been caught said the praetor beginning to fill out some papers we have been looking for you both for a long time i am innocent said the bound man how do you refer to yourself asked the praetor turgus he said the praetor entered that name in the papers he then signed the papers he looked down at turgus how did you come to be tied he asked several men set upon me he said i was struck from behind i was subdued it does not appear that you were struck from behind smiled the praetor the face of turgus was not a pretty sight as i had dashed it into the stones and had then struck the side of his head against the nearby wall is the binding fiber on their wrists from their original bonds as you found them asked the praetor of one of the guardsmen it is he said examine the knots said the praetor they are capture knots said the guardsman smiling you made a poor choice of one to detain my friends said the praetor they looked at one another miserably their paths had crossed that of a warrior they now stood bound before the praetor turgus of port kar said the praetor in virtue of what we have here today established and in virtue of the general warrant outstanding upon you you are sentenced to banishment if you are found within the limits of the city after sunset this day you will be impaled the face of turgus was impassive free him he said turgus was cut free and turned about moving through the crowd he thrust men aside suddenly he saw me his face turned white and he spun about and fled i saw one of the black seamen the one who had passed me on the north walkway of the rim canal when i had been descending toward the pier looking at me curiously the girl looked up at the praetor the neck strap now that turgus was freed of it looped gracefully up to her throat held in the hand of a guardsman her small wrists were still bound behind her back she seemed very small and helpless before the high desk please let me go she said i will be good the lady sasi of port kar said the praetor in virtue of what we have here today established and in virtue of the general warrant outstanding upon her must come under sentence please my officer she begged i am now going to sentence you he said please she cried sentence me only to a penal brothel the penal brothel is too good for you said the praetor show me mercy she begged you will be shown no mercy he said she looked up at him with horror you are sentenced to slavery he said no no she screamed one of the guards cuffed her across the mouth snapping her head back there were tears in her eyes and blood at her lip were you given permission to speak asked the praetor no no she wept stammering forgive memaster let her be taken to the nearest metal shop and branded said the praetor then let her be placed on sale outside the shop for five ehn to be sold to the first buyer for the cost of her branding if she is not sold in five ehn then take her to the public market shelves and chain her there taking the best offer which equals or exceeds the cost of her branding the girl looked up at the praetor the strap in the hand of the guardsman grew taut at her throat this tarsk bit said the praetor lifting the coin which had been taken from her mouth earlier is now confiscated and becomes the property of the port this was appropriate slaves own nothing it is rather they who are owned the girl the new slave was then dragged stumbling away from the tribunal i noted that ulafi captain of the palms of schendi and his first officer were now standing near me in the crowd they were looking at me i made my way toward them i would book passage on the palms of schendi i told them you are not a metal worker said ulafi to me quietly i shrugged i would book passage i said we do not carry passengers he said then he and his first officer turned away i watched them go the praetor was now conversing with the fellow bem shandar from tabor papers were being filled in these had to do with the claims bem shandar was making to recover his stolen money captain i called to ulafi he turned the crowd was dispersing i could pay a silver tarsk for passage i told him you seem desperate to leave port kar said he perhaps i told him we do not carry passengers said he he turned away his first officer followed him i went to a guardsman near the praetor station what efforts are being mace to recover the lost slave i asked are you with the palms of schendi he asked i hope to book passage on that ship i said i fear the captain will delay his departure until she is recovered i was sure this was the case we are conducting a search said the guardsman she may be wearing the garment of a sheurt i said that is known to us citizen said he i myself said a nearby guardsman stopped a girl answering the description one in the torn rag of a sheurt but when i forced her to reveal her thighs she was unmarked where did you find such a girl i asked near the spice pier he said my thanks guardsman said i it seemed to me that the blond girl might well consider various strategies for eluding capture i did not think she would be likely to flee east along the canal walkways for these were relatively narrow and on them between the buildings and the canal she might be easily trapped also though this would not figure in her thinking she could on the north east and south be trapped against the delta walls or at the marsh gates i did not think it likely she would risk stealing a boat even if she could handle a small craft which i doubted for she was an earth girl probably from an urban area the risk of discovery would be too great also though she did not know it a sheurt in a boat would surely provoke instant suspicion where would such a girl obtain a boat if she had not stolen it too it would given the construction of the buildings of port kar be difficult to attain the roof of one from the outside of the building i did not think she would try to gain admittance to a building she would probably then in my opinion try to find her way to markets or stay about the wharves the markets were for the most part save the wharf markets deeper in the city i did not think she would reach them or know how to find them she was then probably in the vicinity of the wharves here she would presumably attempt to conceal herself she might hide in various ways obvious ways of hiding would be to conceal herself among the boxes and bales at the wharves to creep into a crate or barrel or to cover herself with sheets of sail canvas or with heavy coils of mooring rope guardsmen i was certain would examine such possibilities systematically too a sheurt found in such a place it not being night would surely be viewed as a girl in hiding she would presumably then be tied and taken to the praetor perhaps she is wanted for something i was now in the vicinity of the spice pier i did not think my quarry would elect an obvious way of hiding one in which she if found would be immediately exposed as a fugitive she was doubtless highly intelligent she had been chosen as a kur agent i seized a darkhaired sheurt by the arm let me go she screamed i have done nothing where do the sheurts band i asked let me go she cried i shook her oh oh she cried i then stopped shaking her i held her by the arms her toes barely touching the ground she was then quiet looking up at me her eyes were frightened i saw she was ready to be obedient there are some girls behind the paga taverns on the northern shore of the ribbons alley she said i released her and she sank to her knees gasping the ribbon is one of port kars betterknown canals a narrower canal somewhat south of it is called the ribbons alley it was a bit past dawn and the paga taverns backing on the smaller canal would be throwing out their garbage from the preceding night sheurts sometimes gather at such places for their pick of the remnants of feasts it would be less than an ahn until the fullness of the tide i quickly crossed two bridges leading over canals each joining the sea then i walked eastward and took a left and a right and crossed another small bridge i was then on the northern shore of the ribbons alley the ribbons alley like most small canals and many of the larger canals does not join the sea directly but only by means of linkages with other canals the larger canals in port kar incidentally have few bridges and those they have are commonly swing bridges which may be floated back against the canals side this makes it possible for merchant ships round ships with permanently fixed masts to move within the city and from the military point of view makes it possible to block canals and also when drawn back isolate given areas of the city by the canals which function then as moats the swing bridges are normally fastened back except from the eighth to the tenth ahn and from the fifteenth to the seventeenth ahn most families in port kar own their own boats these boats are generally shallowdrafted narrow and singleoared the one oar being used to both propel and guide the boat even children use these boats there are of course a variety of types of craft in the canals ranging from ramships harbored in the courts of captains to the coracles of the poor like leather tubs propelled by the thrusting of a pole along the sides of the major canals there are commonly hundreds of boats moored these are usually covered at night i saw her with several other girls behind the rear court of the silver collar they were fishing through wire trash containers these had been left outside until later when the girls had finished with them when the residues would be thrown into the canals it was not an act of pure kindness on the part of the attendants at the paga tavern that the garbage had not been flung directly into the canals i looked at the girls they were all comely there were seven of them there not including the one in whom i was interested they wore rags of various sorts and colors they had good legs they were all barefoot i saw the blondhaired barbarian standing back she apparently was repulsed by the garbage she did not wish to touch it the other girls paid her no attention except for her failure to exhibit interest in the garbage she might have been only one sheurt among the others she was as pretty and as dirty as the rest suddenly she saw me for an instant i saw she was frightened then she doubtless reassured herself that i could not know her she was after all only another sheurt her thighs were unmarked she went then as not noticing me to the basket of garbage she tried to saunter as a sheurt steeling herself she thrust her hand into the fresh wet garbage she looked up at me she saw i was still watching her in her hand there was a half of a yellow gorean pear the remains of a half moon of verr cheese imbedded in it she watching me lifted it toward her mouth i did not think it would taste badly i saw she was ready to vomit suddenly her wrist was seized by the girl a tall lovely girl some four inches taller than she in a brief white rag who stood with her at the basket who are you demanded the girl in the white rag you are not one with us she took the pear from her with the verr cheese in it you have not laid with the paga attendants for your garbage she said get out any woman even a free woman if she is hungry enough will do anything the paga attendants knew this get out said the girl in the white rag not unrelieved though i do not think she understood much of what was said to her the blond barbarian backed away she reacted then despite herself with momentary horror as the girl in the white rag bit thoughtlessly into the pear with verr cheese then remembering herself she tried to look disappointed get out said the girl in the white rag this is our territory the other girls now too belligerently began to gather around get out said the girl in the white rag or we will tie you and throw you into the canal the blondhaired barbarian backed away not challenging them the girls then returned to the garbage the blondhaired girl looked at me she did not know which way to go she did not wish to pass me but yet on the other hand she did not wish to leave a vicinity where the sheurts were common the buildings were on one side the canal on the other then she began to walk toward me to pass me she tried to walk as a sheurt she came closer and closer she tried not to look at me then when she was quite close to me she looked into my eyes then she looked down i think she was not used to seeing how gorean men looked at women at least slaves and low women such as sheurts assessing them for the furs and the collar then she looked boldly up at me brazenly trying to pretend to be bored and casual then she tossed her head and walked past me i watched her walk past me yes i thought she would make a good slave i began to follow her some twenty or thirty feet behind her surely this made her nervous for she was clearly aware of my continued nearness surely she must have suspected and fearfully that i knew who she was but she could not know this for certain behind us we heard two girls squabbling over garbage contesting desirable scraps from the wire basket i would let her continue on her way she was going in the direction which i would take her in a few moments beside one of the canals leading down to the wharves in the vicinity of the spice pier we came on four sheurts they were on their bellies beside the canal fishing for garbage the blondhaired girl joined them her legs and ankles were very nice i knew she was intensely aware of my presence boldly she reached out into the water and picked up the edible rind of a larma she looked at me then she bit into it and then tiny bite by tiny bite she forced herself to chew and eat it she swallowed the last bit of it i had wanted her to eat garbage out of the canal it would help her to learn that she was no longer on earth i would now capture her i wished ulafi if possible to sail with the tide i busied myself in the sea bag and not obviously drew forth a small strip of binding fiber then i drew the bag shut by its cords the girl had risen to her feet and looking at me and tossing her head turned away i caught up with her quickly took her by the back of the neck and shoving thrust her stumbling running obliquely against the wall to my right i tossed the sea bag to her left as i had thrown her to the wall it would be most natural for her to bolt to the left she stumbled over the sea bag and half fell then i had her left ankle in my left hand and her right ankle in my right hand i dragged her back towards me on her belly i then knelt across her body and jerked her small hands behind her i tied them there a small fist struck me let her go cried a girl i felt hands scratching at me small fists pounded at me the four girls who had been fishing for garbage in the canal leaped upon me let her go cried one you cant simply take us cried another we are free free cried another i stood up throwing them off me i cuffed two back and two others crouched ready to leap again to attack i stood over the blond girl one leg on each side of her she lay on her belly her hands tied behind her another girl leaped toward me and i struck her to one side with the back of my hand she reeled away and sank to her knees looking at me i think she had never been struck that hard before her hand was at her mouth blood between the fingers the other girl who too had been ready to attack backed now uneasily away she did not wish to come within reach of my arm let her go said the leader of the four girls you cant just take us we are free free we will call a guardsman cried another i grinned how delightful are women how weak they are how fit they are to be made slaves i am sorry i struck you as hard as i did i told the girl i had last struck i lost my patience i said i am sorry she after all was not a slave she was a free woman slaves of course may be struck as long and as hard as one wishes the girl between my feet a slave would learn that free her said the leader of the girls pointing to the blondhaired barbarian helpless between my feet you cannot just take her said another girl she is a free woman do not fret your heads about her my pretty little sheurts i said she is not a free woman she is an unmarked slave escaped from ulafi of schendi is it true asked the leader of the sheurts yes i said follow me if you will to the praetor station where this fact may be made clear to you are you a slave asked the leader of the girls to the girl between my feet she does not speak gorean i said or much of it i do not think she understands you the girl between my feet was crying if she is a slave said one of the girls she had best learn gorean quickly i thought that was true i hope for your sake said the leader of the sheurts to the girl that you are not a slave then she said to the other girls find pieces of rope are we going to the praetor station asked one of the girls uneasily of course said the leader i do not want to go to the praetor station said one of the girls we have done nothing said the leader we have nothing to fear there are men there said one of the girls we have men to fear said another we are going said the leader determinedly i picked up the earthgirl slave and threw her over my shoulder she squirmed helplessly crying i picked up my sea bag then and the girl on my shoulder the sea bag in my left hand made my way toward the pier of the red urt are her thighs marked asked the praetor no said a guardsman he had already made this determination the girl stood her hands bound behind her in the brief rag of the sheurt before the tribunal of the praetor the neck strap of a guardsman was on her throat is this your slave asked the praetor of ulafi of schendi yes said he how do i know she is a slave asked the praetor her body her movements do not suggest that she is a slave she seems too tight too cold too rigid to be a slave she was free captured by bejar in his seizure of the blossoms of telnus said ulafi she is new to her condition is bejar present asked the praetor no said a man bejar had left the port yesterday to again try his luck upon gleaming thassa the sea her measurements exactly fit those of the slave said a guardsman he lifted the tape measure marked in horts which had been applied but moments before to the girls body the praetor nodded this was excellent evidence the girls height ankles wrists throat hips waist and bust had been measured she had even been thrown on a grain scale and weighed the praetor looked down at the girl he pointed to her kajira he asked kajira she shook her head vigorously that much gorean she at least understood she denied being a slave girl the praetor made a small sign to one of the guardsmen leash said the fellow suddenly harshly behind the girl in gorean she jumped startled and cried out frightened but she did not as a reflex lift her head turning it to the left nor did the muscles in her upper arms suddenly move as though thrusting her wrists behind her to await the two snaps of the slave bracelets nadu snapped the guard but the girl had not involuntarily begun to kneel i have her slave papers here said ulafi delivered with her this morning by varts man he handed them to the praetor she does not respond as a slave because she has not yet learned her slavery said ulafi she has not yet learned the collar and the whip the praetor examined the papers in ar slaves are often fingerprinted the prints are contained in the papers does anyone know if this is ulafis slave asked the praetor i did not wish to speak for i would then have revealed myself as having been at the sale i preferred for this to be unknown the four sheurts with which the blondhaired barbarian had fished for garbage in the canal stood about she should have been marked said the praetor she should have been collared i have a collar here said ulafi lifting a steel slave collar it was a shipping collar it had five palms on it and the sign of schendi the shackle and scimitar the girl who wore it would be clearly identified as a portion of ulafis cargo i wish to sail with the tide said ulafi in less than half an ahn it will be full i am sorry said the praetor has not vart been sent for asked ulafi to confirm my words he has been sent for said the praetor from some eighty or so yards away from the tiny shop of a metal worker i heard a girl scream i knew the sound a girl had been marked she who had been the lady sasi the little sheurt who had been the accomplice of turgus of port kar had been branded i am afraid we must release this woman said the praetor looking down at the girl it is unfortunate as she is attractive test her for slave heat suggested a man that is not appropriate said the praetor if she is free make her squirm said the man see if she is slave hot no said the praetor the praetor looked at the girl he looked at ulafi i am afraid i must order her release he said no said ulafi wait said a man it is vart the girl shrank back miserably her hands tied behind her back the neck strap on her throat before vart who had pushed through the crowd do you know this girl asked the praetor of vart of course said vart she is a slave sold last night to this captain he indicated ulafi of schendi i got a silver tarsk for her the praetor nodded to a guardsman he thrust the girl down to her knees she was in the presence of free men with the neck strap he pulled her head down and tied it down fastening it to her ankles by means of the neck strap the leather between her neck and ankles which were now crossed and bound was short and taut her rag the brown torn tunic of the sheurt stolen from she who had been sasi was then cut from her she knelt bound then and naked in one of several gorean submission positions the slave is awarded to ulafi of schendi ruled the praetor there were cheers from the men present and gorean applause the striking of the left shoulder with the right hand my thanks praetor said ulafi receiving back the slave papers from the magistrate slave slave screamed the leader of the sheurts to the bound girl slave slave they cried to think we let you fish garbage with us when you were only a slave cried the leader then the sheurts who had accompanied me to the station of the praetor kicking and striking with their ropes fell upon the bound slave she wept kicked and struck slave slave they cried get back called the praetor angrily to them get back or we will collar you all the girls swiftly shrank back fearfully but they continued to look with hatred on the slave the blond girl tried to make herself even smaller and more submissive that she be not more abused she sobbed she had had a taste of the feelings of free women towards a slave which she was captain ulafi said the praetor yes praetor said ulafi have her marked before you leave port he said yes praetor said ulafi he turned to his first officer make ready to leave port he said we have twenty ahn yes captain said the man bring an ankle rack said ulafi to one of the guardsmen one was brought put her in it said ulafi the guardsman removed his neck strap from her throat freeing too her ankles he untied her hands lifting her under the stomach he held her ankles near the rack another guardsman placed her ankles in the semicircular openings in the bottom block and then swung shut the top block with its matching semicircular openings over them he secured the top block hinged at the left to the bottom block with a metal bolt on a chain thrust through the staple on the lower block over the hasp swung down from the upper block the guardsman who had held the girl then ceased to support her she made a little cry the weight of her upper body was then on the palms of her hands her arms stiff her ankles were locked in the rack this helped to support her weight her ankles protruded behind the rack her feet were small and pretty she looked about helplessly bring the scimitar of discipline said ulafi this was brought by a guardsman ulafi showed the heavy curved blade to the girl she looked at it with horror you should not have run away little white slave he said no no she said in english he went behind her and gently that be not cut her laid the blade upon her ankles no no she cried please dont please dont i will be good i will be good she tried to turn her head to look behind her i will not run away again she cried please please she whimpered do not cut off my feet ulafi handed the scimitar to one of the guardsmen he then went to the girls head taking the dagger from his sash she was trembling in misery ulafi pointed to the high desk of the praetor then he looked at her kajira he asked the girl had lied before the desk of the praetor she had denied being a kajira a slave girl she twisted her head upward toward the praetors desk forgive me forgive me she begged kajira asked ulafi yes yes she sobbed then she cried out la kajira la kajira this was a bit of gorean known to her i am a slave girl ulafi with his dagger but not cutting her put it first to her right ear and then to the side of her small nose and then to the left ear dont hurt me she begged im sorry i lied forgive me forgive me la kajira la kajira ulafi stood up replacing the dagger in his sash the girl had now learned that her feet might be cut off for running away that her ears and nose might be cut from her for lying she was still an ignorant girl of course but she now knew a little more of what it might be to be a slave on gor release her from the rack said ulafi the rack was opened and the girl collapsed shuddering on the wharf tie her hands and fasten her at a dock ring said ulafi to his second officer and two seamen one of whom was the fellow who had passed me on the walkway of the rim canal on the way to the pier of the red urt then whip her said ulafi then bring her to the shop of the metal worker i shall await you there bring too a pole and cage to the shop yes captain said the second officer come with me if you would said ulafi to me i followed him to the shop of the metal worker outside the shop stripped weeping chained by the neck to a ring freshly branded was the girl who had been the lady sasi of port kar a guardsman stood near her if she was not soon sold for the cost of her branding she would be taken and put on the public shelves large flat steps leading down to the water near where the central canal meets thassa the sea she was a cheap slave but she was pretty i did not think she should have attempted to inconvenience honest citizens when she saw me she tried to cover herself and crouch small i smiled did she not know she was branded heat an iron said ulafi to the metal worker a brawny fellow in a leather apron tal said the man to me tal said i to him we always keep an iron hot said the metal worker but he did turn to his assistant a lad of some twelve years heat the coals said he to him the lad took a bellows and opening and closing it forced air into the conical forge the handles of some six irons their heads and a portion of their shafts buried in the coals could be seen i looked out the door of the shop i could see the girl about one hundred and fifty yards away her wrists crossed and bound before her tied by the wrists to a heavy ring at the side of the pier she knelt then the first stroke of the whip hit her she screamed then she could scream no more but was twisting gasping on her stomach and side and back under the blows of the whip i think she had not understood before what it might mean truly to he whipped men passed her going about their business the disciplining of a slave girl on gor is not that unusual a sight i have five brands said the metal worker the common kajira brand the dina the palm the mark of treve the mark of port kar we have a common girl to brand said ulafi let it be the common kajira brand i could see that the girl had now been unbound from the ring she could apparently not walk one of the seamen had thrown her over his shoulder and was bringing her toward the shop she was in shock i think she had not realized what the whip could do to her yet the beating had been merciful and brief i doubt that she was struck more than ten or fifteen times i think the purpose of the whipping had been little more than to teach her what the whip could feel like a girl who knows what the whip can feel like strives to be pleasing to the master i could see the lateen sails on ulafis ship loosened on their yards men stood by the mooring ropes two sailors behind the second officer carried a slave cage it was supported on a pole the ends of which rested on their shoulders the girl was brought into the shop and stood in the branding rack which was then locked on her holding her upright the metal worker placed her wrists behind her in the wrist clamps adjustable each on their vertical flat metal bar he screwed shut the clamps she winced he then shackled her feet on the rotating metal platform left thigh or right thigh he asked left thigh said ulafi slave girls are commonly branded on the left thigh sometimes they are branded on the right thigh or lower left abdomen the metal worker turned the apparatus spinning the shaft with its attached circular metal platform the girls left thigh now faced us it was an excellent thigh it would take the mark well the metal worker then with a wheel tightening it locked the device in place so that it could not turn i looked at the girls eyes she hardly knew what was being done to her the metal worker drew out an iron and looked at it soon he said putting it back i looked at the girl she had tried to run away she had lied at the praetors desk yet her feet had not been removed her nose and ears had not been cut from her she had been shown incredible mercy she had only been whipped her transgressions of course had been first offenses and she was only an ignorant barbarian i think now however she clearly understood that gorean men are not permissive and that her second offenses in such matters would not be likely to be regarded with such lenience she is in shock or half in shock i said yes said the metal worker she should be able to feel the mark he took the girl by her hair and by it cruelly shook her head then he slapped her sharply twice she whimpered may i i asked i pointed to a bucket of water nearby used in tempering surely said the metal worker i threw the cold water over the girl who shuddering and sputtering pulled back in the branding rack she looked at me frightened but her eyes were now clear she twisted wincing she could now feel the pain of the whipping which she had endured she sobbed but she was no longer numb or in shock she was now a fully conscious slave ready for her branding the iron is ready said the metal worker it was a beautiful iron and white hot ulafi threw the metal worker a copper tarsk my friend here said ulafi indicating me will use the iron i looked at him he smiled you are of the metal workers are you not he asked perhaps i smiled he had told me earlier that i was not of the metal workers we are ready to sail said ulafis first officer who had come to report good said ulafi i donned leather gloves and took the iron from the metal worker who cheerfully surrendered it he assumed i was because of my garb of his caste ulafi watched me to see what i would do i held the iron before the girl that she might see it she shrank back no no she whimpered please dont touch me with it the girl is commonly shown the iron that she may understand its might its heat and meaning please no she cried i looked upon her i did not then think of her as an agent of kurii i saw her only as a beautiful woman fit for the brand she tried unsuccessfully to struggle she could move her wrists her upper body and feet somewhat but she could not move her thighs at all they were because of the construction of the branding rack held perfectly immobile they would await the kiss of the iron please no she whimpered then i branded her an excellent mark said ulafi while she still sobbed and screamed the metal worker freed her wrists of the clamps ulafi put her immediately in slave bracelets braceleting her hands behind her that she not tear at the brand the metal worker then freed her thighs of the rack and she sank sobbing to her knees he freed her ankles of the shackles which had held them at the circular metal platform ulafi then pushing her head down fastened the sturdy steel shipping collar on her throat snapping it shut behind the back of her neck it had five palms on it and the sign of schendi the shackle and scimitar put her in the cage and load her said ulafi the girl was then taken braceleted and thrust into the tiny slave cage which was then locked shut she knelt sobbing in the cage the two sailors then lifted the cage on its poles and kneeling she was lifted within it i looked at her i saw in her eyes that she had begun to suspect what it might mean to be a slave girl she was carried to the ship i did not think she would now escape i thought now she could be used easily to help locate shaba the geographer of anango the equatorial explorer in my sea bag were the notes for him made out to bankers of schendi in my sea bag too was the false ring which the girl had carried i am grateful to you for having apprehended the slave said ulafi to me it was nothing i said you also marked her superbly he said doubtless in time she will grow quite proud of that brand i shrugged captain said i yes said he i would still like to book passage with you to schendi i said he smiled you are welcome to do so he said thank you i said it will cost you a silver tarsk he said oh i said he shrugged i am a merchant he explained i gave him a silver tarsk and he turned about and went down to the ship i wish you well i said to the metal worker i wish you well said he to me i was pleased that i had branded women before i wondered how much ulafi knew i then left the shop of the metal worker outside i saw the guardsman unchaining the girl who had been the sheurt sasi her hands were now bound before her body and she already had his strap on her throat you did not sell her i asked who would want a sheurt he asked i am going to take her now to the public shelves looking at me the small lovely darkhaired girl drew back what do you want for her i asked it cost a copper tarsk to brand her he said i looked at her she looked at me and trembled and shook her head negatively i threw him a copper tarsk she is yours he said he took his strap off her throat and unbound her hands submit i told her she knelt before me back on her heels arms extended head down between her arms wrists crossed as though for binding i submit to you master she said i tied her hands together she then lowered her bound wrists i pulled up her head i held before her an opened collar withdrawn from my sea bag i had had one prepared can you read i asked her no master she said it says i said i am the girl of tarl of teletus yes master she said i then collared her i had thought that some wench probably one to be purchased in schendi would have been a useful addition to my disguise as an aid in establishing and confirming my pretended identity as a metal worker from the island of teletus this little wench though now locked in my collar i thought would serve the purpose well there was no particular reason to wait to schendi before buying a girl besides the collar on her might help to convince ulafi who seemed to me a clever and suspicious man that whatever i might be i was a reasonably straightforward and honest fellow i traveled with a girl who wore a name collar are there papers on her i asked the guardsman no said the guardsman most gorean slaves do not have papers the brand and collar are deemed sufficient i pulled the little slave to her feet and pointed out the palms of schendi do you see that ship i asked yes she said run there as fast as your little legs will carry you i said and tell them to cage you yes master she said and ran sobbing toward the ship i then shouldered my sea bag and followed her a moment after i had trod the gangplank it was drawn up the railing was shut and fastened a sailor thrust the small darkhaired slave into a small cage and snapped shut the padlock securing it it was next to another cage that which contained the blond barbarian the darkhaired girl looked at her startled you she said the blond girl drew back as she could in her cage kajira hissed the darkhaired girl angrily at her it was the blond who had taken her garment as she had lain trussed with turgus of port kar while awaiting the arrival of the guardsmen who would take them into custody there were tears in the eyes of the blond girl she pulled with her wrists against the bracelets which held her hands behind her then she looked angrily at the darkhaired girl kajira she said to her angrily mooring ropes were cast off sailors at the port rail with three poles thrust the palms of schendi away from the dock canvas fell from the long sloping yards the two helmsmen were at their rudders the first officer directed the crew the captain ulafi of schendi stood upon the stem castle ready called the second officer ten sailors on a side slid oars outboard stroke called the second officer he acting as oar master the long oars dipped into thassa and rose dripping from the greenish sea the vessel moved slowly outward into wider waters a breeze from the east over port kar swelled the sails they lifted and billowed oars inboard called the second officer the helmsman guided the ship to the right of the line of white and red buoys i watched port kar its low buildings fall behind the sky was very blue i went to the cage which contained the girl i had bought she looked up at me her wrists were still bound i do not have a name she said it was true she was as nameless as a tabuk doe or a sheverr i had bought her i had not yet given her a name you are sasi i told her naming her yes master she said putting her head down she would wear her old name but it had now been put on her as a slave name by my will the second officer now freed of his duties as oar master approached me he indicated sasi there is an extra charge said he for the keeping and feeding of livestock it will cost you an extra copper tarsk of course i said i handed him from my pouch a copper tarsk he turned about and left i looked down at the other cage and the blondhaired barbarian who had been an agent for kurii kneeling naked her wrists braceleted behind her put her head down i looked at the brand fresh in her burned thigh it was small precise deep clean and sharp a severe lovely mark unmistakable and clear her thigh now well proclaimed what she was a gorean slave ulafi merchant and captain stood upon the deck of the stern castle i stood at the rail canvas snapped in the wind over my head the masts and timbers of the ship creaked i smelled the sharp freshness of gleaming thassa the sea i heard her waters lick at the strakes a sailor began to sing a song of schendi and it was taken up by others i watched port kar drop behind we ply toward schendi lesha snapped the second officer to the blond girl she spun from facing him and lifted her chin turning her head to the left placing her wrists behind her as though for snapping them into slave bracelets nadu he snapped she swiftly turned facing him and dropped to her knees she knelt back on her heels her back straight her hands on her thighs her head up her knees wide it was the position of the pleasure slave sula kajira said the man she slid her legs from under her and lay on her back her hands at her sides palms up her legs open bara kajira he said she rolled quickly to her stomach placing her wrists behind her crossed and crossing her ankles ready to be bound she is a pretty thing said ulafi and turned away yes i said sula said the man bara nadu lesha nadu bara sula nadu the girl was gasping there were tears in her eyes as she knelt on the deck once she had been struck when her transition between two of the movements had been insufficiently beautiful another time she had been struck when her response had been insufficiently prompt the trip south towards schendi is a long one consuming several days even with fair winds which we had had do you think she will make a good slave asked sasi standing beside me eating a larma perhaps in time i said how are her lessons in gorean coming along sasi shrugged i am teaching her as i can she said barbarians are so stupid i had had sasi at the invitation of ulafi spend several hours a day tutoring the blond girl in gorean sasi enjoyed this standing over the blond girl with a strap striking her when she made mistakes when she had had a good session ulafi would sometimes when he thought of it throw her a bit of cake or pastry which she would gratefully receive she would then kneel before ulafi and kiss his feet clutching the bit of cake or pastry thank you master she would say she would then kneel before sasi her teacher and offer her the bit of cake or pastry which sasi would take taking most of it and returning a portion of it to her thank you mistress she would say for sasi was first girl she would then creep to her cage and be locked within it she would lie curled up in it a lovely helpless slave and try to make the bit of cake or pastry last as long as possible when more than one slave girl stands in a relationship of slave girls as when they serve in the same shop or house or adorn the same rich mans pleasure gardens it is common for the master or masters to appoint a first girl her authority is then to the other girls as is that of the master this tends to reduce squabbling the first girl is usually though not always the favorite of the master there is usually much competition to be first girl first girls can be cruel and petty but commonly they attempt to govern with intelligence and justice they know that another girl at the masters whim may become first girl and that they themselves may then be under her almost absolute power in my own house i often rotated the position of first girl among my slaves who were native goreans i never made an earthgirl slave first girl this is fitting let them be always as the slaves of slaves i looked at the earth girl who had been left kneeling on the deck the second officer having left her there she did not move a muscle she was being well trained i hate her said sasi why i asked she is so stupid and slow said sasi things are hard for her i told sasi remember that she is only a barbarian she is stupid said sasi i do not think she is stupid i said she is slow said sasi she is learning i said she will always be a pitiful clumsy slave said sasi perhaps i said i do not know frankly i did not think she was even now a pitiful clumsy slave she seemed to me to learn quickly i felt that she would in time particularly if put under sex conquest prove superb are you going to train me a little tonight master asked sasi perhaps i said i had already brought her past the limitations of the free womans heat sometimes at night i would pull her forth from her cage the key to which had been given to me use her and then put her back in the cage after the first three or four days she had begun to grow rather food of her collar it is an interesting transition in a woman i looked at the blondhaired slave kneeling in the position of the pleasure slave sasi bit into the larma fruit the first two days the blondhaired girl could not eat she had shrunk back in honor from the gruel of meal and fish fit provender for slaves thrust in its pan into her cage she had looked at me compared to it the garbage of port kar had been haut cuisine but on the third day she had finished it thrusting it with her fingers into her mouth and licking the pan clean slaves are often not permitted utensils seeing that the pan was clean ulafi had then had his second officer commence her lessons the next day sasi at ulafis request of me had begun to improve her gorean do you think she is pretty master asked sasi yes i said i did think she was pretty she seemed more lovely now than when we had left port kar it was probably the fresh air the exercise and the finding of herself under the absolute domination of men the training too doubtless helped the second officer now returned to the kneeling girl and standing behind her loosely with a movement of the slave whip looped the five broad blades of the whip about her neck he then held the loops against the whips staff her neck encircled by them he then pulling against the side of her neck threw her to his feet what are you he asked a slave girl master she said her neck in the loops of the whip what is a slave girl he asked a girl who is owned she said are you a slave girl he asked yes master she said then you are owned he said yes master she said who owns you he asked ulafi of schendi she said who trains you he asked shoka of schendi she said do you have a brand yes master why because i am a slave do you wear a collar yes master what sort of collar do you wear a shipping collar master it shows that i am a portion of the cargo of the palms of schendi i thought the girls gorean though the responses were generally simple had improved considerably in the last few days what is the common purpose of a collar the collar has four common purposes master she said first it visibly designates me as a slave as a brand might not if it should be covered by clothing second it impresses my slavery upon me thirdly it identifies my master fourthlyfourthly fourthly he asked fourthly she said it makes it easier to leash me he kicked her in the side she winced her response had been slow do you like being a slave girl he asked yes master she said she sobbed she was again kicked yes master yes master she cried what does a slave girl want more than anything he asked to please men she said what are you he asked a slave girl she said what do you want more than anything he asked to please men she cried nadu he cried loosening the whip coils on her throat she swiftly knelt back on her heels back straight head high hands on her thighs knees wide he then left her again and she remained kneeling she moved no muscle is she more pretty than i master asked sasi your beauties are quite different i said i think you are both quite pretty i think you will both make superb little slaves oh said sasi an additional utility of the collar though it did not count as one of its four common purposes was that it made it easier to put the girl in various ties for example one can use it to tie her hands before her throat or at the sides or back of her neck one can use it with say rope or chain to fasten girls together one can tie her feet to her collar and so on if the feet are tied to the collar the knot is always in the front so that the pressure will be against the back of the girls neck and not the front the purpose of such a tie is to hold the slave not choke her gorean men are not clumsy in their binding of women i looked at the kneeling blondhaired girl how miserable superficially she seemed in her slavery i supposed that if she were asked outside the context of training where certain answers are prescribed if she liked being a slave girl she would have denied it vehemently perhaps with tears doubtless she would have begged piteously for her freedom yet i recalled that when her trainer shoka of schendi had flung her to his feet by the whip coils on her neck she had fallen in a certain way and had lain at his feet in a certain fashion i recalled the position of her wrists and palms and the look in her eyes as she had looked up at him her hip had been turned both legs had been drawn back but one more than the other her toes had been pointed accentuating the turn of her calf she had not fallen clumsily she had not lain clumsily at his feet she had lain at his feet and looked at him as a slave she had not been trained to do that i did not even think she was aware of this sort of thing do you like me master asked sasi yes i said particularly since you have had a bath oh master she said i had scrubbed her the first day out from port kar she kneeling in a tub with sea water and a deck brush what was the last time you had a bath i asked her a girl pushed me in the south canal a year ago she said i see i said is master fastidious she asked not particularly i said but i will expect you to keep yourself reasonably clean from now on you are no longer a free woman no master she said you are now a slave girl i said yes master she said she knew that slave girls must be attentive to matters of appearance health cleanliness and hygiene they are no longer free women yesterday the blondhaired girl had been permitted to walk about the deck i had stopped near her and she had immediately knelt for she was in the presence of a free man i had walked slowly about her she was very nice i had then stood before her and she had suddenly dropped her eyes i saw a tiny movement in her hands on her thighs as though she would turn them exposing the palms to me but then she pressed them down her thighs hard i crouched beside her then i smiled i smelled slave heat then i got up and went about my business i saw her later leaning against the main mast later i looked at it and saw that she had made marks in it with her nails i myself prefer the training of the furs said sasi biting again into the larma fruit the blondhaired girl still knelt in the position of the pleasure slave for the time her trainer had forgotten about her you just do not like being struck with the whip i told her perhaps that is it she laughed master she said yes i said if i am good you will not whip me will you she asked i might i said oh she said sometimes i had had sasi train with the blondhaired girl but generally i did not ulafi had no objection to her sharing the barbarians training indeed he had even suggested the arrangement graciously he had made no charge for this on the other hand i had not charged him for the instruction which sasi was giving the blond barbarian in gorean our arrangement thus though tacit was a tidy one sasi gorean even in the collar a few days was already far beyond the blondhaired barbarian it was for this reason that i had had her seldom train with the barbarian there had simply not been much point to it the barbarian still needed the simplest and most elementary lessons of slave training shoka recollecting her had now returned to the vicinity of the blondhaired barbarian she did not know he was behind her bara he called sula nadu lesha sula bara nadu instantaneously she performed then she was again kneeling as before not bad said sasi chewing on the larma yes i said though sasi was well advanced beyond the blond barbarian i suspected that the blond barbarian moving slowly at first might in time catch up with her and perhaps even surpass her the blond barbarian i suspected had unusual slave potential shoka then without warning struck her with his whip she did not break position but she gasped her face was startled her eyes were wild she did not know why she had been struck in a sense there had been no reason one does not need a reason to strike a slave but in another sense in the training situation there had been a reason that she was subject to discipline and that it could be meted out by the master purely at his whim or caprice she tensed she did not know shoka behind her if she would be struck again but shoka took her by the hair and she pulled to her feet bent over was conducted to her cage there he released her and she fell to her hands and knees to crawl into the cage to be locked within may i speak master she asked yes he said why was i struck she asked kiss my feet he said she did so then she looked up at him it pleased me he said yes master she said into the cage slave he said yes master she said in a moment she had been locked within i saw her looking after him then she looked at me too and then she looked down i saw her lie on her side in the cage her legs drawn up the cage is very tiny i looked out over the rail there were white clouds in the sky and the sky was very blue we would make schendi if the winds held in four days master said sasi yes i said i turned to look at her she looked up at me she smiled if i get to be good she said may i have a garment perhaps i said i think i would like a garment she said chewing on the larma fruit it would give me something to tear off you i admitted she looked up at me smiling the collar looks well on you sasi i said you could have been born in a collar for all practical purposes she said i was i do not understand i said i am a woman she said chewing on the fruit why are you bound for schendi asked ulafi of me it was late evening now i stood again by the rail i have never been there i said you are not of the metal workers he said oh i asked perhaps you know chungu said he the hand on watch i said he said ulafi by sight i said i did remember him quite well he was the fellow who had passed me on the northern walkway of the rim canal when i had been on my way to the pier of the red urt i had seen him too later in the vicinity of the desk of the wharf praetor before the general alarm was permitted to sound in port kar in the matter of apprising the wharves of the news of an escaped slave said ulafi we naturally conducted a search for her ourselves we expected to pick her up without difficulty in a few minutes you understand of course i said she was naked and a barbarian said ulafi where could she go what could she do of course i said yet she was clever said ulafi yes i said she had stolen a garment and concealed herself unmarked and uncollared among sheurts i had no doubt that she was a highly intelligent girl that intelligence could now be applied now that she was a slave to the pleasing of masters we did not wish to annoy the praetor said ulafi it would be embarrassing too i suspect i said for one of schendi and one who was a captain too to call public attention to the fact that he had lost a girl would you like to be thrown overboard asked ulafi no i said i would not like that would this not have been embarrassing for anyone asked ulafi of course i said forgive me captain when we decided to enlist the aid of guardsmen and inquire into the reports of citizens said ulafi we had the general alarm rung one of my men chungu was hunting for the girl in the vicinity of the rim canal in that area he saw two assailants a man and his female accomplice subdued by one who wore the garb of the metal workers further this deed was apparently performed with dispatch a dispatch scarcely to be expected of one who was of the metal workers soon the fellow who wore the garb of the metal workers had left he had paused little longer than was necessary to awaken the girl to consciousness rape her and tie her to the man whose accomplice she had been oh i said when the alarm rang said ulafi chungu returned to the ship you were the fellow in the garb of the metal workers said ulafi yes i said when the assailants were brought to the praetors desk too said he it was seen that their wrists had been bound with capture knots i see i said such knots are tied by a warrior he said perhaps i said why are you bound for schendi asked ulafi if you knew me not of the metal workers i asked why did you permit me to mark the blondhaired slave i wished to see what you would do he said you risked a badly marked thigh on the girl i said the mark was perfect said ulafi thus you see said i that i am truly of the metal workers no said ulafi i knew you were not of the metal workers thus i saw that you were truly of the warriors should i have blurred the brand i asked that would have been a shame said he smiling true i grinned all men like a wellmarked girl too said he that would have shown had you done poorly that you were not of the metal workers might i not have been a slaver or one who did work with them i asked perhaps said ulafi but that would not have well fitted in with the dispatch with which the assailants were handled or the knotting on their wrists or indeed with your general mien how you walk and sit and look about yourself your eyes how you handle yourself i looked out to sea the three moons were high abeam the sea was sparkling was it important to you to leave port kar when you did asked ulafi i think so i said why did you choose to voyage to schendi he asked are there not fortunes to be made there i asked in schendi said ulafi there are fortunes and there are dangers dangers i asked yes said ulafi even from the interior from the ubarate of bila huruma schendi is a free port administered by merchants i said we hope that it will continue to be so he said as you have suspected i said i am of the warriors ulafi smiled perhaps there are some in schendi i said with whom i might take service steel can always command a price said ulafi he made as though to turn away captain i said yes said he i indicated the blondhaired barbarian in her cage a few yards forward of the mainmast it was chained at four points to cleats in the deck that it not shift its position overmuch in rough weather a folded tarpaulin lay near it with which it could be covered sasis cage had similar appointments the girls relieved themselves during the day when ordered to do so i am curious about the blondhaired slave i said on the wharf the slaver vart said that he had gotten a silver tarsk for her i looked at ulafi surely such a girl a wench of only average beauty a tense tight girl awkward and clumsy one untrained new to the collar one who can hardly speak gorean a barbarian is worth at best only two or three copper tarsks i can get two silver tarsks for her said ulafi her hair and coloring is rare in schendi i asked such girls and better are cheap in schendi he said do not forget that schendi is the home port of the black slavers how then will you get two silver tarsks for her i asked she is on my conditional want list said ulafi i see i said that seemed to me intelligent on the part of kur agents they must have known that she would be sailing from cos to schendi this trip particularly because of the depredations of pirates from port kar is a hazardous one it then made sense that provisions would be made to retrieve her in a port kar market should she be taken and enslaved doubtless a similar arrangement had been made with some schendi merchants in tyros and perhaps in lydius or scagnar why are you giving her slave training i asked she is a slave said ulafi why should she not receive slave training true i said i smiled who is your client i said is it worth a copper tarsk to you he asked yes i said uchafu he said a slaver in schendi i handed him the copper tarsk is uchafu an important slaver i asked no said ulafi he usually handles no more than two or three hundred slaves in an open market does it not seem strange to you i asked that uchafu should offer two tarsks for such a girl yes he said obviously he is conducting the transaction at the behest of another who i asked i do not know said ulafi i would pay a silver tarsk to know i said ah said ulafi i see you have business in schendi that you have hitherto concealed a silver tarsk i said it pains me said ulafi but i must confess i do not know i am sorry i looked at the girl she was lying in the cage on her side turned away from us she is pretty isnt she asked ulafi yes i said we watched the girl she lay there quietly she ran the index finger of her right hand idly slowly up and down on one of the bars near her face she seemed lost in thought yes a pretty slave said ulafi look i said the girl very delictely lifted her head a bit from the metal floor of the cage and with her tongue furtively touched the bar then she again touched the bar delicately licking it with her tongue she is beginning to suspect that she may be truly a slave said ulafi yes i said she is beginning to learn her collar he said yes i said the girl then lay there quietly again her head resting on her left arm it lying flat elbow bent beneath her on the sheetmetal floor of the cage her face and lips were near the bar the small fingers of her right band touched the bar near its base have you not noticed the improvement in her asked ulafi since the beginning of the voyage yes i said her movements have become less constricted she is no longer as clumsy or tight as she was she is becoming less inhibited she is becoming more beautiful these things were true she was being taught her slavery i wonder who it is who has placed her on order he said i do not know i said i would like to know i too am curious he said ulafi then turned away from me he walked down the deck toward the stern castle i again looked out to sea i sensed then that the girl sasi was near me she knelt lightly beside me to my left she put her head down i felt her tongue soft at my ankle she licked and kissed at my ankle and leg for a few ehn may i speak she asked yes i said she looked up at me i beg training master she said crawl to my blankets beside the sea bag i told her yes master she said head down she crawled to the blankets and lay there the blondhaired girl now knelt in her cage her fists were on the bars she was watching me i joined sasi on the two blankets she lay there quietly in her collar but as soon as i touched her she lifted her lips to mine and squirmed and sobbed i was pleased the branded she of her was mine you train well little slave i said please do not stop touching me master she begged perhaps i should whip you i said no no she begged please let me try to be more pleasing to you i smiled to myself already only a few days in the collar she was slave hot perhaps you are ready for the first of the full slave orgasms i said master she said then after a few ehn she clutched me wildly her fingernails cutting into my arms it cannot be it cannot be she said shall i stop i asked no no she said intensely perhaps i shall stop i said your slave begs you not to stop she said oh oh she said it is coming i sense it it is coming what do you feel like i asked her a slave a slave she cried i must yield to you she said i am going to yield to you she cried as what i asked as a slave she cried she threw back her head and wildly weeping sobbing cried out the submission of her bondage i kissed her she had not done badly her body was growing in vitality she showed promise for a new slave i was pleased she clutched me please do not leave me she said continue to hold me if only for a time there were tears in her eyes i beg it master she said very well i said i held her and kissed her and caressed her keeping her close and warm beside me thank you master she said she looked up at me frightened i did not know it could be like that she said i had no idea i kissed her gently as a free woman she said sometimes late at night or in my dreams i had dimly sensed what might he the sexuality of the slave girl but i had never remotely understood it could be anything like that anything so overwhelming so helpless so total it was only a rudimentary slave orgasm i said it had been rudimentary she asked yes i said you jest with a poor slave she said no i said truly she asked truly i said what then lies in store for me she whispered slavery i told her yes master she said she lay beside me then on her back she looked up a slave at the stars and moons she touched her collar her body in the moonlight was white on the dark blankets after a woman has felt anything like that she said how could she ever go back to being free not many would receive the opportunity i told her she laughed it was true gorean men on the whole do not free slaves the freeing of a girl is almost unheard of this makes sense they are not free women they are belongings valuables slaves treasures who discards precious possessions who surrenders treasures if the slave girl were worth less perhaps she would be freed more she is too marvelous to free and if she is not marvelous she can be slain too what man who has known the glory and joy of a girl at his feet is likely to wish to exchange that for the inconvenience and bother of a free woman no slave girls for all practical purposes are not freed they will remain in one collar or another men will have it that way i am owned she said her fingers touching her collar you own me yes i said i do not want to be free she said do not fear i said you are too pretty to free she kissed me sometimes when a woman is freed for one reason or another as can happen upon rare occasions she becomes sometimes after an initial elation restless and later miserable she often becomes unpleasant and irritable consequences of her frustration often she attempts to inflict her dissatisfaction on others often she tries to dominate males in her vicinity perhaps in an attempt to punish them for their inability or cruel refusal to understand or relieve her discomfort perhaps too in an attempt to provoke them into an action which will restore her to her place in nature she has once been in that place and she cannot fail to recollect it perhaps it would have been better if she had never tasted nature it is difficult thereafter to be satisfied with politics ignorance as always remains myths sturdiest bulwark such women often eventually take to walking the high bridges or frequenting exposed areas sometimes outside the city walls they are courting capture and the collar they wish to kneel again slaves before a man i have been had many times when i was a sheurt she said i have lain for paga attendants hoping to be thrown a handful of garbage i have been raped by vagabonds many times did i pleasure turgus yet never did i feel anything like what you did to me of the three types of experiences you have mentioned i said the nearest to what you recently felt occurred when you hoped to be thrown garbage by paga attendants she looked at me with wonder yes she said how did you know that because in that experience you were most under the domination of a man dependent on him even for food would he or would he not throw you a few scraps would you be sufficiently pleasing to win from him even a few shreds of garbage yes she said it is the woman in the position of submission and subordination doubtless sometimes they even ordered you to dance naked before them i said yes she said what occurred later then i asked when they had you i reached orgasm quickly she said of course i said but still you were free if you wished you could starve for another day or you could seek garbage elsewhere or beg or fish for scraps in the canals yes she said you see i said you were not totally dependent on them you were not totally helpless you were not their slave are you going to let me eat tomorrow she asked suddenly apprehensively perhaps i said i will make that decision in the morning yes master she said do you begin to see what i am saying to you i asked yes master she whispered i could not have earlier had the feelings you induced in me yes i said master she said yes i said the very nearest thing to what i recently felt occurred on the northern walkway of the rim canal when you not a vagabond but a strong free man who had subdued both turgus and myself simply took me and used me for your pleasure i recall i said too i recall that you responded well considering that you were at that time only a free woman you treated me as a slave she chided i saw the potential slave in you i said accordingly i handled you as i would have handled a slave that is why i could not help responding to you as i did she said and yet i said that did not compare with what you recently felt no she said that is because before you were a free woman i said you did not then truly belong to men i do now she said yes i said now you are a slave that is the difference she said yes i said the orgasm was rudimentary she asked yes i said just as you could not as a free woman attain to the heights of the rudimentary slave orgasm recently inflicted upon you so too you as a new slave cannot yet attain to the overwhelming and degrading ecstasies familiar to a girl longer in the collar yes master she said you have a long way to go in slavery little sasi i said yes master she said but in a year or two i said i think you will be superb and beyond that it is just a matter of continued growth does any woman ever learn her full slavery she asked no i said i think no woman ever learns the fullness of her slavery i want to be a good slave she said men will see that you are i said yes master she said master she said yes i said may i please have my ears pierced master she begged would you be so degraded a slave i asked ear piercing on gor is regarded in most cities as the most degrading thing that can he done to a girl it is commonly done only to the lowest of pleasure slaves compared to it fixing a ring in a girls nose is regarded lightly indeed among the tuchuks one of the wagon peoples of gor even free women wear nose rings these matters are cultural of course yes master she said why i asked that i might be kept always a slave she said i see i said a girl with pierced ears on gor might as well for all practical purposes give up even the slimmest of hopes should she entertain them of freedom what gorean man seeing a woman with pierced cars could treat her as or accept her as anything but a slave please master she said i will have it done in schendi i said usually a leather worker pierces ears in schendi there were many leather workers usually engaged in the tooling of kailiauk hide brought from the interior such leather with horn was one of the major exports of schendi kailiauk are fourlegged wideheaded lumbering stocky ruminants their herds are usually found in the savannahs and plains north and south of the rain forests but some herds frequent the forests as well these animals are shorttrunked and tawny they commonly have brown and reddish bars on the haunches the males tridentlike have three horns these horns bristle from their foreheads the males are usually about ten hands at the shoulders and the females about eight hands the males average about four hundred to five hundred gorean stone in weight some sixteen hundred to two thousand pounds and the females average about three to four hundred gorean stone in weight some twelve hundred to sixteen hundred pounds thank you master she said she then lay quietly beside me on the blankets the sea bag was to my right are you going to lock me in my cage tonight master she asked no i said tonight you will sleep beside me thank you master she said at my feet i said yes master she said sailors called the watch the wind was soft in the triangular sails though it was night ulafi had not had them furled on their yards the sea hooks the light anchors at stem and stern had not been thrown out we would not lay to here the sea was open and the light from the moons and stars was more than ample the palms of schendi though it was night continued to ply her way southward ulafi for some reason seemed eager to reach schendi i love being a woman said the girl i love being a woman she kissed me you are a slave i told her she kissed me again they are the same she whispered i rolled over and seized her almost instantly this time she attained slave orgasm then she looked up at me frightened and i touched the side of her forehead brushing back some hair i so fear the slave in me she said you so fear the woman in you i said they are the same master she said they are the same that is known to me i said she lifted her lips to mine and kissed me softly yes master she said to my feet i said yes master she said she crept tremblingly to my feet curl up i told her yes master she said i then threw the second blanket the top blanket over her covering her completely when a blanket or cloak or covering of any sort is thrown over a slave like this she may not speak or rise she must remain as she is silent until the master or some free man lifts the covering away i then lay on the blanket my hands under my head looking up at the canvas and stars with my foot i could feel the girl her breathing told me that she was soon asleep it was the first time since her enslavement she had slept outside of a cage she was an excellent little slave i was pleased that i had picked her up after a time restless i got up and paced the deck ulafi was not asleep he was on the stem castle two helmsmen stood below him on the helm deck the only other hand awake as far as i knew was the lookout some forty feet above me on the ringed platform encircling the mainmast the taller of the two masts i walked over to the cage of the blondhaired barbarian she i felt was the key to the mystery that device whereby i might locate shaba and the fourth ring one of the two remaining lightdiversion rings the secret of which had apparently perished long ago with prasdak the kur inventor he of the cliff of karrash the fifth ring according to samos was still somewhere on one of the steel worlds it would not be risked we speculated on gor or earth perhaps it served to keep order on some steel world shielded in invisibility an executioner could come and go as he pleased if we could acquire once more of course the tahari ring the fourth ring which had been brought to gor by a kur faction intent upon preserving the planet from destruction we could presumably have it duplicated in the sardar the use of such rings if their use were permitted by priestkings might well make it difficult or impossible for the kurii to function on gor with it their secret strongholds might be penetrated with it one man might in time slaughter an army i was pleased that the fourth ring had been brought to gor without it given to me by a dying kur warrior i doubted that i could have survived to prevent some years ago the detonation of the explosives in the steel tower in the tahari explosives that were intended to destroy gor and the priestkings that the path to earth might be cleared for conquest but the faction that would have been willing to destroy one world to obtain another was we speculated no longer in the ascendancy on the steel worlds halfear a war general of the kurii whom i had met in the north had not been of that faction kurii now it seemed reasonably clear were again intent upon the possibilities of invasion they sensed the weakness of priestkings why now should they think of destroying a world which like a ripe fruit seemed to hang almost within their grasp i looked at the blondhaired barbarian i was surprised to see that she was not asleep usually a girl in training sleeps well she has been worked hard and is tired but she was not asleep she knelt in the small cage her fists on the bars she was naked i could see the moonlight on her flesh striped by the shadows of the bars and glintingn the shipping collar locked on her throat she was looking up at me i smiled to myself clearly she was not sleepy if she had been mine i would have dragged her from the cage and thrown her upon the deck she looked over to where sasi lay under the blanket she looked at her wonderingly then she looked at me again i heard her cry out she said in english half to herself what did you do to her she had heard an hour ago or so sasis cry emitted in the throes of her first slave orgasm acknowledging her surrender to me as a slave girl what did you do to her she asked in english surely she must know or suspect what had been done to sasi would not any woman know what i asked in gorean i crouched down by the cage she drew back from the bars forgive me she said frightened in english i was only talking to myself really i did not mean to bother you master what i asked in gorean she collected herself it is nothing master she said in gorean forgive me master her gorean was still terribly limited i saw her look again to sasi under the blanket and then to me as she knelt before me within the cage i saw her straighten her back and draw back her shoulders lifting her breasts how beautiful they were i do not think she even realized she had done this it was a slaves act displaying her imbonded beauty before the gaze of a free man yet i do not think she was even aware of what she had done i looked at her ears they had not been pierced i had never known a female agent of kurii who had been brought to gor with pierced ears that was no accident of course pierced ears in a girl mean to a gorean that she is a slave among slaves i looked at her if i owned her i would have her ears pierced that would be sufficient guarantee on gor that she would always be kept in a collar she opened her knees slightly before me as she knelt this was done unconsciously what a naive slave she was doubtless still priding herself on her freedom some earth girls of course brought to gor as slaves as lovely meat for the flesh markets did have their ears pierced some of them did not learn for months why it was that they were treated with a roughness and contempt far beyond that of their imbonded sisters subjected to a harsher authority and put beneath the rudest predations of a masters lust and yet the answer was simple they were piercedear girls it is said that the ear piercing of slaves on gor originated in turia certainly it was practiced there after the fall of turia the custom spread northward it is now relatively common on gor for pleasure slaves slavers have discovered that a piercedear girl commands a higher price i looked into the eyes of the blond girl she had looked again at sasi and then had lifted her eyes to mine her lower lip trembled and then she put her head down quickly i saw that she wished that it had been she and not sasi who had been subjected on the blankets to the pleasure of a master but she would not of course admit this to herself sasi a slave had served the pleasure of a master she a slave had not sasi had been called to the blankets she had been left in her cage ulafi had not had her thrown to the crew he had purchased her for another she was to be shipped intact to her buyer in schendi he who had placed her on order she lifted her head and our eyes met i saw her small right hand tremble it lifted timidly from her thigh she wanted to reach out through the bars to touch me then quickly she drew her hand back she put down her head i thought that whoever eventually owned her would be a lucky fellow she had excellent slave potential i would not have minded having her in my own collar she had grown considerably in beauty just on the voyage she lifted her head again i looked again into her eyes yes i thought excellent slave potential again she looked down i find you so attractive you brute she said miserably in english much to herself you are so attractive to me she said i hate you you are so attractive to me she said you make me weak i hate you what are you saying i asked her in gorean as though i could not understand her she looked at me boldly but she spoke in english which she believed i could not understand i do not know what is going on in me she said my clothes have been taken i am caged i wear a collar i have been branded i have been whipped i am being trained as a slave and yet i find you attractive i am no good i am no good i want to he before you and lick your feet i want to serve you fully and as a slave she looked away i hate myself she said i hate you i hate all of them and yet something in me is beginning to sense happiness joy fulfillment how terrible i am she sobbed perhaps i am a slave truly she whispered then she shook her head tears in her eyes no no no no no she said i am not a slave what are you saying i asked her in gorean she looked at me and brushed back her hair nothing master she said in gorean forgive me master she said it is nothing nadu i said swiftly she knelt before me in the tiny cage in the perfection of the position of the pleasure slave good i said she had assumed it instantaneously fluidly beautifully thank you master she said it is now time to sleep i told her yes master she said and curled up on the sheetiron square which floored her cage i looked at her her legs were drawn up her toes were pointed her belly was sucked in slightly her body was a beautiful armful of slave curves she had not been taught to do that i looked into her eyes she was a natural slave i saw as is any woman too i saw that she suspected it i then took the tarpaulin which lay to one side i unfolded it and threw it over the cage and then tied it down fastening it to the four cleats at the corners of the cage covering her for the night schendi do you smell it asked ulafi yes i said it is cinnamon and cloves is it not yes said ulafi and other spices as well the sun was bright and there was a good wind astern the sails were full and the waters of thassa streamed against the strakes it was the fourth morning after the evening conversation which ulafi and i had had concerning my putative caste and the transaction in schendi awaiting the arrival of the blondhaired barbarian how far are we out of schendi i asked fifty pasangs said ulah we could not yet see land the two girls on their hands and knees on the deck linked together by a gleaming neck chain some five feet in length attached to two steel work collars these fitted over their regular collars looked up they too could smell the spices even this far from land in their right hands grasped were deck stones soft white stones rounded which are used to smooth and sand the boards of the deck earlier they had scrubbed and rinsed and with rags on their hands and knees dried the deck later when finished with the deck stones they would again rinse and again on their hands and knees with rags dry the deck had sailors been doing these things they of course would have dried the deck by simply mopping it down this was not permitted to the girls of course they were slaves the boards almost sparkled white ulafi kept a fine ship behind the girls stood shoka with a whip he would not hesitate to use it on them if they shirked they did not shirk those are schendi gulls said ulafi pointing to birds which circled about the mainmast they nest on land at night i am pleased i said the trip had been long i was eager to make landfall in schendi i looked to the girls sasi looked up at me and smiled the blondhaired barbarian too had her head lifted she smelled the spices she knew we were now in the vicinity of land she looked up at the birds she had not seen them before ulafi looked to the blondhaired barbarian she looked at him frightened he pointed upward at the birds we are approaching schendi he said yes master she said she put her head down trembling she a slave did not know what awaited her in schendi shoka behind the girls shook out the blades of the slave whip he carried quickly both girls their heads down returned to their work i remained at the rail on the port side soon i could see a brownish stain in the water mingling and diffusing with the green of thassa i drew a deep breath relishing the loveliness of the smell of the spices now stronger than before half port helm called ulafi to his helmsmen slowly the palms of schendi swung half to port and the great yards above the deck pulleys creaking lines adjusted by quick sailors swung almost parallel to the deck the same wind which had pressed astern now sped us southeastward i now regarded again the brownish stains in the water still we could not see land yet i knew that land must be nigh already though we were still perhaps thirty or forty pasangs at sea one could see clearly in the water the traces of inland sediments these would have been washed out to sea from the kamba and nyoka rivers these stains extend for pasangs into thassa closer to shore one could mark clearly the traces of the kamba to the north and the nyoka to the south but given our present position we were in the fans of these washes the kamba as i may have mentioned empties directly into thassa the nyoka on the other hand empties into schendi harbor which is the harbor of the port of schendi its waters only then moving thence to thassa kamba incidentally is an inland word not gorean it means rope similarly the word nyoka means serpent ushindi means victory thus lake ushindi might be thought of as lake victory or victory lake it was named for some victory over two hundred years ago won on its shores the name of the tiny kingdom or ubarate which had won the victory is no longer remembered lake ngao which was discovered by shaba and named by him was named for a shield because of its long oval shape the shields in this area tend to have that shape it is also an inland word of course the ua river is literally the flower river i have chosen however to retain the inland words as they are those which are commonly used there are of course many languages spoken on gor but that language i have called gorean in its various dialects is the lingua franca of the planet it is spoken most everywhere except in remote areas one of these remote areas of course is the equatorial interior the dialects of the ushindi region i will usually refer to as the inland dialects to some extent of course this is a misnomer as there are many languages which are spoken in the equatorial interior which would not be intelligible to a native speaker of the ushindi area it is useful however to have some convenient way of referring to the linguistic modalities of the ushindi area gorean incidentally is spoken generally in schendi the word schendi as nearly as i can determine has no obvious direct meaning in itself it is generally speculated however that it is a phonetic corruption of the inland word ushindi which long ago was apparently used to refer to this general area in that sense i suppose one might think of schendi though it has no real meaning of its own as havingan etiological relationship to a word meaning victory the gorean word for victory is nykus which expression seems clearly influenced by nike or victory in classical greek shaba usually named his discoveries incidentally in one or another of the inland dialects he speaks several fluently though his native tongue is gorean which is spoken standardly in anango his island the inland language or better one of its dialects is of course the language of the court of bila huruma shabas patron and supporter sails ho called the lookout two points off the port bow men went to the port rail and ulafi climbed to the stern castle i climbed some feet up the knotted rope dangling by the mainmast which led to the lookouts platform i could not yet see the sails ulafi did not put about or change his course i braced myself holding my feet together on one of the knots on the rope i steadied myself puffing one arni about the mast his men did not rush to the benches slide back the thole ports or slip the great oars outboard sea water was not brought to the deck from over the side sand in buckets was not brought topside from the ballast in the hold the first officer gudi did not preside over the issuance of blades and lances i felt distinctly uneasy that the masts could not be lowered how vulnerable seemed the ship the masts high with their sloping yards and billowing canvas there was a light catapult forward but it had not yet been erected if ulafi had torch arrows they were not in evidence too the fire pans had not been kindled for dipping the arrows nor had a fire been kindled beneath the oil kettle for filling the clay globes with flaming oil to be cast in looping trajectories from the catapult forward if onagri or springals lay unassembled in the hold they were not yet being brought to the deck i looked out past the bow almost dead ahead i could now see the sails i counted eleven of them the ships were singlemasted they were ramships yet i now breathed more easily since i from my lower elevation a few feet above the deck by the mainmast could see their canvas i knew that their lookouts from their superior elevations could see the palms of schendi yet the ships were not taking in canvas they were not bringing down their yards and lowering their masts it might have been for all its stately progression a convoy of merchantmen yet the ships were singlemasted tarnships ramships too ulafi did not seem concerrned about them or his men they knew apparently what these would be perhaps the lookout already had made his routine identifications i too now had little doubt what these would be as it was the northern spring and we in the waters of schendi convey our greetings to the fleet called ulafi from the stern castle putting down his glass of the builders flags in colorful series were set at the port stem castle lines i lowered myself now to the deck hand by hand i stood near the bow now on the starboard side on each side of us five on one side six on the other the low lean ships straightkeeled and shallowdrafted singlemailed began to slide past us i could see the oars lifting and dipping in unison as they moved by you do not seem concerned i said to shoka ulafis second officer who stood near me we are of schendi he said i stood with shoka near the rail suddenly i said i have this strange feeling as though i were swimming and then as though from nowhere i found myself swimming with sharks who silently passed me not regarding me it could be frightening admitted shoka do they never prey on ships of schendi i asked i do not think so said shoka if they do i suppose the ship and its crew are destroyed at sea one never hears of it i do not find that particularly comforting i said we are in the waters of schendi said shoka if they were to attack schendi ships it does not seem likely they would do so in these waters that is slightly more comforting i granted him the low sleek ships continued to pass us i could see the black faces of crew members here and there i could not see the nearest oarsmen for these were concealed by the structure of the rowing frame occasionally i glimpsed the far oarsmen as the ship rolled in the swells the oarsmen would be free men one does not put slaves at the oars of warships the wall on the rowing frame of course tends to protect the oarsmen against high seas and the fire of missile weapons i watched the ships they were very beautiful shoka indicated that the two girls should rue and come to stand by the rail to look out and see the fleet is that wise i asked perhaps they should be put on their bellies under the tarpaulins that they not attract attention why should one advertise that one carried two lovely slaves it does not matter said shoka let the slaves see but they will be seen as well i pointed out it not matter said shoka in two months time those ships will have hundreds of such women chained in their holds the two girls then stood by the rail lovely naked neckchained together watching the passing ships their bare feet on the smooth boards of the deck of the palms of schendi i suppose you are right i said yes said he the ships then had slid past us i saw ulafi on his stern castle raise his hand to a black captain some seventy yards away on the stern castle of his own vessel the captain had returned this salute you did not even take defensive precautions i said to shoka what good would it have done he asked i shrugged to be sure one merchant ship like the palms of schendi could have made little effective resistance to the ships which had just passed us nor could she though swift for a round ship have outrun them what if they had taken such action as an indication that we were hostile asked shoka that is true too i said our defense said shoka is that we are of schendi i see i said they need our port facilities said shoka even the larl grows sometimes weary and the tarn upon occasion must find a place in which to fold its wings i turned about watching the ships vanish in the distance return to your work said shoka to the girls yes master they said and with a rustle of chain fell again to their knees and seizing up the deck stones once more shoka near them vigorously addressed themselves to their labors i turned again to watch the ships they were now but specks on the horizon they plied their way northward in the northern autumn they would return to be refitted and supplied again in schendi and would then a few weeks later in the southern spring ply their way southward schendi located in the vicinity of the gorean equator somewhat south of it provides the ships with a convenient base from which they may conduct their affairs seasonally in both hemispheres i was pleased that i had seen the ships i could not have conceived of a more pleasant way in which to have made their acquaintance i had seen the passing of the fleet of the black slavers of schendi the girls had been cleaned and combed shoka had soused perfume on them extend your wrists crossed for binding said he to the blondhaired barbarian she kneeling complied yes master she said the line which shoka now tied around her crossed wrists was already strung through a large metal goldpainted ring one of two which were mounted in the huge wooden ears of the kailiauk head which high above the water surmounted the prow we had lain to after more closely approaching the port of schendi in the evening of the preceding day the day in which we had seen the fleet of the black slavers of schendi we could see the shore now with its sands and behind the sand the dense green vegetation junglelike broken by occasional clearings for fields and villages schendi itself lay farther to the south about the outjutting of a small peninsula point schendi the waters here were richly brown primarily from the outflowing of the nyoka emptying from lake ushindi some two hundred pasangs upriver extend your wrists crossed for binding said shoka to sasi yes master she said her wrists then were tied to another line it strung through the goldpainted ring fixed in the right ear of the kailiauk head at the prow i had volunteered her at the request of ulafi who had his vanities he was an important merchant and captain in schendi indeed he had not entered port yesterday evening the palms of schendi would make her entrance in the morning when the wharves were busy the shops open and the traffic bustling i looked about the palms of schendi sparkled the deck was smoothed and white ropes were neatly coiled gear was stashed and secured hatches were battened and the brass and fittings were polished yesterday afternoon two seamen had reenameled the kailiauk head at the prow with brown and the eyes with white and black the golden metal rings too had been repainted the palms of schendi would enter schendi her home port in style at sea of course a sensible compromise must be struck between a ship which is constantly ready so to speak for inspection and one which is loose the ship must be neat but livable there must be order but not rigidity the ship must be one on which men are comfortable but it must also be one on which because of its arrangements and discipline the efficient performance of duty is encouraged ulafi it seemed to me struck this sort of balance well with his men and ship i thought him a good captain somewhat begrudgingly because he was of the merchants it was hard to fault him he ran a clean tight ship but with common sense the light anchors were raised canvas was dropped from the long sloping yards oarsmen at the command of the first officer a tall fellow named gudi he standing now on the helm deck slid their great levers through the thole ports soon to his calls the oars drew against the brownish waters about the hull the girls knelt on the deck before the stem castle their wrists bound before them lines leading to the rings the palms of schendi began to negotiate its wide turn about point schendi are you proud i asked sasi yes master she said i am very proud i stood at the port rail by the bow i watched the green of the shore moving slowly by last night we had had lanterns at stem and stern i looked at the blondhaired slave girl she was very lovely kneeling naked in her collar her wrists tied before her body the line running to the golden ring seeing my eyes upon her she put her head down ashamed i smiled last night an ahn after she had been put in her cage i had once glanced upon her she had been tying on her back in the cage her knees drawn up her hands had been beside her thighs their backs resting on the metal of the cage floor her head had been turned toward me when she had seen me look at her she had looked up quickly at the square of sheet metal above her i had gone to the side of the cage and crouched there nadu i had said to her and she had then knelt before me within the cage behind the bars in the position of the pleasure slave i had studied her body and in particular her face her eyes and expression i had then reached through the bars and taken her by the upper arms she seemed terrified but made no sound i drew her toward me until i held her against the bars i held her there for more than a minute reading in her eyes and in my grip of her soft upper arms the tenseness the softness the confusion the desire the fear of the lovely slave then i had seen what i had wanted she pressed herself against the bars her eyes were closed the lower portion of her face the bars cruel against it thrust toward me her lips soft and wet opened to me oh no she had then breathed softly in english and frightened had drawn back i had then released her arms and she had crouched back in the cage against the bars on the other side i had neither kissed nor really refused to kiss her it had happened really neither quickly nor slowly but as it had happened she offering her lips almost inadvertently hesitating and then frightened dismayed drawing back i do not think i would have kissed her as i did not own her but she of course had not known that i had been interested of course in assessing the current level of her development in bondage that could make a difference in what happened to her and what happened to her could make a difference in the success or failure of my own mission in schendi if she were still too rigid or irritating to men she might even possibly be slain before she could lead me to the mysterious shaba but my small test affirmative in its results convinced me that she was probably slave enough already to be permitted to live at least until she were thrown naked at his feet i had then continued to look at the girl for a few moments she looked at me miserably frightened i am not a slave she said to herself in english and then suddenly put her head in her hands sobbing i smiled surely she must have sensed that the mouth kiss which she had so helplessly proffered and had proffered as a slave was the symbolic opening of her vagina to male penetration i am not a slave i am not a slave she wept how these earth women fight the natural woman in themselves as far as i could tell it was not wrong to be a woman any more than it was wrong to be a man i do not know of course for i am not a woman perhaps it is wrong to be a woman if not why should they fight it so but perhaps weak men who fear true women have conditioned them so it is not clear that any true man would object to a true woman it is clear however that those who fear to be either will object to both values are interesting how transitory and peculiar are the winds which blow over the plains of biology i am not a slave wept the girl i am not a slave then she looked at me suddenly angrily you know that i am a slave dont you you brute she asked in english i said nothing to her is that why i hate you so much she wept because you know that i am a slave i looked at her or do i hate you so much she asked because i want you as my master then she put down her head again no no she wept i am not a slave i am not a slave i then withdrew i had no objection to the girl addressing herself to me in english which she was confident i did not understand i thought it healthy that she be given the opportunity to ventilate her feelings many gorean masters permit a barbarian to prattle upon occasion in her native tongue it is thought to be good for them a few minutes later i had joined sasi on the blankets please touch me master she had begged very well i had said i glanced back once at the cage of the blondhaired barbarian shoka had covered it for the night i had seen her body and eyes proclaim her slavery and i had heard her mouth both deny it and affirm it and then again deny it the blondhaired girl was still fighting herself she did not know yet who or what she was interestingly i had heard her ask herself if she hated me because she wanted me as her master i knew that a girl who wants a man for her master can perform wonders for him and yet she was only an ignorant girl a raw girl new to the collar what did she know of being the slave of a master but then i recalled that she had again denied being a slave i smiled to myself what a little fool she was she did not yet know truly that she was a slave oh master said sasi then i turned my attention away from the blondhaired girl her intended role in my plans and what might lie ahead in schendi i then turned my full attention to the sweet squirming collared sasi the branded curvacious little beast from the wharves of port kar what a delight she was she had none of the problems of the blondhaired girl but too she was gorean almost as soon as the collar had been locked on her she had begun happily to blossom in her bondage slavery is cultural for goreans they know it is something a woman can be you give me great pleasure master she said be quiet i told her yes master she whispered a quarter of an ahn later i held and kissed her gently letting her subside at her own rhythms what are you i asked her a slave master she said whose slave i asked yours master she said are you happy i asked yes master she whispered yes master the palms of schendi had now begun to come about about point schendi the yards swung on the masts capitalizing on the wind the oars dipped and lifted we were still some seven or eight pasangs from the buoy lines i could see ships in the harbor we would come in with a buoy line on the port side ships too would leave the harbor with the line of their port side this regulates traffic in the open sea similarly ships keep one another where possible on their port sides thus passing to starboard what is the marking on the buoy line that will be used by ulafi i asked shoka who stood near me by the girls at the bow yellow and white stripes he said that will lead to the general merchant wharves the warehouse of ulafi is near wharf eight do you rent wharfage i asked yes from the merchant council he said white and gold incidentally are the colors of the merchants usually their robes are white trimmed with gold that the buoy line was marked in yellow and white stripes was indicative of the wharves toward which it led i have never seen incidentally gold paint on a buoy it does not show up as well as enameled yellow in the light of ships lanterns i could see some forty or fifty sails in the harbor there must then have been a great many more ships in the harbor for most ships naturally take in their canvas when moored the ships under sail must most of them have been entering or leaving the harbor most of the ships of course would be small ships coasting vessels and light galleys also of course there were river ships in the harbor used in the traffic on the nyoka i had not realized the harbor at schendi was so large it must have been some eight pasangs wide and some two or three pasangs in depth at its eastern end of course at one point the nyoka channeled between stone embankments about two hundred yards apart flows into it the nyoka because of the embankments enters the harbor much more rapidly than it normally flows it is generally like the kamba a wide leisurely river its width however about two pasangs above schendi is constricted by the embankments this is to control the river and protect the port a result of course of the narrowing the amount of water involved being the same is an increase in the velocity of the flow in moving upstream from schendi there is a bypass rather like a lock system which provides a calm road for shipping until the nyoka can be joined this is commonly used only in moving east or upstream from schendi the bypass or hook as it is called enters the nyoka with rather than against its current one then brings ones boat about and by wind or oar proceeds upstream the smell of spices particularly cinnamon and cloves was now quite strong we had smelled these even at sea one smell that i did not smell to a great degree was that of fish many fish in these tropical waters are poisonous to eat a function of certain forms of seaweed on which they feed the seaweed is harmless to the fish but it contains substances toxic to humans the river fish on the other hand as far as i know are generally wholesome for humans to eat indeed there are many villages along the kamba and nyoka and along the shores of lake ushindi in which fishing is the major source of livelihood not much of this fish however is exported from schendi i could smell however tanning fluids and dyes from the shops and compounds of leather workers much kailiauk leather is processed in schendi brought to the port not only from inland but from north and south from collection points along the coast i could also smell tars and resins naval stores most perhaps i could now smell the jungles behind schendi this smell interestingly does not carry as far out to sea as those of the more pungent spices it was a smell of vast greeneries steaming and damp and of incredible flowers and immensities of rotting vegetation a dhow with a redandwhitestriped sail slipped past us on the port side the bow of the palms of schendi had now come about and the peninsula of point schendi dropped behind us to port the impassive painted eyes white and blackpupiled of the huge brown kailiauk head at the prow now gazed upon the harbor of schendi it lay dead ahead some four pasangs the blondhaired barbarian looked across the deck to sasi mistress she whispered to sasi who stood to her as first girl yes slave said sasi the blond lifted her bound wrists the line running up to the golden ring in the left ear of the kailiauk head through it and back to the deck why are we bound like this she asked do you not know you little fool asked sasi i smiled for sasi was actually a bit shorter than the blond girl i would have guessed they would have weighed about the same sasi may have weighed a little more neither was a large girl no mistress said the blond girl she was deferential to sasi if she had not been she might have been whipped to within an inch of her life rejoice said sasi you have been found beautiful enough to be put at the prow oh said the blond girl uncertainly then she knelt back on her heels she smiled then she looked up uneasily at the ring in the ear of the kailiauk head that proud adornment surmounting the prow of the palms of schendi through which her wrist rope was strung on your bellies said shoka to them and the two girls lay on the deck he first crossed the blonds ankles and tied them together and then he did the same for sasi this is done to improve the line of a girls body as she hangs at the ring up said shoka to them and they again knelt both were now ready to be put at the rings the blond at the left sasi at the right we were now some three pasangs from schendi a light galley twomasted with yellow sails was leaving the harbor far to port coming about point schendi behind us some two pasangs astern was a round ship she flew the colors of asperiche far to starboard we saw two other ships a mediumclass round ship and a heavy galley the latter with red masts both of ianda what will be done with us in schendi asked the blondhaired girl of sasi i do not know what will be done with me said sasi but doubtless you will be marketed sold asked the blond of course said sasi uneasily the blond girl squirmed a bit in her bonds but they held her perfectly do not fear said sasi you will learn to obey men with perfection they will see to it yes mistress said the blond and then she glanced at me and then quickly looked away i continued to regard her she knelt back as she could her small ankles roped a bit frightened lifting her upper body she displayed herself well she trembled she an earth girl knew herself now subjected to the scrutiny of a gorean male she did not dare not to display herself well she did not wish to be kicked or beaten yet as i regarded her i saw more in her body and beauty than the mere intelligence of a collared slave i saw something incipiently of the joy and pride of the slave girl the girl who knows that though her body is being placed in bondage her womanhood paradoxically is being freed i continued to regard her surely at the beginning of the voyage it never would have occurred to ulafi to have put her at the prow better than that she would have been chained in the hold to a ring or caged on deck the tarpaulin thrown over the cage that she might not detract from the splendor of his entrance into his harbor but ulafi and shoka had in the voyage accomplished much with her she was now incredibly enough sufficiently beautiful to be found acceptable for the prow of the palms of schendi what a subtle thing is a womans beauty how little it has to do actually generally with such matters as symmetry of form and regularity of features it eludes scales and tapes mathematics cannot i think penetrate its mysterious equations i have never understood beauty but i am grateful that it exists the girl looked up at me and then again looked away she put her head down trembling i smiled remembering her eyes they had been those of a slave how incredible that she did not yet know that she was a slave i pointed ahead toward the harbor it was now some two and a half pasangs away schendi i said to her yes master she said you will be sold there i told her yes master she said men will own you i said yes master she said what do you want to do more than anything i asked to please men she said recalling well her training why do you wish to do that i asked she looked up at me because i am a slave girl she whispered is it true that you are a slave girl i asked yes master she whispered do you desire intensely to be a slave girl i asked am i in training she asked of course i said yes master she said i desire intensely to be a slave girl you are not now in training i said do you desire intensely to be a slave girl no no she wept no master no master i see i said and turned away from her she knelt beside me trembling sobbing we were now some two pasangs out of schendi the traffic was heavier yes master she whispered i looked down at her what did you say i asked yes master she said yes what i asked she looked up at me tears in her eyes yes master she said i do desire intensely to be a slave girl you are not now in training i told her i know she whispered but i do desire intensely to be a slave girl she choked back a sob tears stained her cheeks she bent her head to me and delicately softly kissed me on the right thigh below the tunics hem then she again timidly looked up at me i did not cuff her have no fear i told her your wish is granted you are completely and totally a slave girl yes master she said then she put down her head her small fists clenched no she said suddenly i am not a slave girl fight the collar i told her in the long run it will do you no good why she asked looking up at me why because you are a slave i told her no she said no but i saw in her eyes that she understood that i had seen the slave in her she knew that i had recognized it she had not been able to conceal her from me it is very difficult for a woman when she meets a man who can see the slave in her what then can she do she can flee or kneel before him no she said i am not a slave be silent slave i said yes master she said she knelt back i saw her body suffuse with a subtle pleasure that she had been ordered to silence her protestations had not been accepted her immediate realities were simple she was silent ordered so and kneeling she had not wanted her protestations to be accepted though it had been important for her to make them her resistance must be overcome how else could it be clear to her that her will truly was subjected to that of another like all women in her heart she wished to be owned and mastered she looked straight ahead kneeling her body held beautifully she bit her lower lip she tried to look angry i smiled to myself already i could see many signs some subtle and some quite obvious that the secret slave which lurks in every woman had begun to sense fearfully excitedly that she had been brought to a world on which she might perhaps be free at last to emerge had the chains been removed she lifted her wrists had her small limbs now been unfettered she looked up from the straw up the long narrow stairs toward the iron door was it now ajar since her birth a pathological culture had thrust her into the dungeon of suppression confining her in the darkness her very reality and existence had been ignored and hysterically denied but at times sometimes in dreams or idle moments her screams for mercy unheeded had been heard from the darkness below or was it only the sound of the wind i suspected that the blondhaired girl uneasily had many times heard the cries of the imprisoned slave the slave now her fetters struck away by gorean men crept toward the iron door could it truly be ajar had men opened it outside the door the blondhaired girl tremblingly waited the slave was going to emerge but the slave feared to emerge behind her the blondhaired girl heard strong men summon forth the slave the slave would come forth then the blondhaired girl would gasp for she would see that it was she herself who was the slave then she would feel a collar being locked on her throat and she would kneel in the sunlight at the feet of a master put them at the prow called ulafi two seamen came to assist shoka we were now some two pasangs out of schendi the traffic was heavier shoka lifted up the blond girl easily in his arms she was frightened the line on her wrists went to and through the golden ring in the left ear of the kailiauk head at the prow of the palms of schendi it then from the ring returned to the deck the two seamen then held the line at the deck shoka then threw the girl over the bow she cried out with misery but in a moment swung from the tether through the ring fastened to her wrists at shokas direction she was drawn up until she hung her wrists over her head about a foot below the golden ring one sailor held the rope then while the other secured the line to a ring on the deck he made a loop in the line passed the free end through the deck ring brought the end up through the loop about the line and down through the loop again then tightened the knot the girl thee swung from the ring the knot at the ring was a simple bowline familiar to all who know the sea brought to gor perhaps hundreds of years ago by mariners who had once sailed the aegean or the mediterranean perhaps who had once called not such ports as schendi or bazi their own but miletus or ephesus or syracuse or carthage h a few moments sasi too swung from a golden ring she too suspended over the brownish waters outside schendi a heavy galley out of tyros forty oars to a side stroked past us her yellow lateen sails loose on their yards crewmen paused in their labors to examine the beauty of the displayed slaves her captain lowering his glass of the builders lifted his hard high fist clenched to ulafi greeting him and congratulating him on his ship and the girls which hung at its prow ulafi graciously lifting his hand palm open acknowledged the gesture we were then at the mouth of the harbor and in a moment had brought the line of yellowandwhitestriped buoys to port there were already two ships behind us now and another was ahead of us as we moved toward the wharves three ships passed us moving toward the open sea there are more than forty merchant wharves at schendi each one of which extending into the harbor accommodates four ships to a side the inmost wharves tend to have lower numbers on the starboard side of the port as one enters the harbor we could see men on the docks and on the outjutting wharves many seemed to recognize the palms of schendi and she was well received i had not realized that schendi was as large or busy a port as it was many of the wharves were crowded and there were numerous ships moored at them on the wharves and in the warehouses whose great doors were generally open i could see much merchandise most in evidence were spice kegs and hide bales but much else too could be seen cargos in the warehouses and on the wharves some waiting some being actively carried about being embarked or disembarked as the palms of schendi her canvas now taken in and the long yards swung parallel with the deck oars lifting and sweeping moved past the wharves many men stopped working setting down their burdens to wave us good greetings men relish the sight of a fine ship too the two girls at the prow did not detract from the effect they hung as splendid ornaments two slave beauties dangling over the brownish waters from rings set in the ears of a beast we passed the high desks of two wharf praetors i saw too here and there brieftunicked collared slave girls i saw too at one point a group of paga girls chained together soliciting business for their masters tavern many goods pass in and out of schendi as would be the case in any major port such as precious metals jewels tapestries rugs silks horn and horn products medicines sugars and salts scrolls papers inks lumber stone cloth ointments perfumes dried fruit some dried fish many root vegetables chains craft tools agricultural implements such as hoe heads and metal flail blades wines and pagas colorful birds and slaves schendis most significant exports are doubtless spice and hides with kailiauk horn and horn products also being of great importance one of her most delicious exports is palm wine one of her most famous and precious exports are the small carved sapphires of schendi these are generally a deep blue but some are purple and others interestingly white or yellow they are usually carved in the shape of tiny panthers but sometimes other animals are found as well usually small animals or birds sometimes however the stone is carved to resemble a tiny kailiauk or kailiauk head slaves interestingly do not count as one of the major products in schendi in spite of the fact that the port is the headquarters of the league of black slavers the black slavers usually sell their catches nearer the markets both to the north and south one of their major markets to which they generally arrange for the shipment of girls overland is the sardar fairs in particular that of enkara which is the most extensive and finest this is not to say of course that schendi does not have excellent slave markets it is a major gorean port the population of schendi is probably about a million people the great majority of these are black individuals of all races however schendi being a cosmopolitan port frequent the city many merchant houses from distant cities have outlets or agents in schendi similarly sailors from hundreds of ships and numerous distant ports are almost always within the city the equatorial waters about schendi of course are open to shipping all year around this is one reason for the importance of the port schendi does not of course experience a winter being somewhat south of the equator it does have a dry season which occurs in the period of the southern hemispheres winter if it were somewhat north of the equator this dry season would occur in the period of the northern hemispheres winter the farmers about schendi as farmers in the equatorial regions generally do their main planting at the beginning of the dry season from the point of view of one accustomed to gors northern latitudes i am not altogether happy with the geographers concept of a dry season it is not really dry but actually a season of less rain during the rains of the rainy season seeds could be torn out of the ground and fields half washed away the equatorial farmer incidentally often moves his fields after two or three seasons as the soil depleted of many minerals and nutriments by the centuries of terrible rains is quickly exhausted by his croppage the soil of tropical areas contrary to popular understanding is not one of great agricultural fertility jungles which usually spring up along rivers or in the vicinity of river systems can thrive in a soil which would not nourish fields of food grains the farmers about schendi are in a sense more gardeners than farmers when a field is exhausted the farmer clears a new area and begins again villages move this infertility of the soil is a major reason why population concentrations have not developed in the gorean equatorial interior the land will not support large permanent settlements on the equator itself interestingly geographers maintain that there are two dry seasons and two rainy seasons once again if there is much to this i would prefer to think of two rainy seasons and two less rainy seasons my own observations would lead me to say that for all practical purposes there is on the equator itself no dry season the reason for the great amount of rain in the equatorial regions is i suppose clear to all at the equator the suns rays are most direct this creates greater surface heat than oblique rays would this heating of the surface causes warm air to rise the rising of the warm air leaves a vacuum so to speak or better an area of less pressure or density in the atmosphere into this less dense area this hole so to speak cooler air pours like invisible liquid from both the north and south this air is heated and rises in its turn when the warm air reaches the upper atmosphere well above the reflecting heated surface of the earth it cools as it cools its moisture is precipitated as rain this is of course a cycle it is responsible for the incredible rains of the gorean equatorial interior there are often two major rains during the day in the late afternoon when the warm air has reached its precipitation point and again in the late evening when due to the turning of the planet the surface and upper atmosphere darkened cools there can be rain of course at other times as well depending on the intricate interplay of air currents pressures and temperatures oars inboard called gudi who acted as oar master seamen hurled mooring lines to men on the wharf these were looped about heavy mooring cleats coils of rope slung over the side cushioned the strakes of the ship lest she grate herself on the boards of the wharf men gathered their gear the gangplank was run from an opening in the starboard rail swung open to the wharf the number of the wharf was eight i saw two slavers stop at the wharf looking up at the slaves suspended from the rings if you want to sell them bring them to the market of kovu called one of them an ugly fellow his right cheek disfigured by a long scar shoka lifted his hand to them acknowledging that he had heard them they then continued on their way beautiful slave girls clothed and unclothed are not that rare on gor that the two girls had attracted the attention of passing slavers was high praise indeed for their unconcealed charms two men from the desk of the nearest wharf praetor he handling wharves six through ten a scribe and a physician boarded the ship the scribe carried a folder with him he would check the papers of ulafi the registration of the ship the arrangements for wharfage and the nature of the cargo the physician would check the health of the crew and slaves plague some years ago had broken out in bazi to the north which port had then been closed by the merchants for two years in some eighteen months it had burned itself out moving south and eastward bazi had not yet recovered from the economic blow schendis merchant council i supposed could not be blamed for wishing to exercise due caution that a similar calamity did not befall their own port the scribe with ulafi went about his business i with the crew members submitted to the examination of the physician he did little more than look into our eyes and examine our forearms but our eyes were not yellowed nor was there sign of the broken pustules in our flesh two slave girls white barefoot in ragged brown tunics with golden rings in their ears one chewing on a larma came to stand on the wharf near the prow how ugly you are called up one of them to the girls at the rings have you ever been put at the prow called sasi back to them unhesitatingly they did not respond i saw the blondhaired barbarian suspended at her ring suddenly shudder with understanding and then how proud she seemed bound there suddenly she looked up at her bound wrists and the large ring her feet moved rubbing slightly against one another her ankles crossed and bound shifted in the small encircling rope loops which held them closely together the line of her body suspended as she was was very beautiful she looked over at sasi and sasi smiled at her then to my amazement the blond girl though her wrists must have hurt her her weight drawing against them smiled back at sasi then she looked down with contempt at the ragged girls on the wharf you are both homely poor slaves called up one of the girls you are homely poor slaves not we said sasi we are at the prow she looked at them angrily were you ever at the prow again they did not answer can your master not afford to give you a decent tunic asked sasi i smiled for sasi herself did not have a stitch to wear i would have her improve her slave skills considerably before i would let her have so much as a rag i wager your master has you dance for male slaves cried sasi the two girls cried out with rage and the one girl hurled the core of the larma at sasi stinging her on the lower right abdomen piercedear girls cried saul the two girls suddenly looked at one another and sobbing turned and fled from the wharf sasi looked back at me well pleased with herself i had to admit she had handled the two girls well i also recalled that she had once in the voyage begged me to have her own ears pierced that she might be then all the more helplessly and irrevocably a slave i did not know if she had changed her mind on this issue but it did not matter i looked at her yes rings would look well in her ears i would thus have her ears pierced or would do it myself i also looked at the blondhaired girl her ears too i decided would look well with rings in them she would soon have pierced ears set well with golden rings should she come into my ownership the blondhaired girl looked at me and then looked away i was pleased i could see how proud she was to have been found beautiful enough to be put at the prow of a gorean ship perhaps for the first time she was beginning to sense how lovely she truly was how ignorant women are do they not know how beautiful they are do they not know how incredibly exciting they are to men do they not know how they are wanted how fiercely they are desired if only they could see themselves but once through a mans eyes would they not be terrified to leave the house lest they be stripped and put under the iron and collared by the first man who sees them perhaps it is well for women not to know how desirable they are how they might fear men if they but knew i speak of course of the men of gor and those of a gorean nature and yet on gor women who are put in collars do not long remain ignorant of their own beauty and its meaning it is soon taught to them for they are slaves perhaps it is only the slave girl of all women kneeling and owned placed uncompromisingly at the mercy of men who had some sense of her own desirability what woman can begin to understand men who has not been owned by one bring in the slaves said the physician one seaman held sasis rope taut above the deck ring another undid the bowline which fastened the rope to the ring shoka with a hook on a pole drew sasi back to the rail he put aside the pole and one hand about her waist drew her to him lifting her then over the rail he placed her on her back on the deck her ankles still bound her wrists still tied back over her head the physician bent to examine her shoka then retrieved the pole and extended it outward to draw the blondhaired girl back to the rail she was very beautiful her eyes briefly met mine as shoka lifted her over the rail he placed her on her back beside sasi her wrists and ankles like those of sasi still tied her arms like sasis elbows bent were back and over her head oh she cried handled as a slave girl curious the physician touched her again she whimpered squirming shes a hot one said the physician yes said ulafi the girl looked at the physician with horror tears in her eyes but he completed her examination looking into her eyes and examining the interior of her thighs her belly and the interior of her forearms for marks then the physician stood up they are clear he said the ship is clear all may disembark excellent said ulafi the scribe noted the physicians report in his papers and the physician with a marking stick initialed the entry may i wish you good fortune in your business in schendi said ulafi yes thank you captain i said my thanks to you too for a line voyage he nodded thanks too said he for the use of your pretty little darkhaired slave for the prow it is nothing i said i wish you well said he i wish you well said i i bent to sasis bonds and freed her then i took a pair of slave bracelets from my pouch and braceleted her hands behind her back i would have to find lodging put that one said ulafi to a seaman indicating the bound blondhaired girl in sink and chain her to a ring on the wharf we will not have her run away again as she did in port kar yes captain said the man i went and gathered up my sea bag sasi behind me braceleted to my left i heard the blondhaired girl being locked in silk she was then freed of the ropes on her she was pulled to her feet by the chain at her throat that attached to the sink collar the sirik collar was closefitting and would not like a work collar fit over the shipping collar the shipping collar was thrust up her throat under her chin where it would be easy to check the sink collar then had been locked about her throat below it i did not think the girl would be let out of the shipping collar until she had been delivered into the hands of the slaver uchafu who was to be her buyer ulafi commendably was taking no chances with the wench i did not think however that she would be likely to attempt to escape again anyway she had now learned something of her slavery and she had felt the whip too surely she could remember the fed of the scimitar of discipline on her ankles at port kar at the desk of the wharf praetor at a word from ulafi her feet would have been cut off mercifully she had been only whipped thereafter being identified as what she was a slave by brand and collar i did not think she would wish to lose her feet i did not think she would attempt to escape again shoka pulled her down the gangplank and near the ship with a length of chain and a heavy padlock running the chain through the sink chain fastened her to a ring she knelt there on the hot boards she looked up at me naked and chained for an instant i saw again in her eyes the secret slave of her then i saw her eyes try to deny the slave she bit her lip and looked down no no she whispered to herself in english i am not a slave are you going to sell me in schendi asked sasi perhaps i said i will if i wish yes master said sasi the blondhaired girls head was down i supposed the secret slave knew well that her jailer was the blondhaired girl but i did not think the blondhaired girl realized or fully realized that she herself was the slave she so cruelly suppressed the blondhaired girl then timidly lifted her eyes to mine i looked at her gorean men despite her will would free that slave the blondhaired girl would have no choice but to become her deepest fullest and most ancient self the lies of her false civilization cast aside the veneers of her acculturation rent and discarded being of no interest to gorean men who did not share them the deepest and most primitive female animal in her would be liberated she would be made to be a woman frightened the blondhaired girl quickly put down her head she trembled the chains moved she seemed small i continued to look upon her yes she would be made to be a woman and in the fullest sense of the word that of a love slave to strong men i turned to leave master she cried i turned about to again face her do not go she said please do not leave me i do not understand i said take me with you she begged i do not understand i said please buy me she said she looked up at me tears in her eyes lifting her chained hands to me please please master buy me she said he already has a girl said sasi angrily be silent i said to sasi yes master she said do you beg to be purchased i asked the blondhaired girl yes master she said only a slave begs to be purchased i said it is regarded as an acknowledgment of their slavery that they can be bought and sold i am a slave she said yes i said but you do not yet really know it she looked at me you have not yet begun to learn your collar i told her buy me she said teach it to me you tempt me lovely slut i said she looked up at me kiss my feet i told her she did so in her chains kneeling on the hot boards of the wharf at schendi then again she looked up at me another will buy you i told her then i turned away from her we must seek lodging i said to sasi yes master she said i heard the girl behind us cry out in misery and then she screamed though we did not turn to regard her in english i hate you i hate you master and i am not a slave i am not a slave but i remembered the feel of her lips and tongue delicate on my feet the feel of the caress had been unmistakable tier lips and tongue had been those of a slave i am not a slave she cried in english i thought the girl would be useful she would lead me inadvertently to the geographer shaba explorer of lake ushindi discoverer of lake ngao and the ua river she would lead me too not understanding it to the tahari ring it was that which i sought and perhaps too the blood of shaba who had betrayed priestkings the market of uchafu there are many fine slave markets in schendi in particular those of ushanga mkufu utajiri dhahabu fedha marashi hariri kovu and ngoma the market of uchafu on the other hand is not numbered among these one can pick up pot girls and low women there it was thus appropriate i suppose that the blondhaired barbarian ignorant and untrained scarcely able to speak gorean little more than raw collar meat should have been taken there she would attract little attention may i be of assistance to master asked uchafu hobbling toward me supporting himself on a knobbed stick perhaps later i said i am browsing now browse as you will master said uchafu you will find that we have here the finest slaves in all schendi he had lost several teeth and was blind in one eye his robe was filthy and stained with food and blood a long knife unsheathed was thrust into his sash why is that girl blindfolded i asked indicating a girl kneeling with other girls chained under a low palmthatched platform why to keep her quiet master said uchafu i nodded it is a device often used by slavers uchafu then hobbled away buy me master said a girl near me i glanced at her and then passed by moving down the row it was muddy in the market for it had rained yesterday afternoon and evening after our arrival in schendi the air was steamy one could smell the vegetation and jungles behind the port uchafus market was back of the merchant wharves nearer the harbor mouth it was on a canal called the fish canal leading back from the harbor it is adjacent on the south to a large market where river fish are peddled for consumption in schendi these are brought literally through the harbor by canoes moving among the larger ships from the fishing villages of the nyoka and then delivered via the canal to the market there are also a number of small shops in the vicinity the official name of the canal is the tangawizi canal or ginger canal but it is generally called because of the market the fish canal buy me master said another girl as i passed her she was brownskinned and sweetlegged there were only by my conjecture at the time i was in the market of uchafu some two hundred and fifty girls there uchafu was not at his full stock at that time he handled most of his own business but was assisted by four younger men one of whom was his brother in spite of the fact that he was not at full inventory he crowded his girls leaving several of the small opensided palmthatched shelter those about the outer wall a low boarded wall empty most of the girls were black as would be expected from the area but there were some ten or fifteen white girls there and some two girls apparently of oriental or mixed extraction master said a redhaired girl reaching forth her hand timidly not daring to touch me i looked at her fearfully she drew hack her hand i moved farther down the row two black girls shrank back i gathered they were new to their collars i then shifted my attention to another of the small shelters they are some twenty feet long and five feet deep and four feet high two heavy posts are sunk deeply into the ground at each end of each shelter a chain runs between these posts each girl on her left ankle wean an ankle ring with a loop of chain and a lock by means of the loop of chain and lock she is attached to the central chain some of the girls also wore slave bracelets or other devices fastening their hands before or behind their bodies one girl lying on her shoulder in the mud was cruelly trussed hand and foot with binding fiber perhaps she had not been fully pleasing i crouched down beside a thickankled blond girl i pulled her to me by the hair and turned her head to one side i examined her collar the legend had once read i am the girl of kikombe the name kikombe now however for the most part with a set of rough zigzag lines had been scratched out and the name uchafu with a sharp tool had been added i smiled uchafu even used secondhand collars the kurii were clever surely one would not search for a valuable girl in such a market do you like her asked uchafu who had come up near to me again he had kept a close eye on me i had her from kikombe honestly he said i do not doubt it i said i gathered he thought mo possibly an agent tracing smuggled slaves it had not been for no reason that i had seemed to express interest in the thickankled blond do you like white girls asked uchafu yes i said they make superb slaves said uchafu yes i said this one is a beauty he said indicating the girl whose collar i had just examined have you others i asked yes he said have you others with hair of this sort i asked yes he said but he looked at me suddenly warily i looked about over the shelter near us to those at the far wall which were empty you have empty shelters over there i said why do you put so many girls together would it not be better to space them farther apart for purposes of display it is easier to feed and clean them this way he said there is less area to be covered i see i said besides he said later in the month i am expecting deliveries and i will then need that space there were weeds and grass growing about the interior perimeter of the low board fence encircling the market the fence was some four feet high a small wooden hut with a roof thatched with palm leaves at one corner of the compound served as house and office for uchafu and i suspect dormitory for his assistants you seem to have no male slaves i observed they are now scarce in schendi he said bila huruma ubar of lake ushindi uses them for work on his great canal he intends to join lakes ushindi and ngao i have heard i said it is a mad project said uchafu but what can one expect of the barbarians of the interior it would open the ua river to the sea i said if it were successful said uchafu but it will never be accomplished thousands of men have already died they perish in the heat they die in the sun they are killed by hostile tribes they are destroyed by insects they are eaten by tharlarion it is a mad and hopeless venture costly in money and wasteful in human life it must be difficult to obtain so many male slaves i said most who work on the canal are not slaves said uchafu many are debtors or criminals many are simply common men impressed into service victims of work levies imposed on the villages indeed only this year bila huruma has demanded quotas of men from schendi herself these have of course been refused i said we have strengthened our defenses said uchafu reinforcing the palisaded walls which shield schendi from the interior but we must not delude ourselves those walls were built to keep back animals and bands of brigands not an army of thousands of men we are not an armed city not a fortress not a land power we do not even have a navy we are only a merchant port you have of course nonetheless refused the request of bila huruma for men i said if he wishes said uchafu he could enter and burn schendi barbarians from the interior i asked bila huruma has an army at his command organized trained disciplined effective said uchafu he manages a ubarate with districts and governors with courts and spies and messengers i did not know anything of this breadth and power existed in the south i said it is a great ubarate said uchafu but it is little known for it is of the interior i said nothing schendi said he is like a flower at the feet of a kailiauk you have then acceded to his request for men i said yes said uchafu i am sorry i said uchafu shrugged but do not concern yourself with our troubles he said for you are not of schendi he then turned about have you seen the redheaded girl he asked she is very nice yes i said i have seen her i looked about there is a blondhaired girl over there i said indicating the girl in the blindfold kneeling chained crowded together with other girls under one of the small thatched roofs on its poles she was dirty her knees were in the mud her left ankle like that of the other girls was fastened in an ankle ring she like the others was by the loop of chain and lock run through the chain ring on the ankle ring attached to the central chain of her shelter that strung between the two heavy posts one at each end of the shelter she like the others was naked her small hands her wrists secured in slave bracelets by means of a locked chain snug at her waist were held at her belly she could not then reach the blindfold it was of black cloth it covered most of the upper part of her head let me show you these two said uchafu leading me away from the girl in the blindfold she was the only one blindfolded in the market uchafu had told me earlier that it was to keep her quiet what of these asked uchafu yesterday after i had left the blondhaired barbarian at the wharf i had taken lodging at the cove of schendi a rooming house in the vicinity of wharf ten which caters to foreign sailors the rooms were small but adequate with a mattress spread upon the floor a sea chest at one side of the room a low table a tharlarion oil lamp a bowl and pitcher of water and at the foot of the mattress a stout slave ring i threw my sea bag beside the sea chest braceleted sasis hands before her body about the ring left the room locked the door dropped the key in my pouch and made my way downstairs to return inconspicuously to the vicinity of wharf eight where the palms of schendi was disembarking her cargo i did not have long to wait uchafu himself had soon appeared and meeting with ulafi completed the brief transaction which purchased him the blondhaired barbarian shoka removed the shipping collar of the palms of schendi from her neck uchafu then snapped his own collar on her shoka then freed her wrists of the wrist rings of the sirik and uchafu locked a waist chain on her and then about this chain running the linkage of the bracelets behind it braceleted her hands at her belly uchafu then with the black cloth blindfolded her and snapped a lock leash about her collar shoka then removed the sink collar from her and the ankle rings freeing her of the silk he gathered up the sink and he took too unlocking it the chain and padlock which had held her by the silk at the wharf ring he then returned to the palms of schendi uchafu by the leash pulled the braceleted blindfolded girl to her feet and pulled her after him leading her from the wharf i had followed them uchafu as it turned out had not taken a direct route to his market i think the girl even if she had known the streets of schendi would have been utterly confused as to her direction or whereabouts these are nice said uchafu indicating a pair of white blonds these are sisters he said from asperiche you may buy them together or separately as you please the blondhaired barbarian as she knelt frightened in the mud with the other girls still wore her blindfold that which uchafu had placed on her at wharf eight she would have no idea of where she was uchafu undoubtedly because of the prices involved understood that she was of some importance on the other hand i do not think he understood the nature of that importance ulafi i was sure had not either there was no blood that i could see on the interior of the barbarians thighs ulafi too i recalled had not used her nor thrown her to his crew this tended to confirm in my mind that they did not understand the nature of her importance perhaps a rich man an eccentric of some sort desired her perhaps he would not be pleased or would not pay if she were not delivered to him white silk i smiled to myself if ulafi or uchafu truly understood the nature of the girls importance that it had nothing to do with her being red silk or white silk she would doubtless by now have been richly and abundantly raped more than a hundred times by now i expected had they but known she would have thrashed and squirmed gasping held in the arms of strong men her slave beauty the helpless lascivious wine on which mighty masters would slake the thirsts of their lust what do you think of them inquired uchafu indicating the two blondhaired sisters from asperiche both were blueeyed they crouched in the mud chained beneath the palmthatched roof of the tiny shelter what can you do i asked them they looked at one another frightened one whimpered uchafu angrily raised the heavy knobbed stick he carried whatever master desires said one of the girls whatever master desires said the other girl quickly what of that one over there i asked casually indicating the blondhaired barbarian in a shelter some feet away diagonally to my left these are beauties said uchafu indicating the two sisters the blonds from asperiche buy one or both he said but i had begun to walk toward the blondhaired barbarian uchafu hurried along behind me and seized my sleeve stopping me no he said not her why i asked as though puzzled she has already been sold he said how much did you get i asked fifteen copper tarsks he said he had put the price a bit high for this girl and this market that was i supposed to discourage me i recalled she had had an honest bid on her once at the market of vart once publius quintus of ar in port kar a bid from the tavern keeper procopius of forty copper tarsks she had received this bid of course only after her unusual heat for a new slave had been made clear i will give you sixteen i told him uchafu looked annoyed i did not permit myself to smile i knew that he had not yet sold the girl for she was still on his chain he was waiting for his buyer further i knew from ulafi he would have paid two tarsks of silver for her he would doubtless receive three or four silver tarsks from the awaited buyer but then he smiled and shrugged oh misery for a poor merchant said he i could have received sixteen for her and sold her for fifteen misery but i cannot now renege upon my word sadly enough for i am a merchant of wellknown integrity much as i would love to sell her to you for sixteen tarsks i must let her go to a previous buyer for fifteen such is occasionally the sad lot of one who has made the difficult choice and will abide by it of dealing straightforwardly and honestly with all men whomsoever they may be i had not realized that integrity could be such a handicap i said ah yes he moaned but perhaps your reputation as a noble and honest merchant will yet in the long run redound to your profit as well as your honor let us hope so he said you are one of the most honest slavers i have ever met i said my thanks master breathed he bowing low i wish you well said i i wish you well said he i then left his market i think then he realized that i had not bought a girl we will have more in at the end of the week he called come again i waved to him from the other side of the low board fence what occurred in the golden kailiauk hurry hurry clumsy slave cried the small scarred man crookedbacked his right leg dragging behind him he wore a dirty tunic over it was a long brown aba torn and ragged he was barefoot a brown cloth turbanlike was twisted about his head he seemed angry his feet and legs and those of the slave were muddy and dirty from the mud in the streets hurry he cried oh she cried sobbing in the blindfold driven before him struck again by the long switch in his right hand oh oh she cried please dont hit me again master then she cried out again stumbling and weeping before him struck twice more i followed at a discreet distance i had observed her sale by means of a glass of the builders from a roof top near uchafus market i had then telescoped the glass and slipped it into my pouch i had seen silver exchange hands but i did not know precisely how many pieces had been paid as the buyers back as be turned was then toward me hurry he cried he struck her again yes master she cried he was dressed as a beggar but i did not think him of that profession too beggars do not buy slave girls or openly buy them i was sure the man was an agent of kurii he struck her again and again she stumbled on before him she still wore her blindfold that black cloth covering most of the upper portion of her head she had never seen i knew uchafus market and she did not know where she was being driven all she had seen of schendi was the harbor and wharf then she had been blindfolded she stumbled on miserably before her herder her small hands were still secured at her belly but now by binding fiber her wrists had been crossed and bound and then the long end of the fiber had been taken about her body and tied again to her wrists this way she could not still reach the blindfold and her back was fully exposed as was doubtless intended for the stroke of the herding switch uchafus collar had been removed from her in the market and another collar had been snapped on her throat i had not of course had a chance to read it please do not strike me any more master she begged stumbling i am hurrying i am hurrying then she stumbled against a free woman who in fury screamed at her and began to strike and kick at her she fell to her knees and put her head down forgive me mistress she begged forgive me the free woman angrily continued on her way get up snarled the herdsman the girl tried to get up but her foot slipped in the mud and she fell to her side instantly the man was on her with the switch lashing down at her get up you worthless white slut he cried she struggled to her feet yes master yes master she wept hurry he cried he struck her again which way she cried disoriented she looked about blindly her feet in the mud oh oh she cried richly struck and then fell to her knees sobbing helpless he pulled her to her feet by the left arm and thrust her ahead of him down the street hurry he commanded he struck her again yes master she sobbed and again stumbled on before him a blindfolded herded slave girl i looked behind me occasionally but i saw only the normal occupants and passersby of the streets of schendi i wore the garb now of a leather worker if inquiries had been made it would be recalled that he who had arrived in the palms of schendi had been at least ostensibly of the metal workers in here worthless slave said the man and taking the girl by the arm thrust her through the doors of a paga tavern the golden kailiauk he took her over beside a wall across from the main door and close to a small side door lie down here he told her she lay down on the wooden floor on your side he said pull your knees up under your chin she then lay there small her knees drawn up he hurled his brown aba over her covering her completely and limped out through the small side door does master desire aught asked a black girl kneeling before me a paga slave of the establishment paga i said to her she rose to her feet and went to the vat behind the counter i sat down crosslegged behind a low table from which vantage point i could see the girl lying on the floor she covered with the beggars aba i assumed her herdsman had delivered her to this tavern that she be picked up by someone else i nursed the paga making it last but no one seemed to come for her i began to be apprehensive that perhaps some mistake had occurred what if ulafi had been mistaken about the girl what if he had not really received two tarsks from uchafu for her what if the beggar had made a serious purchase of the girl on behalf of the tavern keeper what if she were merely being delivered here to be trained as a mere paga girl i glanced around there was only one other white girl in the tavern a darkhaired girl collared in yellow pleasure silk she too apparently a paga slave like the black girls waiting on the tables perhaps the tavern keeper only wanted another white girl to add variety for his clientele i looked at the blondhaired girl lying hidden under the aba she did not dare to move but no i recalled clearly that silver had exchanged hands in her sale there was no mistake i must wait i ordered another cup of paga i played a game of kaissa with another guest of the tavern the paga tasted a bit strange but it was a local paga and there is variation in such pagas generally a function of the brewers choice of herbs and grains from time to time i glanced at the girl under the aba i used the telnus defense on the fellow a response to his ubaras gambit which i thought might be unknown in schendi as it had first been seen only last spring at the fair of enkara near the sardar mountains he met it squarely however and i myself no centius of cos was soon involved in perplexing difficulties i did manage narrowly to eke out a win in the endgame i did not expect you would handle my response to your ubaras spearman to ubara five as you did i told him you were obviously using the telnus defense he said you have heard of it i asked i have read more than a hundred analyses of it he said do you think we are barbarians in schendi he asked no i said i congratulate you he said you are quite skilled at kaissa i did not play my best game i said no one ever does he said perhaps you are right i said you are a fine player i said thank you for the game he shook hands and left he seemed a nice fellow those who play kaissa are good chaps i glanced once more at the girl under the aba i blinked once or twice my eyes felt a bit strange scratchy my forearms too and belly felt a little itchy i scratched them master asked one of the girls a black girl with high regal cheekbones more paga i said yes master she said in another ahn some musicians arrived shortly thereafter as the tavern grew more crowded they began to play my thigh felt irritated i dug at it with my fingernails i watched the whiteskinned darkhaired girl collared serving cups to a distant table she was nicely legged a skirl on a flute and a sudden pounding on twin tabors small hand drums called my attention to the square of sand at the side of which sat the musicians i then gave my attention to the dancer a sweetly hipped black girl in yellow beads she was skillful and i suspected from the use of the hands and beads had been trained in ianda a merchant island north of anango certain figures are formed with the hands and heads which have symbolic meaning much of which was lost upon me as i was not familiar with the conventions involved some however i had seen before and had been explained to me one was that of the free woman another of the whip another of the yielding collared slave another was that of the thieving slave girl and another that of the girl summoned terrified before the master each of these with the music and followed by its dance expression was very well done women are beautiful and they make fantastic dancers one of the figures done was that of a girl a slave who encounters one who is afflicted with plague she a slave knows that if she should contract the disease she would in all probability be summarily slain she dances her terror at this this was followed by the figure of obedience and that by the figure of joy i looked about and did not see any longer the whiteskinned darkhaired girl she who had been serving paga i was growing irritated and a little drunk it seemed to me that by now surely the blondhaired barbarian should have been picked up i glanced again at the aba by the wall i could still see beneath it the lusciousness of a girls curves what marvelous slaves they make suddenly i howled with rage and threw over the small table behind which i sat i in two strides was at the aba and i tore it away master screamed the girl beneath it looking up frightened it was not the blondhaired barbarian it was the whiteskinned darkhaired girl collared in her bit of pleasure silk who had been serving paga i pulled her to her knees by the hair where is the other girl i demanded where what is going on here cried the proprietor of the tavern who had come in earlier and was now behind the counter ladling out paga one of the paga attendants came running toward me but seeing my eyes hesitated several men were now on their feet the musicians had stopped playing the dancer stood still on the sand startled where is the girl who was under this aba i demanded where what girl was it asked the proprietor whose was she she was brought in by kunguni when you were out said one of the black girls i gave orders that he was not again to be admitted to this tavern said the man you were not here moaned the girl we feared to tell a free man he could not enter where were you called the proprietor to the attendant i was in the kitchen he said i did not know she had been brought in by kunguni angrily i threw the girl i held from me who saw her leave with whom i demanded men looked at one another how came you beneath the aba i asked the girl whom i had thrown to one side a man told me to creep beneath it she said i did not see him he told me not to look around you are lying i told her be merciful master she said i am only a slave the paga attendant he who was closest to me of the crowd was looking at me intently i did not understand this he edged uneasily backward i did not understand this i had not threatened him a silver tarsk to the man who can find me that girl i said the black girls looked at one another she was only a pot girl said one of them a silver tarsk i said repeating my offer to he who can find me that slave look at his eyes said the paga attendant backing away another step she could not have been gone long i must hunt her in the streets suddenly the dancer on the sand threw her hands before her face and screamed then she pointed at me it is the plague she cried it is the plague the paga attendant stumbling turned and ran plague he cried men fled from the tavern i stood alone by the wall tables had been overturned paga was spilled upon the floor the tavern seemed suddenly eerily quiet even the paga girls had fled i could hear shouting outside in the streets and screaming call guardsmen i heard kill him i heard kill him i walked over to a mirror i ran my tongue over my lips they seemed dry the whites of my eyes clearly were yellow i rolled up the sleeve of my tunic and saw there on the flesh of the forearm like black blisters broken open erupted a scattering of pustules i decide to change my lodgings master cried sasi do not fear i said to her i am not ill but we must leave this place quickly your face she said it is marked it will pass i said i unlocked her bracelets and slipped them into my pouch i fear i may be traced here i said we must change lodgings i had left the paga tavern by a rear door and then swung myself up to a low roof and then climbed to a higher one i had made my way over several roofs until i had found a convenient and lonely place to descend i had then wrapped in the discarded aba of kunguni made my way through the streets to the cove of schendi outside from the wharves and from the interior of the city i could hear the ringing of alarm bars plague men were crying in the streets are you not ill master asked sasi i do not think so i said i knew that i had not been in a plague area too the bazi plague had burned itself out years ago no cases to my knowledge had been reported for months most importantly perhaps i simply did not feel ill i was slightly drunk and heated from the paga but i did not believe myself fevered my pulse and heartbeat and respiration seemed normal i did not have difficulty catching my breath i was neither dizzy nor nauseous and my vision was clear my worst physical symptoms were the irritation about my eyes and the genuinely nasty itchiness of my skin i felt like tearing it off with my own fingernails are you of the metal workers or the leather workers she asked let us not bother about that now i said knotting the cords on the sea bag i looked about the room aside from sasi what i owned there was either on my person or in the sea bag a girl likes to know the caste of her master she said let us be on our way i said perhaps it is the merchants she said how would you like to be whipped i asked her i would not like that she said let us hurry i said you do not have time to whip me now do you she asked no i said i do not i thought not she said i do not think it is the peasants i could always whip you later i said that is true she agreed perhaps i should best he quiet that is an excellent insight on your part said thank you master she said if i am caught and it is thought that i have the plague i said you will doubtless be exterminated before i am let us not dally she said we left the room you have strong hands she said is it the potters no i said i thought it might be she said be silent i said yes master she said i make inquiries of kipofu who is ubar of the beggars of schendi the blind man lifted his white sightless eyes to me his thin black hand clawlike extended itself i placed a tarsk bit in his hand you are kipofu i asked i placed another tarsk bit in his hand he put these two tiny coins in a small shallow copper bowl before him he was sitting crosslegged on a flat rectangular stone broad and heavy about a foot high at the western edge of the large utukufu or glory square the stone was his etem or sitting place he was ubar of the beggars of schendi i am kipofu he said it is said i said that though you are blind there is little which you do not see in schendi he smiled he rubbed his nose with his thumb i would obtain information i said to him i am only a poor blind man he said he spread his hands apologetically there is little that transpires in schendi which can escape your notice i told him information can be expensive he said i can pay i told him i am only a poor and ignorant man he said i can pay well i told him what do you wish to know he asked he sat on his etem in brown rags a brown cloth wound about his head to protect him from the sun there were sores upon his body dirt was crusted upon his legs and arms the peel of a larma lay by one knee he was blind and half naked and filthy but i knew him to be the ubar of the beggars of schendi he had been chosen by them to rule over them some said that he had been chosen to rule over them because only he was blind and thus could not see how repulsive they were before him the deformed and maimed the disfigured and crippled might stand as men as subject before sovereign to be heard with objectivity and obtain a dispassionate and honest justice neither to be dismissed with contempt or demeaningly gratified by the indulgence of one who holds himself above them but if there were truth in this i think there was too a higher truth involved kipofu though avaricious and petty in many respects had in him something of the sovereign he was a highly intelligent man and one who could upon occasion be wise as well as shrewd he was a man of determination and of iron will and vision it was he who had first effectively organized the beggars of schendi stabilizing their numbers and distributing and allotting their territories none might now beg in schendi without his permission and none might transgress the territory of another and each each week paid his tax to kipofu the inevitable price of government these taxes though doubtless much went to the shrewd kipofu for monarchs expect to be well paid for bearing the burdens and tribulations of office served to obtain benefits and insurances for the governed no beggar now in schendi was truly without shelter or medical care or needed go hungry each tended to look out for the others through the functioning of the system it was said that even members of the merchant council occasionally took kipofu into their confidence one consequence of the organization of the beggars incidentally was that schendi did not have many beggars obviously the fewer beggars there are the more alms there are for each one unwanted beggars had the choice of having their passage paid from schendi or concluding their simple careers in the harbor i seek information i said on one who seemed a beggar who was called kunguni pay said kipofu i put another tarsk bit into his hand pay said kipofu i put yet another tarsk bit into his hand none in schendi who begs is known as kunguni he said permit me to describe the man to you i said how would i know of these things asked kipofu i drew forth a silver tarsk kipofu i knew through the organization of the beggars their covering of territories and their reports as well as his use of them as messengers and spies was perhaps the most informed man in schendi he like a clever spider in its web was the center of an intelligence network that might have been the envy of many a ubar there were few tremors in schendi which did not sooner or later reach kipofu on his simple etem in the square that is a silver tarsk i said i pressed it into his palm ah he said he weighed the coin in his hand and felt its thickness he ran his finger about its edge to determine that it had not been shaved he tapped it on the etem and though it was not gold he put it in his mouth touching its surface with his tongue and biting against its resistance it is of port kar he said he had too pressed his thumb against the coin on both sides feeling the ship and on the reverse the sign of port kar its initials in the same script that occurred on her home stone this man i said is small and has a crooked back hunched he has a scar on his left cheek he limps dragging his right leg behind him the blood seemed suddenly to drain from kipofus face he turned a shade paler he stiffened he lifted his head listening intently i looked about none were close to us no one is near us i said i had little doubt that kipofu who was reputed to have extremely sharp senses might have heard breathing within a radius of twenty feet even in the square i wondered at the nature of the man the mention of whom might have caused this reaction in the shrewd kipofu his back is crooked and it is not said kipofu his back is hunched and it is not his face is scarred and it is not his leg is crippled and it is not do you know who this man is i asked him do not seek him said kipofu forget him flee who is he i asked kipofu pressed the coin back at me take your tarsk said he i want to know i said determinedly kipofu suddenly lifted his hand listen said he listen i listened there is one about he said i looked about no i said there is not there said kipofu pointing there but i saw nothing where he pointed there is nothing there i said there whispered kipofu pointing i thought him perhaps mad but i walked in the direction which he had pointed i encountered nothing then the hair on the back of my neck rose as i realized what it might have been it is gone now said kipofu i returned to the etem of the ubar of the beggars he was visibly shaken go away he said i would know who the man is i said go away said kipofu take your tarsk he held it out to me what do you know of the golden kailiauk i asked it is a paga tavern said kipofu what do you know of a white slave girl who works within it i asked pembe he said who is the proprietor of the tavern has not owned a whiteskinned girl in months ah i said take back your tarsk said kipofu keep it i told him you have told me much of what i wanted to know i then turned about and strode away taking my leave from the presence of kipofu that unusual ubar of the beggars of schendi shaba the girl stood at the heavy wooden door on the dark street and knocked sharply four times followed by a pause and then twice a tiny tharlarionoil lamp burned near the door i could see her dark hair and high cheekbones in the light the yellow light too flickering in the shadows glinted on the steel collar beneath her hair she wore a tan slave tunic sleeveless of knee length rather demure for a bond girl it did however have a plunging neckline setting off the collar well she repeated the knock precisely as before she was barefoot in her hand wadded up was a tiny scrap of yellow slave silk which had been her uniform in the tavern of pembe she was not a bad looking girl her hair darkbrown was of shoulder length her accent as i had detected yesterday evening in the golden kailiauk was barbarian something in it when she had cried out or spoken to me suggested that she might be familiar with english i had little doubt she had been affiliated with he who had called himself kunguni she had simulated the appearance of the blondhaired barbarian beneath the brown aba her face and body when she had protested her innocence to me had belied her words i had learned from kipofu that she was not owned by pembe proprietor of the golden kailiauk doubtless for a fee paid by her master if she were a slave she had been permitted to serve in his place of business sometimes masters do this sort of thing for their girls it is cheaper than renting space for them in the public or private pens pembe would not be likely to think anything amiss i stood back in the shadows a tiny panel in the door slid back then it shut a moment later the door opened i saw in the light briefly the scarred face and bent back hunched of he who had called himself kunguni he looked about but did not see me concealed in the shadows the girl slipped past him and entered the door it then shut i looked about and then crossed the narrow street i glanced at the shuttered windows i could see cracks of light between the wooden slats inside not far from the door i could see the girl and the man the room or anteroom was dingy is he here yet asked the girl yes said the man he is waiting inside good she said it is our hope said the man that you will be more successful this evening than last i can get nothing out of her if she knows nothing snapped the girl that is true said the man the girl took the bit of wadded yellow pleasure silk she carried in her hand and straightening it a bit slipped it on a narrow wooden rod in an open closet disgusting garment she said a girl might as well be naked a lovely garment said the man but i agree with your latter sentiment she looked at him angrily did many ask for you tonight he asked or did pembe have to inform them that you were not for use none asked she said angrily interesting he said why is it interesting she asked not pleasantly i do not know he said it just seems that your face and body would be of interest to men but apparently they are not i can be attractive if i wish she said i doubt it he said behold she said striking a pose it is fraudulent he said women such as you understand nothing of attractiveness with you it is a matter of externals of acting any true man sees through it immediately you confuse the pretense with the truth the artificial and imitative with the reality you think you could become attractive but merely choose not to be so it is a delusion as you understand these things this permits you to console yourself with lies and at the same time provides you with an excuse for despising and belittling the truly attractive woman thinking she is merely as you would be if you were she acting but it is not true the source of a womans attractiveness is within her it is internal it comes from the inside out she is vulnerable and desires men and wishes to be touched and owned this then shows in her body and movements and in her eyes and face that is the truly attractive woman like that shesleen in the other room asked the woman she has felt the whip and known male domination he said have you no she said i took the liberty of caressing our lovely bound captive a bit before you arrived he said she is quite hot i hate that sort of woman said the girl she is weak she is a slave and i am not i saw the man smile tonight if she knows anything said the girl i will get it out of her i am sure you will he said i then saw the girl to my surprise remove a tiny key from her tunic permit me he said thank you no she said acidly then she lifting her arms fitted the key into the lock at the back of her collar this action lifted the line of her breasts which was lovely and lifted the tan slave tunic a bit higher on her thighs she was nicely legged as i had noted before you neednt look at me as i do this she said forgive me he said and turned away he smiled he began to undo certain buckles attached to leather straps within his own tunic she removed the collar and set it on a shelf in the closet with the key a collar she said how barbaric it is to put women in collars she shuddered i saw to my surprise that the man he who had been called kunguni drew forth from beneath his tunic a sewn padded mound of cloth heavy globelike with dangling straps he then straightened his back he was not tall but he stood now slim and straight his right leg too now did not seem to afflict him he stood straight upon it with the thumb and first finger of his right hand he peeled a cunning jagged streak of paste and ocher from his left cheek removing what i had taken to be a scar i recalled the words of kipofu his back is crooked and it is not his back is hunched and it is not his face is scarred and it is not his leg is crippled and it is not but i did not know who he might be do not seek him had said kipofu forget him flee how long must i continue this farce of feigned service at the golden kailiauk she asked tonight said the man was your last of feigned service there excellent she said he smiled if you would now excuse me she said coolly i would like to slip into something suitable for a woman he looked at her more suitable than this tunic she said slave tunic he said yes slave tunic she said irritably are all women on your former world like you he asked not enough she said how i pity the men of such a place he said true women will teach them how to act and be she said what piteous fools he said what did you mean my former world she asked it is still my world the trace of a smile moved at the corners of the mouth of the man who had been called kunguni if you will now excuse me she said i would like to change i shall await you with him in the other room he said very well she said when you come said he bring your whip i will she said the man then left the small anteroom closing its door behind him and the woman reached to the wooden rods in the closet on which garments hung i could not see into the other room from where i stood nor did it obviously have windows i backed into the dark street and then a few feet away saw a low sloping roof most of the buildings of schendi have wooden ventilator shafts at the roof which may be opened and closed these are often kept open that the hot air in the room rising may escape they can be closed by a rod from the floor in the case of rain or during the swarming seasons for various insects in a few moments i had hoisted myself up to the low roof and then again climbing i eased myself onto the roof of the building in which the man and woman had been conversing there was a ventilator shaft or slatted grille over the main room as i had anticipated there is generally one room at least in which this arrangement occurs otherwise indoor living in schendi could be difficult to bear i could look down into the room some fifteen feet below through the slats in the grille i could not from my position see the entire room i could not see most importantly the figure whom i gathered from the conversation and glances of the man and woman sat at the far end of the room behind a small table i saw upon occasion the movement of his hands long and black with delicate fingers i could see however the man who had been called kunguni and the woman who had worn the tan slave tunic i could also see kneeling on a dark blanket naked her ankles tied her hands tied to her collar her head down still blindfolded the blondhaired barbarian i am sorry i am late said the girl who had worn the tan slave tunic pembe kept me later than i pleased to finish serving paga to a drunken oarsman what sacrifices we must make in the prosecution of our arduous mission mused the fellow who had been called kunguni the girl looked at him angrily she now wore interestingly tight black slacks and a black buttoned top i could also see she wore earth undergarments on her feet were wooden clogs her clothing seemed strikingly at odds with her setting she apparently had little sensitivity to the aesthetic incongruities involved or perhaps she wished merely to reassure herself by this device that she was truly of earth and not gor i had thought the slave tunic and collar had made her fit in better with her surroundings they seemed more apt more tasteful more appropriate they had been i recalled right upon her but are they not right upon any woman in any world there were two other men in the room and i gazed upon them with some astonishment they were large fellows strong and lean dressed in skins and golden armlets and feathers they carried high oval shields and short longbladed stabbing spears these men i was sure were not of schendi they came from somewhere i was sure in the interior the blondhaired barbarian blindfolded frightened lifted her head her lower lip trembled the fellow who had been called kunguni crouched before the girl and quickly jerked loose the knot which held her bound hands which were still tied tethered at her collar he held her bound wrists in one hand please do not hurt me any more she said in english i have told you all i know with his right hand holding the girls tied wrists in his left the man tossed a rope up over a rafter he tied it then to her bound wrists about the cording which secured them he then signaled to the two large fellows who stood nearby they put aside their shields and short spears and hauling on the rope jerked the blondhaired barbarian to her feet please she wept ive told you all i know at a signal from the man near her the two large fellows drew the girl from her feet until she hung suspended some six inches from the floor begin said the voice of the unseen man he behind the table he spoke in gorean the girl in the slacks and black buttoned top swung loose the blades of the slave whip she carried she touched the blades to the body of the suspended girl do you know what this is she asked a slave whip mistress said the girl in english their conversation was conducted entirely in english the two girls i gathered were the only ones in the room who spoke english the girl in the black slacks did however of course translate here and there what the blondhaired barbarian said she herself of course inevitably communicated with the men in gorean speak said the girl in the black slacks i have told you all i know wept the blondhaired barbarian please do not beat me again speak said the girl in the black slacks touching the other girl lightly with the whip my name is janice prentiss she said your name was janice prentiss corrected the girl with the whip yes mistress said the suspended girl i was recruited in be silent said the girl with the whip yes mistress moaned the girl then the girl in the black slacks suddenly lashed her with the whip the blond girl cried out with misery twisting helplessly on the rope her toes some six inches or so from the floor speak said the girl in the black slacks mistress cried the blond girl she was struck again mistress wept the blond girl speak of important things of the ring and the papers she snarled yes mistress yes mistress wept the blond the girl in black slacks prepared to strike her again but he who had been called kunguni lifted his hand and she lowered her arm angrily i saw that she enjoyed punishing the blond girl for some reason it seemed she hated her the ring and the papers she said notes of some sort and two letters i received in cos from one called belisarius i took passage for schendi on the blossoms of telnus a ship of cos we fell to pirates on the high seas i think they were of port kar we were boarded fighting was fierce but brief our ship was then theirs i and other women placed in a net were swung to the deck of the pirate ship on its deck we were stripped and put in chains we were then carried below where we were fastened to rings i was later sold in port kar i was purchased by the merchant ulafi of schendi he brought me slave to this port the girl in the black slacks struck her twice with the whip and the suspended slave striped by the blows dangled shaken sobbing before her the ring the papers said the girl in the black slacks i was captured wept the girl i was put on another ship i was chained in a dark hold with other women naked i do not know what happened to anything have pity on a slave the girl in the black slacks drew back her hand again again to strike with a fivebladed lash but he who had been called kunguni motioned for her not to strike he spoke in gorean to the girl in the black slacks what was the name of the ship which captured the blossoms of telnus she asked who was its captain i do not know wept the blond girl i do not even know in what market i was sold it was the sleen of port kar said he who had been called kunguni captained by the rogue bejar of that port watching through the wooden slats above i smiled bejar in my opinion was one of the most responsible decent and serious captains in port kar we had this through uchafu the slaver who had spoken to ulafi said the man ulafi should have been recruited said the darkhaired girl he will do anything for gold except betray his merchant codes said he who was called kunguni i was pleased to hear this for i was rather fond of the tall regal ulafi apparently they did not regard him as a likely fellow to be used in the purchase of stolen notes on speculation to be resold later to their rightful owner many merchants i was sure would not have been so squeamish such dealings of course would encourage the theft of notes it was for this reason that they were forbidden by the codes such notes their loss reported are to be canceled and replaced with alternative notes let us send a ship to port kar said the darkhaired girl to obtain the ring and papers from bejar do not be a fool said he who was called kunguni by now bejar has doubtless disposed of the ring which would be meaningless to him and has sold the notes perhaps he would give them to an agent said the girl to be brought to schendi for sale to shaba he would sell them said the man he would choose to realize a sure profit an agent might betray him too an agent carrying the notes might be dealt with in schendi not with gold but steel they are then lost said the girl but we retain the true ring said the man belisarius in cos if he learns of the loss of the blossoms of telnus will doubtless contact his superiors who will act a new false ring may be fabricated and new notes prepared if he learns said the girl it could take months admitted the man then he turned to face the figure seated behind the low table whom i could not see you could take the ring to cos to belisarius he said i am not a fool he said the notes must come first to schendi as you wish said he who had been called kunguni but he said shuddering they may come for it they asked the seated figure they who desire it said he who had been called kisuguni i do not fear them said the seated figure i have heard they are not like men said he who had been called kunguni i do not fear them said the man behind the table give me the ring said he who had been called kunguni i will keep it safe i am not a fool said the other bring me the notes what of her asked the girl in black slacks gesturing with the whip to the suspended blond slave i think she has told us willingly and helplessly all that she knows said he who had been called kunguni what shall we now do with her asked the girl in slacks he who had been called kunguni looked at the suspended blond slave he looked at her carefully considering her she is pretty he said let her live he signaled to the two large fellows those clad in skins and feathers and armlets of gold and said something briefly to them i did not understand the language in which he spoke it was neither english nor gorean they lowered the blond to the floor and took the rope from her wrists by which she had been suspended they then took the cording from her wrists which had tied them together and with the same cording fastened them behind her back they then threw her to her stomach untied her ankles and snapped shackles on them steel shackles with about a sixinch run of chain they then threw her on her knees on the dark blanket on which i had originally seen her they slipped one end of the rope by which she had been suspended under her collar and pulled it some ten feet through roughly at the side of her neck this double strand they then took some two and a half feet behind her they looped it about a slave ring set there in the wall one of four about a yard above the floor and tied it there the long free ends falling loose coiling to the floor she blindfolded and shackled her wrists bound behind her her neck tethered to a ring was well secured what a miserable worthless thing you are said the girl with the whip to her yes mistress said the blond girl her lip trembling observe said he who had been called kunguni to the darkhaired girl with the whip then to the blond he said sharply nadu immediately as she could the girl assumed the position of the pleasure slave her hands of course were tied behind her despicable slave said the darkhaired girl yes mistress wept the blond the darkhaired girl then drew back the whip to strike her but he who had been called kunguni caught her wrist in the black sleeve of her blouse no he said the whip will be used later he then released her wrist excellent she said i shall look forward to it and i as well said he the girl looked with hatred at the blond i smiled to myself i did not think they had need any longer of the services of the darkhaired girl her translations i must admit had been fluent and accurate i then slipped back from the wooden slats moved back on the roof and quietly lowered myself to the first roof a low one and from there down to the street i spun about i faced the short stabbing spears of the two huge blacks they had slipped out the front door to receive me the door opened again and in the light i saw the face of be who had been called kunguni come in said he we have been expecting you i straightened up i bear in my tunic i said two letters which should make my business clear to you move carefully suggested he who had been called kunguni slowly watching the points of the two stabbing spears i drew forth the two letters i had not carried with me of course either the ring or the notes i handed the two letters to the man at the door he glanced at them one of them i said is for a man named msaliti i am msaliti said the man who had been called kunguni come in he said i followed him into the building through the small anteroom and into the larger room which i had seen through the wooden grille in the ceiling the two large fellows in skins and feathers with golden armlets entered behind me inside i saw to one side the blindfolded whipped slave she had revealed eagerly helplessly sobbing all she knew she still knelt beautifully in the position of the pleasure slave she had not been given permission to break position the other girl the darkhaired girl with the whip seemed startled at my entrance she had not expected me the men i understood had not taken her into their confidence i did not greet her she was the sort of woman who is best greeted by throwing her upon her back and raping her i looked at the man who sat crosslegged behind the table lie was a large tall man he had long thin hands with delicate fingers his face seemed refined but his eyes were hard and piercing i did not think he was of the warriors but i had little doubt he was familiar with the uses of steel i had seldom seen a face which at once suggested such sensitivity but at the same time reflected such intelligence and uncompromising will following the lines of his cheekbones there was a stitching of tribal tattooing he wore a robe of green and brown with slashes of black against the background of jungle growth blending with plants and shadows it would be difficult to detect he also wore a low round flattopped cap of similar material on the first finger of his left hand he wore a fang ring which i had little doubt would contain a poison probably that of the deadly kanda plant the second letter which i had handed msaliti lay now on the table before the man that letter i said is for shaba the geographer of anango he picked up the letter i am shaba he said the geographer of anango business is discussed in schendi i acquire a new girl i have come to negotiate for the ring i said do you have the false ring and the notes with you asked shaba no i said are they in schendi asked shaba perhaps i said do you have the ring with you perhaps smiled shaba i did not doubt that he had the ring with him such an artifact would be far too valuable to leave lying about having the ring with him too of course he was terribly dangerous do you come to us as an agent on behalf of bejar a captain of port kar inquired shaba perhaps i said no said shaba you do not for you know of the rings value and bejar would know nothing of it he looked at me a similar argument would demonstrate he said that you are not a simple speculator interested in the resale of the notes i shrugged you could always wait in such a case for their cancellation and reissue i said yes he said providing they would be reissued and we had months in which to daily you have a project afoot i asked perhaps said shaba and you wish to move ahead on it quickly i asked yes he said it is perhaps imperative for you to move quickly i asked i think so said shaba he smiled what is your project i asked msaliti was looking at him curiously it is personal business said shaba i see i said since said shaba you come neither from bejar nor as a simple speculator i think we may infer that you come to us from one of two sources you come to us either from kuriior from priestkings i glanced uneasily at the two large fellows those with the shields and stabbing spears who stood near us do not fear said msaliti my askaris do not speak gorean the word askari is an inland word which may be translated roughly as soldier or guardsman regardless from which camp i come i said you have what we wish the ring the ring said msaliti may not be returned to priestkings it must go to kurii i will bring with me when i return of course i said the false ring that it may be borne to the sardar he is with us said msaliti no agent of priestkings would wish the ring conveyed to the sardar this confirmed in my mind the soundness of the speculation of samos that the false ring involved some serious threat or danger you will then of course i said to shaba as an agent of priestkings bear the ring to the sardar do you not think it is a little late for that now inquired shaba we must try that is the plan said msaliti earnestly you must carry out your part of the bargain said the darkhaired girl shaba looked at her be silent said msaliti angrily to her she drew back angry you do not look like one who would serve kurii said shaba to me smiling you do not look like one who would betray priestkings i said to him ah he said leaning back how difficult and subtle are the natures of men he mused how did you find us here asked the girl he followed you of course you little fool said msaliti why do you think you were kept another night at the tavern of pembe you could have told me she said msaliti did not respond to her how did you know i was on the roof i asked the askaris had been waiting for me it is an old schendi trick said shaba look up there do you see those tiny strings those little threads yes i said there were several about a foot in length dangling from the ceiling at the end of each there was a tiny round object it is not uncommon for burglars to enter houses through these grilles said shaba those are dried peas on threads they are inserted under certain boards and in certain cracks in the ceiling when the roof is stepped on the tiny movements in the ceiling boards and the pressures release the peas it is then known that someone is on or has been on the roof it gives a silent warning i said yes he said the house owner may then if he wishes warn the intruder away or if he wishes fall upon him when he enters the house what if the dwellers in the house are asleep i asked small bells are attached to the grille slats said shaba which dangle down near the ears of the sleepers if one attempts to cut the strings or draw the bells up of course a noise is made one usually sufficient to waken the occupants of the house that is clever i said actually said shaba you did extremely well only a few of the threads have been dislodged your step was light indeed none were dislodged apparently until you withdrew from the roof i nodded to be sure i had withdrawn from the slatted grille with less care than i had approached it i had feared little in my retreat i had thought it secure i had not known about the simple device of the threads and peas why was i not told that i was to be followed asked the girl be silent said msaliti she stiffened angrily you eluded me brilliantly in the tavern of pembe the golden kailiauk i told msaliti the exchanging of the girls was ingenious he shrugged and smiled it required of course he said the aid of shaba and the ring of course i said i did my part well too said the girl yes you did i said she looked triumphantly at the men you took the girl into the tavern i said and covered her with your aba that she might not move shaba under the cover of the ring drugged the paga which i drank when my attention was distracted he under the cover of the ring carried away the blond girl and this female by prearranged plan took her place yes said shaba my pursuit of you was foiled i said by the results of the drug you placed in my paga the drug said shaba was a simple combination of sajel a simple pustulant and gieron an unusual allergen mixed they produce a facsimile of the superficial symptoms of bazi plague i could have been killed i said by the mob i did not think many would care to approach you said shaba it was not your intention then that i be killed i asked certainly not said shaba if that was all that was desired kanda might have been introduced into your drink as easily as sajel and gieron that is true i said we only wished to make certain that you did not contact us before our own determinations were made you see we did not know who you were we wished to find out first what we could from the girl perhaps it would not be necessary to contact you at all the stupid slave said the darkhaired girl knew nothing had i not found your headquarters tonight then i said you would have contacted me of course said shaba tomorrow but we speculated that you would find us tonight we speculated that you would discover or reason out the girls role in our business and try to use her as a lead to find us this possibility was confirmed when you made inquiries of kipofu the beggar in the utukufu square you were there i said of course he said under the cover of the ring but i could not approach as closely as i desired kipofu has unusually keen hearing when my presence was detected i simply withdrew why did you not just contact me directly i asked for two reasons said shaba we wished a second time to interrogate the blondhaired slave before making contact and also we were curious to see if you could find us by yourself you did so you have our congratulations you are obviously worthy of conducting business on behalf of the kurii how long have you known i was in schendi i asked since the arrival of the palms of schendi he said we could not be certain at first that your arrival was not a coincidence soon however it became clear that you were an object for our concern you appeared at the market of uchafu you trailed msaliti from the market you waited in the golden kailiauk i have been under surveillance since arriving in schendi i said yes said shaba from time to time you know then doubtless my new residence i said that which i acquired following my departure from the cove of schendi i had taken a large room on the ground floor behind a clothworkers shop just off the street of tapestries wearing the aba taken from msaliti hooding myself with it that my face and eyesnot be seen sasi on my shoulder rolled in a blanket tied tightly closed with ropes i had acquired the lodging the free woman who rented me the room asked no questions when i had given her a copper tarsk as a tip she had looked down at the tightly tied blanket containing its helpless burden and had looked up at me grinning enjoy yourself she had said slipping the tarsk into a pouch tied at her hip if we knew it said shaba men even now would be ransacking it for the ring and notes of course i said you moved quickly said shaba by the time i had brought the blond slave here and returned to the cove of schendi you had already made your departure i see i said i was pleased that i had made the haste i had but now said shaba we are all friends of course i said when will you deliver the notes he asked and the false ring pressed msaliti tomorrow evening i said you choose to move under the cover of darkness asked shaba i think it might be wise i said very well said shaba tomorrow evening at the nineteenth ahn meet us in this place bring the notes and the false ring i will have the true ring ready then for exchange i shall be here i promised our business then said the darkhaired girl flushing with pleasure will at last be well consummated let us have a drink said shaba to celebrate this longawaited rendezvous then he smiled at me you do not fear to drink with us i trust he said i smiled of course not i said do you have the paga of ar of the brewery of temus woe smiled shaba we have here only schendi paga but i think it is quite good it is of course a matter of taste very well i said you will find it is better without sajel and gieron in it he said that is reassuring i said the symptoms induced by the paga tendered to you at the golden kailiauk he said should have disappeared by the following morning they had i said my dear asked shaba of the darkhaired girl would you bring us paga she stiffened fetch paga woman said msaliti you are least among us why am i least among your she asked forgive us my dear said shaba i will bring the paga she said in a few moments she returned with a bottle of schendi paga and four cups she filled these cups forgive me i said to shaba taking the cup which she had placed before him he smiled and extended his hands of course he said then the four of us lifted our cups touching them one to another to victory said shaba to victory we said and drank i had little compunction about drinking this toast each of us may not have had in mind the same victory of course i have not been introduced to this lovely agent i said regarding the darkhaired girl forgive me said shaba it was careless of me i did not wish to be rude he looked at me you are going by the name of tarl of teletus i believe he said if my inquiries in schendi have served me properly that is correct i said that name will do it will serve to cover my true identity many agents use code names said shaba yes i said tarl of teletus said he may i introduce lady e ellis lady e ellis tarl of teletus we inclined our heads to one another is e an initial or a name i asked her any initial she said it stands for evelyn but i do not like that name it is too feminine call me e i will call you evelyn i said you may do as you wish of course she said i see that you know how to treat a woman said shaba you impose your will upon her is evelyn ellis your real name i asked smiling yes she said it is why do you smile it is nothing i said msaliti and shaba too smiled it amused me to see that the girl thought she had a name i must admire the perception of kur recruiters i said you are obviously highly intelligent and very beautiful thank you she said she has been well trained said msaliti i have been not only well trained she said but thoroughly and intensively trained even brilliantly trained nothing has been left to chance the smallest details have been attended to in order to play my role more effectively here i have even permitted my body to be branded i recall i said i had seen her in the golden kailiauk of course in pleasure silk she looked at me angrily my awe at the cleverness and thoroughness of the practices and techniques of kur espionage knows few limits i said and i must admit that my admiration for the products of their schooling as in the present case exceeds almost all bounds she flushed with pleasure flattered and mollified i threw down the last of my paga i would like to see further evidence of your skills i said i am out of paga i said she reached to the bottle to refill the cup no i said she looked at me did they not teach you how to serve paga as a paga slave i asked of course she said show me i said very well she said she drew back taking the bottle and cup in most taverns no bottle is brought to the table but the paga is brought to the table by the paga slave a cup at a time the cups normally being filled from a vat behind the counter she filled the cup there before me and left it behind she returned the bottle then to the table and went beck again for the cup she lifted it in both hands put it down i said she did so looking at me puzzled you are garbed strangely for a paga slave i said indicating the clogs the black slacks and the black buttoned top do you wish me to put on pleasure silk she asked icily no i said she tossed her head in many gorean taverns i said the paga slaves serve naked yes she said slowly they do did they not teach you how to do that i asked yes she said i would see evidence of your skills i said very well she said angrily in her vanity taunted she slipped from the clogs and was barefoot she slipped from the black slacks and removed the black buttoned top she slipped from the panties and in a moment had discarded her brassiere she was furious but yet i could see too as doubtless could the others that she was sexually charged she was naked before clothed men this can be sexually stimulating to a woman it is hard for her in such circumstances not to see them as her masters and herself before them as an exposed slave similarly she knew that in a moment she would be naked on her knees serving them for reasons that have to do with nature these things can be erotically momentous to a woman the relation of master and slave of course in a psychophysical organism of a high order of intelligence such as the human being is a beautiful and profound expression of the fundamental and central truth of animal nature that of order and structure and dominance and submission it is merely the articulated legalized expression to be expected in rational organisms of the biological context in which human sexuality developed a context which can be betrayed but can never because of the ingrained nature of genetic dispositions be fully forgotten or in the long run successfully denied in denying it we deny our own nature in betraying it we betray no one but ourselves the master will never be happy until be is a master the slave will never be happy until she is a slave it is what we are i looked upon the girl she bit her lip i saw that she was lovely wait said msaliti one more item is needed to complete the effect of course said shaba he left the room and in a moment returned with the collar oh she said as he from behind snapped it about her throat i noted that he slipped the key into his pouch i did not think it would be soon removed from the girl msaliti joined us at the table the girl stood loftily before us do i meet with the approval of masters she asked serve us paga slave said msaliti she stiffened then she smiled yes master she said i too smiled i saw that she thought she was playing a role did she not know that she had been truly branded and that in the touch of the iron as it marked her she had been made truly a slave i sensed now that her slavery latent until now was soon to be specifically activated indeed it had now been activated but she did not know it she thought herself a free woman serving as a slave she did not know that she was truly a slave who amusingly still thought herself free it was a rich joke on the proud girl one fitting to be played on an insolent slave paga master she asked kneeling before me the metal cup held before her in her two hands yes i said she proffered the cup to me she knelt back on her heels her knees wide and extended her arms to me the cup in her hands did you not neglect to kiss it i asked her she drew back the cup and pressing her lips to it kissed it is that how a slave kisses the cup of a master i asked she again turned her head to the side and pressed her lips softly lingeringly against it then she kissed it i saw a tremor course through her body i think then for the first time she had begun to understand what it might be truly to kiss the cup of a master then again kneeling back on her heels her knees wide extending her arms to me the cup in her hands she proffered me the drink your head should be down between your arms i said she put her head down again i saw a small movement in her body a tremor subtle she had put her head down before a man another consequence of this position is that the girls eyes in the specific act of her serving do not meet those of the master they are lowered before his as one who submits this is also reminiscent in an experienced girl of her training often in training a girl is not permitted to look into the eyes of the trainer unless he should specifically extend this permission indeed in some cities the girl in training may not raise her eyes above the trainers belt unless again specifically accorded this permission speak i said to her your paga master she said but i did not take the paga do you know other phrases i asked there were many actually and they tended to vary from tavern to tavern and from city to city there was really no standardization in such matters she trembled head down proffering me the paga your girl brings you drink master she said any others i asked here is your drink master she said i beg to serve you further in any way i may another i said do not forget i come with the price of the cup she said use me as you will master another i said sharply for your pleasure she said i bring you paga and a slave personalized phrase i said e she said evelyn i corrected her evelyn tenders drink humbly to master she said evelyn hopes master will later find her suitable to give him pleasure another i said i am evelyn she said i serve you naked and collared take me later to the alcove i beg to be taught my slavery i then took the paga you may now serve others i said to her you made her serve well said shaba thank you i said the girl trembled and then regained her composure then in turn as a naked paga slave she served msaliti and shaba i observed her technique i thought she could probably survive in a paga tavern under real conditions not those artificial conditions under which she had served in the tavern of pembe the golden kailiauk though doubtless she would be often beaten in the beginning when the girl had finished serving shaba she straightenedup and came about the table to where her cup rested on the low wood she reached for it but msaliti moved it out of her reach she looked at him puzzled does a paga slave drink at the table of masters he asked she laughed of course not she said you could be whipped for that he said yes she said that is true she smiled she then went to where her clothing had been discarded on the floor she bent to pick it up to reclothe herself do not dress said msaliti why not she asked kneel there said msaliti indicating a place about a yard from the table why she asked there he said she knelt there puzzled it was about where a paga slave might kneel close enough to be ready to serve at the merest signal far enough away to be unobtrusive you see she said to me i have been well trained yes i said you were not given permission to speak said msaliti to the girl she looked at him puzzled you could be whipped also for that he said of course she laughed then she looked over to the blondhaired barbarian the blondhaired girl miserable still blindfolded knelt by the wall her slender ankles were shackled her hands were tied behind her back a rope looped through her collar tied her to a slave ring behind her about a yard off the floor do you want her whipped again asked the darkhaired girl no said msaliti i thought you said the whip was to be used again tonight she said i did said msaliti are you going to beat her she asked no he said i do not understand she said msaliti looked at her it is nearly time my dear he said for you to be returned to the tavern of pembe no she said you said that tonight was my last night of feigned service there it was said he but this is also the first night of your true service there i do not understand she said she got up angrily and went toward the small anteroom but the two askaris blocked her way she turned about facing us i would like to get the key she said angrily to remove thisthis collar she indicated the collar i have the key here said msaliti lifting it he having taken it a moment ago from his pouch oh she said then she walked toward us do not approach more closely without permission said msaliti she stopped about five feet from the table kneel he said i do not understand she said kneel he said i noted that he had repeated a command masters do not care to repeat commands she knelt i do not understand she said i did not think she was unintelligent it was only that her earth mind was not quick to grasp that she might almost unbelievably almost incomprehensibly to her be placed in certain categories give me the key she said whose collar do you wear he asked that of pembe of course she said what do you wish to do with it he asked remove it of course she said but it is pembes collar he said yes she said thus said he if or when it is removed is surely a determination to be made not by you but by pembe what are you saying she cried are all women on your former world as dull as you he asked what do you mean my former world she asked precisely what i said said he that world which was formerly yours surely you must now know that your world is gor that it is the gorean world and only the gorean world which is now yours no she cried you are a gorean slave girl he said no no she cried she leaped to her feetand ran toward the door but the two askaris seized her and flung her again to her knees before us youre joking she begged no said msaliti take it off she cried yanking at the collar suddenly take it off take it off no said msaliti she looked at him the steel collar remained inflexibly fastened on her throat msaliti in the speech known to the askaris spoke briefly they seized the girl by the arms and dragged her to the side of the room they put her on her knees facing the wall they braceleted her wrists about one of the four slave rings in the wall the one farthest from the blondhaired barbarian and closest to the door it was like the others about a yard from the floor msaliti standing leaving the table shook loose the blades of the slave whip i am not a slave she cried looking at him over her right shoulder you were a slave said msaliti the instant you were branded only you did not know it no no she cried then she cried i served you well yes said msaliti but you are now no longer needed i served you well she wept it is fitting that a slave well serves her masters said msaliti i am your colleague she said never were you anything but our slave you little white fool said msaliti what if our superiors find out she cried msaliti laughed i act in accord with their instructions he said surely you do not think women such as yourself were brought to gor with any object in mind other than to ultimately wear the collar no she cried no he then stepped behind and to one side of her with the whip shaba she cried shaba your services are no longer required my dear said he no she cried hear me slave said msaliti i have long been patient with you but the time of masters being patient with you is now at an end we shall ignore thousands of infractions and insubordinations in the past presumptions and speakings and actions and consider only the past few moments but a few elm earlier you dared to touch a cup on the table of masters as though it were your own and would have if not stopped drunk from it also you have spoken without permission also once you did not respond to the first issuance of a command but required its repetition also but a moment ago you addressed a free man not as master but by his name msaliti she begged ah said he what a dull slave you have repeated the offense you would not dare to strike me she said earlier i told you said he that the whip would be later used you said as i recall that you would look forward to it do not strike me she begged prepare to be beaten as what you are a slave he said i do not fear the whip she said have you ever felt it he asked no she said you will find the experience instructive he said i am not one of those girls she said who at a touch of the leather will crawl to you and kiss your feet speak bravely said he after you have felt the whip she tensed at the ring preparing for the stroke her eyes were open she held the ring with her small braceleted hands then it fell upon her once the slash of the fivebladed gorean slave whip i saw disbelief startled wild enter her eyes then she shut her eyes tightly tears squeezed from between their lids wetting the lashes and her cheeks her knuckles were now white on the ring they clutched no she whispered it cannot be msaliti did not immediately again strike her he knew the whip he gave her several ihn that she might begin to feel the pain of the first stroke i will obey you she whispered do not strike me again then the second stroke fell upon her and she screamed with misery her grip lost on the ring half thrown against the wall scratching at it with her braceleted hands the side of her face against the heavy boards there were now two layers of pain in her body overlapping each reinforcing and intensifying the other her body sensitized by the first stroke helpless raw aware expectant exposed felt the second as was intended mingling with the burning echoes the searing throbbing wounds of the first a thousand times more cruelly it is enough she wept gasping sobbing it is enough i will do whatever you want msaliti then began her beating no master she screamed at the ring twisting and writhing but msaliti administered to her an efficient though brief discipline as beatings go it was not particularly severe on the other hand it was genuine evelyn had been truly beaten she had felt the whip have mercy master on your slave she wept msaliti then after some ten or twelve strokes lowered the whip he spoke to the askaris they unlocked the left slave bracelet of the girl freeing her from the ring she fell to her stomach weeping to my feet said he she crawled to his feet and kissed them yes master she said msaliti again spoke to the askaris and they pulled the girls wrists behind her back and refastening her left wrist in the left slave bracelet the right still locked on her right wrist secured them there msaliti looked down at her on her stomach at his feet what a miserable worthless thing you are he said i recalled that these had been the words the darkhaired girl had used to the blondhaired barbarian still kneeling blindfolded but now terribly frightened to one side she knew little of what was going on she did understand of course that some sister in bondage near to her had just been disciplined yes master she said behold said msaliti smiling to shaba and myself then to the darkhaired girl he said sharply nadu she struggled to her knees and as she could her wrists braceleted behind her assumed before him the lovely elegant position of the pleasure slave despicable slave smiled msaliti to the girl yes master she said sobbing these words too i recalled had been used by the darkhaired girl earlier to the blondhaired barbarian the darkhaired girl now knelt collared before msaliti herself too now only a girl and slave at the mercy of men msaliti spoke again to the askaris he gave one of them the key to the girls collar several days ago said he to the kneeling girl before him your sale to pembe was arranged tonight you will be delivered to him yes master she said it seems he has taken a fancy to you said msaliti he thinks that you may have in you the makings of a paga girl i do not know if it is true or not i would however if i were you attempt to do my best to justify pembes confidence in you pembe is not a patient man he has taken the hands and feet from more than one girl she turned white yes master she said the askaris lifted her to her feet one holding each arm master she asked yes he said may i have permission to speak she asked yes he said do i have even a name she asked no he said unless pembe should choose to give you one master she said yes he said what did you get for me she asked you have a slave girls vanity he said do you not she put down her head yes master she said that is an excellent sign he said perhaps you will even survive she looked at him piteously four copper tarsks he said so little she said in my opinion it is more than you are worth said msaliti then he waved his hand to the askaris and they turned the slave about and thrust her ahead of them from our presence out into the anteroom there in the anteroom one of them retrieved the tiny scrap of yellow pleasure silk the girl had brought with her wadded in her hand when she had come earlier to the building he tied this snugly on her collar she looked back at us frightened then she was thrust stumbling though the outside door and into the street i stood up near the table i shall see you then tomorrow evening i said bring with you said shaba the false ring and the notes and you i said do not neglect to bring the genuine ring with you i shall have it with me he averred i did not doubt it msaliti to one side had begun his transformation into the beggar kunguni he had already slipped the padded hump beneath his tunic and adjusted the straps by which it was held in place he was now at a mirror with paste and ocher attending to the matter of the simulated scar what of this slave i asked msaliti indicating the blondhaired barbarian msaliti shrugged she is now worthless to us he said what did you pay uchafu for her i asked five silver tarsks he said i will give you six i said she is hot admitted msaliti have you subjected her to rape test i asked no said he only to the touch of the owners hands that is usually a reliable test i said i will take six tarsks for her said he if you are serious in the matter i gave msaliti six silver tarsks for the girl she was then mine in the situation as i assessed it either she should have been given to me upon my expression of interest or i should have paid something for her in increments of silver tarsks something over the price msaliti had paid things turned out much as i had expected i did not think msaliti truly whom i took to be a shrewd clever fellow and one concerned with matters of wealth and power would wish to give a girl away too since he had paid for her in silver tarsks he would wish to sell her in the same denomination and presumably at some profit my offer of six seemed perfect it permitted him to satisfy his sense of venality and yet not appear excessively mercenary had i tried to obtain her for less than six tarsks or he tried to obtain more for her i think the situation could have become unpleasant msaliti his scar now affixed and his disguise intact bent down and removed the shackles from the blond barbarians ankles he then removed the collar from her and with it the rope which had tethered her to the wall he then jerked her to her feet and unbound her hands he then thrust her stumbling blindfolded and naked but otherwise unbound to me she stood against me clutching me frightened i now own you i said yes master she said she lifted her hands to remove the blindfold do not remove the blindfold i told her yes master she said her lip trembling you may have the blindfold smiled msaliti keep her in it until she is well away from here very well i said he did not wish her of course to be able to find her way again to this place you are not to touch the blindfold without permission i told her yes master she said standing quietly beside me so simply she a slave had been placed in the shackles of my will until tomorrow night said msaliti lifting his hand until tomorrow night i said he then left we are now alone i said to shaba the presence of the girl of course did not count she was a slave yes said shaba rising from behind the table i measured the distance to him who are you truly he asked i think i said you have the ring upon you and would not leave it elsewhere you are a shrewd man said shaba he lifted his left hand on the first finger of which was a fang ring he folded his left hand into a fist and with his thumb pressed a tiny switch on the ring the fang of hollow steel springing up was then exposed it contains kanda i asked yes said he it will do you little good i said if you cannot strike me with it a scratch will be sufficient he said one must upon occasion take risks i said i think i may easily multiply the risks said he he reached into his robes with his right hand in a moment he had seemed to swirl and then the lightdiversion field activated had vanished from my view tomorrow i said i shall bring the false ring and the notes excellent said shaba i think that we now understand one another quite well yes i said it is a pleasure to do business with such an honest fellow he said i entertain a similar sentiment toward yourself i said i then turned about and taking the slave girl by the arm left the room soon i was in the street outside i return to the golden kailiauk do not fear i said to pembe it was only a passing indisposition his hands shook look i said see i do not have the plague your skin said he is truly clear and too your eyes of course i said you are well he asked uncertainly of course i said welcome to the golden kailiauk he said relieved i shall return to the counter in a moment i said i went to the wall against which i had placed the blondhaired barbarian i had told her to put her belly and the palms of her hands lifted against the wall she remained of course as i had placed her kneel here i said to her back on your heels i said to her she did so by the wall now grip your ankles in your hands i said and put your head down yes master she said and do not break that position i said until given permission yes master she said master she said yes i said she spoke with her bead down her ankles gripped who are you she said who owns me be silent i said yes master she said i then returned to the counter do you have a whiteskinned paga slave here i asked a barbarian girl yes he said i obtained one only tonight for four tarsks i have not yet even put her on the floor i threw him a copper tarsk paga i said and the slave you must know the askaris of msaliti he said i have made their acquaintance i said he turned to one of the paga attendants bring the new paga slave to the floor he said excellent he said to himself already there is a call for her i saw the girl naked in her collar even the bit of yellow slave silk which had been tied to her collar gone thrust through the beaded curtain by the paga attendant ah i said she had not yet seen me i think i said you will soon make back your four tarsks on her but one must figure in too said he the cost of the paga that is true i said she is a new girl he said if she is not entirely satisfactory let me know and i will have her whipped and have your money refunded very well i said i will be at that table i said indicating a table in the rear of the tavern not far from a redcurtained alcove yes master said pembe i went and sat down crosslegged behind the table i had thought it wise not to go directly back to my room if someone were to follow me he would have quite a wait my stop at the paga tavern i thought would make it easier to elude pursuit i had stopped at this tavern of course because of pembes new paga slave when she thought she had been pretending to serve us in the headquarters of shaba and msaliti she had of course whether she intended it or not much aroused me i desired her so i would now have her too i thought that it might be to the girls advantage to be broken in by me one more aware than would be most goreans of the limitations of earth girls usually it is the first two or three nights which are the most difficult for a girl to survive in a gorean paga tavern after the first two or three nights she has usually learned and well what she is a paga slave if she has not learned it in that time it is likely that her throat will have been cut by some customer her sales price being then paid to her owner plus a token tarsk or two of copper for good will the girl was thrust her arm in the grip of the paga attendant on the far side of the room to the counter he released her before the counter pembe placed a goblet of paga in her hands he then pointed in my direction she turned about she nearly spilled the paga trembling it was well for her that she did not spill it slowly alone a paga slave naked and collared she approached my table she then knelt there before me press the cup to your belly i told her she did so she then held it there in both hands paga master she whispered yes i said she sobbed kiss the cup i told her she lifted the metal cup from her belly and turning her head to the side pressed her lips against it she then kissed it she then her knees wide her arms extended to me her head down between her arms proffered the paga to me your paga master she whispered i did not yet take the paga has pembe given you a name yet i asked she said no master for purposes of your service to me tonight i said i name you evelyn yes master she said use now to me i said the second of the two formulas personalized which you earlier used to me when you had so foolishly thought yourself a free woman i am evelyn she said i serve you naked and collared take me later to the alcove i beg to be taught my slavery very well i said she knelt back about a yard from the table i looked at her i sipped the paga you are a pretty slave evelyn i said thank you master she said are you white silk i asked i am virgin she said then you are white silk i said yes master she said have you ever been curious i asked about what it would be to be a slave she looked at me beware i said you are naked and kneeling you wear a slave collar it will not be easy to lie yes she said putting her head down i have been curious to know what it would be to be a slave you will learn i told her yes master she said i then gave my attention to the paga and to my thoughts in time i sent her back for another cup the price for the second cup in the tavern of pembe was only a tarsk hit i paid it to the paga attendant who collected it at the table the girls in pembes tavern as in many taverns are not permitted to touch coins evelyn of course who had come with the higher price of the first cup was mine until i chose to leave the tavern or in some other way release her may i have permission to speak she asked yes i said is it masters intention to use me she asked perhaps i said and perhaps not i will do what i please yes master she said i nursed the second cup of paga then after a time i thrust it from me is master going to leave she asked go to the alcove i said she looked at me agonized she rose to her feet and scarcely able to move numbly went to the alcove she could not bring herself to enter through the red curtains i took her by the left arm and thrust her within onto the furs at my feet i then turned about and drew shut the curtains hooking them shut i then turned about again to face her she sat numbly on the furs her knees drawn up i took the ankle ring and chain which lay at the right corner of the alcove as you enter the chain is about a yard long and runs to a ring bolted in the floor there are similar chains in the four corners of the room and in the center of the wall near the floor opposite the red curtains in the lefthand corner of the room as you enter of course on its chain is another ankle ring at the far corners of the room of course the chains terminate with wrist rings in the center of the wall near the floor opposite the curtains the chain terminates with a collar there are provisions for lengthening and shortening the chains all these devices work from locks answering to a common key which hangs high on the wall toward the back and left as you enter needless to say that key cannot be reached by the prisoner if even one of the chains is fastened upon her near that common key which hangs on a peg there is a second peg from the second peg hangs a slave whip i locked the girls left ankle in the first ankle ring she looked wonderingly at the steel locked on her ankle she lifted the chain leading to the locked ankle ring on her left ankle she looked at me you have chained me she said oh she said i thrust her to her back on the furs i then fastened her left and right wrists in their respective wrist rings i then put the alcove collar on her shortening its chain fitting it over pembes collar she could not then rise more than a few inches from her back i then went to her right and shortened the chain there i then took her right ankle oh she said as i pulled it far to her right i then locked it in the ankle ring on its shortened chain which is at the left of the alcove entrance as one enters she looked up at me terrified i looked down at her do you now begin to understand i said what it might be to be chained as a slave yes master she said look now to your right high on the wall i said what do you see a slave whip she said do you now begin to understand what it might be to be a slave i asked yes master she said this is an alcove i said but you may think of it as a very special sort of place yes master she said as a chamber of submission i said yes yes master she said think of it now i said think of it deeply and keenly with every fiber and particle of your lovely body as a chamber of submission a chamber in which you a slave girl must bend in all respects a chamber in which you only a female slave must submit in every bit of you totally completely to the will of men yes master she said i will now touch you i said i am frigid she wept do not kill me i beg of you think deeply now fully i said you are in the chamber of submission yes master she wept i then touched her with exquisite gentleness her haunches leaped the chains shook she looked at me startled do you submit fully i asked her yes master she said then she lifted her body piteously please touch me again she said i let her wait for a time then again i touched her very gently aiii she cried out squirming i continued to touch her for a bit oh oh she began to moan then i stopped touching her she looked up at me what are these sensations she asked apparently you should be whipped i said why she asked why master because you have lied i said you told me that you were frigid she looked up at me frightened but you are not i said you are only another hot slave no no she said not a hot slave not i let us see said i oh oh she moaned softly she looked up at me how can you respect me she asked you are not to be respected i told her you are only a slave yes master she said you no longer have any pride to guard i said a slave is not permitted pride yes master she wept oh oh then she threw her head to the side on the furs i want to respect myself she cried your obligation is not to respect yourself i told her but to be yourself she looked at me tears in her eyes i dare not be myself she whispered is it wrong for a woman to be a woman i asked yes she said yes it is wrong and demeaning interesting i said what should a woman be i asked her she should be a man she said but quite simply you are not a man i told her i dare not be a woman she wept why i asked because she said i sense in my heart that a woman is a slave is it not permissible for a slave to be a slave i asked no she said why i asked i do not know she wept i do not know can it be wrong to be what one truly is i asked yes yes she said it is wrong for the tree to be a tree the rock a rock the bird a bird i asked no no she said why then i asked is it wrong for a slave to be a slave i do not know she said perhaps it is not wrong for a slave to be a slave i said i dare not even think that she said then she said please do not stop touching me master does a slave beg i asked yes master she said evelyn begs master not to stop touching her i kissed her softly about the breasts but did not stop touching her thank you master she breathed then suddenly she tore at the chains trying to free herself but could not of course do so what is wrong i asked her i must resist you she cried i must not yield i must not yield why not i asked i sense the thing in me she said i have never felt it before but this must be it it is like waves from so deep in me it is beginning to overwhelm me it is fantastic it is unbelievable no no you must stop touching me i stopped touching her why i asked i was beginning to come to you she said so i asked you do not understand she said i was beginning to come to youas a slave to her master but you are a slave i told her yes master she said and you are in the chamber of submission i said you give me no choice she said i smiled at her this time and this time alone i said i will give you a choice a choice she said a slaves choice i told her what is it she asked you may yieldor die i told her she looked at me with terror i choose to yield master she said of course i said you are a slave yes master she said next time i said you will not even be given that choice it will not be necessary your slavery has now been confirmed you will thenceforth be accorded no choice whatsoever no alternative however dire to the enforcement of your submission upon you yes master she said then i began again to touch her lifting her to the heights she had chosen the degrading joys of bondage the humiliating ecstasy of the chained slave girl aiii she cried throwing her head back i yield me yours my master she cried i had not even this early in the evening elected to enter her please touch me hold me she wept helplessly i did so how piteous were her small hands opening and closing in the wrist rings i did not know it could be anything like that she said it was nothing i told her nothing she wept it was the most incredible experience of my life it was only a minor slave orgasm i said when i came to you she said i was submitting and owned it is the most beautiful and glorious feeling i have ever had then after a time i began to touch her again what is master going to do now to his girl she asked i am going to teach her a little more of her slavery i told her yes master she said this time in less than ten ehn she began to squirm and cry then suddenly she looked at me frightened it is coming she said it is greater than the first i will not be able to stand it it will kill me i will die no you will not i told her aiii she cried out head back then she wept im chained im chained hold me please do not let me go stay warm and near to me please master please master i held her and kissed her again i had not even elected to enter her she looked up tears in her eyes please come in me she begged i want to be fully yours had without mercy by my master take me i beg you have me later i told her i have not yet begun to warm you yes master she whispered frightened later toward morning near dawn i awakened evelyns lips so intimate upon me during the night i had unchained her save for the steel and chain on her left ankle she awakened me as i had instructed her it is pleasant to be awakened in that fashion i put my hands down to her hair as she pleasured me during the night i had taught her some small things some techniques little simple things for her mouth and hands and breasts her hair her lips and feet and tongue they might help her i thought to survive in pembes tavern most importantly i had tried to impress upon her the fundamental importance of submission and that she was a slave girl all else for most practical purposes follows from that i cried out softly and she looked up pleased that she had made me do that finish your work slave i told her yes master she said my hands knotted in her hair tightly holding her helplessly to me then i released her i pulled her up to me and in the dim light of the alcove filtering through the red curtain from the slatted grilles in the roof of the main room wiped her mouth with her hair it is morning master she whispered yes i said i held her arms as she looked down at me speak i told her she then whispering said the following i had taught it to her last night he is master and i am slave he is owner and i am owned he commands and i obey he is to be pleased and i am to please why is this because he is master and i am slave i took her and put her to her back beside me i looked down into her eyes good morning slave i said good morning master she said did you sleep well i asked in the little time you permitted me to sleep she said i never slept better before in my life did you dream i asked i dreamed i was a slave she said and then i awakened and found that it was true i smiled at her i am a slave she said you know yes i said when i awakened this morning she said i knew that it was true you taught it to me last night do you think free women could have felt what you felt i asked never she said for they are not slaves she looked up at me what i felt were the feelings of a slave in the arms of her master those are feelings no free woman will ever know unless she is put in bondage i said yes master she smiled then she said how i pity them those poor free woman such as i was how ignorant they are no wonder they are so hostile to men would not any woman hate a man who did not have the strength to put her in a collar perhaps i said i thought of a girl once known one who once had been my free companion i thought of her cruelty to me once in the house of samos when she had thought me helpless and crippled she had once been the daughter of marlenus of ar but he had disowned her for once when she had been the helpless slave of the forest girl verna she had begged to be purchased a slaves act rather than submit to this stain upon his honor he the ubar of glorious ar itself had sworn against her upon his sword and upon the medallion of his office as well the fierce oath of disownment she lived now free but deprived of citizenship sequestered in ar her left thigh would still bear the brand of treve for once long ago she bad fallen slave to rask of treve a captain and tarnsman i wondered if he had made her yield well as a slave when he had owned her i did not doubt it i thought the brand of port kar might look well upon her body placed above that of treve i wondered how she might look in scarlet silk dancing as a slave before any men we belong in collars said evelyn i heard outside the curtain the sounds of the early morning tables were being moved aside that the floor might be cleaned this work is usually done by paga attendants the girls at this time are usually asleep chained in their kennels it is morning i said you are going to go in a moment arent you she asked leaving me behind a chained slave of course i told her paga girl dont go yet she said i beg you master very well i said i wear pembes collar she said touching the encircling steel on her neck i would wear yours i looked at her surely what you did to me last night she said means something to you it was only a nights pleasure with a paga girl i said oh she said any gorean male could do it to you i said make me yield like that she asked as such a slave of course i told her slave girl yes master she said what do you think now of your collar i asked i hate it she said and i love it you love your collar i asked yes she said i love it she looked up at me i love being a slave she said i love being enslaved i love being forced to yield and to obey men i see that it is appropriate that you wear a collar i said yes she said defiantly it is fully appropriate you know why it is fully appropriate i asked of course she said because i am a true slave yes i said slave and yet she said i am an earth girl she put her bands at the collar how cruel that i should be put in a collar she looked up at me will it never be taken off she asked undoubtedly i said ah she said to be replaced with another i said oh she said she looked up at the wall to her right at the slave whip hanging there on its peg you did not whip me she said do you wish to be whipped i said no she said no she had felt the whip she then looked again at me i suppose said she that i will be bought and sold many times doubtless i told her do you think men will ever free me she asked no i said why she asked the collar is right on you i said she touched it yes she said it is right on me and you knew it immediately didnt you you beast that is why you made me when i thought i was free serve you as a naked paga slave it seemed fitting i said that your slavery be made manifest of course she said you are a gorean master any gorean male looking upon you i said whether you wore a collar or not would see that you should be a slave and now i am a slave she said yes i said i do not object she said it does not matter whether you object or not i said true she smiled i heard men moving about outside cleaning the floor i sat up do not go master she begged i must be on my way i told her leaving me here she asked yes i said please remain but a bit longer she begged would you detain me i asked yes she said with the charms of a slave you do not speak as an earth girl i said i am no longer an earth girl she said i am now only a gorean slave she said it is true i said she slipped down my body and began piteously to kiss me i do not have time i told her dally please dally she begged if only for a few moments more i saw that she feared to be left behind she looked up at me miserably you now begin to understand do you not i asked something of the meaning of your collar yes master she said surely now i said you would choose freedom she looked up at me boldly no she said i have been a free woman and i have been a slave i have known both is not freedom inordinately precious i asked yes she said but more inordinately precious to me is my slavery i looked at her i choose the brand she said the collar and the hands of a master on my body i pulled her up beside me and threw her to her back use me ruthlessly master she begged i shall i told her rape me as a slave she said it will be done i told her in a few moments she screamed her submission and looked at me unbelievingly i did not know what it would be to be raped as a slave she whispered it was so swift and brutal she said please hold me she said i spurned her with my foot to the side of the alcove and she lay there trembling and weeping she held out her hand to me please touch me she said be silent slave i said yes master she whispered i began to dress she rose to her knees and knelt there then by the side wall the steel ankle ring with its chain leading to the floor ring still upon her ankle how you used me she said she was still trembling sandals i said she crept to me and head down placed my sandals on my feet she then tied them drawing the thongs tight and then fastening them how you used me she whispered then she held my legs and pressed her cheek against the side of my left leg above the knee i did not kick her from me she looked up tears in her eyes if one is a true slave he said it is not wrong to be a slave is it no i said she held my legs looking up at me if one is a true slave she said it is right that one should be a slave is it not yes i said i am a true slave she said yes i said it is thus right that i should be a slave she said yes i said i lifted her to her feet holding her by the arms before me it is right she said that a true slave should be enslaved of course i said i am a true slave she said i know i said it is thus right she said that i should be enslaved yes i said i am enslaved she said yes i said i then threw her to my feet and turning parted the curtains of the alcove master she wept i turned to look at her but one more kiss please master she said she knelt on the furs chained by the ankle and i crouched before her and took her in my arms we kissed then i thrust her back and stood up you subjected me earlier to slave rape she said soft tears in her eyes with tender reproach yes i said and afterwards spurned me from you yes i said keep me master she suddenly begged keep me i looked down upon her she knelt before me she was so soft and beautiful her eyes and lashes wet with tears her hair dark and soft on her shoulders her lip trembling keep me she begged she had been an agent of kurii take me with you she begged do not leave me behind in this place she had been an agent of kurii speak i said tremblingly head down she spoke he is master and i am slave he is owner and i am owned he commands and i obey he is to be pleased and i am to please why is this because he is master and i am slave each night for a month i said after you are chained in your kennel and before you fall asleep say that yes master she said similarly for the same month i said repeat it to yourself many times during the day yes master she said it may help you to survive i said thank you master she said remember to yield well to men i said i will not be able to help myself master she smiled remember submission and that you are a slave girl i said yes master she said you may now find this difficult to believe i said but the time will come when you will find that you are unable to part these curtains and enter this alcove from the floor outside without being hot and wet merely to cross this threshold that of an alcove that of a chamber of submission will make you ready for a mans pleasure i do not find it difficult to believe master she whispered merely to look at the curtains excites me she touched her collar merely to touch my collar excites me to kneel on the furs to feel them on my body to be kneeling itself before a man excites me to be naked before him on my knees makes me miserable with the desire for his touch i think you will survive slave i told her may i kiss your feet but once more master she said i permitted this i felt her lips so sweet on my feet her tears and hair keep me she begged keep me master i looked down once more at the slave at my feet who had been an agent of kurii then i turned about and left the alcove master she cried i looked back at her once more she was on her belly half through the curtains her left leg extended behind her held by the ankle ring and chain she hold out her right hand to me please buy me dont leave me here she wept how was she asked a paga attendant pausing in his work buffing goblets i will not demand a refund i told him do you think she will work out he asked pembe was curious probably i said it is hard to know about those things it is my guess that she will prove satisfactory is her slavery close to the surface he asked yes i said doubtless it will soon become fully manifest does she have slave fire he asked i remembered her sobbing in my arms kissing and licking and begging for my least touch yes i said that is good he said perhaps there is hope for the wench i grow weary of carrying bodies to the harbor i went to the place near the rear wall where i had left the blondhaired barbarian she had fallen asleep slumped blindfolded there she had of course released her ankles i touched her gently and she with a little moan of anguish awakened she realized then suddenly she had dropped off to sleep suddenly fearfully she assumed the kneeling position in which i had placed her head down gripping her ankles no i told her softly i then took her gently in my arms how small and light she was i do not think she weighed more than one hundred and ten pounds i am leaving by the back way i told the paga attendant as you wish he said outside i waited for a few moments to see if the door behind me should be moved ajar i examined too the dust of the alley to see if it moved or otherwise stirred as it might have if a foot had passed i looked about at the roofs about the door did not move the dust did not stir the tops of the buildings as nearly as i could determine seemed clear i looked at the girl in my arms she was again asleep for a moment i felt moved to tenderness toward her her life in the past few weeks had not been easy she had been a pawn in the cruel games of worlds too it is sometimes traumatic for a proud free woman of earth to discover that she has suddenly become an owned slave i would let the girl sleep i carried her through the streets of schendi i did not take a direct route to my room a girl becomes more beautiful i must take my leave of sasi sasi opened the door master she said prepare a chain for the new girl i said yes master she said i do not think sasi was too pleased when i carried the blond slave over the threshold and placed her on the straw by the slave ring gorean slaves incidentally are commonly carried over the threshold when they first enter a masters house or place of residence this is reminiscent of a bridal custom on earth of course that custom an ancient one makes tacitly clear the brides ownership by the male and has clear implications of capture and bondage it is natural that the bride desires this ceremony and will plead for it the oafish male commonly does not even understand what is going on he should of course take her directly to the bed and throw her upon it his women wish to be the slaves of their men what woman would want a man who is not strong enough to be her master not all gorean slaves of course are carried over a threshold some are leashed and enter on their hands and knees some perhaps bound and collared are thrust through the common denominator of these customs of course is that the slave must understand that force either explicitly or implicitly is involved and that she will enter the stronghold of the master and as a slave whether she wills to do so or not is that not the girl from the palms of schendi asked sasi the blond girl exhausted was still asleep yes i said sasi fastened a short chain to the slave ring locking it with its own lock on the ring she then with a key the same key which would open the chain lock opened the chains ankle ring what do you want her for asked sasi she handed me the opened ankle ring she interests me at least for the moment i told her i shut the ankle ring then on the blonds left ankle she was secured sasi rose and put the key on a hook to one side of the room near it on another hook there hung a slave whip from one of the overhead beams near the side of the room there was a whipping ring to which a slave could be tethered which could be lowered it was a furnished room slaves it must be understood are not that uncommon on gor i covered the blond with one of our blankets the poor thing was exhausted you did not carry me across the threshold said sasi you were bound in a blanket and on my shoulder i said when i entered this room i mean before she said no i said i did not i did however if you will remember when first i used you order you to my blankets i have never forgotten she said she shuddered with pleasure remembering the moment i was simply ordered to your blankets she said a similar sort of thing is done sometimes when a master brings home a new girl to a house which is completely empty if necessary by prearrangement and new to her and orders her to enter alone warm wine he tells her light the lamp of love spread furs crawl naked into them and await me yes master she says she then enters the house obeying not a shackle or a cord is on her body but few women could be more slave than she entering fearfully the strange empty house and preparing herself for her masters pleasure it is difficult to convey to a man she said the feelings of a woman at such a time they are the feelings of a slave i said so simply put she said yes she said they are the feelings of a slave but i wonder if a man ever will truly understand what a womans collar can mean to her i wonder if he ever truly will be able to fathom the nature and depth of the emotions of the woman who kneels at his feet surely free women too have emotions i said i was free she said i did not know what it was to feel until i became a slave i was free there was no need to feel or be aware but this has changed since i became a slave i must now be sensitive to the feelings of others i have never been so aware of other human beings as now and i cannot always have my way and i must yield to male domination i can be commanded and i must obey and be pleasing this answers to something very deep in me master of course i said to the slave in you yes she said to the woman and slave in me they are the same i said yes she said it is hard to be a man i said until one stands in a relation to a woman and i suppose it is hard to be a woman until one stands in a relation to a man what relation she asked master that of the natural order of nature i said yes master she said i looked at her i cannot know well the nature of your feelings i said but i know and well that women are deep as well as beautiful we are so different from you she said i fear you will never understand us it is doubtless easier to put you on your knees and push the whip to your teeth than it is to understand you i said the man who truly understands us she laughed is the first to put us on our knees and make us kiss the whip take off my sandals i said yes master she said she looked up never until i was a slave she said did i feel so helpless alive and vulnerable i said nothing i must untie your sandals she said i must crawl to you if you wish i must do anything you want i am happy attend to your work i told her yes master she said then she had removed the sandais she kissed them and looked up at me tonight i said before i leave the room i will pierce your ears thank you master she said you will then be i said for all practical purposes irrevocably a slave yes master she said she looked up you do understand us dont you she asked it will improve your price i told her yes master she smiled i think also i said i will pierce her ears too i indicated the sleeping blond girl she had been an agent of kurii i decided that i would guarantee for all practical purposes that she would remain in a collar on gor i would pierce her ears i looked over to the sleeping girl so worn and exhausted i went over to her and with one hand lifted the blanket away from her she stirred troubled sensing the difference in the temperature the air upon her skin no she whimpered softly in english i do not want to get up how beautiful she was lying soft and helpless in the straw she stirred again and lifted her knee shifting the position of her shackled ankle no i do not want to get up she whimpered in english she reached down searching for the blanket i then held her by the upper arms oh she said half awakening twisting but i held her oh she said oh suddenly rudely returning to a slaves reality then understanding that she lay in straw her back on a wooden floor held in the arms of a man she moved her ankle frightened and felt the shackle and chain who is it she asked i did not speak to her is it my master she asked yes i said who is my master please she begged i said nothing to her who is my master she cried out miserably i am i told her who owns me she begged i do i told her she turned her head to the side and moaned then she again turned her face toward me its upper portions obscured by the black knotted blindfold why are you holding me like this she asked i said nothing to her what are you going to do to me she asked i did not speak to her what do you want of me she asked oh no please she said i am a virgin her lip trembled no please she said she tensed no she said please no please do not take my virginity like this not like this i am blindfolded i cannot see you i cannot even see you i want to see who takes my virginity from me then she cried out softly and wept it was your master slave i told her yes master she whispered i held her very still how sweet and strong it is she breathed and how helplessly i am held i could not escape now unless you were to release me i did not speak would master deign to kiss a slave she asked i put my lips gently to hers and she lifted her lips to mine tenderly and kissed me and then she put her head back to the straw and the floor thank you master she said this first time i said doubtless it is difficult and painful for you it does not hurt she said oh i said i have never been had before she said i did not know what it was like to lie like this do you like it i asked yes she said yes master she then held my arms master she whispered yes i said i begin to feel like i want to respond to you she whispered may i move master yes i said oh she said softly moving i did not know it could be like this never before have i been locked in a mans arms in this fashion how sweet it is how helpless i feel i am beginning to become excited master i am beginning to become terribly excited master she lifted her lips suddenly to me and kissed me and then she put her head back and turned it from side to side lost in her pleasure and in the darkness of the blindfold suddenly she clutched my arms master she said yes i said we are completely alone are we not she asked no i said oh she cried out in misery oh no then she asked who else is present another woman i told her oh no no no no she wept no not do not fear i said it is only another slave behold how the brute abuses me she called out what we women suffer at the hands of such beasts i was startled sasi looked at me puzzled rape me as a slave she called out you will get no pleasure from me that seemed to me highly unlikely then the chained girl lay back pressing her hands against me her head turned to the side have your will with me she said i am inert i can endure it means nothing to me are you being troublesome i asked her no master she said have you felt the whip i asked yes master she said do you wish to feel it again i asked no master she said you then i said have my permission to again respond surely she said you did not think i was earlier responsive to you you now have my permission to again respond i said i cannot possibly respond with another woman in the room she whispered to me surely you must understand that master respond i told her i am commanded she asked disbelievingly yes i said how can you command such a thing she asked as i have done i said yes master she said and further i said you will respond as a slave yes master she said miserably she began to move timidly slightly about me i will try to forget that there is another woman in the room she said no i said keep it clearly in mind master she said show her your slave heat i said but should one not be ashamed of ones passion she asked why i asked i do not know she said is there any rational reason i asked i do not doubt there may be many irrational reasons or causes perhaps because in a mans arms it makes a woman a slave she said that i said is doubtless true but it is a reservation which if pertinent at all is pertinent only surely to free women yes she said uncertainly you are already a slave i said yes she said it is permissible i suppose she said for a slave to be passionate it is not only permissible for a slave to be passionate i said master she asked i held her very tightly yes master she whispered a slave i said must be passionate master she asked yes i said the slave girl has no choice she must be passionate yes master she whispered moreover i said she is to be proud of her passion it is one of the most splendid and beautiful and joyful things about her yes master she whispered begin i told her yes master she said she began to move and try to kiss me oh no she said i am too miserable it is too embarrassing continue i told her but if i continue i may become excited she said you will become excited i told her but there is another woman present she said move i told her yes master she sobbed be proud of your slave heat i told her yes master she said show her your slave heat i said yes master she sobbed then in a few moments despite her intent i heard a moan of pleasure escape her oh no she added it is not wrong to experience sexual pleasure i told her but there is another woman present she said show her your slave heat i said forgive me she cried out calling to whoever might be in the room i cannot help myself the master is exciting me master said sasi unable to restrain herself withdraw from her let me serve your pleasure no no said the blondhaired barbarian clutching me he is with me now her lip trembled do not withdraw from me she begged why not i asked i want to serve your pleasure she whispered what do you know of serving a mans pleasure said sasi beg his forgiveness for disappointing him and let him seize me in his arms no said the blondhaired barbarian then she said to me i am sorry if i disappoint you master you have not yet disappointed me i said i will try not to disappoint you master she said let me serve your pleasure master begged sasi it is now i who am serving his pleasure said the blond girl if you call that serving his pleasure said sasi help me begged the blond girl lift your body against his said sasi squirm kiss the blond moaned with misery that is like a slave she whispered obey said sasi is she first girl asked the blond yes i said yes mistress said the blond miserably then she obeyed for she was a slave from time to time sasi and i made simple suggestions to the blond who for the first time was being ravished we forced her to cooperate in her rape i began to grit my teeth stop moving i told her she stopped moving but she did not want to stop moving she clutched my arms my passion is making me a slave she whispered you are already a slave i told her yes master she said passion technically i said has nothing to do with the imposition of the yoke of slavery it is of course afterwards required of the enslaved woman passion is commanded of her yes master she said the sense in which passion makes you a slave i said is that it puts you in what is in effect a slaves position helpless yielding submitting to the master yes master she whispered but you will not even begin to know what true passion is ignorant girl i said until you have been longer a slave yes master she whispered you may begin again to respond now slave i told her yes master she said then she began again to move and soon was crying out softly i think she will be a hot slave i said to sasi yes said sasi i think so master please do not use those words of me she begged say i told her i am proud to be a hot slave i am proud to be a hot slave she cried out miserably and you are proud of it you know i told her she clutched me startled her lip trembled yes she said suddenly it is true how incredible i am proud i am proud to be a hot slave of course i told her slave no no she said i am ashamed to be a hot slave whether you are proud or ashamed i told her in any event you are a hot slave yes master she said that could not be denied i come from a far world she said the girl from that world is ashamed the girl on this world the slave is not ashamed she is proud she put her head to the side how shamelessly proud she is she said the girl from the far world i told her no longer exists what exists now in her place is herself transformed herself become a beautiful slave at the mercy of a master yes master she said what is the name of your former world i asked it is called earth she said have you heard of it master she asked yes i said her women are not unknown in our markets oh she said they make excellent slaves i said she said nothing do you find that hard to believe i asked no master she said then she lifted her lips and kissed me master she said yes i said you took my virginity she said now i beg you consummate your will upon me do you beg as a slave i asked yes master she said i beg as a slave beg i told her take me she begged make me yours have me as your slave do you yield i asked her fully and completely and as a slave yes master she whispered i yield fully and completely and as a slave i then took her i thought it might be you master she said lifting her lips from my feet i had removed her blindfold it was now the sixteenth ahn several ahn after i had taken the slaves virginity from the first instant i saw you she said i dreamed of being your slave now it is true help sasi clean the dishes i told her yes master she said she put her fingers to her ears and turned her head from side to side looking at the rings in her ears they are very beautiful she said regarding herself in the mirror they were of gold about an inch in diameter i had pierced her ears and put her in them how glorious it is to again see she said the blindfold lay discarded to one side she was no longer shackled to the slave ring seeing my eyes upon her she knelt am i beautiful master she asked almost i told her she looked kneeling in the mirror i do not wish to sound vain she said but i think that i must be as beautiful as almost any woman upon earth you doubtless are i said but are you as beautiful as a gorean slave girl surely master she said that would depend on the gorean slave girl do you think you are as beautiful as the general run of gorean slave girls i asked she put down her head no master she said i do not i did not know such women could exist until i saw several in cos when i was free and some on the wharves of port kar and schendi after i myself sold in a market became a slave she looked at me sometimes she said it seems almost wrong that a woman should be so beautiful and desirable why i asked i do not know she smiled perhaps it is because i am not so beautiful and desirable perhaps it is because men are so fond of them perhaps i am jealous of their beauty and desirability and am envious because they and not i are found so attractive by men it is natural for the ugly to find an error in beauty i said i am not ugly am i she asked no i said you are not indeed you are almost beautiful i wonder if gorean men such as yourself she said understand how fortunate they are that there should be such women on their world are their not plenitudes of such women on your world i asked beautiful and desirable who loving and helpless beg to serve and please how you gorean beasts she said take naively for granted the glorious riches at your disposal i shrugged she looked at me how ir it she asked that on your world things are not as on my world gorean men are not weaklings and fools i said she looked at me they have not chosen to surrender the dominance which is the blood and backbone of their nature she swallowed hard they keep it i told her yes she said yes what i asked yes master she said what of me asked sasi am i not beautiful are not my earrings lovely yes i said you are beautiful and your earrings you little shesleen are marvelous upon you sasis earrings too of gold were the same as those of the blondhaired barbarian thank you master she said sasi was in a good mood after i had had the blond this morning early upon returning from the tavern of pembe i had slept for several hours but when i had awakened i had contented her slave appetites we had then eaten from foods which she had during my rest i having given her a few coins purchased in schendi some of this food i gave to the blond who at that time was still blindfolded i thrust it some bread and fruit in her mouth while she had knelt in the position of the pleasure slave this is something done with a girl in her first feeding or feedings and may upon occasion be repeated she is fed as an animal and from the hand of the master and while in the position of the pleasure slave this helps to reinforce the centrality of her condition upon her this helps her to understand what she is at least smiled the blond i am almost beautiful perhaps i said you will someday become beautiful she looked at me women grow in beauty and slavery i told her she looked in the mirror beautiful even for a gorean slave girl she asked yes i said i think that someday you may find that you have become beautiful even for a gorean slave girl her eyes were startled yes i said i think that possibly one day you will find that you have become exquisitely beautiful and desirable and that your least movement that of even a wrist or hand or smallest expression will be tormentingly attractive to a man you may then tremble in terror for you will have become a beautiful gorean slave girl i am afraid she said of course i said i am afraid to be beautiful she said naturally i said but i am afraid you will not be able to help yourself but as i become more beautiful and desirable she said i would become more helpless more a slave more than ever at the mercy of these mighty men of gor yes i said of course you would be then only their helpless beautiful slave how fearful she said i said nothing do you truly think i might become beautiful she asked she lifted her hair over her head straightening her body and regarded herself in the mirror yes i said she then removed her hands from her hair behind her her hair came falling to the sweetness of her shoulder blades this was a bit short for the hair of a gorean slave girl their hair as is required by most masters is usually somewhat long there is more that can be done with long hair both with respect to adding variety to the girls appearance and in the furs than with short hair sometimes the girl is even tied in her own hair most importantly perhaps long hair is beautiful on a girl or surely at least on many girls too many masters enjoy unbinding it before ordering a girl to the furs unbinding a girls hair on gor incidentally is culturally understood as being the act of one who owns her a free woman captured whose hair her captor unbinds usually the first time by the stroke of a knife a precaution against poison pins and other devices knows full well by this act that she will soon be made his slave many gorean masters incidentally shape and trim the hair of their own girls this is less expensive than having it done in a pen too it is pleasant to cut the hair of a girl one owns she generally kneels a wrap of repcloth about her shoulders while this is done beneath the wrap of repcloth of course she is naked and in the position of the pleasure slave when one is through with the cutting it is then convenient to have her she looked at herself kneeling in the mirror the earrings are beautiful i said yes master she said she brushed her hair back with her two hands and turning her head from side to side her finger tips at her ears again regarded herself she had the vanity of a lovely slave what do you see in the mirror i asked a slave girl she said yes i said a girl to be bought and sold and abused for a masters pleasure of course i said i may not be beautiful she said but i am delicate and lovely am i not yes i said you are could you truly bring yourself to put me beneath your heavy and uncompromising will she asked certainly i said you could and you will wont you she said yes i said could you whip me she asked yes i said it is a strange feeling being a slave she said you will grow used to it slave girl i said yes master she said i went to her behind her standing there before the mirror what do you see i asked a slave girl she said at the feet of her master i put my hand in her hair and turned her head from side to side then i stopped what do you see i asked a slave girl at the feet of her master she said his hand in her hair commanding her making her do what he wishes i then with my hand in her hair turned her to the side and bent back her body exposing as she knelt there helpless the lovely slave bow of her beauty what do you see i asked a displayed slave she said i did not release her suddenly she said no oh no i waited for a full moment holding her helplessly there letting her see well whatever it might be that she saw and then i released her she knelt there terrified shuddering before the mirror what did you see i asked it is hard to explain she said shuddering suddenly for a fearful moment i saw myself as incredibly beautiful as beautiful as i might someday be but the beauty was not the cool and formal beauty of a free woman something i can understand but the hot sensuous helpless beauty of an owned slave and i was the slave and too for a moment i thought i understood how such a woman might look to a man it was so frightening how we must fear that they might simply seize us and tear us to pieces in their lust then suddenly i understood the brand and collar the whip the chain of course they would brand us marking us as their own of course they would put us in steel collars which we could not remove of course they could chain us to their walls and slave rings of course they would use the whip unhesitantly upon us if we were in the least displeasing she knelt before the mirror shuddering perhaps now i said you understand in some small particular what it is for a woman to be attractive to a man they want us she whispered frightened literally yes i said they want to own us she said own us of course i said i did not know such desire such lust could exist she said yes i said and i could be owned by such a man she said then she looked up at me and then suddenly put down her head and i am owned by such a man she said trembling and what do you feel of this i asked nothing on my own world has prepared me for this master she said there is a stain of blood on your thigh i said my master took my virginity she said you are now a redsilk girl i said yes master she said i am now a redsilk girl whose redsilk girl i asked your redsilk girl master she said i walked back to the center of the room and turned facing her she knelt before the mirror stand up i told her she did so turn and approach me i said but i am naked she said do you wish for me to repeat a command i asked she turned white no master she said she then approached me and stood quite closely before me she had not been taught to stand this closely before me she knew instinctively in the circumstances where she would stand this pleased me for it indicated whether she knew it or not that she was a natural slave this distance of course was not cultural for her she came from a culture which requires a significant distance usually a yard or more between male speakers and as much or more between speakers of the opposite sex yet she knew readily or instinctively or intuitively or naturally or somehow that she should be in these circumstances standing as she was before me at a distance where i might if i wished without inconvenience simply take her in my arms she looked up at me master she asked the gorean slave girl incidentally will space herself from her master quite differently in different situations for example if she is somewhat farther away it is easier for her to display herself in all her beauty if she wishes to wheedle for his caress she may approach quite closely if she is receiving instructions she may kneel a few feet away if she is begging to serve his pleasure she may kneel at his feet perhaps kissing them and holding his ankles obviously too a girl who fears she is to be disciplined will commonly hang back sometimes too a girl will fear to approach too closely until the master by an expression or small sign indicates that she is not in obvious disfavor and may do so i took the head of the blondhaired barbarian in my hands and looked at her she lowered her eyes how magnificent it is to own a woman what can compare with it i turned her head from side to side how exciting were the earrings penetrating the soft flesh of her ear lobes i looked at the tiny wires vanishing in the minute punctures and then emerging looping her ears as though in a slave bond making them the mounting places from which thus fastened upon her by my will dangled two golden rings barbaric ornaments enhancing the beauty of a slave i smiled to myself on earth i had thought little of earrings yet now in the gorean setting how exquisite and exciting they suddenly seemed perhaps then for the first time i truly began to sense how the gorean views such things surely these things are symbolic as well as beautiful the girls lovely ears have been literally pierced the penetrability of her sweet flesh is thus brazenly advertised upon her very body a proclamation of her ready vulnerability in incitement to male rapine and when she wears the earrings he can see the metal disappearing in the softness of her ear literally fixed within it her flesh is doubly penetrated her softness about the intruding metal before his very eyes the wire loop too or rod when it emerges from the ear and by one device or another fastens the ring upon her may suggest her bondage too if the ring itself is closed perhaps it suggests her susceptibility to the locked shackle say a wrist ring or slave bracelet would there not in the two rings be one so to speak for each wrist it is little wonder that gorean free women never pierce their ears it is little wonder that in the beginning it was only the lowest and most exciting of pleasure slaves who had their ears pierced now however it is not uncommon on gor for almost any pleasure slave to have her ears pierced the custom of piercing the ears of a slave has now become relatively widespread it has been done in turia of course for generations too of course the ring is an obvious ornament the girl placed in it has thus been ornamented ornamentation is not inappropriate in a slave lastly the ring is beautiful thus it makes the slave more beautiful i held her head still and lifted it that it might face me she opened her eyes looking up at me master she asked i looked down at her you are a legal slave i told her yes master she said but what you do not yet know i said is that you are also a true slave a natural slave i come from a world she said where women are not slaves is that the world called earth i asked yes she said i have heard i said that on that world women are piteous slaves only they lack masters that lack she said in my case on this world will surely be made up yes i said i released her head and held her then by the upper arms i will obey you she said softly i will do anything and everything that you might want that is known to me i said yes master she said tossing her head a bit irritably would you like to be made more beautiful i asked of course she said lightly if it is my masters wish i then released her and she stood there i went to the side of the room and picked up my sea bag i threw it to the center of the room she looked down at it puzzled it was of heavy blue material canvas and tied with a white rope lie down upon it i told her on your back your head to the floor she did so no please she said not like this it is a common position for a disciplinary slave rape in it the woman feels very vulnerable very helpless i then took her no she wept in english have you no respect for my feelings am i nothing to you i stood up i had by intent given her no time to respond other than as a brutalized slave no time to feel other than as a girl unilaterally subjected to her masters pleasure she looked up at me miserably crawl now to the mirror i told her on your hands and knees and regard yourself miserable she did so her hair falling before her face trembling her sweet breasts pendant she lifted her head and gasped looking in the mirror do you see i asked yes she said and then wept her head down lift your head again i said and again look she did so do you see i asked yes she said weeping the slave is more beautiful than before she then put down her head again crying crawl now to the straw by the slave ring i told her lie down there drawing your legs up yes master she said i then went to her with a blanket and threw it over her but not yet covering her head she looked up at me so vulnerable and delicate so helpless and frightened i am more beautiful now she said but how how could it be it is the result of an inward change in you i said outwardly manifested in expression and bodily mien but what she asked speak your feelings i told her never before she said did i feel so helplessly owned that has something to do with it i told her you subjected me so casually so forcibly to your will she said that too has something to do with it i told her you are my master arent you she asked yes i said you can do with me whatever you want cant you she asked yes i said and you will wont you she asked yes i said i love being owned she said suddenly of course i said you are a woman if a woman loves being owned she said must she not be a natural slave answer your own question i told her you are the woman i dare not answer it she whispered do so i told her yes she whispered frightened she must be a natural slave and you are a woman i said yes master she said draw your conclusion i told her out loud i am a natural slave master she said yes i said she looked up at me never never did i think i would admit that in my life she said it takes great courage i told her there were tears in her eyes but as yet i said it is largely only an intellectual recognition on your part it is not yet internalized not yet a part of the totality of your being and responses yes master she said nonetheless the intellectual recognition abstract and superficial as it is is a useful first step in the transformation of your consciousness and the freeing of your deepest self with her profundities of emotions and needs my deepest self is feminine she said yes i said it is only your present consciousness which has been to some extent masculinized and to a larger extent neuterized beneath the patterns the trainings the roles lies the woman it is she whom we must seek it is she whom we must free i am afraid to be feminine she said you will be punished for femininity on this world i told her only by free women free she laughed miserably they think themselves free i said could i dare to be a woman on this world she asked yes i told her but what if i wish to crawl to a handsome man and beg to obey him she asked on this world i told her you may do so but would he not then as a gentleman scandalized lift me hastily to my feet embarrassed implicitly belittling me and encouraging me to the pursuit of masculine virtues would you fear that i asked yes she said is that why you would hesitate to crawl to a man i asked of course she said on this world as a slave i said you need have no fear what would he do on this world she asked perhaps instruct you in the proper way to crawl to his feet i said oh she said if you did not do so beautifully enough i said he might whip you whip me she asked yes i said she looked at me gorean men are not easy to please slave i said yes master she said masculinity and femininity are complementary properties i told her if a man wishes a woman to be more feminine he must be more masculine if a woman wishes a man to be more masculine she must be more feminine i am thinking of the far world from which i came master she said i think there may be a fearful corollary to what you have said perhaps if a man fears a woman he will want her to be more like a man and if a woman fears a man she will want him to be more like a woman perhaps i said it may depend on the individuals i would not know i am more beautiful now she said i saw it in the mirror yes i said i still do not understand clearly she said how it could be you were taught i said that you were owned and that you were subject totally to the male will yes master she whispered you had begun to learn just a little then you see i said that you a lovely woman were truly under male domination and that made me more beautiful she asked yes i said how she asked by releasing in response more of your femininity i said she looked up at me frightened it is a natural thing i said as a woman becomes more feminine she becomes more beautiful i am afraid to be feminine and beautiful she said as well you might be on this world as a slave i said knowing what it will mean for you how it will excite the lust of masters and make men mad to own you no she said that is not it it is rather that i fear that self i fear it might be truly me have you never wondered i asked what it might be like men with whips standing near you to dance naked in the firelight your feet striking in the sand before warriors yes she said i have wondered about that you see i said that self you fear is truly you give me a choice she begged you will be given no choice i told her your femininity will be forced to grow nurtured if necessary by the whip yes she whispered yes what i said yes master she said master she protested but i lifted the dark blanket and threw it over her head so that she was completely covered she could not then speak or rise up for the blanket was over her i got to my feet from the sea bag i drew forth the notes for fortunes made out to shaba to be drawn on various of the banks of schendi and the false ring that which he was supposed to carry to the sardar in place of the true ring for the notes i as a putative agent of kurii was to receive the true ring the tahari ring which i would then return to port kar that samos might arrange for its delivery to the sardar i did not think i would kill shaba if he should actually dare to deliver the false ring to the sardar he would doubtless there fall into the power of the priestkings they would then deal with him as they saw fit if he did not choose to deliver the false ring to the sardar i might then at a later date hunt him down to kill him my first priority was surely to return the tahari ringo samos as swiftly and safely as possible it was now near the eighteenth ahn master said sasi i fear your eyes i must leave now i told her i fear your eyes she said how you look at me will you return to us i will try i told her i see by your eyes she said that you fear you will not return to us it is a hard business on which i embark i told her in the sea bag i said are various things the key to your collar is there for example too there are coins they should in the event that i do not return or do not soon return keep you and the barbarian alive for a long time yes master she said then she looked at me wonderingly you would let me put my hand on the key to my own collar she asked schendi may not be an easy place in which to survive i told her you may find it convenient in some circumstances to remove your collar are you freeing me she asked it did not even occur to sasi that anyone might consider freeing the blondhaired barbarian she so luscious and becoming so beautiful could obviously on a world such as gor be only slave meat i looked at sasi swiftly she knelt forgive me my master she said please do not slay me no i said but schendi may not be an easy place in which to survive you may find it convenient in some circumstances to remove your collar i am branded she said i would fear to masquerade as a free woman i would not advise that i said you might be fed to tharlarion but still it might be better for you not to be recognized as the girl of tarl of teletus who are you truly master she asked look to the beam above your head and behind you i said what dangles there which might be conveniently lowered a whipping ring she said what hangs on the wall behind you to your left i asked a slave whip she said do you again request to know my true identity i asked no master she said you are an agile clever slave sasi i said as quickwitted as you are curvacious you have lived as a sheurt on the wharves of port kar i have little fear for you i glanced at the barbarian beneath the blanket do not fear master said sasi i will teach her to hide and eat garbage and be pleasing to paga attendants i must go now i said yes master she said in time i said if i do not return you will both presumably be caught and put up for public auction yes master she said i turned to leave must you leave this moment she asked i turned about and looked at her i may never see you again she said i shrugged i do not want to be free she said do not fear i told her you will not be please my master she said make now to me a gentle love i went to sasi and crouched down and took her in my arms msaliti and i are tricked by shaba what occurred outside the headquarters of msaliti and shaba you are late said msaliti i have brought the notes i told him it is past the nineteenth ahn he said i was detained i said have you brought the notes he asked yes i said i have brought them he was clearly nervous he admitted me from the street to the small dingy anteroom that leading to the larger room in which we had the preceding day discussed our business is shaba here i asked no he said then what is so important about me being late i asked give me the notes he said give me the ring no i said i entered the larger room that in which we had conferred on matters of importance yesterday where are the askaris i asked they were not in the room they are elsewhere said he the room was more attractive yesterday i said when it contained the two female slaves msaliti and i sat down crosslegged near the low table yesterday evening i said after we parted i paid a visit to the tavern of pembe i made use there of the slave who had once been evelyn ellis she is not bad in a collar she is frigid said msaliti nonsense i said the poor girl is paga hot i find that surprising said he she cannot now help herself i said pathetic thing he said it required only a bit of chaining and teaching her so to speak to kiss the whip excellent said msaliti you seem distracted i said it is nothing he said my thoughts strayed to the blondhaired barbarian and sasi keep her under the blanket for an ahn after i have left i had told sasi you may then release her if you wish if you do not wish to do so of course then leave her there as long as you please yes master said sasi she is an ignorant girl and a natural slave i said so keep her under strict discipline yes master said sasi do not hesitate to use the whip on her i said no master said sasi remember that she is a natural slave i told sasi we are all natural slaves master she said but have no fear i will keep her under a very strict discipline as is fitting for any slave i said yes master smiled sasi i had then kissed her and left why do you not give me the notes and the ring asked msaliti my orders i said are to exchange them with shaba for the authentic shield ring to whom will you return the ring he asked to belisarius in cos i said do you know his house asked msaliti certainly not i said i will be contacted where will the contact be made asked msaliti regarding me narrowly at the chatka and curla i said in cos who is master of the chatka and curla asked msaliti aurelion of cos i said of course yes said msaliti have no fear i said i will do my best to see that the ring reaches the proper authorities msaliti nodded i smiled why would you wish the ring i asked to assure that it reaches the beasts he said they would not be pleased should it be again lost your concern for their cause is commendable i said i have no wish to be torn to pieces he said that is understandable i said neither would i cheerfully look forward to such a termination you seem in a good mood he said surely you too should be in a pleasant frame of mind i said is our business not nearly completed that is my hope said msaliti do you truly fear the beasts so i asked our business has been delayed he said it is my fear that the beasts themselves will come for the ring but i am to pick up the ring i said i do not even know you said msaliti i do not know you either really i said we were looking for the blond girl he said she was delayed i said she was enslaved i pointed out cheerfully a pity he said nonsense i said slavery is good for a woman i do not trust shaba he said i am sure he does not trust us either i said at least we trust each other msaliti drummed his fingers on the low table are you sure we are alone i asked of course said msaliti none have entered before i came the askaris in the anteroom guarded the door they neglected i see i said to replace the peas on their threads in this room those dislodged by my peregrination of yesterday evening on the roof of course they replaced them said msaliti i would not he too sure then i said that we are alone msaliti looked quickly upward several of the strings with the tiny peas attached dangled downward the grille too i note i said has been removed you are observant said shaba msaliti staggered to his feet stumbling backward across the table from us in his customary place sat shaba there had been a momentary blurring in the area a sort of twisting swirl of light something like a whirlpool of light and then calmly he had sat before us i did not think you would be late i said you seemed a punctual fellow it is you who were late he said yes i said i am sorry about that i was detained was she pretty asked shaba i nodded yes i said matters of great moment are afoot here said msaliti with your permission that of both of you if you please i would like to attend to them it is my understanding said shaba to me that you have brought the notes and the false ring yes i said i put the notes on the table where is the false ring asked msaliti i have it i told him shaba looked at the notes carefully he did not hurry these notes seem to be in order he said may i see them asked msaliti shaba handed him the notes you do not trust our broadshouldered courier he asked i trust as few people as possible said msaliti he looked at the notes very closely then he handed them back to shaba i know the seals and signatures he said they may truly be drawn on the banks indicated there are twenty thousand tarns of gold there i said cash them before you carry the false ring to the sardar said msaliti it is in our interest in these circumstances to bargain in good faith but what if i do not carry the false ring to the sardar asked shaba i would do so if i were you said msaliti i see said shaba the beasts he said do not deal lightly with traitors that is understandable said shaba this business could be conducted in the morning i said at the banks in question you might then verify the notes and withdraw or redeposit the gold as you please kunguni the beggar said msaliti cannot well enter the edifices on schendis street of coins then enter as msaliti i said msaliti laughed do not speak foolishly he said i did not understand his answer i am satisfied to do the business tonight said shaba if the notes are not genuine obviously i would not carry the ring to the sardar remember said msaliti do not depress the switch on the false ring it must be depressed only in the sardar the hair on the back of my neck rose i then realized that what i had suspected must be true that the false ring was of great danger shaba put the notes within his robes he then from about his neck removed a long light chain it had hung hitherto within the robes concealed he opened the chain i saw the ring on the chain my heart was pounding he extended his hand may i have the false ring he asked i think there is little point in carrying the false ring to the sardar i said the delay has surely been such as to provoke suspicion this was true actually i was not eager for a personal reason for shaba to deliver the ring i respected what he had done in the exploration of gor i knew him to be a man of intelligence and courage he was a traitor yes but there was something about him indefinable which i found to my liking i did not particularly wish to see him subjected to whatever priestkings or their human allies might deem fit as the fate of a traitor i did not think that if they set their minds to it they would be less ingenious than kurii perhaps it would be better if i slew him i would do so swiftly mercifully the ring please said shaba give him the ring said msaliti i handed shaba the false ring and he slipped it on the chain were there not eleven strings dangling from the ceiling he asked msaliti quickly turned and looked i do not know he said are there more now i had not taken my eyes from shaba there were twelve i said there are twelve now said msaliti counting then there are the same number now as before said shaba yes i said regarding him evenly i must commend you said shaba you have powers of observation worthy of a scribeor of a warrior he turned the chain and slipped a ring from it handing it to me geographers and cartographers of course are members of the scribes i allowed for the turning of the chain i received in my hand the ring which had originally hung on the chain shaba the false ring on the chain again fastened the chain behind his neck he stood up and so too did msaliti and myself i am leaving schendi tonight said shaba i too said msaliti i have lingered too long here it would not be well for you to be too much missed smiled shaba no said msaliti i did not understand their exchange i wish you well my colleagues in treachery said shaba farewell said we to him he then bowing took his leave give me now the ring said msaliti i will keep it i said give it to me said msaliti not pleasantly no i said i then looked at the ring i turned it in my hand i wished to see the minute scratch which would for me identify the tahari ring i turned the ring feverishly my hand shook stop shaba i said this is not the ring he is gone said msaliti that is the ring from the chain on his neck where he carried the shield ring it is not the shield ring i said miserably i had been outwitted shaba was a brilliant man he had established for us earlier yesterday evening that the ring on the chain had been the shield ring tonight however he had substituted a new ring i might have discerned this had he not appeared to be intent on misdirecting our attention calling it to the simple warning system that of the threads and peas in the ceiling presumably to effect switch of the rings while our attention was diverted i had not permitted my attention however to be diverted too when he had turned the chain i had made certain that the ring which he had surrendered to me had been the ring originally on the chain the exchange of rings of course had actually taken place earlier in privacy the ring he had apparently intended to exchange for the true ring would have been the false ring returning it to us as the true ring i had not permitted this my smugness at preventing this exchange had blinded me foolishly to the possibility that the ring on the chain this evening might not have been the true ring to begin with msaliti looked sick i gave him the ring shaba now had both the true ring the tahari ring and the false ring that which kurii had intended to be delivered to the sardar in lieu of the true ring how do you know it is not the true ring asked msaliti surely you have been taught to identify the true ring i asked i thought swiftly no said msaliti the copy of the true ring was well done at the edge of the silver plate that held in the rings bezel there was indeed a minute scratch it was similar to but it was not the identical marring which i recalled from the tahari the jeweler who had duplicated the ring for shaba had failed slightly in that particular there was a slight difference in the depth of the scratches and one small difference in the angulation this resembles the true ring closely i told msaliti it is large and of gold and in its bezel has a rectangular silver plate on the back of the ring when you turn it there is a circular depressible switch yes yes said msaliti but look here i said see this scratch yes he said the true ring according to my information possesses no such identifying marks i said it is supposedly perfect in its appearance had it been thusly marred i would have been informed of this such a sign would make identification simple you are a fool said msaliti doubtless shaba scratched it would you yourself treat so valuable an object with harshness i asked msaliti turned the ring about he looked at me then he depressed the switch nothing happened he howled with rage the ring clutched in his fist you were tricked he cried we have been tricked i corrected him shaba then has the perfect ring he said true i said shaba had the perfect ring which was the false ring he also had the true tahari ring which the ring in msalitis hand so ingeniously resembled you must put men upon schendis street of coins i said shaba must not be permitted to cash the notes he carries surely he must realize that could be done said msaliti he is not mad how does he expect to get his gold he is quite intelligent even brilliant i mused doubtless he has anticipated such a move yet it must be made it will be made said msaliti angrily how then i wonder said i does he intend to obtain the gold msaliti looked at me in fury he must have a plan i said i am leaving said msaliti surely you will wish to don your disguise i said i do not need it longer he said what are you going to do i asked i must move swiftly he said there are many instructions to be issued there must be an apprehension of shaba how may i be of assistance i asked i will handle matters from here on out he said do not trouble yourself about them he threw a brocaded aba about his shoulders and angrily strode from the room wait i called he had left the room angrily i followed him as soon as i had passed through the anteroom and stepped across the threshold to the street outside i felt my arms pinioned behind me a dozen or more men were there waiting beside the building on either side of the door some seven or eight were askaris including the two huge fellows whom i had seen yesterday black giants in skins and feathers with golden armlets another five or six were guardsmen of schendi there was also an officer there of the merchant council of schendi is this he asked the officer of the merchant council that is he said msaliti turning about he claims to be tarl of teletus but he will be unable to substantiate that identity what is going on here i shouted i struggled trying to free myself of the four men who held me then i felt two daggers pressed through the fabric of my tunic i ceased struggling feeling the points in my flesh both could be driven home before i could hurl my captors from me my hands were taken behind me and tied these men were waiting for me i said to msaliti of course said be i see that you were determined in any event i said to be the one who would return the ring to our superiors of course said msaliti i will then stand higher in their favor but what of me i asked he shrugged who can tell what may have happened to you he asked you are an officer of schendi i said to the man in charge of the guardsmen i demand to be released here is the paper said msaliti to the officer the officer took the paper and looked it over then he looked at me you are the one who calls himself tarl of teletus he asked yes i said the officer placed the paper inside his robes there is no place in schendi he said for criminal vagabonds look in my wallet i said you will see that i am not a vagabond the wallet was cut from my belt the officer shook out gold pieces and silver tarsks into his hand you see i asked he arrived in schendi said msaliti in the garb of a metal worker you see him now in the garb of a leather worker msaliti smiled what metal worker or leather worker he asked carries such funds he is obviously a thief doubtless a fugitive said the officer the work levy imposed on schendi is due to leave in the morning said msaliti perhaps this fellow could take the place of a good citizen of schendi in that levy would you find that acceptable asked the officer msaliti looked at me yes he said splendid said the officer put ropes on the sleens neck two leash ropes were knotted on my neck this is not justice i said these are hard times said the officer and schendi fights for her life he then lifted his hand to msaliti and withdrew taking his guardsmen with him where am i to be taken i asked msaliti to the interior he said you had the cooperation of the council of schendi i said someone in a high place must have ordered this yes said msaliti who i asked i said msaliti i looked at him puzzled surely you know who i am he asked no i said i am msaliti he said and he i asked who might he be why i smiled msaliti and you i asked i thought it was known to all he said i am the high wazir of bila huruma kisu get back i shouted striking at it with the shovel the edge of the shovel struck cutting at the side of its snout it hissed the noise is incredibly loud or seems so when one is close to it i saw the pointed tongue the jaws distended more than a yard in height with the rows of backwardleaning fangs i had managed to get my foot on the lower jaw and with the shovel pry up the jaw releasing the hold on the lacerated leg of ayari who bleeding scrambled back i had felt the draw of his chain against my own collar i thrust the shovel out again against the upper teeth thrusting back shouting other men too to the right of ayari and to my left screamed and struck at it with their shovels eyes blazing it backed away twisting small legs with the stubby clawed feet stabbing at the water its gigantic tail thrashed striking a man hurling him back a dozen feet the water was to my thighs i pushed back again with the shovel the transparent eyelids on the beast under the scaly eyelids closed and opened it hissed more its tongue sopping at the blood of ayari in its mouth back cried the askari in the inland language with his torch thrusting it into the beasts mouth it roared with pain then thrashing squirming hissing it backed off in the shallow water i saw its eyes and snout nostrils open almost level with the water away away shouted the askari in the inland speech brandishing his torch another askari at his side armed with a lance gripping it with two hands shouted too ready to support his fellow interestingly the incident did not much affect the work in the area from where i stood i could see hundreds of men workmen and askaris and many rafts some weighted with supplies others with logs and tools some with mud and earth we had dug out of the swampy terrain mud and earth which would be used to bank the flanking barricades that the area in which we worked might be drained that a proper channel might later be excavated are you all right i asked ayari he wiped the flies away from his head i think i am sick he said there was blood in the water about his leg return to work said the askari with the torch wading near us you have had a narrow escape i told ayari he threw up into the water can you work asked the askari ayaris leg seemed to buckle under him he half fell in the water i cannot stand he said i supported him it is well that i am on the rogues chain grinned ayari never before have i been so pleased with my profession said he had i not been chained doubtless i would have been pulled away that is quite possible i told him ayari was of schendi a thief he had been put on the work levy for the canal of bila huruma schendi was using the misfortune of the levies in order as much as possible to rid itself of its less desirable citizens i supposed she could scarcely be blamed ayari of schendi of course spoke gorean happily for me he could also speak the tongue of the court of bila huruma his father had many years ago fled from an inland village that of nyuki noted for its honey on the northern shore of lake ushindi the incident had had to do with the theft of several melons from the chiefs patch his father had returned some five years later to purchase his mother they had then lived in schendi the inland speech hail been spoken in the home it is estimated that some five to eight percent of the people of schendi are familiar with the inland speech can you work asked the askari of ayari such simple phrases i could now make out thanks to ayaris tutoring more impressive to me was ayaris capacity to read the drums though i am told this is not difficult for anyone who can speak the inland speech fluently analogues to the major vowel sounds of the inland speech are found in certain of the drum notes which differ depending on where the hollowed grooved log is struck the rhythm of the drum message of course is the rhythm of the inland speech thus on the drum it is possible to duplicate in effect the vowels and intonation contours of inland sentences when one adds to this certain additional drum signals corresponding in effect to keys to the message or to certain consonantal ciphers one has in effect a direct effective ingenious device at ones disposal given the drum relays for longdistance communication a message may be conveyed by means of drum stations for hundreds of pasangs in less than an ahn needless to say bila huruma had adopted and improved this device and it had played and continued to play its role in the effectiveness of his military machine and in the efficiency of the administration of his ubarate as a communication device it was clearly superior to the smoke and beacon ciphers of the north there was as far as i knew nothing on gor to compare with it except of course the advanced technological equipment at the disposal of the priestkings and kurii equipment of a sort generally forbidden in the weapons and communication laws to most gorean humans i found it astonishing and i think most goreans would have even those of schendi that a ubarate of the size and sophistication of that of bali huruma could exist in the equatorial interior one of the most amazing evidences of its scope and ambition was the very project in which i was now unwillingly engaged the visionary attempt to join lakes ushindi and ngao separated by more than four hundred pasangs by a great canal a canal that would via lake ushindi and the nyoka and kamba rivers then link the mysterious ua river it flowing into lake ngao to gleaming thassa the sea a linkage that would given the ua open up to the civilized world the riches of the interior riches that must then pass through the ubarate of bila huruma can you work repeated the askari to ayari no said ayari then i must have you killed said the askari i have made a speedy recovery said ayari good said the askari and waded away holding his torch above the water the other askari he with the tharlarion lance accompanied him in a few moments the mud raft of logs bound together with lianas to be loaded with excavated mud was again poled to our vicinity can you dig i asked ayari no he said i will dig for you i said you would wouldnt you he asked yes i said i will dig for myself he said how is your leg i asked it is still there he said most of the workers on the canal were not chained most were impressed free men waters from the overflow of lake ngao entered the great marsh between ngao and ushindi and thence made their ways to ushindi which by means of the kamba and nyoka drained to gleaming thassa the sea the intent of the engineers of bila huruma was to set in place two parallel walls low walls some five or six feet high placed about two hundred yards apart the area between these walls the marsh waters diverted on either side was then to be drained and readied for the digging of the main channel in this work draft tharlarion and great scoops brought from the north as well as gigantic work crews would be used in the event that the central channel when completed would not prove sufficient to handle the overflow of ngao as seemed likely conducting it geometrically to ushindi side channels were contemplated the eventual intent of bila huruma was not only to open the rain forests of the deep interior and whatever might lie within the system of the ua and her tributaries to commercial exploitation and military expansion but to drain the marshes between the two mighty lakes ushindi and ngao that that land then reclaimed thousands of square pasangs might eventually be made available for agriculture it was the intent of bila huruma not only to consolidate a ubarate but found a civilization i slapped at insects work said an askari wading by i shoveled another load of mud from the marsh and flung it on the mud raft work work said the askari encouraging others along the chain i looked about myself at the hundreds of men i could see from where i stood this is an impressive project i said to ayari doubtless we can be pleased that we are a humble part of so mighty an undertaking he mused i suppose so i said on the other hand said ayari i would be content to surrender my part in this noble endeavor to others more worthy than myself i too i admitted dig said an askari we continued to shovel mud onto the mud raft our only hope said a man to my left also like ayari from schendi are the hostile tribes that is some hope said ayari if it were not for the askaris they would fall upon us with their slaughtering knives surely there is resistance to the canal i said there are the villages of the ngao region on the northern shore said ayari there is trouble there that is the most organized resistance said the man on my left the canal is expensive i said it must constitute a financial strain on the coffers of the ubarate of bila huruma this must generate discontent in his court the work levies too must be resented by the villages those of schendi too said ayari are not too pleased with the project they fear bila huruma i said yes said ayari there are mixed feelings in schendi said the man to my left she would stand to profit if the canal were completed that is true said ayari there was shouting from ahead askaris rushed forward lift me up said ayari he was not large i lifted him to my shoulders what is it asked the man to my left it is nothing said ayari it is only a raiding party of three or four men they threw their spears and then fled the askaris are pursuing them i lowered ayari again to the water was anyone killed asked the man to my left no said ayari the workers saw them and withdrew last night said the man ten men were killed he looked at us and none were chained he said it is true said ayari that we would be much at the mercy of such raiders it is unlikely that such however i said could truly do more than delay the progress of the canal yes said ayari could they not free and arm the work crews asked the man to my left the men of the work crews are not of their tribes said ayari you think like one of schendi not one of the interior ayari waved at the lines of men behind us besides said he most of these men are in their way loyal subjects of bila huruma when their work tours are finished they return to their villages most of them would not be again impressed for labor for two or three years ah said the man to my left disgustedly there are two obvious ways in which bila huruma might be stopped said ayari first he must be defeated second he might be killed the first i said is unlikely considering his army and its training there is nothing in these terrains which is likely to be able to meet it in open battle there are the rebels of the northern shore of ngao said the man how can they be rebels i asked bila huruma in virtue of the discoveries of shaba said ayari has claimed all lands in the lake ngao region those who oppose him are thus rebels i see now i said to be sure the distinctions of statecraft sometimes elude me it is basically simple said ayari one determines what one wishes to prove and then arranges ones principles in such a way that the desired conclusion follows as a demonstrable consequence i see i said logic is as neutral as a knife he said but what of truth i asked truth is more troublesome he admitted i think you would make an excellent diplomat i said i have been a fraud and charlatan all my life said ayari there would thus be no transition to make five days ago said the man to my left hundreds of askaris in canoes went past us east before you were entered upon our chain their objective i asked to meet and defeat in battle the rebel forces of kisu former mfalme of the ukungu villages if they are successful said ayari that will finish organized resistance to bila huruma they will be successful said the man why did you say former mfalme i asked bila huruma he said it is well known has bought off the chieftains of the ukungu region in council they have deposed kisu and placed their leader aibu in power kisu then withdrew with some two hundred warriors loyal to him to continue the fight against bila huruma in the arts of politics said ayari complacently gold is more insidious than steel he should withdraw to the forests to continue the fight from there i said war from the forests said ayari is effective only against an enemy which is weak or humane the weak enemy lacks the power to exterminate the population of the forest the humane enemy will not do so bila huruma unfortunately i fear is neither weak nor humane surely he must be stopped i said perhaps he could be killed said ayari he is well guarded surely said the man to my left surely said ayari our only hope said the man to my left is a victory by the forces of kisu five days ago said ayari the askaris went east to engage him in battle perhaps by now said the man to my left the battle has taken place no i said it is surely too soon why asked ayari kisu is severely outnumbered i said he would maneuver for position he would choose his time of battle with great care unless it were forced upon him said ayari how could that be i asked do not underestimate the efficiency of the askaris of bila huruma said ayari you speak i said as though they were professional warriors under astute generalship skilled in scouting in flanking and cutting off retreats listen said ayari he held up his hand i hear it i said can you make it out quiet said ayari i am listening it was only some two pasangs away ahead of us and nearing us but in a moment its message was taken up from behind us some four pasangs down the workway west leading toward ushindi it would then swiftly station to station be transmitted back to the grass palace of bila huruma the forces of kisu have been met in battle and defeated said ayari that is the message of the drum askaris about us were lifting their weapons over their heads and shouting with pleasure behind us further down the workway too men were shouting with pride many lifting their shovels look said ayari i could see the craft now it was a shallowdrafted dismasted dhow it was being drawn by dozens of men wading in the marsh pulling on ropes they wore slave collars they were chained together in groups of eight or ten by the neck askaris some wading some in canoes flanked them the askaris were jubilant resplendent in their skins and feathers with their golden necklaces and armlets their narrow tufted shields and shorthandled stabbing spears on the foredeck of the dhow there was mounted a log drum on this methodically an askari drummer with two long sticks was heating out again and again the message of victory many askaris too rode the dhow mostly officers judging from the arrangements of their gold and feathers for it is by these things serving as insignia that their rankings to those who could read them as i could not were made clear behind the dhow some wading and others in canoes came more than a thousand askaris in place of the mast on the dhow mounted in the mast socket was a t frame with a small crossbar mounted on the vertical beam on this t frame a man was chained his arms were placed over and behind the horizontal bar of the frame his hands chained together the chain running before his body holding him to the frame his feet had been positioned on the small crossbar his ankles were also chained a loop of chain holding them close to the vertical beam he was a large man with tattooing he had apparently been wounded and surely had been much beaten i thought that he might be dead but as the dhow came closer i saw him possibly revived by the shouting and noise raise his head he then straightened his body and as he could stood proudly head high surveying us on the frame the askaris pointed their spears at him and turned to us and shouted there was no mistaking the name they cried kisu they cried kisu kisu it is kisu said ayari msaliti has formed a plan the white slave girls nude toweled my body away said msaliti sharply they fled away their bare feet pattering on the woven mats of my quarters within that gigantic compound that constituted the palace of bila huruma these robes said msaliti indicating robes spread upon the couch will be found suitable for an ambassador of teletus he then indicated a small chest at the couchs foot those gifts too he said will appear seemly from one interested in negotiating a commercial treaty with one of the stature of bila huruma i slipped on a tunic why could you not apprehend shaba at the banks i asked he never cashed the notes said msaliti i looked at him he feared to do so i asked we were tricked said msaliti he signed the notes over to bila huruma and it was agents of the ubar himself who cashed them twenty thousand tarns of gold i said the money said msaliti in fury is being invested in the formation of a fleet of a hundred ships fully fitted and supplied and crewed by fifty men each these ships are being specifically built to be sectioned and rejoinable to make possible their portage about difficult areas our money that which we paid for the ring is being used to outfit an expedition for the exploration of the ua that is a venture i said surely of interest to both a geographer such as shaba and a ubar such as bila huruma i thought he wanted the gold for himself said msaliti gold is perhaps of less interest to him than glory i said he will not get away with it said msaliti we will recover the ring it will take time to prepare such ships i said the work commenced months ago said msaliti surely this could not have been unknown to you i said the work was done in the shipyards of ianda he said i had heard rumors of such a project but did not understand the nature of the ships or that this ubarate was involved but now the ships are already moving upstream on the nyoka it seems i said that bila huruma does not take you into his full confidence he is a secretive man said msaliti perhaps it is fortunate for him that he does not fully trust you surely the hand of shaba may be seen in this said msaliti doubtless i said of those in these lands said msaliti only you and i and shaba know of the ring i gather that you now know the whereabouts of shaba i said he is here the bold rascal said msaliti in this very palace living openly protected by bila huruma he is a courageous fellow i said he thinks he has little to fear said msaliti what is your plan i asked bila huruma this very morning said he holds court you in the guise of an ambassador of teletus will bring forward gifts for his viewing i will do the speaking you need do little or nothing almost no one present will be able to understand gorean i will explain that the details of your proposal for a commercial treaty will be discussed with the appropriate wazir and presented later for approval in short i said it will appear little more than an official greetings exchanged between governments that would be appropriate at this stage of negotiation said msaliti very well i said but what do you have further in mind shaba as one close to bila huruma will be present in the court he said you will attack shaba and slay him i will then have you placed under arrest by askaris i will obtain the ring from the body of shaba and you later by arrangement will be permitted to escape i will pay you a hundred tarns of gold and i myself will then return the ring to the beasts bila huruma will not connect my attack with you in any way i asked presumably not said msaliti i must remain in the clear you understand of course i said why do you not hire just any assassin to do this thing i asked you are a fellow agent of kurii he said you seem an ideal choice of course i said i think i may trust you he said why is that i asked you have had a taste of the canal he said if i am not fully cooperative i said you will return me to the rogues chain i have that power he said permit me to don the robes of an ambassador of teletus i said certainly said he what occurred when court was held in the palace of grass i meet bila huruma a new plan must be formed do you have the dagger whispered msaliti to me surely i said in the sleeve sheath he then left my side there were more than two hundred individuals in the great court both men and women of high station and certain commoners with causes to plead too there were guards and chieftains and envoys the robes were generally of animal skin some marvelously marked there was much gold and silver jewelry anklets and wristlets of feathers were common the hair of the men and women was worn in a variety of fashions too there were ornate headdresses in evidence usually of skins and feathers in the lips of some of the men were brass plugs facial tattooing in various designs was common the opulence and color of the court of bila huruma was quite impressive i was sure that it would have shamed the display and pageantry of many ubars in the north there were various racial types represented in the court almost all black i was the only white present there were some brown fellows from bazi though and one of the attending physicians was oriental even among very similar black types there was variety in hair style and tattooing and dress which i took as evidence of cultural or tribal difference one of the difficulties in the ubarate of bila huruma was this sort of racial and tribal heterogeneity fortunately most of these people generally all from the ushindi region spoke closely related dialects this heterogeneity was surely a challenge to the ubarate of bila huruma and that his government was as stable as it was said as much i think for the intelligence of his governance as for the ruthlessness of his policies and the indomitability of his will when i entered the court bila huruma had just finished accepting the reports of his officers on the battle with the forces of kisu this battle interestingly had occurred in the marshes well west of ngao indeed only a few pasangs from the work lines kisu with his small handful of men as it turned out incredibly enough had been marching on bila huruma so bravely and pathetically might an ant have attacked a giant i hack no doubt as to the courage of kisu i was less confident however that he had the common sense and wisdom expected of a mfalme some of these officers presented men before him who were then commended for their deeds in the recent action rings of gold and now insignia of rank feathers and necklaces were distributed once bila huruma lifted his hand and said good the soldier then commended would then i think rather have died than betray bila huruma such small things i think may be scorned by those who do not understand the nature of war or men and be seen as manipulative and laughable and yet such a small commendation when warranted and sincere is worth more to some men than the material treasures that might move those who hold themselves their superiors let each man choose his own treasures the cynical mercantile mind will never understand the mind of the soldier the soldier has stood with comrades in arms and held i do not think he would exchange that for the contemptuous pretense to wisdom of those whom he protects who would scorn him he has maintained his post but perhaps some even those who have never marched in the mud with comrades singing on a clear and windy morning a spear upon their shoulder can understand this why does the nibbling urt chatter and laugh at the larl is it because he himself is not a larl or is it because he fears its paw i looked up at the high conical ceiling of interwoven branches and grass of the court of bila huruma it was some seventy feet over my head the room itself a great round room was a hundred feet in width msaliti again slipped to my side are you ready he asked yes i said bila huruma was then hearing cases at law selected for his attention perhaps one day the warrior in man would die and with him the fighter the wanderer the wonderer the explorer the adventurer the rover the doer and hoper the days of the lonely ones the walkers and seekers would then be at an end men might then become as many wished as cattle and flowers and be free to spend their days in placid grazing until they died beneath the distant burning unsought suns but it was difficult to know what the mists of the morning would bring i contented myself with the thought that deeds had been done which now whether recollected or not or however viewed were irrevocably fixed in their fullness and truth in the fabric of eternity they had been nothing nothing ever could change that the meaning of history lies not in the future but in the moment it is never anywhere but within our grasp and if the history of man terminated should turn out to have been but a brief flicker in the midst of unnoticing oblivions let it at least have been worthy of the moment in which it burned but perhaps it would prove to be a spark which would in time illuminate a universe it is difficult to know what the mists of the morning may bring much depends upon what man is much depends upon what he shall decide himself to be are you ready pressed msaliti yes yes i said i am quite ready for what i intend to do he then again left my side i could see shaba in the group of people near bila huruma his first case dealt with a widow who had been defrauded by a creditor the fellow was dragged screaming from the court his hands would be cut off as those of a common thief his properties were to be confiscated and divided half to the widow and half predictably to the state the next fellow was an actual thief a mere boy who had stolen vegetables it turned out that he had been hungry and had actually begged work in the gardens of his victim no one who wants to work in my ubarate said bila huruma will go hungry he then directed that the boy be given work if he wished in his own gardens which were considerable i supposed that if one did not wish to work one might well expect to starve bila huruma i conjectured was not one to be patient with laggards fairness is a central thesis of sound governance two murderers were next brought to him for sentencing the first a commoner had slain a boatsman from schendi the second an askari had killed another askari the commoner was ordered to have his fingers cut off and then be put upon a tharlarion pole in lake ushindi that his fingers be removed was accounted mercy on the part of bila huruma that he be able to cling less long to the pole and his miseries be the sooner terminated he had slain not one of the domain of bila huruma but one of schendi his crime thus was regarded as the less heinous the askari was ordered to be speared to death by one of his own kin in this fashion his honor would be protected and there would be no beginning of a possible blood feud between families the askari petitioned however to be permitted to die instead fighting the enemies of the ubarate this petition was denied on the grounds that he had by slaying his comrade not permitted this same privilege to him this judgment was accepted unquestioningly by the askari but am i not of my own kin my ubar he asked yes had said bila huruma he was taken outside he would be given a shorthandled stabbing spear and would be permitted to throw himself upon it the next fellow had lied about his taxes he would be hung a hook through his tongue in a market his properties were to be confiscated and distributed half to be given to members of his village and half to the state it was conjectured that when he was removed from the pole if he were still alive he would be more careful in his accounts from outside i heard the cry of the askari he had performed upon himself the justice of bila huruma the next to appear before bila huruma were two members of the nobility a man and his companion he complained of her that she had been unwilling to please him by one word and a stroke of his hand between them bila huruma dissolved their companionship he then ordered that the man be put in the dress of a woman and beaten from the court with sticks this was done he then ordered that the woman be stripped and a vine leash be put on her neck she was then sentenced to a barrack of askaris for a year that she might learn how to please men kisu the rebel in chains was then dragged before bila huruma he was thrown upon his knees he was sentenced to the canal to be put upon the rogues chain that he might now at last well serve his sovereign bila huruma kisu kept on his knees was then dragged to one side next to approach bila huruma was mwoga ambassador of the villages of ukungu representative of the high chief aibu who had organized the chiefs of ukungu against kisu and deposed him he presented gifts skins and feathers and brass rings and the teeth of tharlarion to bila huruma and swore to him the fealty of the ukungu villages too to seal the bonds of these political bargains he on behalf of aibu offered to bila huruma the very daughter of the high chief aibu him self a girl named tende as one of his companions is she beautiful asked bila huruma yes responded mwoga bila huruma shrugged it does not matter he said i supposed it did not matter there were doubtless many womens courts in his house he had i had heard already more than two hundred companions not to mention perhaps twice the number of slave girls captures purchases and gifts if the body of tende appealed to him he could get heirs upon it if it did not he could forget her leaving her neglected a sequestered souvenir of state another girl lost in one of the womens courts in the palace may i address our prisoner inquired mwoga yes said bila huruma is tende not beautiful he asked yes said kisu and she is as proud and cold as she is beautiful too bad she is not a slave said bila huruma she might then be made to crawl and cry out in passion she is worthy to be a slave said kisu she is the daughter of the traitor aibu bila huruma lifted his hand take him away he said kisu was dragged struggling from the court mwoga shortly thereafter bowing and stepping backwards took his leave msaliti then appeared by my side and thrust me gently through the crowd forward be ready he said bila huruma and those about him including shaba regarded me shaba gave no sign that he recognized me if he revealed that i was not what i seemed it might seem reasonable to inquire into the sources of his knowledge it would then be a short step to making clear his involvement with the ring such a trinket doubtless would be of great interest to the ubar bila huruma it was not in the best interest of shaba or myself or msaliti for the power of the ring to come to the attention of the sovereign of this vast equatorial ubarate when i was near bila huruma i was to draw the dagger slay shaba and then by prearranged plan be immediately apprehended by askari guardsmen to be placed under arrest msaliti was supposed to obtain the ring from the body of shaba i was later supposed to receive a hundred tarns of gold and my freedom i smiled to myself are you armed asked msaliti both in the inland speech some of which i had learnedfrom ayari and in gorean why yes i said pleasantly revealing the sleeve sheath and handing him the dagger for an instant just an instant i saw in the eyes of msaliti a flash of incredible fury then he nodded and accepted the dagger which he handed to an askari i showed the sleeve sheath to bila huruma who was interested in it such sheaths are common in the tahari but in the equatorial interior where men are commonly barearmed i gathered they were an interesting novelty bila huruma said something to an aide it had to do with seeing that a robe was made for him which contained such a device greetings great ubar said i and noble gentlemen all i smiled at shaba i bring you greetings from the merchant council of teletus that council sovereign in that free island aware of the wealth and mighty projects of the ubarate we desire to arrange the apparatus for commercial interaction with your state should the great canal be completed we are well aware that this ubarate will become a crucial link between the equatorial east and west we now wish as doubtless will other merchant holdings such as our sisters schendi and bazi to accord you our best wishes and to sue for your favor that our shipping and merchants may be permitted to prove themselves of service in your future ventures msaliti did his best not happily to translate this for bila huruma i wished to make such declarations for various reasons first i thought it possible that some of the blacks in the room besides shaba and msaliti perhaps close counselors of bila huruma might know gorean it was important to me to seem to be truly an envoy from teletus secondly i thought it might be amusing to try my hand at diplomatic bombast i seldom received such an opportunity and i have always been impressed by that sort of thing i gathered from the looks of those about that the sort of things i said were the usual sorts of things mostly vacuous which are said upon such occasions this pleased me thirdly i think i might have enjoyed discomfiting msaliti hoisting him so to speak by his own petard msaliti then signaled to a man who brought forward the gifts for bila huruma in the small coffer he acknowledged them and then they were put to the side i was informed through msaliti the ubar speaking that the greetings of teletus were accepted that his ubarate expressed similar greetings to those of the island that his ubarate appreciated our interest in its future and that his wazir of trade would speak to me within the next ten days i then as i had seen others do smiled and bowed and walking backward withdrew from his presence the next envoy was from bazi he presented to bila huruma four chests of gold and ten black slave girls nude in golden chains this did not much please me i thought that msaliti might have done better on behalf of teletus the envoy from bazi i noted would receive an audience with the wazir of trade within five days shortly after the business with the envoy of bazi the court of bila huruma was adjourned i think that one of the slave girls had struck his fancy i hoped that she was well trained he was a ubar he would not be easy to please msaliti and i were then alone in the great conicalroofed court i sheathed the sleeve dagger which after the adjournment of the court the askari had returned to me he was beside himself with rage why did you not kill shaba he demanded that was the plan it was not my plan i said it was your plan i have a different plan i will have you immediately returned to the canal he said in rage that will be difficult to do i said you have already established and i am grateful that i am an ambassador or envoy from teletus he cried out with rage surely i said you did not think i would be fool enough to do what you wanted as soon as shaba was slain you would have had the askaris at a word in the heat of the thing slay me you would then have me out of the way who knows about the ring and free access to the ring itself you thought i would betray you he asked certainly i said you would have wouldnt you yes he said i thought so i said you see i said you do have the makings of an honest truthful fellow in you i slipped the sleeve dagger loose it will do you no good to kill me he said i am just testing the sheath i said i replaced the blade it appears we must work together he said i again slipped loose the blade yes i said he watched the steel what is your plan he asked we must act quickly i said we do not know how much time we have bila hurumas wazir of trade will doubtless soon detect that i know little of the merchants or affairs of teletus we must act quickly what do you wish to do he asked it is simple i said shaba has the ring show me his chambers and i will fetch it this very night shaba knows you are in the palace he said he will surely be on his guard then send another i said only we and shaba said he know of the ring precisely i said i will show you his quarters tonight said he good i said how do i know you will treat me fairly he asked how do i know you will not simply vanish the ring you do not know i said oh that is a splendid aspect of your plan said he irritably i find it attractive i admitted if you wish to essay the quest in the chambers of shaba yourself feel free to do so i said if i should fail said he it would mean the end of my position at the court doubtless i granted him also if you should be so unfortunate as to run afoul of shabas fang ring it would mean the end of more than your position it contains kanda as i understand it it appears there are few sensible alternatives to your plan he said i am the one who is supposed to recover the ring you know i said i know he said i know surely you trust me i said as though hurt i trust you as my own brother he said i did not know you had a brother i said he once betrayed me said msaliti i arranged that he appear guilty of a violation of state trust and had him slain for treason against the ubarate it was a mistake to trust such a fellow i said precisely he said until tonight i said bila huruma he said is the one who truly stands in the way of obtaining the ring he is the patron of shaba his protector if bila huruma were gone it would be easy to arrest shaba and secure the ring that may or may not be i said but obviously shaba is the fellow with the ring it is he from whom we must seek that elusive artifact shaba may not be willing to surrender the ring said msaliti it is my hope to be able to persuade him to do so i said will you please replace that dagger in the sheath said msaliti it is making me nervous very well i said i slipped the steel back in the sheath what did you think of our ubar asked msaliti he is surely a big fellow i said but i scarcely noticed him bila huruma indeed had been an extremely large man and long armed he had sat upon a royal stool of black lacquered wood mounted on the crossed tied horns of kailiauk his arms and legs had been bare and they had glistened from oil he had worn armlets and bracelets and anklets of gold he had worn at his loins the pelts of the yellow panther he wore too the teeth of his beast as a necklace behind and about him had swirled a gigantic cloak of yellow and red feathers from the crested lit and the fruit tindel brightly plumaged birds of the rain forest in making such a cloak only two feathers are taken from the breast of each bird it takes sometimes a hundred years to fashion such a cloak naturally it is to be worn only by a ubar his head was surmounted by an elaborate headdress formed largely from the long white curling feathers of the ushindi fisher a longlegged wading bird it was not unlike the common headdress of the askari indeed save for the length of the feathers and the intricate leather and beading in which the feathers were mounted it might have been such a headdress it made clear that he the ubar ella huruma himself was one of them himself an askari his face had been broad and the eyes widely spaced on his cheeks and across the bridge of his nose there had been a swirling stitching of tattoo marks the record of his transition long years ago into manhood surely you must have seen him well said msaliti for you were presented before him i noticed externals i said and i remember the things you told me of his signs of office but my mind was more on shaba and yourself than the ubar i saw him but i did not truly see him your mind was distracted said msaliti yes i said perhaps it is lust as well that you did not look deeply into him said msaliti to truly see a ubar i said to look into his heart can be a fearful thing only one can sit upon the throne said msaliti that is a saying in the north i said i know said msaliti but it is a saying that is also known east of schendi even east of schendi i smiled the throne is a lonely country he who sits upon the throne it is said said msaliti is the most alone of men i nodded perhaps it was just as well not to have looked too deeply into the eyes of bila huruma it is not always desirable to look deeply into the eyes of a ubar until tonight said msaliti withdrawing until tonight i said a basket of osts a chain of gold the eyes of the ubar why is there no guard i asked he has been disposed of said msaliti have no fear he gestured to the portal enter he said surely shaba will have others of his caste with him geographers of the scribes i said enter said msaliti lend me your lamp i said he carried a small lamp with a shallow bowl which burned tharlarion oil askaris might see the flame through the walls of the room he said there are many about hurry i slipped into the room it was totally dark within i stood with my back to the grass wall to the left of the door as i had entered the sleeping platform i was told was near the center of the room shaba i suspected would have the ring about his neck very slowly inch by inch every sense alert i began to move toward the center of the room msaliti had brought me himself to the room he had not been accompanied by askaris i found this strange as few as possible must know of our deed he had said yes i had said but surely he would not trust me to return the ring to him i had expected that he would be accompanied by askaris whom he would set upon me to slay me once i had either killed shaba or obtained the ring but i saw none it had been my hope of course and a risk which msaliti for his part would have had to accept that i might with the ring elude his askaris even if the room were surrounded the odds had i the ring would i think have been in my favor they were odds of course which msaliti had been given no chance but to accept i could always leave the room of course by kicking and tearing through the grass wall at any point of my choosing looking behind me i saw outside the room the lamp of msaliti lift and lower twice i smiled to myself that i took it was his sign to his askaris that i was within the room his sign to them that they were then to surround it but then i was troubled i saw no askaris appearing from the darkness outside suddenly i heard a rush of feet instantly i crouched dagger drawn blade up my left hand too ready in the onguard position for knife combat but the feet had not approached me i was startled i thought i heard climbing then suddenly from in front of me in the darkness i heard a hideous cry of pain then i heard a wild piteous shriek which terminated in spasmodic coughing and gasping i heard fingernails scratching at a wooden surface and the turning and thrashing of a body i turned to leave the room but at the door i was met with the leveled stabbing spears of several askaris i saw no sign of msaliti i lifted my hands dropping the knife men entered with lamps i saw then that i was not in the room of shaba in the center of the room on a high platform some nine feet high supported by eight poles sitting crosslegged naked save for the panther teeth about his neck was not shaba but the ubar bila huruma men seized my arms then pinioning them behind me i felt my wrists being tied the room was now well lit from the several lamps other lamps too at a sign from the ubar were lit i looked to the round shallow circular pit in the center of the room it was about a foot deep the poles supporting the sleeping platform were set within it in the pit his hands still clutching fingernails bloody at one of the round poles supporting the platform lay an askari his body was twisted horribly and contorted the flesh had turned a blackish orange and in places had broken open the skin peeling back like burned paper a knife fallen lay near him in the pit about his body small nervous sinuous crawled tiny snakes osts each of these startlingly had tied to it a thin string there were eight such diminutive reptiles the strings fastened behind their heads led up to a pole at the head of the sleeping platform where they were tied a woven basket hung too near the foot of the sleeping platform the ost is usually an orange snake but these were ushindi osts which are red with black stripes anatomically and with respect to toxin i am told they are almost identical to the common ost what is going on my ubar cried msaliti entering he was in disarray as though he might have been aroused by the screaming he did not have the lamp with him in his hurry of course he would not have had time to light a lamp i admired him he was a shrewd fellow suddenly msaliti stopped startled he seemed astonished but only for an instant my ubar he cried are you all right yes said bila huruma upon entering msaliti had called out to the ubar but when he actually saw him he had reacted briefly stunned i realized he had called out to make it clear to all that he had expected the ubar to be alive when he entered but when he saw that the ubar truly was alive he had been for the moment startled he had recovered himself almost instantaneously but surely he would not have expected me to have killed the ubar i sought the ring if i had not found it on shabas person surely would not have killed him perhaps losing it forever msaliti looked into the shallow pit below the high poles of the sleeping platform of bila huruma he looked sick what happened he asked he looked closely at the contorted figure its discolored hands still clutching at the pole of the sleeping platform it is jambia he said your guard he tried to kill me said bila huruma he was doubtless highly paid he did not know of the osts that man is doubtless his accomplice i then understood the brilliance of msaliti but msaliti had underestimated the genius of his ubar i had been told that the guard had been disposed of actually he had been within in the hire of msaliti awaiting his signal with the lamp i recalled then that msaliti in the morning had told me that bila huruma was he who stood in the way of obtaining the ring and that if he were gone it would be easy to arrest shaba and secure the ring his plan then had been simple bila huruma was to be slain by jambia who would then escape presumably by cutting through the grass wall it would be i who would be found in the ubars chamber perhaps jambia himself was to make the discovery the rent in the grass wall would be taken of course the grass pressed inward to have been my entrance into the ubars chamber rather than the exit of jambia if the plan had been successful bila huruma would have been dead and shaba without his protector would be much at the mercy of msaliti who as high wazir would immediately assume at least temporarily the reins of government my false identity that which msaliti had constructed for me as an envoy of teletus would not then in the circumstances any longer protect me any diplomatic immunity so to speak which i might have possessed would in the circumstances have been stripped away from me i might then be dealt with as msallti pleased his plan if successful then would permit him not only to secure the ring but rid himself of me as well one who shared with him the secret knowledge of the ring and one who might desire to be himself the agent by which the ring was to be transmitted to belisarius in cos for subsequent return to the kurii i had been troublesome to msaliti i might prove troublesome to him in the future he had thus found a useful place for me in his plans too of course if it were thought i were the assassin investigative scrutiny would then be directed away from the court rather than within it but msalitis plan had not succeeded kill him said msaliti pointing to me two askaris drew back the short stabbing spears to drive them into my chest no said bila huruma they lowered the stabbing spears do you speak the ushindi speech asked bila huruma of me only a little i said ayari with whom i had shared the rogues chain in the canal had been generous in his help we both knew gorean and so i had made rapid progress with the lexicon the grammar of course was much more difficult i spoke the inland speech very poorly but as would be expected thanks to ayari i could follow a reasonable amount of what was going on who hired you asked bila huruma no one hired me i said i did not know this was your chamber one by one slowly almost tenderly on their strings bila huruma lifted the tiny osts from the floor of the pit and placed them one by one in the basket near the foot of the sleeping platform are you of that caste called assassins he asked no i said he held the last of the osts on its string suspended about five feet from the floor of the pit bring him near he said i was dragged to the edge of the pit bila huruma extended his arm i saw the small ost red with its black stripes on its string near my face its tiny forked tongue slipped rapidly back and forth between the tiny jaws do you like my pet he asked no i said i do not the snake twisted on the string who hired you he asked no one hired me i said i did not know this was your chamber you do not know probably who it was who truly hired you he said doubtless they would not do so openly he is white said a man nearby only those in schendi might hire such a killer they are familiar with the sleen of the north perhaps said bila huruma i now saw the snake lifted until it was level with my eyes is jambia who was my guard known to you asked bila huruma no i said why did you wish to kill me asked bila huruma i had no wish to kill you i said why were you here he asked i came to find something of value i said ah said bila huruma then he spoke rapidly to an askari i could not follow what he said then bila huruma took the tiny snake and then carefully placed it in the hanging basket he then placed the lid on the basket i breathed more easily suddenly a necklace of gold heavy with solid links was looped about my neck it had been taken from a coffer to one side you were a guest in my house he said if you wished something of value you should have asked for it i would then have given it to you my thanks ubar i said then if i thought you should not have asked for it he said i would have had you killed i see i said but i give you this freely he said it is yours if you are an assassin take it in lieu of the pay which you would not otherwise receive if you are as i suspect a simple thief take it as a token of my admiration of your boldness for it must have taken courage to enter the chamber of a ubar i did not even know this was your chamber i said keep it then as a memento of our meeting he said my thanks ubar i said wear it in the canal he said take him away two askaris turned me about and thrust me toward the door at the door i stopped startling the askaris i turned about dragging them with me to again face bila huruma our eyes met i then truly for the first time looked into the eyes of bila huruma he sat upon the high platform above the others solitary and isolated the necklace of panther teeth about his neck the lamps below him i sensed then for a moment what it must be to be a ubar it was then in that instant that i first truly saw him as he was and as he must be i looked the on loneliness and decision and power the ubar must contain within himself dark strengths he must be capable of doing as many men are not what is necessary only one can sit upon the throne as it is said and as it is said he who sits upon the throne is the most alone of men it is he who must be a stranger to all men and to whom all men must be strangers the throne indeed is a lonely country many men desire to live there but few i think could bear its burdens let us continue to think of our ubars as men much like ourselves only perhaps a bit wiser or stronger or more fortunate that way we may continue to be comfortable with them and to some extent feel ourselves their superior but let us not look into their eyes too closely for we might see there that which sets them apart from us it is not always desirable to look deeply into the eyes of a ubar the askaris again turned me about i saw briefly the face of msaliti then i was conducted from the chamber of bila huruma his gift a necklace of gold about my neck i remembered him behind me sitting on the high platform a sleeping platform from which hung a basket of osts i do not kill kisu that is pretty said the askari yes i said he reached for it and i thrust back his hands i want it he said it was a gift from bila huruma i said he backed away from me i thought he would trouble me no more it is pretty said ayari at least it wilt not rust in the rain i smiled i looked at the heavy linkage of the gold chain slung over the iron collar and work chain i wore now there is something really pretty said ayari we stood near the mud raft that raft of logs and liana vines on which we placed our shovelfuls of mud in this place in this great irregular marsh the water was only to our knees in some places there were risings above the marsh and hills of relatively dry land in some places in pockets the water was so high as our chests in others shallow places as low as our ankles i looked in the direction which ayari with his head had indicated i gripped the shovel startled i heard yesterday from an askari he said that they would pass here today they are gifts from bila huruma to tende daughter of the high chieftain aibu of the ukungu villages serving slaves it is his intention to take tende into companionship the companionship said one of the men will consolidate the relation of the ukungu villages with the ubarate i would not mind receiving such lovely gifts said another man too bad tende is a woman said another the two girls were on a raft being drawn through the marsh by five chained slaves four askaris waded beside the raft the girls were standing a pole mounted on two tripods had been fastened some six feet above the surface of the raft and parallel to its long axis the girls stood beneath this pole their small wrists locked in slave bracelets fastened above their head and about the pole both were barefoot about their left ankles and throats were wound several strings of white shells each about her hips wore a brief wraparound skirt held in place by tucking at the left hip of redandblackprinted repcloth ho i cried striding toward the raft as far as the chain on my neck would permit me master cried the blondhaired barbarian both girls were blond blueeyed white barebreasted slaves they were a matched set selected to set off the dark beauty of tende daughter of aibu high chieftain of the ukungu villages sasi and i were taken almost immediately cried the blondhaired barbarian we were put up for sale where is sasi i called silence said one of the askaris near me lifting his stabbing spear in my direction she was sold to a tavern keeper in schendi called the girl one called filimbi one of the askaris wading beside the raft climbed angrily to its surface the girl then stood very straight frightened looking straight ahead but he holding his shield and stabbing spear with his left hand struck her twice snapping her head back and forth with his right hand blood was at her mouth she had spoken without permission the askari near to me one supervising the chain thrust me back with his shield and i fell in the water and he hit me four times with the handle of the stabbing spear i then regained my feet angrily he threatened me with the blade of the spear i twisted my head angrily in my collar other askaris too stood about i stood still in the water on the surface of the raft the askari who had administered slave discipline to the blondhaired barbarian for her outburst thrust a slave whip crosswise in her mouth thrusting it back between her teeth this would keep her quiet if she dropped it of course she would be beaten with it i saw the raft slowly being pulled beyond our chain the blondhaired barbarian did not now dare look back she looked straight ahead the whip between her teeth the other girl also blondhaired and blueeyed did look back once i think she was puzzled to see one on the rogues chain who wore a necklace of gold i supposed she too was a barbarian for they were a matched set possibly also from earth though doubtless brought to the shores of gor like most as a simple girl for the markets dig said the askari who had struck me i would have thought that sasi might have been able to elude capture longer than she had but i had been mistaken apparently both girls had been taken again almost immediately as slaves soon thereafter apparently they had been put up for sale they had been good merchandise it seemed certainly both had been promptly vended sasi to filimbi whom i had heard of the owner of a paga tavern and the blondhaired barbarian directly or indirectly to an agent of bila huruma quite possibly with the immediate object in mind of being used as a component in a matched set of girls white serving slaves gifts for tende another projected political companion for the inland ubar dig said the askari menacingly naturally there had been on the raft besides the girls a chest of riches for tende riches which according to the askaris with whom ayari took pains to be on good terms would include such things as bolts of cloth jewelries cosmetics coins and perfumes this made good sense of course and made clear the generosity of the ubar bila huruma his gifts to her would surely have been demeaning had they been limited to the presentation of two halfnaked white slaves the handle of the short stabbing spear struck down viciously across my shoulder dig said the askari very well i said and thrust the shovel again into the mud at my feet you too cried the askari to a man further down the line dig dig the fellow on the chain tall regal regarded him contemptuously then he turned again to look after the raft bearing the gifts for tende the askari struck him about the shoulders and chest repeatedly then without deigning to look upon the askari he began again to dig that man was kisu who had been the leader of the ukungu rebels after a time when the askaris had withdrawn a few yards i said to ayari convey my greetings to kisu i had seen him look after the raft and had read the cold rage the fury like iron in his body we waded dragging the chain on our necks toward kisu the men behind us at our sign moved with us ayari spoke to kisu and he lifted his head regarding me disdainfully i have conveyed your greetings to kisu said ayari speaking to me in gorean he did not respond i said of course not said ayari he is mfalme of ukungu he does not speak to commoners tell him he is no longer the mfalme of ukungu i said tell him he was deposed if there is any longer a mfalme of ukungu it is aibu the wise and noble actually aibu would become a district administrator as high chieftain of ukungu under the sovereignty of bila huruma have your shovel ready said ayari to me in gorean i will i said but kisu did not upon receipt of my message attack he stiffened and regarded me with fury but he did not move to strike me with the shovel for a proud man and one both highstrung and powerful he restrained himself creditably tell him i wish to talk with him i said if necessary he may as mfalme of ukungu elevate me to the nobility ayari conveyed this cheerfully to kisu again kisu restrained himself then he turned away he began to dig tell him said i that bila huruma his own ubar speaks to commoners tell him that a true mfalme listens to and speaks with all men kisu straightened up and turned to face me his knuckles were white on the shovel i have told him what you said said ayari the speech of kisu was closely related to the inland speech and ayari had no difficulty in communicating with him it was harder for me of course for i was not that familiar with the inland speech the inland and ukungu speech i suppose would have been regarded linguistically as two dialects of the same mother tongue the distinction between a dialect and a language is at times a conceptual one in a series of villages each village may be able to understand those proximate to it but perhaps those in the first village cannot understand at all the speech of the tenth village thus one would think that the first village and the tenth speak different languages yet where shall the lines be drawn between them tell him i said that he would do well to take lessons in leadership from a truly great leader bila huruma this was conveyed to kisu with a cry of rage kisu leaped toward me the shovel swinging toward my head i blocked the blow and bringing about the long handle of my own shovel struck him a heavy blow alongside of the face it would have staggered a kailiauk to my amazement he did not go down i then smartly began to deflect and parry blows one slash or blow of the shovel would have finished me i thrust him back twice with the handle of the shovel the second time plunging the handle into his solar plexus he stopped paralyzed by the latter blow but he did not fall he could not then defend himself i was breathing heavily i did not of course strike him that precise point of the body is one of the target areas taught to warriors such a blow is usually given with a thrust of the butt of a spear generally in the crowding of close combat when you cannot bring the weapon about kisu was i had little doubt quite similar in strength to myself he was not however a trained warrior it was little wonder that he and his forces had been defeated by the askaris of bila huruma he lifted his head looking at me in amazement he did not understand how such a blow could have stopped one of his strength then he threw up in the marsh the askaris waded to us shouting angrily they struck both of us with the handles of their stabbing spears we were separated and each thrust back to our own places the chain line being then again strung out after a time kisu turned about and called to ayari ayari then spoke to me he wants to know why you did not kill him he asked i did not want to kill him i said i only wanted to talk with him this was conveyed to kisu he then again said something he is mfalme of ukungu said ayari to me he cannot speak to commoners very well i said this assent was conveyed then to kisu dig called the nearest askari we returned then to our digging what i saw one night in the marsh while i was chained in the rogues cage awaken said ayari nudging me i rolled over in the chain on the raft something is coming he said raiders i asked i do not think so he said i struggled to a crouching position the iron ring with its chain heavy on my neck the raft on which the rogues chain was kept was a long one covered by a barred cage locked i peered into the darkness i do not see anything i said i saw the brief glint of a dark lantern momentarily unshuttered said ayari whoever it is then moves in stealth i said raiders of course would not possess such lanterns listen said ayari suddenly the snout of a tharlarion half lying on the edge of the raft thrust against the bars i drew back it grunted it kept its snout for a time on the edge of the raft then with a soft splash it slipped back in the dark shallow water listen said ayari i hear it now i said oars muffled several of them how many vessels asked ayari two at least i said and moving in tandem order i could hear slightly out of time the softer entry into the water of a second set of oars they could not be askaris said ayari no i said askaris used not oars but paddles and used canoes moreover when moving at night each canoes paddles kept the exact rhythm of that of the lead canoe this makes it difficult to count their number it is common of course to use a tandem order in night rowing the first vessels untroubled passage marking the safe channel its impeded passage marking the location of an obstacle how do you judge the draw asked ayari the craft are light i said and being rowed in this water must be shallowdrafted the number of oars suggests length said ayari they must be light galleys no i said i know the draw of a light galley these vessels are too light for even such a galley furthermore any light galley with which i am familiar though comparatively shallowdrafted would be too deeply keeled to traverse this marsh what manner of vessels can they be asked ayari and where would they come from they can be but one thing i said and yet that they should be here now at night is madness we then heard a thrash in the water as a tharlarion perhaps the same one which had thrust its snout against the bars of our cage struck against wood in the darkness some twenty yards from us we heard a cry of anger and for an instant a dark lantern was unshuttered we saw two men in the prow of a low mediumbeamed bargelike vessel one pushed down with a spear forcing the broad head of the tharlarion away from the vessel i clutched the bars of the cage in which on the raft i was confined then the dark lantern was again shuttered the vessels slipped past us there were three of them the shafts of the oars where they rested in the open fixedposition ushaped oarlocks had been wrapped in fur that they might make no sound as they moved against these fulcrums the oars themselves had barely lifted from the water and had then entered and drawn again almost splashlessly the oarlocks too had been lined with fur what is wrong asked ayari nothing i said in the light of the dark lantern when it had been briefly unshuttered i had seen the faces of three or four men the faces of those in the prow and two others who had stood near to them one of the faces i knew it had been that of shaba the geographer i clenched the bars i was helpless for a moment i shook them with futile rage then i was quiet what is wrong asked ayari nothing i told him i continue to dig in the canal i hurled mud from my shovel to the mud raft i had heard no drums coming from the west nothing to suggest that there was a pursuit of shaba yet i was certain that it had been he who had passed us in stealth in the night there had been three vessels of the sort which had been prepared in ianda and brought to schendi and then to lake ushindi by way of the nyoka part of the fleet which bila huruma was organizing to support the explorations of shaba navigating the ua into the far interior but there had been only three of the vessels out of some one hundred and shaba had moved in secrecy there had been as far as i could tell no convoy of askari canoes with him nor askaris as far as i saw in the vessel i had seen the men with him i suspected or most of them were members of his own caste geographers of the scribes perhaps but men inured to hardships perhaps men who had been with him in his explorations of ushindi and ngao men he trusted and upon whom he could count in desperate situations caste brothers i brushed insects away from my face it seemed clear to me that shaba must be in flight and i had little doubt that he must have the ring with him to obtain which had been the object of my journey to schendi he had now passed us moving silently secretly to the east i thrust the shovel again down hard into the mud at my feet i dug and shaba my quarry moved further away from me with each thrust of the shovel each bite and sting of each tiny insect i hurled another shovelful of mud onto the mud raft there is no escape said ayari do not think foolish thoughts how do you know i think of escape i asked see how white are your knuckles on the shovel he said if the marsh were an enemy you would have cut it to pieces by now he looked up at me beware my friend he said the askaris too have noted you i looked about one of the askaris it was true was looking in my direction they might have killed you by now said ayari but you are strong you are a good worker i could kill him i said he carries no key said ayari the metal on your neck is hammered shut dig now or we will be beaten with the handles of spears tell kisu i said that i would speak with him that i would escape do not be foolish said ayari tell him i said once again as before yesterday my words were tendered to kisu he looked about he responded he does not speak to commoners said ayari to me i slashed down at the marsh with my shovel gouged out a weight of mud and flung it to the mud raft had it been kisu he would have been destroyed escape kisu pays a call on tende is she not beautiful whispered ayari yes i said be quiet said an askari stand straight said another askari hold your heads up keep the line straight which is the one called kisu asked an askari wading up to us i do not know i said that is he said ayari indicating tall kisu a few places from us slowly the state platform was drawn toward us it fastened planks extending across the thwarts of four long canoes like pontoons moved slowly toward us drawn by chained slaves on the platform shaded by a silk canopy was a low dais covered with silken cushions why did you tell him which one of us was kisu i asked she would know him would she not he asked that is true i said on the cushions reclining on one elbow in yellow robes embroidered with gold in many necklaces and jewels lay a lovely imperiousseeming girl it is tende whispered one of the men the daughter of aibu high chief of the ukungu district we had known this for the message of the drums coming from the east had preceded her on either side of tende knelt a lovely white slave girl strings of white shells about her throat and left ankle a brief tucked wraparound skirt of redandblackprinted repcloth her only garment low on her belly high and tight on her thighs both slaves were sweetly bodied each had marvelously flared hips i found it hard to take my eyes from them they were among the gifts which bila huruma had sent ahead to his projected companion tende i smiled and licked my lips though they had been bought to be the serving slaves of a woman i had little doubt that their purchase had been effected by a male agent in the hands of each of the slaves was a longhandled fan terminating in a semicircle of colorful feathers gently cooling her they fanned their mistress i looked at the blondhaired barbarian she who had been janice prentiss who knelt now to my right at tendes left she did not meet my eyes her lower lip trembled she did not dare to give any sign that she recognized me about tendes right wrist i noted fastened to it by a loop was a whip stand straighter said an askari we stood straighter on the raft near tende and her two lovely barebreasted white slaves stood four askaris men of bila huruma in their skins and feathers with golden armlets like most askaris they carried long tufted shields and short stabbing spears the daughter of aibu i gathered was well guarded other askaris too waded in the water near the platform one other man too other than the askaris stood upon the platform it was mwoga wazir to aibu who was now conducting tende to her companionship i recognized him having seen him earlier in the palace of bila huruma he like many in the interior and on the surrounding plains and savannahs north and south of the equatorial zone was longboned and tall a physical configuration which tends to dissipate body heat his face like that of many in the interior was tattooed his tattooing and that of kisu were quite similar one can recognize tribes of course and often villages and districts by those tattoo patterns he wore a long black robe embroidered with golden thread and a flat soft cap not unlike a common garb of schendi hundreds of pasangs distant i had little doubt but what these garments had been gifts to him from the court of bila huruma bila huruma himself of course in spite of the cosmopolitan nature of his court usually wore the skins and the gold and feathers of the askari it was not merely that they constituted his power base and that he wished to flatter them it was rather that he himself was an askari and regarded himself as an askari in virtue of his strength skill and intelligence he was rightfully first among them he was an askari among askaris behold lady said mwoga indicating kisu the enemy of your father and your enemy helpless and chained before you look upon him and inspect him he opposed your father now on a rogues chain he digs in the mud for your future companion the great bila huruma the ukungu dialect is closely related to the ushindi dialect ayari softly translated the conversation for me yet had he not done so i could have by now followed its drift kisu looked boldly into the eyes of the reclining tende you are the daughter of the traitor aibu he said tende did not change her expression how bravely the rebel speaks mocked mwoga i see mwoga said kisu that now you are wazir that you have risen high from your position of a minor chiefs lackey such i gather are the happy fortunes of politics happier for some than others said mwoga you kisu were too dull to understand politics you are headstrong and foolish you could understand only the spear and the drums of war you charge like the kailiauk i wiser bided my time like the ost the kailiauk is contained by the stockade the ost slips between its palings you betrayed ukungu to the empire said kisu ukungu is a district within the empire said mwoga your insurrection was unlawful you twist words said kisu the spear as in all such matters smiled mwoga has decided wherein lies the right what will the stories say of this demanded kisu it is we who will survive to tell the stories said mwoga kisu stepped toward him but the askari at his side forced him back no people can be betrayed said mwoga who are not willing to be betrayed i do not understand said kisu the empire means security and civilization said mwoga the people tire of tribal warfare men wish to look forward in contentment to their harvests how can men call themselves free when each night they must fear the coming of dusk i do not understand said kisu that is because you yourself are a hunter and a killer said mwoga you know the spear the raid the retaliation the seeking of vengeance the shadows of the forest steel is your tool darkness your ally but this is not the case with most men most men desire peace all men desire peace said kisu if this were true there would be no war said mwoga kisu regarded him angrily bila huruma is a tyrant he said of course said mwoga he must be resisted said kisu then resist him said mwoga he must be stopped said kisu then stop him said mwoga you style yourself a hero who would lead my people into the light of civilization asked kisu no said mwoga i am an opportunist i serve myself and my superiors now you speak honestly said kisu politics and needs and times calls forth men such as myself said mwoga without men such as myself there could be no change the tharlarion and the ost have their place in the palace of nature said kisu and i will have mine at the courts of ubars said mwoga meet me with spears said kisu how little you understand said mwoga how naively you see things how your heart craves simplicities i would have your blood on my spear said kisu and the empire would endure said mwoga the empire is evil said kisu how simple marveled mwoga how dazed and confused you must be when upon occasion you encounter reality the empire must be destroyed said kisu then destroy it said mwoga go serve your master bila huruma said kisu i dismiss you we are grateful for your indulgence smiled mwoga and take these slave girls with you gifts for his highness bila huruma said kisu gesturing to tende and her two servitors lady tende daughter of aibu high chief of ukungu said mwoga is being conveyed in honor to the ceremony of companionship to be mated to his majesty bila huruma she is being sold to seal a bargain said kisu how could she be more a slave tendes face remained expressionless of her own free will said mwoga the lady tende hastens to become ubara to bila huruma one of more than two hundred ubaras scoffed kisu she acts of her own free will averred mwoga excellent said kisu she sells herself he said well done slave girl he commended she is to be honored in companionship said mwoga i have seen bila huruma said kisu no woman could be other than a slave to him and i have seen luscious slaves black and white and oriental in his palace girls who know truly how to please a man and desire to do so bila huruma has his pick of hotblooded trained enslaved beauties if you do not wish to remain barren and lonely in your court you will learn to compete with them you will learn to crawl to his feet and beg to serve him with the unqualified and delicious abandon of a trained slave still tendes face did not change expression and you will do so tende said kisu for you are in your heart as i can see in your eyes a true slave tende lifted her hand her right hand with the whip on its loop fastened to her wrist she moved her hand indolently her two slaves tense frightened desisted from fanning her tende rose gracefully to her feet and descended from the cushions and dais to stand at the edge of the platform over kisu have you nothing to say my dear tende beautiful daughter of the traitor aibu inquired kisu she struck him once with the whip across the face he had shut his eyes that he not be blinded i do not speak to commoners she said she then returned to her position her face again expressionless and looking straight ahead she lifted her hand indolently and again her two slaves began gently to fan her kisu opened his eyes a diagonal streak of blood across his face his fists were clenched continue on said mwoga to one of the askaris on the platform the fellow called out sharply to the chained slaves drawing the platform pointing ahead with his spear they then began to wade forward drawing the canoes with the platform of state affixed athwart them we watched the platform with its passengers and canopy moving west i looked at kisu i did not think now i would have long to wait dig said a nearby askari with a feeling of satisfaction and pleasure i then thrust the shovel deep into the mud at my feet we sat in the long cage bolted on the extended raft i ran my finger under the collar to move it a bit from my neck i could smell the marshes about with a movement of chain he crawled toward me in the darkness with my fingernail i scratched a bit of rust from the chain on my collar far off across the marsh we could hear the noises of jungle birds the howling of tiny longlimbed primates it was about an ahn after the late evening rain somewhere about the twentieth ahn the sky was still overcast providing a suitable darkness for the work which must soon be at hand i must speak with you he said in halting gorean i did not know you could speak gorean i said looking ahead in the darkness when a child he said i once ran away i lived for two years in schendi then returned to ukungu i did not think a mere village would content you i said it was a long and dangerous journey for a child i returned to ukungu he said perhaps that is why you are such a patriot of ukungu i said because once you fled from it i must speak with you he said perhaps i do not speak with members of the nobility i said forgive me he said i was a fool you have learned then i said from bila huruma who will speak to all men how else can one listen he asked how else can one understand others beggers speak to beggers and to ubars i said it is a saying of schendi he said yes i said do you speak ushindi he asked a little i said can you understand me he asked speaking in the dialect of the court of bila huruma yes i said gorean was not easy for him ushindi i was sure was no easier for me ayari to my right knew ushindi well enough to transpose easily into the related ngao dialect spoken in the ukungu district but i did not if i cannot understand you i will tell you i said i had little doubt but what between his gorean and my understanding of the ushindi dialect spoken at the court of bila huruma we could communicate i will try to speak gorean he said that at least is not the language of bila huruma there are other things in its favor as well i said it is a complex efficient language with a large vocabulary ukungu he said is the most beautiful language in all the world that may well be i said but i cannot speak it i personally would have thought that english or gorean would have been the most beautiful language in all the world i had met individuals however who thought the same of french and german and spanish and chinese and japanese the only common denominator in these discussions seemed to be that each of the informants was a native speaker of the language in question how chauvinistic we are with respect to our languages this chauvinism can sometimes be so serious as to blind certain individuals to the natural superiority of english or perhaps gorean or perhaps french or german or spanish or chinese or japanese or say bassa or hindi i will try to speak gorean he said very well i said generously i breathed more easily i want to escape he said i must escape very well i said let us do so but how he asked the means i said have long lain at our disposal it is only that i have lacked the cooperation necessary to capitalize on them i turned to ayari pass the word down the chain i said in both directions in various languages that we shall escape tonight how do you propose to do this asked ayari discharge your duties my friendly interpreter i said you will see shortly what if some fear to escape asked ayari they will then be torn alive out of the chain i told him i am not sure i am in favor of this said ayari do you wish to be the first i asked him not me said ayari i am busy i have things to do i am passing the word down the chain how can we escaper asked kisu i reached out and measured the chain at his collar and slipped my hands down the chain until about five feet later it lifted to the collar of the next man i pushed them closely together to drop the chain in a loop to the log floor of the extended raft by feeling i dropped the loop between the ends of two logs and drew it back about two feet in from the end of the log it was now looped beneath the bottom of the loop was then under water and about one log i put one end of the chain in the hands of the powerful kisu and took the other end in my own hands i see said kisu but this is an inefficient tool you could ask the askaris for a better i suggested we then began smoothly and firmly exerting heavy even pressures to draw the chain back and forth under the log in moments using this crude saw or cuffing tool we had cut through the bark of the log and had begun rhythmically to gash and splinter the harder wood beneath the spacing and twisting of the links in the motion of the metal served well in lieu of teeth there was an occasional squeak of the metal on the wet wood but the work for the most part was accomplished silently the sound being concealed under the surface of the water it was a mistake on the part of the askaris to have left us in neck chains in a cage mounted on a log platform we ceased work once when a canoe of askaris on watch paddled by my hands began to bleed on the chain doubtless kisus hands too were bloodied one man crept close to us this is madness he said i am not with you you must then be killed i told him i have changed my mind he said i am now with you fully good i said the sound will carry under the water said another man sound does carry better under water than above it indeed some five times as well the sound of course does not well break the surface of the water thus the sound though propagated efficiently either beneath or above the surface is not well propagated because of the barrier of the surface either from beneath the surface to above the surface or from above the surface to beneath the surface it will attract tharlarion or fish and then tharlarion he said we will wait for them to investigate and disperse i said ayari was near to me it is dark he said it is a good night for raiders a bit of wood moved by the chain splintered up by my feet i slid the loop of chain down toward the end of the log near the end of the other log to which it was adjacent the chain thus positioned might exert more leverage pull i said kisu and i drawing heavily on the chain splintered the log upward breaking off some inches of it with my foot and hands i snapped off some sharp splinters we will now wait for a time i said we heard a tharlarion a large one rub up against the bottom of the raft i looped the chain in my bloody hands to strike at it if it should try to thrust its snout through the hole cover the log seem asleep whispered a man we sat about the piece of log our heads down some of us lying on the floor of the log raft i saw the light a small torch in the bow of another canoe pass us one containing ten armed askaris they did not pay us much attention they fear raiders said ayari after a time when it seemed quiet i said bring the first man on the chain forward he not happy was thrust toward me i will go first i said but i cannot as i am toward the center of the chain what about the fellow at the end of the chain he inquired an excellent idea i said but he like you might be reluctant and it is you not he whose neck is now within my reach what if there are tharlarion he asked are you afraid i asked yes he said you should be i said there might be tharlarion i am not going he said take a deep breath i told him and keep moving for others must follow make for the mud raft there are shovels there i am not going he said i seized him and thrust him head first downward through the hole the next man slid feet first through the hole the next heavy squeezed with difficulty through the aperture between the logs another man slipped through the first mans head broke the surface sputtering he started toward the mud aft one after another i and kisu and ayari toward the center of the chain the same fortysix prisoners of the cage slipped free take shovels and bring the raft i said which way shall we go asked ayari follow me i said you are going west said ayari we must free ourselves i said in the chain we cannot long escape if we go west we may deceive inquiring askaris and west only a pasang away lies the smiths island where men are added to the chain there will be tools there said ayari precisely i said let us go east or toward the jungles north or south said a man kisu struck him on the side of the head knocking him sideways i looked at kisu does it not seem wise to you mfalme i asked him to proceed westward he straightened himself yes he said we will go westward his agreement pleased me without his cooperation and the significance of his prestige and status it would be difficult if not impossible to enforce my will on the chain without his aid and influence i do not think it would have been possible to have escaped the cage i had seen from his striking the fellow in the chain that he had been in agreement with me as to the advisability of proceeding westward i had then using the title of mfalme asked him to make this concurrence explicit his declaration had helped to reassure the men in asking him i had also of course indicated my respect for his opinion which incidentally i did respect and in using the title of mfalme i had acknowledged that i for one would continue to recognize his lofty status in ukungu had i not anticipated his agreement i do not know what i would have done i suppose then one or the other of us would have had to beat or kill the other soon leading the chain from the center its ends behind and on either side of us i and kisu and some others between us were wading westward shovels in hand some men behind on either side thrust the mud raft along with us you are a clever fellow said kisu to me surely you do agree that our best direction at the moment is west i asked yes he said they will not expect us to head west and there are tools there there is something else there too he said which i want what is that i asked you will see he said askaris said ayari ahead we have been released by other askaris and sent westward for safety i told him we were even given our tools there were raiders who is there stop called an askari we stopped obediently nervously i saw that there were several askaris about more than i had originally realized some twenty of them with their shields and stabbing spears the white feathers of the headdresses marked their positions in raids askaris sometimes remove these headdresses when actually engaged in combat in darkness of course it helps them keep their formations and tell friend from foe although doubtless there are advantages and disadvantages to the headdress it is tactically in my opinion a liability like the shako of the hussar it makes too good a target raiders called out ayari pointing backward we were released by askaris and commanded to march west for protection raiders cried one of the askaris it is a good night for them said another you will protect us will you not begged ayari where are the askaris who released you demanded one askari fighting said ayari sound the drums said the man an askari rushed away prepare to relieve the beleaguered section said the man column of twos called another the askaris formed themselves into a double column who will stay to protect us inquired ayari march to the rear said the officer you will be safe there there is a relief said ayari hurry said the officer we immediately began to wade westward again the askaris hurriedly began to wade east soon we could hear a drum its sound would marshal new askaris hurry said ayari twice in our march west we were passed by columns of askaris and then by two canoes filled with such troops they will soon discover it is a false alarm said kisu hurry i said in a few moments we clambered onto the smiths island askaris moved past us what is going on asked one of the smiths holding a torch standing outside his sleeping shelter he and his fellows in the shelter were then ringed with desperate men remove our chains i told him never said one we can do it ourselves said ayari shovels were lifted the smiths threatened hurried escorted by chained men to their anvils the collars swiftly were opened and the heavy bands struck with sharp expert blows were bent wide we thrust the smiths back into their sleeping shed and threw them to their bellies we tied them hand and foot gagging them with choking wads of marsh grass forced into their mouths and fastened in place with wide strips of leather i tied shut the door of the wooden shelter to keep it from being pushed inward by tharlarion which might crawl to the surface of the small island disperse i said to the men it is now each man for himself they disappeared into the darkness making their way in various directions kisu i and ayari remained on the island where are you going asked kisu i must go east i said i follow one called shaba i seek the ua river that will suit my purposes well he said grimly i do not understand i said you will in time he said do you menace me i asked he put his hands on my shoulders by the crops of ukungu no he said then i do not understand you i said you will he said i must be on my way i said time is short you are not facing east he said i have a stop to make first i said i too have some business to attend to he said that is in accord with some plan of yours i asked exactly he said it is my intention to recover a lost slave i said i recalled the lovely blondhaired barbarian janice prentiss i wanted her at my own feet that is why you brought along the mud raft smiled kisu of course i said i think i too will take a slave he said i thought you might i said i do not understand why the askaris have not yet returned said ayari by now they must understand it to be a false alarm i would think so i said let us hurry said kisu we set off through the darkness westward pushing the mud raft with us our shovels placed upon it why are you not with the other askaris fighting in the east asked ayari i am guarding the lady tende he said who are you what is that where is the rogues chain asked ayari i do not know he said who are you what is that raft i am ayari said ayari this is the mud raft used by the rogues chain the rogues chain is to the east said the man we passed it earlier today what is going on here asked mwoga returning from the eastern edge of the platform of planks fixed over the four canoes it is a worker looking for the rogues chain said the askari mwoga peered into the darkness he could not see ayari well obviously the man was a worker for he was not chained probably the mud raft had broken loose and the worker was intent upon returning it if unwisely in the darkness one askari called ayari is not enough to guard so great a personage as the lady tende have no fear fellow said mwoga there is another about that is all i wanted to know said ayari kisu and i bad located one guard apiece the others had apparently joined in the investigation to the east i do not understand said mwoga with the flats of our shovels kisu and i struck the two guards senseless mwoga had informed us that there were only two to concern ourselves with and that we might proceed with dispatch he had been quite helpful mwoga looked from his left to his right without speaking further or attempting to draw his dagger he leaped from the planks into the water falling scrambling up and plunging away into the darkness the chained slaves who drew the platform and were sitting and crouching forward on its surface bad cautioned by ayari remained silent the darkness was loud with the drums i cannot sleep said the lady tende emerging from the small silken shelter one of two one for her and her slaves and one for mwoga pitched aft on the platform then she saw kisu we obtain a canoe kisu makes tende a slave it was getting light we thrust the mud raft ahead of us some askaris straggled past some wounded a canoe with bleeding askaris half drifted half paddled passed us a hundred yards away on our right mare than an ahn ago we had passed the point at which the prison raft from which we had escaped had been anchored there were raiders said kisu it was a good night for them said ayari we continued to push the mud raft ahead of us the dawn a rim of luminescent gray lay before us on gor as on earth the sun rises in the east an askari limped past moving painfully through the thighhigh water do not proceed further he said there is action in the east my thanks for your advice my friend called out ayari prepare to turn about he said loudly to us we pushing from the sides turned the heavy raft heaped with piled mud slowly about when the askari was some seventyfive yards away we turned about again and continued eastward he was not i am sure aware that we were not following him if he was he was in no condition to pursue us concealed by a thin layer of mud on the raft were two shields and two stabbing spears which kisu and i had taken from the two askaris we had subdued on the platform of tende our shovels lay in plain sight on the mud heaped on the raft we continued to push the raft toward the east ayari looked up at the sky it must be about the eighth ahn he said how far ahead is ngao i asked kisu days said kisu it is hopeless said ayari let us make for shore they will expect us to do that i said and if we are seen we may fall to hostile natives or if they be allies of bila huruma be taken or our position indicated by the drums listen said kisu suddenly i hear it i said what asked ayari war cries ahead and to the right i said men fighting i climbed to the surface of the raft kisu followed me what do you see asked ayari there is an engagement there i said in canoes and in the water some hundred askaris some forty or fifty raiders there may be numerous such engagements said ayari let us avoid them to be sure i said kisu and i clambered down splashing into the water and again thrust the raft eastward twice more before noon we scouted such engagements it had rained heavily about the ninth ahn but we drenched had not ceased to push the raft toward the western shore of ngao somewhere ahead of us down said ayari we crouched down in the water our heads scarcely above the surface shielded by the raft on the other side of the raft passed two canoes of askaris returning to the marsh camps of the west they had seen from their point of view only a mud raft loosed and drifted from the work area askaris are returning said ayari the raiders have been driven away kisu lifted the headdress of an askari from the water and threw it from him not without cost he said we are safe now said ayari keep a watch for tharlarion said kisu he reached under the water and pulled a fat glistening leach some two inches long from his leg destroy it said ayari kisu dropped it back in the water i do not want my blood pinched from it released in the water he said ayari nodded shuddering such blood might attract the bint a fanged carnivorous marsh eel or the predatory voracious blue grunt a small freshwater variety of the much larger and familiar saltwater grunt of thassa the blue grunt is particularly dangerous during the daylight hours preceding its mating periods when it schools its mating periods are synchronized with the phases of gors major moon the full moon reflecting on the surface of the water somehow triggering the mating instinct during the daylight hours preceding such a moon as the restless grunts school they will tear anything edible to pieces which crosses their path during the hours of mating however interestingly one can move and swim among them untouched the danger currently of the bint and blue grunt however was not primarily due to any peril they themselves might represent particularly as the grunt would not now be schooling but due to the fact that they drawn by shed blood might be followed by tharlarion the spear slender some seven feet in length hit into the mud near my hand raiders cried ayari we heard screaming kisu tore at the mud scratching for one of the shields and stabbing spears a fellow leaped to the surface of the raft i slipped under the water i thrust my way through submerged marsh grass a spear struck down at me then i managed to get beneath the canoe and stood up suddenly screaming tipping its occupants into the water there suddenly over the waters of the marsh roared the war cry of koroba i dropped one man lifeless his throat wrenched open into the water one man thrust at me with his spear and the others startled stood back i tore the spear from him and kicked him from it he slipped and i thrust the iron blade into him and thrust him down pinning him blood and bubbles bursting up to the bottom of the marsh i regarded the other four men standing back who faced me i saw they did not move to attack i pressed the body of the man under the surface from the spear blade with my foot and drew the weapon up the body twisting now head down emerged in the grass i stepped to one side the men facing me were standing still kisu stood on the raft like a black god the shield on his arm a bloodied stabbing spear in his right hand in the water to his left struck from the raft lifeless inert buoyant rolled two bodies i waved my hand begone i cried begone i do not think they understood my words but my meaning was clear the four men backed away and then turned and fled i righted the canoe kisu leaving the raft fetched two sealed calabashes of meal from where they floated in the marsh tied in the canoe itself was a long cylindrical basket of strips of salted dried fish ayari waded out to the canoe do you think they have gone he asked yes i said perhaps there are others he said he was retrieving paddles from the water i think it is late now for raiders i said perhaps they will come again in a few days to again attack the workers at the canal i think there is little to fear from them at the moment bila huruma will burn their villages said kisu he must be careful i said he would not wish to alienate the friendly shore communities either of the marsh or of ngao he will do what he thinks is necessary to achieve his ends said kisu doubtless you are right i said indeed i had no doubt but what bila huruma would design a sober and judicious course gentle if necessary harsh if necessary to bring about those ends which he might seek he a ubar by nature would not be an easy man to deal with or to stop ayari placed the paddles he had found some six of them in the canoe this gave us altogether a total of eight paddles not counting two which were lost floated away for there were two paddles extra paddles tied in the canoe it is quite common of course for a war canoe or raiders canoe to carry extra paddles a sensible precaution against the loss of one or more of these essential levers indeed even a canoe which is not one of war or raiding may carry extra paddles particularly if it is to be propelled through turbulent waters i moved the canoe to the side of the raft from the heaped mud on the raft unobtrusively protruded three hollow stems of broken marsh reed kisu with his hands dug in the mud he reached under the mud and seized the blond hair of a slave girl cords of pierced shells looped about her neck he pulled her free by the hair from the mud the reed through which she had breathed fell from her teeth her eyes were frightened and wide her wrists were tied behind her and her ankles too were crossed and bound kisu submerged her shaking her rinsing mud from her body then he handed her to me master said the blondhaired barbarian be silent slave i said yes master she said i carried her to the canoe i placed her us the canoe on her belly as a slave kisu had then freed the second blondhaired slave from the mud and submerging her she also bound hand and foot rinsed her clean he then handed her to me and i placed her as i had the first she who had once been janice prentiss in the canoe i placed the second girl forward in the canoe so that her feet were at the head of the first girl the blondhaired barbarian this would make communication between them difficult such small touches aid in the control and management of girls beast screamed tende to kisu sputtering and coughing as she was pulled up from the water free me free me i did not think you spoke to commoners he said ayari grinned affording me the translation of their remarks if i had spoken ushindi more fluently i could probably have made out their discourse as ayari did for the ukungu speech is a closely related language my ushindi of course was poor in the next few days i would learn to make transpositions between ushindi and ukungu the vocabularies are extremely similar except for pronunciation the grammars in their basic structures are almost identical i have little doubt that most of the black equatorial stock on gor descendants of individuals brought to this world by priestkings on voyages of acquisition perhaps hundreds of years ago derive from one of the earths major linguistic families perhaps the bantu group gorean itself shows innumerable evidences of being derived largely from languages of the indoeuropean group tende stifled an angry cry kisu threw her in her soiled robes to the surface of the raft he untied her hands from behind her back and turning her roughly almost as though she might have been a slave retied them before her body leaving a long loose end which might serve as a tether she gasped with indignation and lying on her side looked at him with anger he then untied her ankles and threw her from the raft he led her by the bound wrists she stumbling in her robes about the raft and tied the tether on her hands to the sternpost of the canoe the tether was some seven feet in length she stood in the water in the muddied robes the water was to her hips she was slender and about five and a half feet tall let us untie the two slaves said kisu they may aid us in paddling i unbound the two white girls and knelt them frightened in the canoe they were barebreasted about their throats and left ankles were coils of white pierced shells about their thighs now muddied were brief wraparound skirts of redandblackprinted repcloth suitable garments for slaves i thrust a paddle into the hands of each we must make haste said ayari taking a position forward in the canoe the two girls one behind the other knelt behind him i knelt paddle in hand behind the second slave she who had once been janice prentiss she was attractive i was pleased that i had taken her behind me also with a paddle was kisu we had placed weapons in the canoe the shields and stabbing spears from the two askaris and some spears and another shield from the raiders tende screamed and we turned about we saw the body of one of the raiders seized in the jaws of a tharlarion pulled beneath the surface it had been drawn to the area probably by the smell of blood in the water or by following other forms of marine life most likely the bint or blue grunt who would have been attracted by the same stimulus it is not unusual for tharlarion to follow bint and grunt they form a portion of its diet also they lead it sometimes to larger feedings kisu and i the girls following lowered our paddles into the water and moved the canoe eastward tende tethered to the sternpost stumbled after us looking back i saw two more tharlarion nearby i then again lowered the paddle into the marsh some forty yards behind i could now hear the water churning the tharlarion when it takes large prey such as tabuk or tarsk or men commonly drags the victim beneath the surface where it drowns it then tears it to pieces in the bottom mud engorging it limb by limb please kisu begged tende let me enter the canoe but he did not respond to her he did not even look at her i cannot wade in these robes she wept please kisu she stumbled and fell and was for a moment under the surface but the tether on her wrists pulled her again to the surface and moaning she regained her feet and staggered to again follow us i looked back again to the vicinity of the mud raft i saw one body move as though leaping out of the water and then saw that it was caught in the jaws of two rearing tharlarion who fought for it each would keep part of it i saw four more tharlarion low on the surface eyes and nostrils above the surface knifing toward the feast kisu wept tende please kisu but he did not look at her we continued with our paddling it will be only a matter of time kisu i said in gorean until the tharlarion have fed and there is no more there some may then follow a scent in the water that of sweat and fear of course said kisu not looking back i glanced back once at tende she was looking back over her shoulder i then continued with my paddling we did not set a harsh pace the girl must be able to keep up and we must not move so swiftly that the tharlarion might become confused or lose the scent kisu cried the girl take me into the canoe but again he did not speak to her kisu she cried i cannot wade in these robes do you wish me to remove them from you asked kisu were you not once fond of me kisu she called you are the daughter of my hated enemy aibu said kisu coldly why will you not take me into the canoe she asked you are where the tharlarion can take you within my sight he said no she screamed no no ah but yes my dear tende he said please kisu she begged please i hear but the voice of the proud free woman tende daughter of my hated enemy aibu said kisu she began to weep she tried to approach the canoe more closely but kisu as she would approach would with a powerful stroke move the canoe more swiftly forward keeping her at the length of the tether once he let her approach the stern but as she reached out with her bound hands he with the paddle thrust her back she stood there in the water he then again moved the canoe forward again she followed at the length of her tether please kisu she begged but again he did not respond to her we paddled on not speaking for a quarter of an ahn look said ayari after a time looking back are they there now asked kisu yes said ayari four of them tharlarion tende looked back over her shoulder at first i could not discern them then because of the subtle movement of the water i saw them their bodies except for their eyes and nostrils and some ridges on their backs as they swam were submerged they were about eighty yards away they did not hurry but moved with the fluid menace of their kind we stopped the canoe tende lower in the water than we then saw them kisu she screamed take me into the canoe you are where i want you he said where the tharlarion may take you within my sight no she screamed no no please no please i hear the voice of the proud free woman tende said kisu who is the daughter of my hated enemy aibu no she wept no then what voice is it that i hear inquired kisu the voice of a helpless female slave cried tende who begs her master to spare her life you are pretending to be a slave said kisu no she cried no i am a true slave the four tharlarion were now some twenty yards away they sensing the static position of their prey slowed their approach in your heart asked kisu yes yes master she cried a natural and rightful slave he asked yes i am a natural and rightful slave she cried the tharlarion stopped swimming now they drifted toward her this has the effect of minimizing the pressure waves projected before their bodies an effect that might otherwise alert a wary but unsuspecting prey with tiny backward movements of their short legs they then became motionless watching her what is your name asked kisu whatever master pleases she wept the answer was suitable do you beg slavery he asked yes yes master she cried perhaps i shall consider it girl said he please master she cried with a tiny almost imperceptible movement the tiniest motion of their short legs the four tharlarion almost ringing the girl seemed to drift again toward her like halfsubmerged meaningless logs save for the methodicality of their convergence there would then be a sudden lunge and the snapping of the great jaws the fighting for the prey master cried tende kisu suddenly reached out and seizing the girl by the bound wrists she screaming wrenched her bodily in a shower of water across the thwart of the canoe at the same time sensing the sudden movement of the prey the four tharlarion lashing the water with their tails cut toward her two of them struck toward the stern of the canoe another uttered an explosive cry half grunt half bellow which in rage and frustration sounded across the marsh the fourth jaws distended more than a yard in width attacked the side of the canoe i beat it back with the paddle the canoe began to tip backward as another tharlarion clambered half out of the water onto its stern kisu thrust at it with his paddle it bit the paddle in two the girls clinging to the thwarts screamed ayari moved toward the bow of the canoe half standing to try to balance the weight with the splintered handle of the paddle kisu jabbed at the tharlarion it slipped back off the stern the canoe struck with a clash in the water nearly capsizing another tharlarion struck at the side of the canoe with its snout i heard wood crack but not break it turned to use its tail another tharlarion slipped beneath the canoe move the canoe cried kisu do not let them under it i thrust at the water with the paddle and then as the tharlarion began to surface under the slender vessel pushed down at it the canoe slipped off its back and righted itself ayari seizing one of the paddles and i then moved the canoe forward the tharlarion were quick to follow snapping and bellowing kisu with the splintered paddle handle thrust back one of them then i saw a handful of dried fish fly into the maw of one of the beasts ayari his paddle discarded was reaching into the cylindrical basket of dried fish torn open which had been among the supplies of the canoe he hurled more fish to another tharlarion which with a snapping popping noise clamped shut its jaws on the salty provender he similarly threw fish to the other two beasts hand me another paddle i said to the first girl in the canoe she was crouching trembling head down in the bottom of the canoe perform slave i said yes master she whispered she handed the paddle back to the blondhaired barbarian who half in shock numb handed it back to me she looked at me frightened and then looked away i think she knew that she again belonged to me i pulled the paddle from her fingers and passed it back to kisu who took it calmly kisu and i then began to propel the canoe eastward tende wrists bound beneath her body lay shuddering between kisu and myself in the bottom of the canoe ayari then threw bits of fish into the water where the tharlarion must swim to them to obtain them he threw successive tidbits further and further away behind the canoe then he scattered several scraps of fish at one time in an arc behind the tharlarion kisu and i continued to propel the canoe from the vicinity the tharlarion distracted and feeding did not follow after a quarter of an ann kisu laid aside his paddle he put tende to her back crouching beside her he untied her hands she looked up at him it is right is it not he asked to enslave a rightful and natural slave yes master she said he then gently removed her clothing you are beautiful he said a girl is pleased if master is pleased she said it is too bad you are only a slave he said yes master she said i then removed the white shells and cord from the throat and left ankle of the blondhaired barbarian and snapped the two cords in half i then retied shells on her throat and left ankle the two remaining pieces of cord with their shells i gave to kisu he then tied them on the throat and left ankle of tende you have ornamented me as a slave master said tende it is fitting slave said kisu yes master she said she then saw her clothing with the exception of a silken strip a foot in width and some five feet in length ripped from an undergarment dropped overboard into the marsh kisu carefully folded the silken strip into small squares and slipped it between his waist and his loincloths twistedcloth belt it could serve her as a brief wraparound skirt similar to those of the other girls if he later saw fit to clothe her your slave lies naked before you master said tende i have always desired you tende he said she lifted her arms to him you are a slave arent you tende he asked yes master she said she put her arms down she looked up at him since i was a little girl she said i wanted to be your slave but i never thought you would be strong enough to make me your slave in ukungu he said it was not possible he looked down at her his hands hard on her arms here he said it is possible here she said it is reality then she winced for his hands in his desire tightened more upon her anus oh she said youre hurting me be silent slave he said yes master she said he looked at her fiercely she could not meet his eyes i think she had not known before that a man could so desire her she had not before been a slave i name you tende he said yes master she said now wearing that name like a collar it having been put upon her as a slave name to whom do you belong he asked you master she said do you think you will have an easy slavery with me he asked no master she said you are right he said your slavery will be a full slavery i desire no other she said turning her head to face him i could smell the heat of her are you now going to claim me as your slave she asked they seemed oblivious of the others in the canoe yet had they not been it would have made no difference for the girl was only a slave i claim you tende said he as my slave are you going to take the rights of the master she asked when and as i please he said yes master she said oh she said forced down roughly in the canoe i claim you tende daughter of my hated enemy aibu he said as my slave and now for the first time i assert over you the full and uncompromising rights of my mastery yes master she said yes master ayari and i and the two barebreasted lovely white slaves property girls each of us now with a paddle not speaking propelled the long canoe quietly eastward we reach the sill i am not pleased with a slave look said ayari in the bow of the long canoe pointing forward at last said kisu in the stern resting his paddle the two white slaves kneeling one behind the other before me lifted their paddles from the water laying them across the sides of our narrow vessel behind me directly before kisu tende withdrew her paddle too from the water kisu kept her in the canoe immediately before him he wanted her within his reach she knew herself constantly under his scrutiny she dared not shirk no more than the other slaves in the heavy work set her more than once kisu had struck her across the shoulders with his broadbladed ornately carved paddle when she weary arms aching had faltered in the rhythm of the stroke we had come to the sill that place where the marsh gives way to the waters of ngao kisu and i slipped into the water and wading slipping in the mud thrust and hauled the canoe forward then the marsh reeds parted and i saw before us sparkling in the sun broad and shining the waters of lake ngao how beautiful it is breathed the blondhaired barbarian in english it had taken us fifteen days to reach the sill we had lived by spear fishing and drinking the fresh water of the marsh the sun shone on the wide placid waters shaba i recalled had been the first of civilized men or outlanders to have seen this sight it is beautiful i thought to myself unfortunate i thought that the first civilized person to have seen this sight had been the treacherous shaba ukungu said kisu lies to the northeast on the coast ukungu was a country of coast villages speaking the same or similar dialects it was now claimed as a part of the expanding empire of bila huruma you are no longer welcome there i said to kisu true said he is it your intention to return i asked in an attempt to foment rebellion that is not a portion of my current plan he said what is your current plan i asked i shall speak to you of it later he said i am seeking one called shaba i said one with whom i have business to conclude my task takes me to the ua i too smiled kisu am on my way to the ua river that is a part of your plan i asked yes he said it is a part of my plan i myself i said may perhaps find it necessary to enter upon the ua river itself i too may find that necessary he said the country of the ua i suspect i said is a perilous country i am counting on that said kisu is that too tasked in accord with the plan you guard so secretively it is grinned kisu are you familiar with the ua i asked no said kisu i have never seen it i steadied the canoe it floated free now fully at the outer edge of the ngao waters let us be on our way i said kisu the water now again to his thighs reached into the canoe he took a narrow short length of leather and bound tendes wrists tightly behind her body he then similarly crossing them and lashing them together secured the girls ankles why does my master bind me she asked kneeling helplessly in the canoe i do not expect to see canoes of ukungu said kisu but if we do you will thus bound perhaps not be tempted to leap into the water and swim to safety yes master she said putting her head down these other slaves too i said might be tempted to seek an easier slavery within the collar of the empire let us then discourage them too from foolish thoughts of escape said kisu i then bound the other two girls as kisu had bound tende we then with two long lengths of leather fastened them all three together one strap putting them in throat coffle the other in leftankle coffle do not tie me with white slaves master begged tende but kisu laughed at her and it was done to her kisu and i reentered the canoe and took up our paddles we then set forth paddling calmly on the broad shining waters of ngao we paid no attention to tende who was weeping with the degradation which had been inflicted upon her the proud daughter of aibu high chief of the ukungu district was now well learning that she was only a slave you there i said crawl to my arms i lay in the canoe on one elbow under the moons of gor the canoe like a tiny bit of wood in the vastness of the shimmering lake yes master she said the blondhaired barbarian her body pale in the light of the moons carefully moved toward me i heard the shells about her neck click softly together nestle i told her yes master she said she nestled obediently in the crook of my left arm we had kept the girls in highsecurity ties only for the first two days upon ngao then we had been far out on the lake much farther away from the shores than any canoe would be likely to travel after the first two days we had for another two days kept them merely in leftankle and throat coffle on the fifth day they were merely in throat coffle on the sixth day we had relieved them of even that bond kiss me i said she did so and then she lay with her head on my left shoulder you are frightened i said she had lost much ground since schendi do you not remember the beautiful girl you saw in the mirror in schendi i asked she was a slave whispered the girl of course i said i fear her she said she is the slave beauty within you i said indeed she is the true you glimpsed but for an instant your true self seen but for a moment begging to be freed i dare not free her she said she is too beautiful and sensuous you do not dare to be what you are i asked no she said if that is what i am i dare not be it why i asked it is too beautiful and sensuous and helpless and yielding and yet in your heart i said you ache to be it no she said no i said nothing i am in conflict she said miserably resolve the conflict i told her free the slave within you she who is suppressed your true self no no she said pressing her cheek against my shoulder i felt tears you will never achieve happiness i told her until you have acknowledged her no she whispered she must be freed i said that lovely girl the slaves yearning for a collar within you your truest and deepest self i dare not free her she said is honesty so terrible i asked a woman must have dignity she said are selfdeceit and lies and hypocrisy so noble i inquired i dare not free the slave she said why not i asked i fear that i may be she she whispered you are she i said no no she whispered yes i said i am not a gorean girl she said the women of earth collared and broken to the whip i said make superb slaves oh she said as i touched her you are dry and tight i told her forgive me master she said bitterly you are not now on earth i told her here no one will chide you for being lovely and sensuous here you need not feel guilty for being loving and feminine i am not a gorean slut she said do you think that i am patient i asked if master wishes to use his girl please do so she said and then let me crawl back to my place i took her head between my hands please youre hurting me she said do you think that i am patient i asked i am ready to obey master she said tensely frightened do you think that i am patient i asked holding her i do not know master she whispered strained there is a time to be patient and a time not to be patient i said yes master she said beware i said of the time when i decide not to be patient yes master she said i released her she lay on her side in the canoe her body tense beside me do you want me now master she asked frightened no i told her return to your place yes master she said she crawled back to her place i lay on my back looking up at the stars and the moons i beard her fingernails dig at the wood of the canoe she had been a rejected slave we enter upon the ua we hear drums the blondhaired barbarian dipped her paddle into the water and drew it backwards is the lake endless she asked no i said we had been twenty days upon the lake living by fishing drinking its water i could see brownish stains in the lake i could smell flowers somehow the mouth of the ua must lie ahead do you carry slaves into danger asked the blondhaired barbarian yes i told her she trembled but did not lose the stroke of the paddle she had tried to speak to me at various times during the past few days but i had responded little to her usually confining my responses to curt utterances once i had gagged her with her own hair and leather she continued to peddle miserably knowing herself to be in disfavor with her master surely by now said ayari speaking from the bow we must be hear the ua observe the water said kisu smell the flowers and the forest i think that already we may be within its mouth i was startled could its mouth be so wide already we were perhaps within the ua kisu pointed overhead see the mindar he said we looked up and saw a brightly plumaged shortwinged sharpbilled bird it was yellow and red that is a forest bird said kisu the mindar is adapted for short rapid flights almost spurts its wings beating in sudden flurries hurrying it from branch to branch for camouflage in flower trees and for drilling the bark of such trees for larvae and grubs look said ayari pointing off to the left there we saw a tharlarion sunning itself on a bar as we neared it it slipped into the water and swam away we are within the river said kisu i am sure of it the lake is dividing said ayari no laughed kisu pleased that is an island in the river there will doubtless be many of them which way shall we go i asked go to the right said kisu why i asked i am english it seemed to me more natural to pass on the left that way of course ones sword arm faces the fellow on the other side of the road who might be passing you surely it is safer to keep a stranger on your right goreans generally incidentally like the english i am pleased to say keep to the left of a road they too you see are a sensible folk they do this explicitly for reasons quite similar to those which long ago presumably prompted the english custom namely provision for defense and the facilitation if it seems desirable of aggression most goreans like most men of earth are righthanded this is natural as almost all goreans seem to be derived from human stock in gorean as in certain earth languages the same word is used for both stranger and enemy in entering a village on the ngao coast said kisu one always enters on the right why is that i asked one thus exposes ones side to the blade of the other said kisu is that wise i asked how better asked kisu to show that one comes in peace interesting i said but for my part i would have felt easier in passing to the left what if the other fellow does not desire peace as a warrior i knew the value of an eighth of an ihn saved in turning the body thus said kisu if there are men in these countries and their customs resemble those of the ngao villages and ukungu we shall make clear to them our peaceful intentions this may save us much trouble that sounds intelligent to me i said if there are men in these countries they may then be encouraged to leave us alone precisely said kisu and we might of course if need be i said bring the canoe about yes said kisu we then took the canoe to the right in half of an ahn the island was on our left it was pasangs in length i do not even think there are men in these countries said ayari we are too far to the east you are probably right said kisu it was then that we heard the drums can you read the drums i asked no said ayari kisu i asked no he said but doubtless they are announcing our arrival the fishing village a slave begs to be touched ayari acquires information they were scampering about on the scaffolding it extending far out into the river we could understand little of what they said from the scaffolding a double row of peeled logs about ten feet apart with numerous connecting bars and crossbars fastened together with vines more than a hundred yards in length extending out into the flowing waters hung numerous vine ropes attached to which were long conical woven baskets fish traps away away screamed one of the men first in ushindi and then in ukungu he and others waved their arms aversively there were only men and male children on the scaffolding back on the shore almost invisible in the jungle were the huts of the village on the palmthatched roofs of these huts in rows exposed to the sun were drying fish we could see women on the shore some with bowls come out to the edge of the river to see what was occurring go away cried the fellow in ukungu and ushindi we are friends called ayari speaking in ushindi go away screamed the fellow again this time in ushindi he was we gathered the village linguist other men too some eight or nine of them and some seven or eight boys of various ages came out farther on the platform balancing themselves expertly over the flowing waters to bid us be on our way i would know i said if shaba came this way and how long ago more than one of the men now drew forth knives and threatened us they are not overly friendly observed ayari this is not good said kisu we could use supplies bush knives and trade goods with what will you purchase them i asked you have the golden chain given to you by bila huruma he said i touched the chain yes i said that is true i lifted the chain from my neck and displayed it to the men on the long scaffolding they continued to encourage us to be on our way it is no use said ayari even the children were screaming at us imitating their elders to them of course objectively i supposed it made no difference whether we came ashore or not this was the first settlement we had come to on the river it lay only an ahn beyond the first island one of several we had encountered let us continue on our way said kisu i heard a sudden scream that of a boy and looking about saw one of the lads some eight years in age tumble from the scaffolding he began almost immediately to be washed downstream without thinking i dove into the water when i surfaced i heard kisu calling out to turn the canoe i stroked quickly after the boy moving swiftly in the current then i was to where i thought given my speed he should be or to where i thought i might be able to see him he was not there a few moments later the canoe glided beside me do you see him i called out to ayari he is safe said ayari come into the canoe where is he i asked crawling dripping over the bulwark of the light vessel look said kisu i looked back and to my surprise saw the lad half shinnied up one of the poles of the scaffolding he was grinning he swims like a fish said ayari he was never in danger none of the men i noted had leapt from the platform yet the boy had screamed yet he had seemed to be washed downstream apparently in jeopardy of being carried away by the current one of the men on the platform gestured for us to come closer he had sheathed his jaggededged knife a fishermans knife we paddled closer as we did so he helped the lad climb up to the surface of the scaffolding i saw that both the men and boys stood upon it and moved upon it with a nimble sure footing they were less likely to fall from it i realized than an earthling to tumble from one of his sidewalks they knew it intimately and conducted the business of their livelihood upon it for hours a day the lad and others were grinning at us one of the men perhaps his father patted him on the head congratulating him he had played his part well come ashore said one of the men in ushindi he who had earlier used this language and ukungu as well you would have saved the boy he said it is thus clear that you are our friends be welcome here come ashore our friends to our village it was a trick said kisu yes i said but a nice trick said ayari i do not like to be tricked said kisu perhaps on the river i said one cannot be too careful perhaps said kisu we then guided the canoe about the platform and made for shore we tied the hands of the three girls behind them and sat them in the dirt we were within a sticksided palmthatched hut in the fishing village a small fire in a clay bowl dimly illuminated the interior of the hut there were shelves in the hut of sticks on which were vessels and masks individual tethers ran from the bound wrists of each girl to a low stout sunken slave post at one side of the hut there had been much singing and dancing it was now late kiss and i sat opposite one another across the clay bowl with its small fire where is ayari i asked kisu he remains with the chief said kisu he is not yet satisfied what more does he wish to learn i asked i am not sure said kisu we had learned that three boats with more than one hundred and twenty men several in blue tunics had passed this village several days ago they had not stopped we were far behind shaba and his men master said tende yes said kisu we are naked she said yes said kisu you traded the bit of silk you had permitted me to wear about my hips she said you traded the shells about my throat you traded even the shells about my ankle yes said kisu the shells and silk interestingly had been of considerable value to these fishermen the shells were from thassa islands and their types were unknown in the interior similarly silk was unknown in the interior the shells from about the throats and ankles of all the girls of course had been traded we had also traded of course the strips of redandblackprinted repcloth from about the hips of the two blond slaves we had retained the golden chain which i wore which had been a gift of bila huruma it might be useful we speculated at a later date in civilization of course it had considerable value here we did not know if it would have more value than metal knives or coils of copper wire the results of our trading had been two baskets of dried fish a sack of meal and vegetables a length of bark cloth plaited and pounded from the pod tree dyed red a handful of colored wooden beads and most importantly two pangas twofootlong heavy curvebladed bush knives it was the latter two implements in which kisu had been most interested i did not doubt but what they might prove useful i am not pleased kisu said tende he leaped across the fire bowl toward her and savagely struck her head to the left with a fierce blow of the fiat of his hand did you dare to speak my name slave he asked she lay at his feet on her side terrified blood at her mouth her wrists bound behind her the line on them taut to the slave post forgive me master she cried forgive me master i see it was a mistake to have permitted you any decoration or clothing whatsoever proud slave he said forgive me master she begged it was true that a slave may wear in the way of cosmetics clothing or ornament only what the master sees fit to permit her sometimes of course this is nothing i see another item said kisu angrily which might perhaps be traded in the morning before we leave the village what she asked it lies at my feet he said no master she cried i wonder what you would bring in trade he mused do not trade me master she begged she might of course be traded as easily as a sack of meal or a knife or a bit of cloth or a tarsk or vulo she was a slave you are not much good as a slave he said i will try to be better she said struggling to her knees let me please you tonight i will give you pleasures you did not know exist i will so please you that in the morning you will not wish to trade me it will not be easy said he with your hands tied behind you she looked at him frightened he loosened her tether from the slave post and carried her wrists still bound behind her back to the side of the hut he put her on her knees there and then indolently lay down on one elbow between her and the stick wall of the hut he looked at her yes master she said and then piteously as a slave addressed herself to his pleasure i sat beside the clay bowl with its small glowing fire thinking in the morning early we must be again on our way with a tiny stick i prodded the fire shaba was far ahead of us why i wondered had he fled to the ua with the ring he might have slipped to a thousand more secure safeties on the broad surface of gor yet he had chosen the dangerous unknown route of the ua did he think men would fear to pursue him upon its lonely waters penetrating such a lush perilous mysterious region surely he mustknow that i and others to seek the ring would follow him even into the steaming flowerstrewn wilderness of the ua he had i conjectured made a serious mistake a misjudgment surprising in one of so subtle a mind master i heard softly i turned the first blondhaired girl not she who had been janice prentiss whom i have referred to as the blondhaired barbarian knelt at the end of her tether her wrists extended behind her bound their line taut to the slave post this was she who had with the blondhaired barbarian been purchased as one of the matched set of serving slaves which bila huruma had given to tende among her other companionship gifts this girl was also blond and barbarian also clearly given her accent her teeth which contained two fillings and a vaccination mark of earth origin she too like the blondhaired barbarian bore on her left thigh the common kajira mark of gor master said the first girl the blondhaired barbarian her wrists tied behind her tethered to the same post sat nearby angrily in the dirt yes i said i crawl to the end of my tether where i kneel before you she said yes i said she put down her head i beg your touch she said i heard the blondhaired barbarian near her gasp in indignation i could hear the sounds of pleasure from kisu and tende at the side of the hut the kneeling girl lifted her head regarding me i beg your touch she said my need is much on me again i heard the blondhaired barbarian gasp but this time in amazement she could not believe that she had heard a woman admit to sexual desire did the other slut not know that this was something that no woman must do was it not sufficiently horrifying even to experience sexual desire without admitting the fact slave chided the blondhaired barbarian slave slave yes slave said the first girl to her please master she said to me i went near to her but not so near that she could touch me please she begged you are a barbarian i said to her i am now a gorean slave girl she said are you not from a world called earth i asked yes master she said how long have you been on gor i asked more than five years she said how did you come to gor i asked i do not know she said i went to sleep one night in my own room on my own world i awakened perhaps days later chained in a gorean market i nodded gorean slavers usually keep their lovely prizes drugged enroute between worlds what is your name i asked whatever master wishes she said it is true i said she smiled at me i have been owned by many men she said i have had many names what was your barbarian name i inquired alice she said alice barnes that is two names is it not i asked yes master she said alice was my first name barnes was my second name alice i said is a slave name so i have learned on this world she said on my old world however it may also function as the name of a free woman interesting i said she smiled feminine first names of earth are often used on gor as slave names sometimes they are even given to slave girls of gorean origin they tend to excite masters and often improve a girls price the origin of the custom is probably a simple one most girls brought to gor are brought as slaves it is thus natural that their original names be regarded as the names of slaves many goreans even those educated to the second knowledge that afforded the higher castes find it hard to believe that the delicious earth women who show up in their markets could possibly have been free on their native world they are just too obviously marvelous slave meat if they were free they should not have been say many goreans at any rate they add they are now in the collar where they belong and they will stay there it is true incidentally that a girl of earth origin is almost never freed on gor they are on the whole just too wonderful too desirable to free perhaps one would have to be insane to free such a woman would it not be madness to let such beauties kneeling before you out of your collar a gorean saying of the second knowledge has it that a steel collar locked on the throat of an earth woman is perfect if you should be a female and are reading this and should be so unfortunate as to be taken to gor as a slave do not hope for freedom rather learn your lessons swiftly and well and resign yourself to the service of masters fight your collar if you wish but in the end it will do you no good you are slave i name you alice i said thank you master she said you wear the name now as a slave name i said i know she said do you like it i asked now wearing your old name but now afresh put upon you as a degraded slave name i love it she said it is delicious it makes me quiver with desire she strained at the tether trying to reach me it is said i said that the women of earth are natural slaves it is true she whispered it is also said they are the lowest and most miserable of slaves and are to be used as such it is true master she said she looked down that has been well taught to me on gor she said she looked up please take me in your arms she said i am an earth woman who has been made a gorean slave girl you need not respect me as you might a gorean woman and i am further only a slave do not respect me i do not i told her thank you master she said i am an imbonded earth woman she said i am among the lowest and most miserable of slaves take me in your arms i beg you and treat me as such i took her in my arms so use me that i fear that i may die master she begged i thrust my lips to her throat and she put her head back slave slave chided the blondhaired barbarian yes slave wept the girl in my arms i lowered her to the dirt i stayed with her a long time i did not however bother to untie her hands i would only have had to retie them later the blondhaired barbarian turned away bitterly she lay on her side in the dirt i heard her cry her small fists behind her were clenched in frustration i thought that in a few days it might well be she who would crawl kneeling to the end of her tether her bound wrists extended behind her the line taut to some slave post and beg perhaps weeping the touch of a master it was late when ayari returned to the hut the girls were asleep tende when kisu had finished with her had been returned to her place she now too like the other girls lay sleeping in the dirt her wrists tied behind her tethered to the slave post did you learn more i asked others said he than your shaba and his followers have passed here i learned this finally from the chief and two of his men with whom i spoke they were reluctant to speak asked kisu quite so said ayari they were frightened even to speak of what they saw what was it i asked things said he what sort of things i asked they would not say mid ayari they were too frightened he looked at me but i fear that it is not we alone who seek your shaba others pursue as well asked kisu i think so said ayari interesting i said i lay down beside the fire let us get rest now i said we must be on our way early in the morning the box in the river there said ayari bring the canoe to the right we turned the light vessel a quarter to starboard i see it i said we were four days from the fishermens village where we had been cordially received in these four days we had passed two other villages where farming was done in small clearings but we had not stopped at either the river was generally two to four hundred yards wide at these points at night we would pull the canoe ashore camouflage it and make our camp about a half pasang inland to minimize any danger from possible tharlarion which tend to remain near the water the box about a foot wide and deep and two feet long floating heavy almost entirely submerged with an ornate ring lock rubbed against the side of the canoe by its metal handles i drew it into the canoe with the back of one of the heavy pangas i struck loose the ring lock there were varieties of ring locks this one was a combination padlock in which numbers inscribed on rotating metal disks fitted together are to be properly aligned this permitting the free extraction of the bolt this as is the case with most singlealignment ring locks was not a highsecurity lock the materials in the box i was confident would not be of great value the numbers on the lock were in gorean i thrust up the lid ah said kisu in the box jumbled were rolls of wire mirrors pine and knives beads shells and bits of colored glass trade goods said kisu doubtless from one of the vessels of shaba said ayari doubtless i agreed we put the goods in one of the sacks we had had and saved from the fishermens village and threw the broken lock and opened box again into the river let us proceed with caution said kisu that seems to me wise i said bark cloth and beads we sat about the small fire some half pasang inland from the river in the rain forest a great spined anteater more than twenty feet in length shuffled about the edges of the camp we saw its long thin tongue dart in and out of its mouth the blondhaired barbarian crept closer to me it is harmless i said unless you cross its path or disturb it it lived on the white ants or termites of the vicinity breaking apart their high towering nests of toughened clay some of them thirtyfive feet in height with its mighty claws then darting its fourfootlong tongue coated with adhesive saliva among the nests startled occupants drawing thousands in a matter of moments into its narrow tubelike mouth she drew a bit further away trembling she was a naked woman and a slave on the barbaric planet of gor perhaps she did not relish being dependent on men and their protection for her very life but she was and she knew it we had brought certain goods with us from the canoe to our camp oh cried the girl startled a grasshopper red the size of a horned gim a small owllike bird some four ounces in weight common in the northern latitudes had leaped near the fire and disappeared into the brush she restrained herself from approaching me more closely she put her head down embarrassed kisu with a knife was cutting a length from the rough reddyed cloth plaited and pounded derived from the inner bark of the pod tree which we had obtained in trade some days ago at the fishermens village it has a cordage of bark strips resembling a closely woven burlap but it is much softer a result in part perhaps due to the fact that the dye in which it is prepared is mixed with palm oil tende was watching him closely i chuckled to myself do i amuse master asked the blondhaired barbarian irritably i was thinking about this afternoon i said oh she said this afternoon late when we had come inland almost in the dusk she had become entangled in the web of a rock spider a large one they are called rock spiders because of their habit of holding their legs folded beneath them this habit and their size and coloration usually brown and black suggests a rock and hence the name it is a very nice piece of natural camouflage a thin line runs from the web to the spider when something strikes the web the tremor is transmitted by means of this line to the spider interestingly the movement of the web in the air as it is stirred by wind does not activate the spider similarly if the prey which strikes the web is too small and thus not worth showing itself for or too large and thus beyond its prey range and perhaps dangerous it does not reveal itself on the other hand should a bird such as a mindar or parrot or a small animal such as a leaf urt or tiny tarsk become entangled in the net the spider swiftly emerges it is fully capable of taking such prey when the blondhaired barbarian stumbled into the web screaming trying to tear it away from her face and hair the spider did not even reveal itself i pulled her away from the net and slapped her to silence curious as she sobbing cleaned herself with leaves and saliva i located the gentle swaying strand which marked the location of the spider it immobile on the ground was about a foot in diameter it did not move until i nudged it with a stick and it then backed rapidly away you need not have struck me she said reproachfully be silent slave i said yes master she said that a slave has irritated one in the least particular is of course more than enough reason for striking her indeed one does not need a reason for striking a slave one may do so at ones purest caprice the girls know this this helps in their discipline in this particular instance of course aside from my irritation at her outburst i did not want her cries to mark our position in the forest we did not know who or what besides ourselves might trek perhaps at our side in that lush habitat master said the girl yes i said you need not have struck me earlier this afternoon she said but i suppose that you are the judge of that for you are the master she added airily i looked at her surely one needs a reason for striking a slave she said no i said i see she said putting her head down she trembled come here i said kneel before me back on your heels she did so looking at me master she asked suddenly i struck her a fierce blow which flung her mouth bloodied to her side in the dirt i stood up do you see i asked yes master she whispered looking up at me horrified now kneel before me and kiss my feet i said and thank me for having struck you tremblingly she crawled to me and knelt before me she put her head down i felt her lips on my feet thank you for having struck me master she whispered she looked up at me do you now understand that you are a slave i asked yes master she said do you still think that a master requires a reason to strike you i asked no master she said and why is that i asked because i am a slave she said it is true i said yes master she said i then sat down again crosslegged and turned my attention to kisu he was displaying the strip of cloth about a foot wide and five feet in length to tende i hoped that the blondhaired barbarian had learned her lesson it might help her to survive on gor a girl does not question what her master does to her she is slave tende knelt before kisu and put her head to the dirt i beg clothing master she said earn it said he to her yes master she said eagerly and then well did she earn it when she was finished kisu threw her the strip of cloth which she then delightedly wrapped about her hips tucking it closed he then from a sack brought from the canoe threw her two strings of colored wooden beads blue and red and yellow which we had obtained in trade from the fishing village earlier thank you my master breathed tende and she then displayed herself before him the brief bark cloth scarlet snug about her hips and the beads about her lovely throat it is now time to tie you for the night said kisu yes master she said the first blond alice gazed enviously upon tende she then crept to me head down i beg clothing master she whispered i looked upon her i am a humbled naked slave she said i beg clothing of my master are you prepared to earn it i asked her yes master she said smiling whore cried the blondhaired barbarian i took alice in my arms kissing her and she put her head back with her eyes closed whore whore cried the blondhaired barbarian what do you think slave girls are for laughed alice her eyes still closed delightedly you silly girl whore whore cried the blondhaired barbarian i kissed alice gather some wood for the fire build it up a little i said to the blondhaired barbarian yes master she said alice looked up at me your touch is masterful she said she smiled up at me the earth woman yields to her gorean master she said the fire had now burned low it was some two ahn before dawn alice her wrists bound now behind her tethered by them to a tree to which tende lay similarly secured lay asleep about her hips was the wraparound skirt tucked shut of scarlet bark cloth which she had well earned i had cut the skirt for her following her performance i had also given her as kisu had tende two strings of wooden beads they were attractive on her she too now like tende was a clothed ornamented slave tende was asleep so too were ayari and kisu i looked over to the blondhaired barbarian who sat by the fire she poked at the fire with a green stick go sit by the slave post i said to her referring to that slim tree to which the other girls were secured which served us as slave post and cross your wrists behind you she did so oh she said as i with the end of a long narrow strip of leather fastened her wrists tightly together i then tied the free end of the tether about the slave post or tree fastening her to it master she said yes i said am i not to be given clothing she asked are you ready to earn it i asked if you command me she said i must obey i am slave and if i do not command you i asked master she asked would you beg for the opportunity to earn clothing i asked never she said never it is time now to go to sleep i said i want clothing she said please master lie down i said it is time to sleep she lay down on her side i cannot beg clothing she sobbed i am an earth woman so too is alice i said she is a slave said the blondhaired barbarian and you i asked yes said the blondhaired barbarian sobbing i too am a slave beg if you wish i said i cannot she wept go to sleep now i said the day will be long and hard tomorrow master she whispered yes i said you taught me a lesson this evening did you not perhaps i said that a master requires no reason to put me under even the harshest of disciplines that is true i said in your cruel way are you not kind she asked to a girl who is a slave do you wish to be whipped i asked no master she said your slavery will be of little use to men i said if you through your ignorance must be soon thrown alive to sleen or tharlarion i see she said bitterly you are not kind no i said you are merely training an animal to know her station in life yes i said i smiled i resisted an impulse to tenderness i resisted too an impulse to seize her fair ankles turn her to her back by means of them throw them apart and then rape her in the dirt she struggled up to one elbow she looked at me what do men want of a slave girl she asked everything i told her she lay back in the dirt miserably master she said yes i said a man may do to me whatever he wants at any time may he not she asked yes i said he needs no reason she said no i said but a man commonly she asked would not hurt me or abuse me without a reason would he he may do so if he wishes i said particularly in your training but of course normally he would not do so there would simply be no point to it there are better things to do to a woman once she is trained than hurt her if i please my master he will not hurt me will he she asked he will if it pleases him i said but if i am totally pleasing to him fully and as an abject slave girl she pressed he will not be likely to be pleased to hurt me will he no i said of course not you must understand of course that if you are displeasing in the least particular that will be a sufficient reason for him to put you under whatever discipline he desires i understand that clearly she said but i will try to be pleasing to my master totally pleasing and fully and as an abject slave girl i asked yes she said i shall strive with all my might to be pleasing in that way to my master masters i said she swallowed hard yea masters she said she knew she might have many masters on gor i saw that the slave girl in her was near the surface are you now ready i asked to beg to earn your clothing i cannot do that she said horrified i saw that the slave girl in her was again thrust back again the iron door of her prison like a heavy hatch was flung shut over her and the bolt thrust shut the slave lying on the narrow stairs leading from her dungeon wept she pressed her small fingers against the damp wall to her left and against the heavy iron door bolted shut obdurate above her which confined her the lovely slave lying on the narrow damp steps hidden beneath the iron door shut out again from the sun cried in the lonely quiet darkness her existence once again denied very well i said remain naked very well she said i shall you have had the opportunity to beg to earn clothing i told her you refused it it is possible that that opportunity may not be again offered she looked at me frightened sleep now i said yes master she said i then went to sit by the small fire i would watch for a time and then awaken kisu in this fashion he then taking the watch i would have some sleep before dawn i was interested in the fauna of the river and the rain forest i recalled sunning themselves on exposed roots near the river tiny fish they were bulbous eyed and about six inches long with tiny flipperlike lateral fins they had both lungs and gills their capacity to leave the water in certain small streams during dry seasons enables them to seek other streams still flowing or pools this property also of course makes it possible for them to elude marine predators and on the land to return to the water in case of danger normally they remain quite close to the water sometimes they even sun themselves on the backs of resting or napping tharlarion should the tharlarion submerge the tiny fish often submerges with it staying close to it but away from its jaws its proximity to the tharlarion affords it interestingly an effective protection against most of its natural predators in particular the black eel which will not approach the sinuous reptiles similarly the tiny fish can thrive on the scraps from the ravaging jaws of the feeding tharlarion they will even drive one another away from their local tharlarion fighting in contests of intraspecific aggression over the plated territory of the monsters back the remora fish and the shark have what seem to be in some respects a similar relationship these tiny fish incidentally are called gints i poked the fire i wondered if i should give the blondhaired barbarian an opportunity again to beg to perform that she might earn a bit of cloth and a handful of beads i would make that decision later kisu i said wake up take the watch he stirred himself and i lay down i thought about the river and was soon asleep we make further progress upon the river do not permit the canoe to be swept away screamed kisu straining to be heard over the rushing water we had been two weeks upon the ua we had come to another of its cataracts it is impossible to paddle against these currents as the river descending rapidly plunges in torrents among a jungle of rocks i and kisu and the blondhaired barbarian and tende waded beside the canoe thrusting it ahead of us on the shore each with a rope one extending from the bow one from the stern stumbled ayari and alice ayari held the bow rope and alice the rope extending from the stern we could port the canoe but only with great difficulty it was an eightman raiders canoe do not lose your footing naked slave cried tende to the blondhaired barbarian yes mistress she cried over the water struggling to remain upright we had made tende first girl she had been after all the former mistress of the two white slaves they would obey her with perfection if they did not we would beat them if tende for her part did not do well as first girl kisu and i had agreed that alice should have the opportunity tende we were sure fearing to be at the mercy of one of her former slaves would strive to be a good first girl tende and alice had taken to calling the blondhaired barbarian naked slave she had among us no other name we had not given her one calling the blondhaired barbarian by that descriptive and accurate appellation made clear the distinction between her and the others she was low girl we all used her to fetch and carry and perform the most servile of our tasks the blondhaired barbarian would weep at night but we paid her no attention unless it be to order her to silence hold the lines called kisu ayari and alice kept the lines taut push called kisu we wading half blinded with water thrust the canoe forward we stop to trade the admissions of a slave trade trade friends friends they called do not take me in there unclothed master begged the blondhaired barbarian we had pulled the canoe up on the shore i tied the blondhaired barbarians hands behind her and put a rope on her neck the loose end of which i threw to alice it would be more seemly we had conjectured if she as she was not clothed as the other girls was led in like a stripped recently captured slave it might tend to allay suspicion that she was not in favor if that were known the bidding might be fierce upon her the villagers being eager to capitalize on her dissatisfaction with her and acquire her as a cheap piece of trade goods perhaps for transmittal into the interior as it was if she had been newly roped we might not be willing to sell her not yet having had an opportunity to truly determine whether or not she might have promise how is it that you are coming from the west on the river with her asked a man who knew snatches of ushindi i did not understand his question the blondhaired barbarian shuddered with misery seeing the honesty of the mens eyes upon her is she a taluna asked a man i did not understand his question the blondhaired barbarian moaned in misery as the men s hands were upon her some of them intimately look said a man crouching beside her holding her leg indicating her brand this excited interest they had never seen a brand on a woman before mices brand was covered by her brief skirt of red bark cloth unnoticed she drew the skirt down an inch or so on her thigh to better conceal her own slave mark the blondhaired barbarian twisted in the grasp of the men her small hands pulled at the tightly looped knotted strap that bound them behind her back it was just as well i realized that we had tied her as we had if she had tried to push away the villagers or prevent them from touching her they might have wanted her hands cut off she cried out with anguish i made a sign and we advanced alice pulling the blondhaired barbarian forward away from the men we entered the gate of the village trade i called friends friends ayari was a remarkable man i doubt that anyone in the village knew more than a few dozen words of ushindi but ayari with his ushindi his gestures his quick wit and a stick with which he drew in the dust of the village not only conducted his trading in a brisk and genial fashion but managed to gather valuable information as well shaba was here said ayari when i asked the chief says only long ago said ayari some of his men were ill he stayed here a week that explains i said how it is that some here know some words of ushindi of course said ayari and doubtless shaba and his men set themselves to learn something of the speech of this village i nodded we had obtained in the trading for some knives and colored glass several sacks of meal fruit and vegetables is there anything else i asked yes grinned ayari we are supposed to turn back why i asked the chief says the river is dangerous beyond this point he says there are hostile tribes dangerous waters great animals monsters and talunas whiteskinned jungle girls he indicated the blondhaired barbarian kneeling her hands tied behind her back her neckrope in the hands of alice who in lovely repose stood beside her he thought she might be one he said i told him she was only an ordinary slave i looked at the blondhaired barbarian that is true i said she put her head down shaba did he not i asked go upriver yes said ayari i too then i said am going upriver we all are said kisu i looked at him it is part of my plan he said your mysterious plan i asked yes he smiled did the chief or the others i asked ayari say anything about the things or whatever they were which were mentioned at the fishing village about which the fishermen were reluctant to speak i asked them said ayari they have seen nothing out of the ordinary then we have lost them said kisu perhaps i said shall we be on our way i asked of course not said ayari there is to be a feast tonight and singing and dancing of course i said that night late we slept in a hut in the village within its palisade it was the first village we had come to on the river which was surrounded by a palisade i pondered on this the river eastward from this point was said to become more dangerous i heard the blondhaired barbarian stirring she like the others had her small hands tied behind her a fivefoot line lying loosely behind her ran from her bound wrists to the slave post to which it tethered her through halfclosed eyes in the halfdarkness as moonlight filtered through the thatched roof and sides of the hut i watched her struggle to her knees she moaned softly on her knees inch by inch she moved toward me until her wrists were extended behind her and she could approach no more closely i know that men are my masters she whispered so softly that i knew she did not speak to awaken me too she spoke in english which language native to her she did not believe any in the hut could understand i have learned that incontrovertibly on this natural world though i think always in my heart i knew it to be true i am yours sweet master why do you not take me and use me as the slave i am you made me yield as a slave so absolutely in schendi do you think i could have forgotten those sensations which you induced in me do you think a girl could ever forget those feelings so rapturously so helplessly overwhelming those feelings which made me a proud earth woman a helplessly submitting slave girl i a slave long to lie again in the arms of my master why have you not again taken me in your arms i long to serve you master am i not pleasing what is it that you would have me do must i crawl to you as the slave i am and beg your touch do you not understand that i cannot admit men are my masters for i am a woman of earth do you not understand that i cannot crawl to you as the slave i am and beg your touch for i am a woman of earth she sobbed softly the tortured prisoner of her conditioning why have the men of gor not surrendered their natural dominance she asked why have they remained strong and proud joyful and mighty and free so unlike the men of my world have they not been taught that it is wrong for them to be true men that it is wrong for them to fulfill themselves and be happy have they not been taught that frustration and conflict and misery is the proper condition of the human male that he is to be approved only in so far as he subjects himself to external standards foreign to his own nature that he is to be praised only in so far as he denies himself to himself that he must avoid at all costs satisfying genetic realities locked in every cell in his body is it truly better for a man to torture his system inflicting guilt and fear upon it inducing irregularities within it and to die prematurely of a variety of loathsome diseases than to be happy i do not know i am only a woman why are the men of gor different from those of earth is it because poisoned minds were not brought to gor is it that it is only a matter of chance that on earth and not gor due to a chance dynamic or a particular situation the consequences of which were not understood civilization developed not as the expression celebration and enhancement of nature constituting a palace within which nature might thrive but as its nemesis its stunting foe i do not know perhaps those they call priestkings if they exist have been thoughtful in this respect or perhaps it is simply that the men of gor unlike the men of earth do not choose to unman themselves why should we do so they might ask and there is i think no answer to that question the men of gor like beasts and loving gods subject the women they own to their total mastery it pleases them to do so they are men should i be distressed or displeased not truly for i am a woman i admire their honesty that they scorn to conceal the sovereignty which is theirs by nature they do not play games they put me to their feet where i belong should i be displeased no for i am a woman only where there are true men can there be true women whatever be the reasons whether genetic or cultural or both the men of gor are different from those of earth they have remained men perhaps simply because it has pleased them to do so this also pleases me because only where there are true men can there be true women she put down her head i did not stir but continued through halfshut eyes to regard her in the filtered moonlight in the hut tethered to the slave post she again lifted her head i did not know such men could exist she whispered again again in english which language she used to express her most intimate thoughts again so softly that she might not awaken me she pulled toward me on her knees her wrists extended behind her tethered to the slave post even to look upon them she whispered makes the slave in me scream for fulfillment she sobbed and half choked then she said how terrible i am it is fortunate that my tether is so short i want to crawl to you and please you with my tongue and mouth i hope that you would not beat me if i so disturbed your rest she was silent for a moment and then she said so softly that i could scarcely hear it and again in english i though a woman of earth admit that men are my masters i though a woman of earth admit that i am a slave i though a woman of earth beg my master for his touch i did not move slowly softly she crept back to the vicinity of the slave post and lay down i heard her sob softly i smiled to myself she had come far this night on the road to slavery she had uttered slave admissions though so softly that she thought i could not hear though in a language she thought i could not understand female display behaviors a slave girls dream bark cloth and beads do not drop it said kisu strained sweating the girls cried out in anguish slipping trying to keep the canoe from falling ayari struggled with the bow behind him were the three girls then kisu amidships and myself at the stem we could hear the cataract some two hundred yards away the canoe on our shoulders tilted upward at a twentydegree angle rocks slipped behind us rolling down the grade this is impossible said ayari keep moving forward said kisu i am tired said ayari upward upward said kisu very well said ayari i never argue with big fellows the portage was not easy and it was not our first this was the eleventh cataract of the ua sometimes we used rollers beneath the canoe and hauled with ropes the boats of shaba had been sectioned to facilitate such portages he had had numerous strong men to carry the burdens we had only ourselves and three slightbodied female slaves i can go no further said ayari this was the fourth portage of the day let us rest i said gently we lowered the canoe while the others held it i with rocks braced it that it might not slip backwards down the grade trees surrounded us overhead bright jungle birds flew we could hear the chattering of guernon monkeys about bring up the supplies said kisu yes master said the girls sweating they went back down the grade some hundred yards to gather up the paddles and sacks and roped bundles which contained our various goods we moved these things separately usually a hundred or two hundred yards at a time kisu and i took turns at the stern it requires great strength to brace and support the canoe at that point shaba passed here said kisu sitting down wiping the sweat like river water from his head our portages i said would be much more difficult if he had not preceded us that is true grinned kisu we generally followed the portage routes determined by shaba and his scouts they had located sensible geodesic contours and in traversing the area had because of their larger vessels cut away various trees vines and obstacles i smiled to myself i had little doubt that we now were moving much more swiftly than shaba too he had lost a week with the illness of several of his men a dozen or so as we had learned at the village at which we had recently traded i was pleased with the situation i suspected from the degree of recovery of the jungle following the passage of shaba and his men that he was not more than fifteen or twenty days ahead of us on the river i looked down the grade approaching us in single file led by tende came the slaves carrying supplies last in the line naked came the blondhaired barbarian erect and lovely balancing on her head steadying it with her hands one of the bundles of our supplies she looked at me i saw that she looked at me as a slave girl at her master it pleased me she put down the bundle she then like the other girls who had also discarded their burdens returned down the grade these transports of goods took them two trips ayari was lying on his back looking up at the sky kisu sitting was looking down through the trees at the swift churning water of the river in a few minutes the girls again made their way upward again they came in a single file again the blondhaired barbarian was the last in the line again lovely and erect balancing on her head a bundle one roped heavily and wrapped in bark cloth do not put down your burden i said to her i then rose to my feet and went to where she stood beautiful and obedient she straightened herself even more steadying the bundle on her head i walked slowly about her inspecting the slave beauty of her you make a lovely beast of burden i told her i am a beast of burden master she said i am a slave i looked at her and our eyes met and she lowered her eyes frightened could i know the truth of her could i know how she had confessed herself slave and needful of my touch of course not for i had been asleep and i could not understand her english yet from the very morning following that night of her secret acknowledgments five days ago our relationship had been subtly deliciously different she had begun from that time timidly to look upon me with the vulnerable need of a slave girl she had secretly acknowledged herself slave and mine it was now merely up to me to do what i wished with her she lifted her eyes again to mine for an instant they were frightened could i know her secret of course not how could i swiftly she again lowered her eyes you may put down your burden i said thank you master she said rest now i told her lie on your stomach head to the left with your legs spread and your hands at your sides backs of your wrists to the ground palms facing upwards yes master she said the day had been long and hard we had now made camp a small stream was nearby which led into the ua she stood before me and then without asking gently delicately untied and opened and took from me the shreds of the soiled tunic which i wore it was muddied and caked with dirt from the days in the jungle from the muddy banks of the ua as she removed it from me she kissed me softly tenderly about the chest and left hip are you a trained slave i asked her no master she said she then knelt before me holding the tattered muddied garment against her masters garment is muddied she said i said nothing then she leaned forward and kissed me softly does the earth woman kiss her master i asked yes master she said then she leaned forward and again kissed me softly surely you are a trained slave i said no master she said looking up at me and then she rose to her feet i crouched by the stream and watched her on her knees in the fashion of the primitive owned female clean and rinse the garment of her master the proud earth woman unbidden served as my laundress when she had finished with the garment and wrung it much dry i had her replace it on my body i would let it finish its drying on my body before she tied shut the tunic she kissed me again softly this time on the chest and belly and then again knelt before me her head down gather wood for the fire i told her yes master she said it was now late and the others were asleep tende and alice were already hands tied behind them wristtethered to the small tree which served us as slave post the blondhaired barbarian regarded me and then lowered her eyes and put a bit more wood on the fire it is not always easy to make a fire in the forest there are commonly two large rains during the day one in the late afternoon and the other late in the evening usually an ahn or so before midnight or the twentieth hour these rains are often accompanied by violent winds sometimes i conjecture ranging between one hundred and ten and one hundred and twenty pasangs an ahn the forest is drenched one searches for wood beneath rock overhangs or under fallen trees one may also with pangas hack away the wet wood of fallen trees until one can obtain the dry wood beneath even during the heat of the day it is hard to find suitable fuel the jungle from the heat and rain steams with humidity too like the roof of a greenhouse the lush green canopies of the rain forest tend to hold this moisture within it is the fantastic oxygenation produced by the vegetation conjoined with the humidity and heat and the smell of plant life and rotting vegetable matter and wood that gives the diurnial jungle its peculiar and unmistakable atmosphere an encompassing looming green warm ambience which is both beautiful and awesome the nocturnal jungle is cooler sometimes even chilly and the air a little thinner a shade less rich is different the suns energy no longer powering the complex reaction chains of photosynthesis yet at night perhaps one is even more aware of the presence and vastness of the jungle than during the day in the daylight hours ones horizons are limited by the encircling greenery in the night in the darkness one senses the almost indefinite extension of the jungle thousands of pasangs in width and depth about one the blondhaired barbarian stirred the fire with a stick i watched her one does not make ones camp in the jungle near tall trees because of the abundant amount of moisture the trees do not send down deep tap roots but their root systems spread more horizontally in the fierce winds which often lash the jungle it is not unusual for these shallowly rooted trees uprooted and overturned to come crashing down it seemed she wished to speak but then she did not speak there is an incredible variety of trees in the rain forest how many i cannot conjecture there are however more than fifteen hundred varieties and types of palm alone some of these palms have leaves which are twenty feet in length one type of palm the fan palm more than twenty feet high which spreads its leaves in the form of an opened fan is an excellent source of pure water as much as a liter of such water being found almost as though cupped at the base of each leafs stem another useful source of water is the liana vine one makes the first cut high over ones head to keep the water from being withdrawn by contraction and surface adhesion up the vine the second cut made a foot or so from the ground gives a vine tube which drained yields in the neighborhood of a liter of water in the rain forest some trees grow and lose leaves all year long remaining always in foliage others though not at the same time even in the same species will lose their foliage for a few weeks and then again produce buds and a new set of leaves they have maintained their cycles of regeneration but these cycles interestingly are often no longer synchronized with either the northern or southern winters and springs master said the girl yes i said it is nothing she said looking down in the rain forest we may distinguish three separate ecological zones or tiers or levels each of these tiers or levels or layers is characterized by its own special forms of plant and animal life these layers are marked off by divergent tree heights the highest level or zone is that of the emergents that of those trees which have thrust themselves up above the dense canopies below them this level is roughly from a hundred and twentyfive feet gorean to two hundred feet gorean the second level is often spoken of as the canopy or as that of the canopies this is the fantastic green cover which constitutes the main ceiling of the jungle it is what would dominate ones vision if one were passing over the jungle in tarn flight or viewing it from the height of a tall mountain the canopy or zone of the canopies ranges from about sixty to one hundred and twentyfive feet high gorean measure the first zone extends from the ground to the beginning of the canopies above some sixty feet in height gorean measure we may perhaps somewhat loosely speak of this first zone as the floor or better ground zone of the rain forest in the level of the emergents there live primarily birds in particular parrots longbilled fleers and needletailed lits monkeys and tree urts and snakes and insects however can also be found in this highest level in the second level that of the canopies is found an incredible variety of birds warblers finches mindars the crested lit and the common lit the fruit tindel the yellow gim tanagers some varieties of parrot and many more here too may be found snakes and monkeys gliding urts leaf urts squirrels climbing longtailed porcupines lizards sloths and the usual varieties of insects ants centipedes scorpions beetles and flies and so on in the lower portion of the canopies too can be found heavier birds such as the ivorybilled woodpecker and the umbrella bird guernon monkeys too usually inhabit this level in the ground zone and on the ground itself are certain birds some flighted like the hookbilled gort which preys largely on rodents such as ground urts and the insectivorous whistling finch and some unflighted like the grub borer and lang gim along the river of course many other species of birds may be found such as jungle gants tufted fishers and ringnecked and yellowlegged waders also in the ground zone are varieties of snake such as the ost and hith and numerous species of insects the rock spider has been mentioned and termites also termites incidentally are extremely important to the ecology of the forest in their feeding they break down and destroy the branches and trunks of fallen trees the termite dust thereafter by the action of bacteria is reduced to humus and the humus to nitrogen and mineral materials in the lower branches of the ground zone may be found also small animals such as tarsiers nocturnal jit monkeys black squirrels fourtoed leaf urts jungle varts and the prowling solitary giani tiny catsized panthers not dangerous to man on the floor itself are also found several varieties of animal life in particular marsupials such as the armored gatch and rodents such as slees and ground urts several varieties of tarsk large and small also inhabit this zone more than six varieties of anteater are also found here and more than twenty kinds of small fleet singlehorned tabuk on the jungle floor as well are found jungle larls and jungle panthers of diverse kinds and many smaller catlike predators these on the whole however avoid men they are less dangerous in the rain forest generally than in the northern latitudes i do not know why this should be the case perhaps it is because in the rain forest food is usually plentiful for them and thus there is little temptation for them to transgress the boundaries of their customary prey categories they will however upon occasion particularly if provoked or challenged attack with dispatch conspicuously absent in the rain forests of the ua were sleen this is just as well for the sleen commonly hunts on the first scent it takes upon emerging from its burrow after dark moreover it hunts singlemindedly and tenaciously it can be extremely dangerous to men even more so i think than the voltai or northern larl i think the sleen which is widespread on gor is not found or not frequently found in the jungles because of the enormous rains and the incredible dampness and humidity perhaps the sleen a burrowing furred animal finds itself uncomfortable in such a habitat there is however a sleenlike animal though much smaller about two feet in length and some eight to ten pounds in weight the zeder which frequents the ua and her tributaries it knifes through the water by day and at night returns to its nest built from sticks and mud in the branches of a tree overlooking the water i listened to the noises of the jungle night the chattering and the hootings and the clickings and cries of noctutnal animals and birds and insects i glanced to the blondhaired barbarian it was nearly time to secure her for the night contrary to popular belief the floor of the jungle is not a maze of impenetrable growth which must be hacked through with machete or pangs quite the contrary it is usually rather open this is the result of the denseness of the overhead canopies because of which the ground is much shaded the factor which tends to inhibit and limit ground growth looking about among the slender scattered colonnades of trees exploding far overhead in the lush capitals of the green canopy one is often exposed to vistas of one to two hundred feet or more it is hard not to be reminded of the columns in one of the great shaded temples of initiates as in turia or ar and yet here in the rain forest the natural architecture of sun and shade and growth seems a vital celebration of life and its glory not a consequence of aberrations and the madness of abnegations not an invention of dismal men who have foresworn women even slaves and certain vegetables and live by parasitically feeding and exploiting the superstitions of the lower castes there are of course impenetrable or almost impenetrable areas in the jungle these are generally secondgrowth patches through them one can make ones way only tortuously cuffing with the machete or panga stroke by stroke they normally occur only where men have cleared land and then later abandoned it that is why they are called secondgrowth patches they normally occur along rivers and are not characteristic of the botanical structure of the virgin rain forest itself the blondhaired barbarian dropped some turgs on the fire why are you feeding the fire now i asked forgive me master she said i smiled she did not wish to retire so soon but surely she knew it was nearly time for me to tie her at the slave post it is time to secure you i said must i be secured tonight she asked then she looked frightened forgive me master she said please do not whip me go sit with your back to the slave post in binding position i said yes master she said i let her sit there for a few minutes she did not dare to look back at me over her shoulder come here i then said and kneel before me she did so please do not strike me master she begged what is on your mind tonight i asked nothing master she stammered her head down you may speak i said i dare not she whispered speak i said tende and alice are clothed she said they are scarcely clothed i said and the bit of rag they wear may be stripped away from them in an instant on the least whim of a master yes master she said she looked at me agonized tears in her eyes do you an earth woman i asked desire again that opportunity once afforded to you but rejected by you to beg to earn clothing yes master she said i beg that opportunity though you are an earth woman yes though i am an earth woman master she said it is yours earth woman i said she put down her head i beg clothing master she sobbed do you beg to earn it i asked yes master she said in any way that i see fit i asked yes master she sobbed in such a situation as this formerly i said you spoke of alice your sister in bondage as a whore yes master she said it now seems that it is you i said who are the whore yes master she said it is now i who am the whore but you are mistaken i said in your own case as you were in the case of alice she lifted her bead master she asked in your vanity i said you dignify yourself master do you think you are free i asked no she said the whore i said is a free woman do not presume in your insolence lest you be cut to pieces to compare yourself with her she is a thousand times higher than you you are a thousand times lower than she she is free you are slave yes master she said sobbing head down please forgive me master she shook with emotion i regarded her i beg to earn clothing in any way my master may see fit she said and i humbly beg this as what i am only a slave she lifted her head our eyes met engage in female display behaviors i said master she asked female display behaviors i said surely you are familiar with the biological concept and the sorts of behavioral patterns which are subsumed beneath it she looked at me they are quite common i said in the animal kingdom i am not an animal she said the human being i said is not alien to nature nor disjointed from it he is in some respects one of its most interesting and sophisticated products he is not something out of nature nor apart from nature but one of its complex fulfillments it is not that he is less an animal than say the zeder or sleen but rather that he is a more complicated animal than they in a sense given the rigors of evolution and selection the human contains in itself not less animality than his brethren whom we choose to place lower on the phylogenetic scale than ourselves but more the human is not less of an animal than they but more in him there is in a sense that of complexity and sophistication a greater animality than theirs i am aware as any educated person she said of our animal heritage it is not only your heritage i said it is now and recognize it if you dare your reality she looked down perhaps someday i said sleen will become sufficiently intellectual to make mistakes in reasoning when they do their first fallacy will doubtless be to decide that they are not really sleen that is silly she said she smiled is it less silly i asked if it is done by human beings perhaps not she said to be sure i said if i have a problem in algebra i will give it to a mathematician before i will turn it over to a sleen the reason for that however is not that the sleen is an animal and the mathematician is not but rather that the mathematician is better at algebra than a sleen the word animal may be used in various senses not all of them complimentary to animals in the literal sense of animal the human being is an animal in a rather different sense of animal we sometimes draw a distinction between human beings and animals that is we take the category of animals and divide it in two calling one sort of animals ourselves human beings and letting what is left over the other sorts of animals count as the animals do not ask me to explain the logic of that distinction there are also senses of animal which are complimentary and derogatory for example he has an animal charm or he acts like an animal when he is drunk i looked at her also i said if you are interested in these matters you are not simply an animal in the literal sense in the biological sense of animal but in the sense that persons individuals with rights before the law are distinguished from animals she regarded me frightened in that sense my dear i said i am not an animal and you are an animal yes my dear you are legally an animal in the eyes of gorean law you are an animal you have no name in your own right you may be collared and leashed you may be bought and sold whipped treated as the master pleases disposed of as he sees fit you have no rights whatsoever legally you have no more status than a tarsk or vulo legally literally you are an animal yes master she whispered you may now engage in female display behaviors i said i do not know any she said i laughed i am not a lewd girl she said does the slave have pride i asked no master she said perform i said i do not know how she wept i do not know how peel away the hideous encrustations of your antibiological conditioning i told her hidden in every cell in your body in the genetic codes of each minute cell the product of a long complex evolution lie the marvels of which i speak in the deepest part of your brain lies the provocation to these truths you are the result of thousands upon thousands of women who have pleased men evolution has selected for such women do not tell me that you do not know these behaviors deny them if you will but they have been bred into you they are a part of your very being they are my sweet slave in your very blood no she wept perform i said she threw back her head with misery and clutched at her hair and then suddenly startled her hands at her hair looked at me her eyes wide the line of her breasts had been lifted nicely yes i said consult the animal in you what am i doing she wept she now sat and extended her leg and took her right ankle in her hands and moved her hands slowly from her ankle to her calf her toes were pointed emphasizing the sweet curve of her calf is it not now coming back to you i asked is it not almost like a memory a kinesthetic and intellectual recollection are you not now getting in touch with certain feared basic and rudimentary feelings and reactions can you not now begin to sense the ancient truths those of the female before the male i am frightened she whispered build up the fire i said master she asked that i may better see my female perform yes master she said i watched her gather twigs how she walked how she held them how she returned to the fire and kneeling sometimes glancing at me placed them on the fire as i had thought she was even then engaging in female display behavior i had thought she would i wondered if she were fully conscious of what she did i suspect she was only partly aware of it and yet clearly i saw that she was excited how subtly and marvelously she manifested her beauty in so small a thing as the way in which a woman places a plate on the table before a man or a twig upon a small fire she may invite him to her rape i do not think she was fully conscious of how provocative she was yet doubtless she was intensely aware of my eyes upon her i wondered if women knew how beautiful they were i supposed not otherwise why would any of them be puzzled when they were enslaved i observed her movements she had begun to recognize her bondage to understand in her heart that she was truly a slave girl you move as a slave girl before her master i said i am a slave girl before my master she said the slave girl moves and carries herself differently from a free woman this is evident in such small things as fetching a cup for her master or in pouring his wine these movements and bodily attitudes and postures subtle and beautiful difficult to fully disguise have betrayed more than one slave beauty who disguised as a free woman has sought to flee a city the spears of guards lowered to her dismay suddenly block her way where are you going slave they ask she is then knelt and stripped her collar and brand revealed returned to her master she may be confident that her punishment will not be light i looked at the slave an earth woman who exhibits sensuous movement is commonly ostracized or in some other way socially punished the contempt in which the exotic dancer on earth is held despite the richness of her music and beauty is a symptom of this pathology the freedoms of the earth woman do not extend to the point where she is permitted to move as a woman that she is not supposed to be free to do the freedoms of the earth woman in effect are freedoms to conform within reasonably narrow limits to certain socially approved stereotypes females of earth not permitted to move as women are expected to perform what are in effect maleimitation movements it is little wonder that they occasionally crying out with frustration dance naked before a mirror it is little wonder that in their dreams they are roped and thrown to warriors on gor of course the woman if she be slave is no longer prohibited because of cultural requirements from expressing the kinesthetic realities of her womanhood the slave girl learns to think of herself as deeply and radically feminine as uncompromisingly feminine she thus soon unconsciously thinks and moves as what she is a female moreover there is a special modality to the movements of the slave girl she knows not only that she is a female but a female in the most radical and profound sense an owned female one at the bidding of masters this excites her and cannot help hut be reflected in her movements she is the most natural biological and profound of women the woman at the mercy of men who must obey and serve them the slave girl the blondhaired barbarian put a bit more wood on the fire i smiled the men of earth think often of sex as a simple matter of explicit congress this is however much too limited the perimeters of sex are not limited to those of physiological union any woman i suppose knows this it is unfortunate that it is not recognized by more men the blondhaired barbarian and i she beneath my will were now surely intensely engaged in sex yet she was feet from me and i was not touching her the fire is high enough i said now kneel before me slave yes master she said stretch like the sleek little animal you are i said yes master she said now rise gracefully i said and walk back and forth before me yes master she said i watched her you are a pretty slave i said thank you master she said now stand before me and lower your head yes master she said lift your head again and lower it again i said this time more deferentially i obey master she said she again lifted her head and this time slowly gracefully deferentially inclined it to me excellent i said thank you master she said you now stand before your master i said your neck bent in submission yes my master she said lift your head now i said and look at me yes master she said she did so you are an earth woman i said on earth as i understand it i said your delicious and vulnerable animality your feminine animality the most basic and deepest female of you helpless and needful was as a matter of cultural policy consistently suppressed and frustrated yes master she whispered did you daydream i asked i fought them she said foolish i said but they kept recurring she said of course i said she looked at me was there a common theme i asked yes she said myself in a position of submission before men hat is natural i said yes master she said and at night i said occasionally erupting from the depths of your mind indicative of your cruelly frustrated needs and desires were certain sorts of dreams yes master she whispered describe to me now one of them there was one of them which more than once i dreamed she said which returned to me again and again describe it to me i said but such things are so private to a girl she said speak slave i said yes master she said it seems i was in the jungles of south america a continent on my native world earth or perhaps it was some other world i do not know i was a traveler or tourist there was some group involved the details are unclear we were examining the ruins of an ancient civilization great blocks of stone huge frightening carvings yes i said i wore boots and a skirt and shortsleeved blouse she said and a helmet of lightweight material to protect me from the sun too i wore sunglasses pieces of colored glass sometimes worn by those of earth before their eyes sometimes to guard their expressions and features but usually to reduce the glare of a bright sun i understand i said what is that carving i asked our native guide he was a tall red man handsome and strong he wore an openthroated blue shirt with the sleeves rolled up it is like a halftunic for the torso with sleeves too he wore blue trousers such a garment covers the lower body and fits about the legs i am familiar with such garments for the upper and lower body i said they are worn in torvaldsland and in other areas generally in the northern latitudes is it not obvious he asked it is the carving of a naked slave girl kneeling before her master i was so embarrassed perhaps she is only a captive i said angrily look he said pointing she wears a neck belt oh i said see its knot and disk he asked the distinctive slave knot and the disk that identifying the master yes i said it is the neck belt of a slave he said i see i said she is a slave he said then i said she would have to do what her master tells her he then with two hands removed my sunglasses he looked directly into my eyes yes he said i trembled for in that instant he had looked upon me as a woman one perhaps containing within herself a slave he then turned me so that i must look again upon the carving of the subservient girl the kneeling slave at the feet of her master i then saw it in the bright and direct light of the sun it was clear that she was lovely even in the rudeness of the carving on her throat was the neck belt of bondage doubtless tied shut with a slave knot and fastened to it identifying her the disk of the master how horrifying it is to look upon such a reality so directly how much better it is to deny it or to see it only as through colored glass through the softened tinted lies of civilization he then handed me back the sunglasses do not put them back on he said how angry i was immediately angrily i put them back on continue i said what occurred next in this dream that night of course she said i was captured ruthlessly gagged and bound with black straps for days i was carried into the jungle i began to stink my clothing rotting from my sweat and the heat and humidity began to disintegrate on my body too it was half torn away from snagging on thorns and from the lashings of branches in the beginning i was tied on a pole carried on the shoulders of men then a sack was put over my head and i was thrown on my belly in a canoe then later at some point i did not recognize after i had again been carried into the jungle the sack was removed i was then hands tied behind me marched before my captors i stumbled before them for days when i dallied i was beaten with sticks at last we came to a clearing in the jungle there was a city in this clearing the architecture of the city was identical to that of the ruins we had earlier visited but this city was not in ruins it was a living city populated thriving hidden in the jungle it was not known what had become of the population of the city which had been permitted to fall into ruins no marks of war or fire or other forms of sudden destruction had been discernible meals had apparently been left uneaten and fires untended at a given point perhaps determined by their priests or chiefs for no reason that is clear to us the population it seemed had abandoned the city marching away into the jungles the fate of the population was one of anthropologys mysteries i was thrust toward the city i perhaps alone of all white people now understood or thought i understood what had become of the population of the city which over centuries had fallen into wins they had come here it seemed to this point in the jungle and here had rebuilt their city the numerous individuals red men and women in theft colorful feathers and robes on the walks and terraces of this city maintaining their old way of life it seemed were their living descendants sticks pushed against my back guided me to a narrow doorway leading into a room carved out of living rock in the base of what i took to be a temple there four red girls who were beautiful were awaiting me i was unbound and turned over to the four red girls who treated me with great deference they fed me and gently removing my clothing bathed me they combed my hair and perfumed me i was given golden sandals to wear and a single robe highcollared ornate of brocaded gold my old clothing and my boots which the girls laughing cut to pieces with small knives were burned outside the doorway with large curved knives stood two huge men warriors on guard the blondhaired barbarian looked at me continue i told her that night they came for me she said my hands were tied behind my back then two straps were put on my neck and by two men the girls following i was led forth i was conducted down a long street between mighty buildings men and women followed me with longhandled feathered fans there was much singing there were numerous torches and drums at the end of the street before a group of men standing on the wide steps and the surface of a broad stone platform some ten feet in height we stopped the drums and singing too suddenly stopped a sign was given by one of the men on the height of the platform the straps were removed from my neck my hands were freed i looked up at them another sign was given the girls removed my sandals and then gracefully drew away my robe i looked up again at the men i was now stark naked the man on the height of the platform red in his robes and feathers regarded me for some time then by nodding his head and a simple gesture he indicated his approval there was a shout of pleasure from the crowd which made me shudder my wrists were seized and a long thong was tied on each wrist men then began by these wrist leashes to drag me up the steps the singing and drums had then again commenced no i screamed when i reached the top of the platform for i then saw before me a large oblong piece of stone a massive primitive stone altar discolored with huge stains of dried blood with iron rings no no i screamed but i was lifted from my feet and my back to the ground screaming carried by many men was helplessly hurried to its surface i was thrown on my back on the altar and my hands by the wrist leashes were fastened apart and over my head to iron rings at the same time my legs by the ankles were jerked apart painfully so i felt thongs tied on my ankles i cried out my legs were pulled even more widely apart men strung the thongs on my ankles through the iron rings at the foot of the altar i screamed by the thongs my legs were drawn apart even more i was then as i wept and begged for mercy fastened in that cruel position the ceremony began the priest from a golden dish lifted up a knife it was long and translucent eighteen inches in length of slender bluish stone i twisted on the altar under the torches all about me were the robes and feathers the savage red faces the thongs bit deeply into the flesh of my wrists and ankles the singing the drums began to intensify in crescendo they became deafening the priest lifted the knife it was then that i saw him sitting on an oblong pillar of stone some eight feet in height some forty feet from the altar he was sitting crosslegged watching impassively though he now wore the robes and feathers of this savage people i recognized him instantly it was he who had been the guide of the tour in which i had been a member that tour with which i had been visiting the rums of the mysteriously abandoned city it was he who had explained to me the meaning of the carving of the kneeling girl who had told me not to replace my sunglasses he whom i had disobeyed master i screamed to him master master i asked yes she said i called him master why i asked i do not know she said it startled me that i should have called him that yet the utterance came naturally helplessly from deep within me an irrepressible incontrovertible acknowledgment you called him master i said because in your heart you knew that he was your master yes master she said that is it i suppose i had known from the first instant i had seen him that he was my master and i was his slave but how could i an earth woman have admitted that even to myself let alone to the superb red brute what occurred then in the dream i asked he lifted his hand and spoke out to the priest and the men about the altar i lay there helpless he pointed to me and said something in his own tongue i could tell that it was scornful the priest angrily returned the knife of blue stone to the golden dish others too were angry the thongs at my ankles were cut free my wrist leashes were untied from the iron rings the crowd began to become ugly by a hand on my arm i was thrust from the altar it seemed now they did not want me on the altar i was struck by a man i cowered my wrist leashes were seized by two men and i was dragged before the pillar of oblong stone on which sat he to whom i had called out master the anger of the men and the crowd i suddenly realized was not directed at the red brute sitting upon the stone but startingly frighteningly at mc they were not angry with him for interfering with their ceremony but somehow for no reason i understood with me i shuddered held naked by the wrist leashes before the stone the object of the contempt and wrath the scorn and fury of the multitude i terrified felt their hatred directed upon me almost as though it came in waves why did you not tell us you were a slave he asked of me he spoke in english forgive me master i begged to our gods he said the offer of a contemptible slave would be an insulting sacrifice yes master i said the first time i saw you he said i thought you were a slave yet when i ordered you not to replace your sunglasses you did so forgive me master i said surely you know that any free man has authority over a slave girl he asked yes master i said when you did not obey he said i then thought perhaps that i had been mistaken about you that perhaps you were not a slave but a free woman and thus might serve as a suitable sacrifice to our gods yes master i said my head lowered but as i had originally thought he said you were only a slave yes master i said i did not raise my head when i ordered you not to replace your sunglasses you did so he said yes master i said why he asked forgive me master i said you were disobedient he said yes master i said whip her he said the blondhaired barbarian looked at me continue i said there were two rings before the stone about five feet apart she said they knelt me down kneel down i said precisely as in your dream yes master she said she knelt down my wrist leashes she said were then slipped through the rings the free ends of each in the hands of a standing man it is interesting that that should be in your dream i said it is a device for maintaining a differential tension in the body of a beaten girl it seemed natural she said it is natural i said now place your wrists exactly as they were at the beginning of your beating yes master she said she extended her wrists downward and to the sides what then occurred i asked i was beaten she said how many strokes i asked eleven she said ten for disobedience and one to remind me that i was a slave interesting i said that too is sometimes done yes master she said you will now i said count the strokes and after each count react as you did in your dream yes master she said i observed her the beating in her dream had apparently been quite efficient i studied her facial expressions the movements of her body sometimes under the blows or in fearful anticipation of them she twisted or changed position once sitting sometimes crouching once on her stomach most of the blows were across her back but two had been delivered frontally and two to her left side and one to her right side in all this i was conscious in her movements of how the two men with the wrist leashes tightening or slackening them toyed and played with her as one sometimes does with a slave skillfully managing her in her beating the beating was then finished i said yes master she said apparently you were well beaten i said yes master she said i was well beaten at the end of the beating you well knew that you were a slave i said yes master she said i well knew then that i was a slave what occurred then i asked i cowered kneeling sobbing before my master she said the men then thrust my wrist leashes back through the rings and by means of them dragged me to my feet i looked up at my master piteously searching his face for the least sign of kindness but there was none i was a woman of a foreign and hated race and a slave you are a worthless slave he said yes master i wept he gestured to his right i was dragged to the side by the wrist leashes stumbling i saw before me a circular opening in the stone like a sunken sheersided pool some eight feet in diameter the men went to either side of the pool dragging me by the wrist leashes toward it i heard grunting and movement and stirred water in the pool in the light of lifted torches i saw its contents i screamed in the pool clambering over one another lifting their jaws upward were crocodiles beasts like river tharlarion but differently hided and plated i nodded the marsh tharlarion and river tharlarion of gor are i suspect genetically different from the alligators caymens and crocodiles of earth i suspect this to be the case because these earth reptiles are so well adapted to their environments that they have changed very little in tens of millions of years the marsh and river tharlarion accordingly if descended from such beasts brought long ago to gor on voyages of acquisition by priestkings would presumably resemble them more closely on the other hand of course i may be mistaken in this matter it remains my speculation however that the resemblance between these forms of beasts which are considerable particularly in bodily configuration and disposition may be accounted for by convergent evolution this process alert to the exigencies of survival has i suspect in the context of similar environments similarly shaped these oviparous predators of two worlds certain other forms of gorean beast however i suspect do have an earth origin this seems to be the case with certain birds and rodents and possibly even with an animal as important to the gorean economy as the bosk struggling trying to pull back fighting the wrist leashes screaming inch by inch she said i was drawn toward the pool master master i screamed then i was drawn to the very edge of the pool i looked back wildly over my shoulder sobbing please master i wept have mercy on me master mercy master mercy take pity on a worthless slave the wrist leashes then tightened to plunge me forward into the lifted waiting lunging jaws i threw my head back i do not know from where within me came then that piteous wild cry that i then uttered let me please you i cried he must have given a sign perhaps raising his hand for the wrist leashes tight on my small wrists no longer pulled me forward but neither did they let me move an inch back let your girl try to please you master i cried the girl begs to please her master i could scarcely believe that i had uttered those words i was horrified that i had said them they were the words surely of a slave yet how naturally and spontaneously they had come from me what could it mean i was dragged back before the oblong stone there my wrist leashes were removed i ran terrified to the stone and pressed myself against it i scratched at it with my fingernails and looked up at him do you desire to please your master he asked yes master i said as a slave he asked yes master i said as a slave i looked at him i now knew what the words i had uttered had meant those words which had so horrified me and which yet had come so naturally and spontaneously from me they had meant that i was truly a slave and truly desired to please my master then in my own heart my slavery was well confirmed in me do so he said yes master i said and stepped back from the stone i listened to the noises of the jungle night i threw some more twigs on the fire you understand clearly do you not he asked that if you are not sufficiently pleasing you will be thrown to the crocodiles yes master i said continue i told her i was terrified she said i looked up at the brute i knew that if i were to live i must please him and please him well and as a slave what did you do i asked i moved before him she said as a slave do so now i said precisely in every detail as you did in your dream ah she said how clever you are master how cleverly you have tricked me i regarded her not speaking it is again a matter of female display behaviors is it not she asked of course i said but these behaviors she said would now be extracted from my most intimate and secret dreams i did not speak you are a bold demanding master she said i did not speak do not make a girl so expose her needs she begged the slave girl must honestly expose her needs i said the hypocrisy of the free woman her concealment her subterfuges her lies are not permitted to the female slave oh master she wept miserably are you prepared to perform i asked do not so violate the privacy of a girls dreams she begged you have no privacy i said you belong to me am i not to be permitted the least vestige of my pride she asked no i told her i am a slave she said yes i said i shall now perform for my master she said do so i said and precisely in each and every detail as in your dream yes my master she said she looked at me remember she said that i was forced to do this that i not be hurled to the waiting jaws of crocodiles beasts much like river tharlarion that i not suffer so horrible a fate i knew that i must please him well and as the slave which i had now been proven to be for your very life you performed i said yes master she said as a terrified slave perform i commanded almost instantaneously she seemed transformed i was startled i found myself for the first time partner to a womans dream how vividly she was reenacting the experience nay how intensely was she reliving it i could sense almost the high oblong stone that rude barbaric eminence on which crosslegged sat her master i could almost sense the torches the pool of reptiles to one side the rude altar with its rings in the background i could almost feel and see the savages those red men and women in their ornate robes and feathers in the midst of whom a white beauty freshly enslaved piteously strove to save her life by pleasing her stern red master i watched her perform i marveled i think that no one will ever again be able to lie to me about women how incredibly exciting and marvelous they are what a fool a man is who does not seek and release the deepest slave in them then she was on her belly whimpering scratching at the turf her face pressed against it delicately she extended her tongue and licked a stone then moaning she rolled onto her back and twisted moving her head from side to aide in the dirt before me the firelight was beautiful on her body i think there was no aspect or attitude of her beauty which she had not pleadingly presented before me for my inspection and appraisal then she lay on her back her knees drawn up before me she arched her back her breasts were lifted beautifully i observed their lovely rise and fall correlated with the respiratory cycle of her small lungs then she lay back her shoulders in the dirt and pressing against the earth with her small feet piteously lifted before me for my examination and seizure if i pleased the deep belly of her the sweet cradle of her slaves heat how vulnerable are female slaves i rose to my feet my fists clenched she lay back before me at my feet it was thus she said that i tried to please him i scrutinized from head to toe the naked slave who lay at my feet i could feel my fingernails in the palms of my hand i gritted my teeth i must not now take her she was not yet fully ready one must sometimes be patient with slaves the next time i took her i resolved she would be a wellprepared feast on the occasion of that feast it was my intention to teach the girl who she was truly to free at long last the hidden slave which was her secret self her true self that girl which hitherto had been permitted to emerge only in the disguise of clandestine dreams that piteous girl denied and suppressed who had been for so long so cruelly imprisoned in the dungeon of her mind i would free the secret slave from her dungeon then i would make her mine i would call her janice the girl sat up i sat down crosslegged the fire was now low what then occurred in your dream i asked my master descended then from the height of the great stone she said and with his hand indicated a direction in which i must precede him he followed me with a torch i walked through the city and then coming to a great temple or building with stone steps stopped he indicated i must climb upwards the edifice was constructed of mighty blocks of stone its construction paid tribute to the engineering skills of his people there were mighty carvings on many of the stones i found the building somehow familiar he then directed me to walk to my left and i walked upon one of the broad terraces many feet from the ground which like tiers were integral to the structure of the edifice i had the feeling i had been here before in the light of his torch i could see that many of the carvings were colored the natural hues and pigments not worn away by wind or rain in the daylight the building or temple must be incredibly barbaric and colorful stop he told me i stopped turn and kneel he said i turned about facing him and knelt down on the hard broad stone of the terrace he then lifted the torch to the wall of stone which was at my left i gasped kneeling beside me carved in relief on the great stone was a naked girl it is a likeness of myself i whispered yes he said i could see from the carving and the pigments that the girl was figured like myself and was lightskinned and had yellow hair and blue eyes but she wore a yellow neck belt and i did not i knew then why the building seemed so familiar it was identical to that which in ruins had been visited by our tour and i now knelt as the girl in the carving i had earlier seen had knelt i had this carving prepared he said i ordered it made sending a runner ahead almost the first moment i saw you you had determined then i said that you would have me as your slave of course he said he then placed his torch in an iron rack projecting from the wall on an iron table to the right of the rack there was a flat box lie on your right side exposing your left thigh he said yes master i said from the box he then took a small curved knife and a tiny cylindrical leather flask i gritted my teeth but made no sound with the small knife he gashed my left thigh making upon it a small strange design he then took a powder orange in color from the flask and rubbed it into the wound kneel he said i did so from the flat box he then took a yellow neck belt two inches in height and beaded it is fastened with a thong which ties before the throat say i am a slave i am your slave master he said i am a slave i said i am your slave master he then put the neck belt on me tying it shut with the thong with what i knew must be a slave knot from the box then he took a yellow leather disk which had a small hole possibly drilled with a tiny stone implement near its top there was writing in some barbaric script upon it he threaded an end of the thong through the hole and then using the other end of the thong too knotted the disk snugly at the very base of the collar in the front below my throat he looked down at me you have been knife branded he said the orange mark upon your thigh will be recognized in the jungle for hundreds of miles around if you should be so foolish as to attempt to escape any who apprehend you seeing the mark will return you to the city as a runaway slave yes master i said master i asked did the girl in the carving in the ruined city have such a mark on her thigh it could not have been seen of course for as she knelt it was only her right side which was revealed to the viewer yes he said it has been put upon her i do not understand master i said this is a slaves neck belt he said jerking at the snug collar on my throat i felt it pull against the back of my neck it too he said marks you as a slave you are not permitted to remove it yes master i said the disk of course he said is a personal identificatory device it marks you as an article of my individual property yes master i said master i asked how could you know that the other girl she in the other carving wore upon her thigh a knife brand i put it there he said master i asked recollect clearly the carving said he can you not now recognize the girl in it in spite of the weathering which defaced it in spite of the lengthy ravages of time inflicted upon it master i asked think hard said he consider the matter deeply it was i i whispered and the master he asked standing before me his arms folded you i whispered i felt faint the jungle said he is a strange place even we its people do not fully understand it but the people left the city mysteriously i said perhaps we never left it he said look about you i looked about from the high tier on the temple or building on which i knelt it is the same city i whispered i shuddered i was terrified do you not feel that it is right and fitting that you should be kneeling at my feet he asked yes i whispered master it was a strange feeling the interstices and cycles of time said he are interesting he looked down at me have we not been here before he asked do you not recognize me my fair slave he inquired you are my master i whispered and i have caught you again he said and again put you to my feet i looked up at him trembling then i am an eternal slave i said and you are my eternal master you are an eternal slave he said but you have had many masters as i have had many slaves i looked up at him terrified but you my pretty white woman are one of my favorites you will serve me well and i will get incredible pleasure from you yes master i whispered i knew then that i was an eternal slave and that be was one of my eternal masters he then withdrew from the flat box the last of the objects which it contained a slave whip he thrust it to my mouth and i kissed it stand said he i stood then he looped the whip about me behind me high on my thighs and drew me toward him i felt the stiff gold of his brocaded robes against my breasts he held me so that i could not move i lifted my lips to his the blondhaired barbarian then put down her head and did not speak what happened then i asked she lifted her head and smiled i do not know she said i awakened an interesting dream i said strange i mused that in the dream of a naive earth woman such details should occur details such as the differential tension of the wrist straps in a beating and the extra stroke given sometimes to remind a girl that she is a slave too the kissing of the whip is a quite accurate detail one practiced in many cities but surely a surprising detail to occur in the dream of a girl ignorant of bondage knife branding too practiced by some primitive peoples is quite rare it is strange that you should have heard of it it is a practice of which even many of those involved in cultural studies are ignorant i looked at her you are quite inventive i said perhaps i am an eternal slave she smiled perhaps i said do you believe she asked that there can be warps in time it does not seem likely to me i said but i would not know about such things i am not a physicist do you think she asked that people may have lived before that they may have had many lives and have met one another perhaps time and time again i would not wish to rule out such possibilities i said but such a thing seems to me very unlikely it was an interesting dream she said i conjecture though i do not know i said that the dream was speaking to you not of truths of other worlds and other times but of this world and this time i suspect that the dream in the beautiful allegory of its symbolism was conveying to you not mysterious truths of other realities but concealed truths of your own reality truths which your conscious mind because of its training could not bring itself to recognize with candor what truths she asked that woman in her nature i said is the eternal slave that man in his nature is the eternal master the men of my world she said are not masters they have been crippled i said and it seems are being slowly destroyed not all of them she said perhaps not i said yet if one of them should so much as question the renunciatory and negativistic values with which his brain has been imprinted he will be immediately assailed by the marshaled forces of an establishment jealously presiding over the dissolution of its own culture is it so difficult to detect the failure of public philosophies are unhappiness frustration misery scarcity pollution disease and crime of no interest to those in power i fear the reflex spasm but we were not to blame they will say as they wade in poisoned ashes is there no hope for my world she asked very little i said perhaps here and there men will form themselves into small communities where the names of such things as courage discipline and responsibility may be occasionally recollected communities which in their small way might be worthy of home stones such communities emerging upon the ruins might provide a nucleus for regeneration a sounder more biological regeneration of a social structure one not antithetical to the nature of human beings must my civilization be destroyed she asked nothing need be done i said it is now in the process of destroying itself do you think it will last another thousand years i do not know she said i fear only i said that it will be replaced by a totalitarian superstition uglier than its foolish and ineffectual predecessor she looked down men would rather die than think i said not all men she said that is true i mused in all cultures there are the lonely ones the solitary walkers those who climb the mountain and look upon the world and wonder why is it she asked that the men of gor do not think and move in herds like those of earth i do not know i said perhaps they are different perhaps the culture is different perhaps it has something to do with the decentralization of city states the multiplicity of traditions the diversity of the caste codes i think the men of gor are different she said they are presumably or surely most of them of earth stock i said i think then she said that on the whole it must have been only a certain sort of earth man who was brought to this world what sort i asked those capable of the mastery she said surely there are those of earth i said who are capable of the mastery perhaps she said i do not know stand slave i said yes master she said you have moved well this night slave i said you have well earned a brief rag for your thighs thank you master she said i do not think she could have been more pleased if i had considered allowing her a sheath gown of white satin with gloves and pearls i cut a length from the red bark cloth about five feet in length and a foot in width i wrapped it about the sweetness of her slave hips and tucked it in i pushed it down so that her navel might be well revealed it is called the slave belly on gor only slave girls on gor reveal their navels you make me show the slave belly master she said is it not appropriate i asked yes master she said it is do you like it i asked yes master she said you are a slave arent you i asked yes master she said i liked it too it reveals well the roundness of her belly and low at the hips the beginning of subtle love curves do you understand the meaning of the tuck closing on the skirt i asked master she asked i then rudely tore away the garment spinning her stumbling from me she gasped brutally and suddenly stripped she looked at me frightened again naked before her master do you now understand i asked yes master she said i threw her the garment again hastily she put it on again not neglecting to thrust it well down on her hips that the slave belly would be well revealed excellent slave i said thank you master she said i then reached into a sack near the fire i drew forth from it a handful of strings of beads i threw her a necklace of red and black beads which i thought was nice master she asked pointing may i also have that string of beads tende and alice each had two strings of beads i saw no reason why the blondhaired barbarian might not be similarly ornamented i handed her the second string of beads and put the others back in the sack she had already put the first string that of red and black beads about her throat she looped them twice and still they fell between her lovely breasts one loop longer than the other the second string of beads was blue and yellow both strings were of small simple wooden beads suitable for slave girls master she asked holding out to me the blue and yellow beads would you not please put this string upon me very well i said standing behind her looping them twice one loop smaller than the other about her throat each loop as with the red and black beads fell between her sweet breasts why did you want this string i asked are blue and yellow not the colors of the slavers she asked yes i said blue and yellow are often used for the tenting of slave pavilions and in the decor of auction houses the wagons of slavers often have blue and yellow canvas sometimes they bind their girls with blue and yellow ropes sometimes their girls wear yellowenameled collars and yellowenameled wrist rings and ankle rings with chains with blue links in his best a slaver will usually wear blue and yellow robes or robes in which these colors are prominent he will normally in his daytoday business wear at least chevrons or slashes of blue and yellow on his lower left sleeve are blue and yellow beads then she asked not appropriate for me for i am a slave they are very nice i said but any simple cheap beads say of wood or glass will do as well for a slave i see master she said but may i keep them until i or any free man i said sees fit to take them from you i held her by the upper arms from behind you do not own them i said you only wear them and on the sufferance of free men yes master she said i own nothing it is rather i who am owned yes i said i turned her about to face me you are beginning to feel and understand your slavery arent you i asked yes master she said tonight you taught me much for the first time in my life tonight i moved totally as a woman i do not think i could go back master to moving as a man i held her tightly and looked sternly into her eyes you are not a man i told her you are a woman that is what you are try to understand that you are a woman not a man yes master she sobbed it is thus permissible for you truly to move as a woman and to feel and think and behave like a woman i am a slave she said and yet strangely i am beginning to feel so free you are breaking through the constrictions of a pathological conditioning program i told her i looked at her she trembled go to the slave post i said sit there with your back to the post your hands crossed behind your back yes master she said i took a piece of improvised binding fiber a narrow strip of leather some five feet long and crouched down behind her you freed me of many inhibitions tonight master she said was that your intention perhaps i said i am grateful she said oh she winced as i knotted her hands behind her back i am a woman she said i want to be a woman truly have no fear i said you will be she looked at me gorean men i said do not accept the conceit and pretense of pseudomasculinity in female slaves they would enforce my womanhood upon me she asked you are a slave i said you will be given no choice but to manifest your total womanhood to your master in all its full vulnerability and beauty but then i would have to obey and please them she said yes i said surely they would show me some compromise she said the gorean man i said does not compromise with a female slave if necessary you will learn your womanhood under the whip but what if even then she asked i am not sufficiently pleasing you will then perhaps be fed to sleen i said yes master she said i fastened the free end of the binding fiber to the slave post and stood up i am a secured slave she said yes i said master she said yes i said there was one thing i did not tell you about my dream what was that i asked it is something that you will not understand she said for you are a man what is that i asked it was when i must needs please my master well and as a slave she said yes i said i wanted to please him she whispered of course i said you were desperate to please him for you knew that if you were not pleasing to him you would be cruelly and horribly destroyed but i wanted to please him too for another reason she said what was that i asked you will not understand she said a man could never understand what i asked i wanted to please him she said because he was my master she looked at me a girl can want to please her master she said because he is her master i did not speak can you understand that she asked i shrugged do you think that we would make you such superb slaves if we did not want to he your slaves perhaps not i said a girl desires to please her master she said can you understand that master i think so i said i desire to please you she whispered i see i said master she said yes i said why did you not rape me tonight master she asked am i not pleasing to you later perhaps i said youre training me arent you master she asked yes i said what we saw from the height of the falls tende dances we enter again upon the river i anticipate the surrender of the blondhaired barbarian we thrust the canoe upward kisu and i at the stern ayari and the girls hauling on ropes at the forequarter it tipped up and then settled downward and we thrust and hauled it laden to the level the sound of the falls to our left plunging some four hundred feet to the waters below was deafening it is difficult to convey the splendor of the uas scenery to those who have not seen it there is the mightiness of the river like a great road twisting and turning occasionally broken with green islands sometimes sluggish sometimes shattered by rapids and cataracts sometimes interrupted by flooding cascades of water sometimes a few feet in height and sometimes towering upwards hundreds of feet and then there is the jungle its immensity and wildlife and the vast sky above it i am pleased said kisu happily wiping the sweat from his brow why i asked come here he said be careful i said to him he was wading out into the water come here he called i waded after him some forty or fifty feet out into the current it was only to our knees there look he said pointing from the height of the falls we could see for pasangs behind us downriver it was not only a spectacular but also a marvelous coign of vantage i knew it would be so he cried slapping his thigh in pleasure i looked the hair on the back of my neck rising tende tende called kisu come here now the girl moving carefully waded to where we stood kisu seized her by the back of the neck and faced her downriver see my pretty slave he asked yes my master she said frightened it is he said kisu he is coming for you yes master she said hurry now to the shore he said build a fire prepare food slave yes master she said commanded hurrying from us to address herself to her tasks i looked into the distance downriver half shutting my eyes against the glare from the water downriver several pasangs away small but unmistakable moving in our direction was a fleet of canoes and river vessels there must have been in the neighborhood of a hundred oared river galleys the balance of the fleet which had been prepared for shabas originally projected penetration of the ua and perhaps again as many canoes if there were crews of fifty on the galleys and from five to ten men in a canoe the force behind us must have ranged somewhere between five and six thousand men it is bila huruma shouted kisu in triumph so this is why you accompanied me on the ua i asked i would have come with you anyway to help you for you are my friend said kisu but our ways happily led us the same direction is that not a splendid coincidence yes splendid i smiled you see now what was my plan he asked your mysterious plan i grinned yes he said happily i thought this might be it i said but i think you may have miscalculated i could not in battle beat bila huruma said kisu his askaris were superior to my villagers but now as i have stolen tende his projected companion i have lured him into the jungle i need now only lead him on and on until he is slain in the jungle or until bereft of men and supplies i need only turn back and meet him as man to man as warrior to warrior i looked at him thus said kisu in destroying bila huruma i will destroy the empire it is an intelligent and bold plan i said but i think you may have miscalculated how is that asked kisu do you truly think that bila huruma i asked who owns or is companion to perhaps hundreds of women would pursue you into the jungle at great risk to himself and his empire to get back one girl a girl whom he doubtless realizes has by now been reduced to slavery and has thus been rendered politically worthless and a girl who was never more to him to begin with than a convenience in a minor political situation on the ngao coast yes said kisu it will be a matter of principle for him it might be a matter of principle for you i said but i doubt that it would be a matter of principle for bila huruma there are principles and there are principles for a man such as bila huruma i conjecture that the principle of preserving his empire would take precedence over matters of minor personal concern but bila huruma is on the river said kisu probably i said thus said kisu you are wrong perhaps i said do you think he follows you asked kisu no i said i am unimportant to him thus said kisu it is i whom he follows perhaps i said perhaps you are right kisu then turned and happily waded back to the shore remove your garment said kisu to tende yes master she said follow me he said yes master she said you others may come too he said wading we followed kisu and tende out toward the center of the river there was there overlooking the falls a large flat rock we climbed onto the rock from its surface we could see downriver and pasangs back the flotilla of canoes and galleys of the ubar bila huruma what are you going to do with me master asked tende i am going to dance you naked he said he thrust her forward on the rock facing downriver tende stood there trembling dressed only in her slave beads bila huruma called kisu i am kisu he pointed at the girl this is the woman tende who was to have been your companion i took her from you i made her my slave bila huruma of course if he were with the flotilla as we conjectured could not have heard kisu the distance was too great too had he been within fifty yards he probably could not have heard him because of the roar of the falls moreover so far away was the flotilla i had little doubt but what we could not be seen from its position we could see the flotilla largely because of the size of its galleys and the number of its vessels both canoes and galleys the canoes were almost invisible from where we stood had there been but a single canoe it would have been extremely difficult to detect similarly from the position of the flotilla we would be of course specks upon a larger speck for most practical purposes invisible i had never seen glasses of the builders in the palace of bila huruma shaba however i was sure from anango would possess such an instrument it would make him difficult to approach this is the woman tende called kisu facing his distant enemy shouting against the roar of the falls pointing to tende she was to have been your companion i took her away from you i made her mine i now exhibit her naked before you as my slave he cannot see you or hear you shouted ayari that does not matter laughed kisu he gave tende a happy slap below the smell of the back oh she cried dance tende said he he began to sing and clap looking downriver that is a slave song she cried he stopped clapping and singing and regarded her there are white slaves present master she cried he looked upon her sternly i dance my master she cried frightened she flexed her legs freeing her body to move and extended her arms gracefully to the right the right arm further advanced than the left is she free asked ayari no said kisu have her put her arms over her head wrists back to back said ayari do so said kisu tende complied how lovely that is said kisu i have seen it done in schendi said ayari it is one of the ways in which a slave may begin a dance i smiled to myself that was true the lovely posture which tende had just assumed was undeniably one of the initial postures of certain slave dances it is widely known on gor of course not just in schendi it is for example quite familiar in port kar and far to the southeast of that port and somewhere far to the north and east of our present position in the tahari slave dances of course may begin in dozens of ways sometimes even with the girl roped or chained at a mans feet i looked at tende to be sure only a slave dance could begin from such a posture no free woman for example would dare to place herself in such a position before gorean free men unless perhaps weary of her misery and frustration she was begging them almost explicitly to put her in a collar there are many stories of gorean free women sometimes of high caste who as a lark or in a spirit of bold play dared to dance in a paga tavern often perhaps to their horror they found themselves that very night hooded and gagged locked in close chains lying on their back their legs drawn up fastened in a wagon chained by the neck and ankles their small bodies bruised on its rough boards as they helpless beneath a rough tarn blanket are carried through the gates of their city are you ready slave asked kisu yes master said tende i am fond of slave dances it is hard for a woman to be more beautiful than when she dances her beauty as a slave before masters but then a woman can be incredibly beautiful in almost all attitudes and postures it is strange that the men of earth are so seldom aware of the subtler beauties of women but then they have not seen them in their full femininity as slaves a woman can be very beautiful simply greeting her master head down at the door to his chambers she can be very beautiful in doing so small a thing as pouring his wine eyes downcast gracefully as his slave perhaps she is a bit more beautiful however when she kneels helplessly before you or lies piteously at your feet supplicating you to satisfy her slave needs perhaps she is most beautiful when she collared in your arms cries out in orgasm acknowledging you as her master dance slave said kisu yes master said tende tende then obedient to her masters command as kisu clapped his hands and sang danced on a flat rock in the ua river danced before bila huruma so far away her masters enemy from whom she had been stolen she danced well i observed the eyes of the blondhaired barbarian who with alice knelt on the rock the eyes of the blondhaired barbarian gazing on the exhibited slave shone with excitement how beautiful tende was and how stimulating it was to the blondhaired barbarian to realize that a man could force a woman to do this sort of thing kisu continued to clap his hands he continued to sing the strains of a melodic slave song dancers bring high prices on gor some slavers specialize in dancers renting them and buying and selling them two such houses in ar are those of kelsius and aurelius some say that the finest dancers on gor are found in ar others say that they are found in port kar and others that they are in the tahari or in tuna these controversies i think are fruitless i have been in many cities and in each i have found marvelous dancers the matter is further complicated by the buying and selling of girls and their shipment as merchandise among cities a dancer has usually had many masters her fair throat has been graced by many collars in some cities if a dancer is not thought to have been sufficiently pleasing she is thrown to the patrons of the tavern to be torn to pieces or beaten if she is thought to have been sufficiently pleasing she may be auctioned for the period of an ahn to the highest bidder enough called kisu happily tende stopped dancing he then to her surprise with a leather strap as she stood on the rock overlooking the falls tied her hands behind her back he then took her by the hair bent her over and waded her back to the shore we followed him i stopping to look once more downriver at the tiny objects so far away yet objects i knew to be filled with men kisu and i thrust the canoe into the shallow water as i held it he placed tende on her knees in the canoe he then crossed and tied her ankles he then took two lengths of rope he tied them both on her neck and then took the free end of one and tied it to a thwart forward of her position and the free end of the other and tied it to the thwart aft of her position thus fastening her between these two thwarts master she asked that should hold you he said that was an understatement kisu tied well why are you placing me under such great security master she asked bila huruma is now behind us he said you will not now go running back to him she put back her head and laughed oh master she protested what is wrong he asked i do not wish to run away from you she said oh he asked she looked at him do you not know by now my master she asked that tende is your conquered slave no chances will be taken with you slave he said as my master wishes she said putting her head down i saw then as i think that kisu did not that the proud tende who had been so haughty and cold was now naught but a surrendered love slave i smiled to myself she was now indeed politically worthless what of the remains of the fire asked ayari should we not dispose of such evidence of this brief encampment no said kisu leave it but it will mark our trail said ayari of course said kisu it is my intention that it do so we then moved the canoe wading beside it with the exception of tende fastened within it out into the river kisu waist deep in the water turned to lock back over the falls he lifted his fist and shook it follow me bila huruma he cried follow me bila huruma if you dare his voice was almost indistinguishable against the roar of the waters he then lowered his fist and slipped into the canoe taking his place at the stern ayari and alice entered the canoe i then slipped into the canoe and taking the blondhaired barbarian under the arms drew her into the canoe i did not immediately release her she turned her head back over her left shoulder did you see it she asked on the rock he danced her naked of course i said she is only a slave yes master said the blondhaired barbarian like yourself i said yes master she said i then thrust her ahead of me to her place take your plane slave girl i said yes master she said we then lifted our paddles and lent our strengths to the task at hand once she looked back at me but my stern gaze warned her to direct her attention again to her work and the river i smiled to myself i saw that the slave girl in her was now well ready to be released this very night i thought she would beg explicitly for her masters touch the blondhaired barbarian dances what occurred in the rain forest between a master and his slave watch out i said the tarsk a small one no more than forty pounds tasked snorting bits of leaf scattering behind it charged it swerved slashing with its curved tusks and i only man aged to turn it aside with the point of the raiders spear i carried one of four such weapons we had had since our brief skirmish with raiders that in which we had obtained our canoe that which had occurred in the marsh east of ushindi it had twisted hack on me with incredible swiftness the blondhaired barbarian screamed i thrust at it again again it spun and charged again i thrust it back there was blood on the blade of the spear and the animals coat was glistening with it such animals are best hunted from the back of kaiila with lances in the open they are cunning persistent and swift the giant tarsk which can stand ten hands at the shoulder is even hunted with lances from tarnback it snuffled and snorted and again charged again i diverted its slashing weight one does not follow such an animal into the bush it is not simply a matter of reduced visibility but it is also a matter of obtaining free play for ones weapons even in the open as i was in a clearing among trees it is hard to use ones spear to its best advantage the animal stays so close to you and moves so quickly suddenly it turned its short wide head with that bristling mane running down its back to its tail get behind me i called to the girl it put down its head mounted on that short thick neck and scrambling charged at the blondhaired barbarian she stumbled back screaming and the animal at her legs fell but in that moment from the side i thrust the animal from her it immediately turned again i thrust it again to the side this time suddenly before it could turn again i with a clear stroke thrust the spear through its thickset body behind the right foreleg i put my head back breathing heavily pressing against the animal with my foot i freed the spear i turned to the blondhaired barbarian are you all right i asked yes she said there was blood on her left leg on the outside of the leg about six inches up from the ankle i crouched down beside her give me your leg i said i looked at the leg she sat on the floor of the rain forest her leg felt good in my hands is it serious master she asked no i said it is nothing it is only a scratch she had been fortunate it will not leave a scar will it she asked no i said that is good she said she leaned back in relief bracing her body on the palms of her hands i want to be pretty she said both for myself and for my master or masters you are pretty i said indeed in the past few weeks you have become even beautiful thank you master she said she looked at me im yours you know she said of course i said yet you have not taken me since schendi she said that is true i said you made me yield well to you there and as a full slave she said i did not speak and when you threw me on my back head down over your sea bag and raped me with such brutal dispatch i well learned that i was no longer a free woman it is a useful lesson for a slave girl to learn quickly i said and i remember the girl i saw there briefly in the mirror she was so beautiful yes i said but she was so beautiful she could be only a slave yes i said but i am an earth woman she said i could not dare to be that girl i smiled did she not realize that she had seen in schendi in those brief moments the slave she had for so long concealed within herself that she had seen then frightened scarcely daring to recognize her her own self what cruelties could men inflict upon women i wondered which could half compare with those they inflict upon themselves she leaned forward and examined the wound on her leg it is superficial i said it will not scar i have a slaves vanity dont i she asked yes i said is it permissible she asked yes i said good she said she continued to look at the wound on her leg i do not think i could stand to bring a lower price than tende or alice she said what a slave you are i said yes master she said have no fear i said your value on the sales block has not been reduced thank you master she said i then rose to my feet and walked a few yards away to a fan palm from the base of one of its broad leaves i gathered a double handful of fresh water i returned to the girl and carefully washed out the wound she winced i then cut some leaves and wrapped them about it i tied shut this simple bandage with the tendrils of a carpet plant thank you master she said she reached up and put her arms about my neck i took her hands and slowly pulled them from my neck i put them to her sides she looked at me i cuffed her snapping her head to the right master she asked next time i said stay behind me yes master she said stand slave i said yes master she said it had been this morning shortly before noon that we had surmounted the height of the falls that almost on the summit of which kisu in the face of the distant oncoming forces of bila huruma had danced a naked slave called tende i went over to the slain tarsk we had then continued on up the river for several hours in the late afternoon we had brought the canoe to shore concealed it and then went inland to make our camp i feel the desire for meat had said kisu i too i said i will hunt kisu and i warriors wanted meat too ahead of us we suspected that the river as we had been warned at the last village would become ever more dangerous and treacherous we felt the longterm strength of meat protein would be a useful addition to our diets i will need a beast of burden i had said the blondhaired barbarian immediately had sprung to her feet she had stood before me her head down i am a beast of burden she had said follow me i had said yes master she had said i lifted up the wild tarsk we had proceeded into the rain forest for better than two ahn before we had come upon the tarsk it had charged i had killed it bend down i told the girl i threw the tarsk across her shoulders she staggered under its weight i then turned from her and left the clearing my hands were free for the use of the spear gasping behind me stumbling staggering under the weight of the tarsk i had killed came my slave i looked upward through the trees it is growing dark i said we will not have time to reach the encampment before nightfall we will make a small camp in the forest and proceed in the morning yes master she said as the girl on her knees tended the roasting tarsk i cut a long stake some four and one half feet in length and some four inches in width about its top about two inches from the end i cut a groove about an inch deep what is that for she asked it is a slave stake i said for securing you for the night i see she said she turned the tarsk on its spit it glistened from its sides droplets of fat and blood popping and sizzling dropped into the fire with a large rock blow by blow heavily inch by inch i drove the long thick stake into the ground i left about four inches of it exposed the tarsk is ready she said i took one end of the spit in two hands and lifted the tarsk from the fire putting it down on leaves i then crouched beside it and began to cut into it to the spit i looked up the girl kneeling by the fire watched me i rose to my feet i tied a long leather strap on her neck and led her to the slave stake i tied the free end of the strap about the slave stake using the prepared groove in the stake which i had earlier cut kneel i told her yes master she said she then knelt there tethered to the stake by the neck i ha left her about seven feet of slack in the strap i then returned to the meat and began to cut slices from it and feed after i had begun to feel full i looked at the girl i threw her a piece of meat which struck against her body it fell to the ground she picked it up in two hands and watching me began to eat it after a time i wiped my face with my forearm i was finished eating i again looked at the girl do you want more i asked no master she said we had drunk earlier from the water cupped at the base of the leaves of fan palms i then lay on one elbow near the fire i regarded the beautiful slave it is pleasant to own women are you going to tie my hands behind my back before you retire she asked yes i told her that is common in slave security isnt it she asked it is common in the open i said when one does not have cages or chains and slave bracelets at ones disposal a girls hands of course need not be tied behind her back they might be tied over her head or before her body usually about a small tree are girls secured at night in the cities she asked sometimes i said sometimes not they are collared the cities are walled where would they run to but not all girls wish to escape do they she asked no i said all the evidence supports the thesis that very few girls desire to escape their masters slavery apparently agrees with them but all girls whether they wish to escape or not know that escape is almost impossible besides if they should escape they would doubtless soon fall to another master perhaps worse than the first yes master she said too i said i am not certain that it is altogether wise for a girl to attempt to escape for example if she is caught her feet may be cut off i would be afraid to try to escape master she said you tried to escape in port kar i said i had caught her and tied her and returned her to ulafi who had been at that time her master i had wanted her shipped to schendi that i might by means of her following her sales and exchanges be led to the lairpf the treacherous shaba traitor to priestkings i did not even begin to understand at that time she said what might be involved the almost total impossibility of escape and the drastic nature of the penalties which gorean men might without a second thought so casually inflict upon me i did not even begin to understand at that time what it might mean to be a slave girl on gor but you understand a little of what it might mean now dont you i asked yes master she said kneeling there by the slave stake the tether tied on her throat she fingered the tether if i had known then what i now know she said i would not have dared to move i nodded i would have been afraid she smiled wryly to have moved even so much as a muscle for fear one of ulafis men would have put me under the lash of course i said intelligent women learned swiftly the realities of gor master she said yes i said not all masters would secure their slaves at night would they even in the open no i said much depends on the girl and the area a master would not be likely to secure a conquered love slave would he she asked he might i said if only to remind her that she is a slave i see she said there is another reason too for securing a slave at night i said for example for locking her in her kennel or if she is to be kept outofdoors chaining her to a ring in your courtyard what is that she asked to keep her from being stolen i said we could be stolen couldnt we she said she trembled of course i said slave theft is not unknown on gor i have heard she said that girls are often chained at night to slave rings at the foot of their masters couches that is true i said but surely there is little danger she said of a girl being stolen from her masters compartments not while he is there i admitted then why are they chained like that she asked because they are slaves i said yes master she said putting her head down it is nearly time to tie you for the night i said oh please master she said lifting her head let me speak but a moment more with you do not tie your slave just now very well i said she knelt back happily on her heels she put her hands on the tether at her throat wasnt it horrifying she asked what kisu did to tende today what i asked making her dance naked she said no i said oh she said she is a slave i reminded her yes master she said she looked at me it is permissible for a slave to dance naked she asked yes i said she looked down master she said yes i said am i a slave object she asked of course i said and a very delicious one i added thank you master she said does it trouble you to be an object i asked i do not feel like an object she said technically i said in the eyes of gorean law you are not an object but an animal i see she said in one sense i said no living human being nor bird nor squirrel can be an object they are not for example tables or rocks in another sense all living creatures are objects for example they occupy space and obey the laws of physics and chemistry you know what i mean she said no i said i do not speak more clearly a woman is treated like an object she said when men do not listen to her or care for her feelings surely women in the singleminded pursuit of certain goals can treat other women and men in that way i asked and men could treat men in that way and so on is not the problem you have in mind a rather general one perhaps she said similarly i said do not confuse being treated as an object with being an object similarly do not confuse being treated as an object with being regarded as an object for example individuals who treat human beings as objects very seldom think that they are really objects that would suggest insanity you do not respond properly she smiled is your criterion for being treated as an object that men do not agree with you i asked if so that is somewhat obtuse i suppose perhaps it is she said if men do not do what we want then they so to speak have not listened to us or paid attention to our feelings that is a very interesting way of thinking i admitted by the same token if women did not pay close attention to the wishes of men and comply with their desires then men might be entitled to regard themselves as being treated as objects how silly she said yes i said it is hard to talk with you about these things she said i think so i said you are not familiar with the slogans she said that is perhaps it i admitted i shall try again she said do so i encouraged her men she said are only interested in womens bodies i have never known a man who was only interested in a womans body i said this is not to deny that some such unusual person might somewhere exist she looked at me if what you say is true i said it would be the case that it would make no difference to a man whether the woman with whom he was relating was conscious or not indeed if what you say is true it should not even make a difference to him whether he held a sentient woman in his arms or an unconscious mechanism designed to resemble such a woman i submit with all due respect that that is not only libelous but preposterous surely no rational person male or female if they took a moment to reflect could entertain so peculiar a hypothesis no man with whom i am familiar would be content with a woman who lacked consciousness that sort of thing is simply stupid it seems to me it would even have limited propaganda value the men of earth can be confused and terrorized by such assertions she said some perhaps i said idiots perhaps she said but such assertions can be politically effective yes i agreed the trick is to make a charge so obviously false or hopelessly vague that your interlocutor who is usually concerned to be polite and congenial makes a fool of himself trying to treat it seriously it is a little like the fellow who tries to respond to the charge that he is a mad sleen by discussing the results of his blood tests perhaps what is meant she said is that men do not pay sufficient attention to the thinking and feelings of women that is a totally different charge i said and one that may well be true she looked at me it is a common property of human beings i said that they for better or for worse do not pay much attention to the thoughts and feelings of others thus it would not be surprising if most men did not pay much attention to the thoughts and feelings of women if it is any consolation they do not pay much attention to the thoughts and feelings of other men either similar remarks of course hold for women many women for example are excellent in not listening to others no one sex has a monopoly on dogmatism i looked at her if you are interested in this sort of thing from the gorean viewpoint i said free men and women are usually attentive to the thoughts and feelings of one another not only are they free but they may even share a home stone free women in being free command attention when they speak it is their due the case with slaves such as you my dear is of course much different the difference however is that respect and attention is not due to you that it need not be accorded to you you are slave in actual practice of course masters tend to pay a great deal of attention to the thoughts and feelings of their lovely slaves it is rewarding and delicious to do so how wonderful it is to know another human being so intimately especially one one owns there are no secrets between masters and slaves her deepest thoughts and desires as well as her most trivial fancies and observations are open to him and because he owns her of great interest to him a man is much more likely to be intensely fond of a girl he owns than of a free individual toward whom he stands in a mere contractual relationship the latter he does not own the former he does the owned girl is a valuable she is precious this makes her much different from a business partner for what it is worth the most intimate and deepest loves i have know have been between masters and their slaves that between the love master and his love slave but the woman is still a slave she said yes i said totally and categorically she may even be sold if he wills the attention and love such a girl obtains she said need not be accorded to her no i said it is a gift of the master he could at any point she said simply order her to silence and put her to his feet of course i said and sometimes he will if only to remind her that she is a slave she is then for all her freedom yet absolutely under his will yes i said she is his slave i love you master she whispered i listened to the crackling of the fire and the sounds of the jungle night as an earth woman i said you are doubtless not accustomed to thinking of yourself as an article of property no master she smiled but i think now i said that you may be ready to understand the sense in which you are a slave object yes master she said tears in her eyes you are a beautiful woman who is owned i said you may be bought and sold yes master she said too i said not the least attention need be paid to your desires your thoughts or feelings yes master she said that is mainly what it is to be a slave object i said i understand my master she said you see i said it has nothing to do with consciousness or feelings i acknowledge the justice of the expression she said but somehow it seems quite inapt perhaps you will not think so i said when you are put in chains and sold to a master who terrifies you no master she smiled why do you feel the expression is inapt i asked because i do not feel like an object she said never have i been so alive so excited and so vital or have i felt so significant and real as when i have been a slave never in the constrictions of my freedom could i have understood such experiences to exist as i have felt on this world as a lowly slave i had not dreamed such happiness could exist i did not know i could experience such joy perhaps i should whip you i said please no master she said be merciful to your girl i shrugged i determined that i would not whip her at least at the moment so you see master she said though in some respects i am a slave object an article of property that may be bought and sold a thing whose desires whose thoughts and feelings need not be in the least respected in another sense that of feeling and emotion i am so far removed from the notion of an object that the use of such an expression is totally inadequate to convey the least understanding of my felt realities i was far more of an object a thing manipulated by the internalized demands of others a thing not daring to feel a thing not daring to be true to itself when i was free than i am now a slave girl in the uncompromising shackles of your bondage i concede i smiled for most practical purposes the expression slave object is not well chosen to express the realities involved indeed for most practical purposes the expression is not only misleading and infelicitous but as you have pointed out inapt you see she said in some respects i am an object and in other respects i am not an object yes i said and in the deepest respects you are not an object yes master she smiled i looked at her kneeling there before me the bit of bark cloth at her hips the two necklaces one red and black one blue and yellow about her throat my tether knotted on her throat fastening her to the slave stake but you are a slave animal i said yes master she smiled i am a slave animal it is time to tie you for the night my pretty slave animal i said the animal begs that you not tie her just now she said very well i said i looked at her i reclined on my elbow she knelt most slave girls you have told me she said do not desire to escape that is apparently true i said that is strange isnt it i asked i do not find it strange she said oh i asked i do not want to escape she said you will be tied anyway i told her of course master she smiled master she said yes i said animals have needs she said what sorts of needs i asked many sorts she said sexual i asked yes she said she put her head down her lip trembled look at me slave i told her she looked at me there were tears in her eyes do you admit that you have sexual needs i asked yes master she sobbed is your admission merely intellectual i asked no master she said it is deeper than that the intellectual admission that one possesses sexual needs is cheap it is well within the range of even the clever bigot that sort of admission automatic expected and innocuous serves often not only in lieu of an authentic emotional admission but serves often too as a psychological device whereby just such an honest concession to the needs of ones deeper nature may be avoided do you have sexual needs truly i asked yes she said and do you wish them satisfied i asked yes she said say then aloud i said i have sexual needs truly i am a woman of earth she protested please do not make me say that say it i said i have sexual needs she said truly say now i said i want them satisfied i want them satisfied she said say i said i will never again deny my sexual needs i will never again deny my sexual needs she said say i said i will be such and behave in such a way as to attempt to secure the satisfaction of my deepest and most honest sexual needs i will be such and behave in such a way she said as to attempt to secure the satisfaction of my deepest and most honest sexual needs she looked at me even though they might be those of a slave she asked even though they might be those of a slave i said even though they might be those of a slave she said even though they are those of a slave i said even though they are those of a slave she repeated say now i said i am a slave i am your slave master i am a slave i am your slave master she said she looked at me i cannot believe how i feel she said i am so incredibly happy master i nodded i sensed then that the locks on the dungeon door had been opened that the bolts had been slid back then she put down her head i am a girl in need she said i beg the touch of my master look at me i said and speak clearly she lifted her head i am a girl in need she said boldly i beg the touch of my master i smiled and she reddened she had now at last explicitly begged for my touch the hands of the small naked slave girl hidden in the dungeon crouching on the damp narrow stone stairs pressed upward against the iron door which had been bolted shut above her it moved a quarter of an inch upward and did not strike against its familiar bolts the bolts had been withdrawn she trembled and sobbed fearing to be the victim of some cruel trick she thrust harder against the iron door above her an inch of light narrow and straight almost blinded her she put down her head then again she thrust upward against the weight she sobbed in misery her small strength might not be sufficient to lift the door to thrust it back she struggled then slowly inch by inch she pressing upward the door began to open she could feel the stone of the stairs hard under her bare feet her muscles ached there was a heavy sound from the protesting thick hinges she cried out thrusting upward the door then suddenly opened suddenly swinging back falling away from her there was a clang of iron on stone fearing to move blinded by the sunlight she knelt trembling on the stairs she did not lift her head above the level of the opened door perhaps she feared that her mistress janice prentiss would come and whip her and put her back in the dungeon but did not her mistress know that it was she herself who was the lovely frightened slave did she not know that it would be only she herself who would feel the blows of such a whip or she herself who would see again the iron door of the dungeon close above her head the blondhaired barbarian my tethered slave looked at me and smiled i am ready to please you in any way that you might see fit master she said i reclined on one elbow watching her command me she said i do not i said master she asked if you desire to please me i said you may do so i accord you my permission but i am an earth woman she said are you not going to order me no i said surely you do not expect me an earth woman to please a man i mean really please him of my own free will she asked i smiled it is a startling thought i admitted she smiled do you want to please me i asked yes master she said you may then do so if you wish i said but i am a slave she said yes i said but are slaves not commanded she asked not always i said it is strange she said i never thought that in all my life i would kneel before a man and tell him that i was ready to please him in any way he saw fit now i have done so and he does not command me perhaps if you wish i said you might please me in some way that you see fit but i am a slave she said precisely i said you know dont you she asked that i want to please you as a slave of course i said that is natural you are a slave command me she begged no i said but i am an earth woman she said not really any longer i said you are now a gorean slave girl yes master she said she rose lightly to her feet she lifted the tether away from the slave stake the tether knotted on her throat fastened at the other end to the slave stake was about seven feet in length i watched her i have sexual needs she said and i want to please my master i shrugged she looked down at the slave stake i note that this night she said you did not fasten me to a small tree as to a slave post but that you prepared a slave stake she then lifted the tether i note too master she said that this tether is somewhat longer than would be needful to secure a miserable slave you are a highly intelligent woman i said that makes it all the more pleasant to own you you knew what i would want to do didnt you she asked of course i said suddenly she put her head in her hands sobbing i dare not she wept i dare not command me command me no i said i did not hurry her in time she took her hands from her face and wiped away her tears tie me for the night she begged very well i said no she said no very well i said she straightened herself she smiled her eyes were moist what i am now going to do she said i do fully and completely of my own free will i have sexual needs i shall exhibit the desperation of these needs before my master in the hope that he will take pity on me and satisfy them it is also a girls hope that in what she does her master will not find her fully displeasing she then gently removed the bark skirt from her hips and dropped it to the side she then flexed her knees and lifted her hands the backs of the wrists facing one another gracefully over her head wait i said master she asked have you begged to perform i asked no master she said you may now do so i said i beg to perform before my master she said very well i mid you may do so thank you master she said she then danced before me of her own free will a girl in need and one desiring to please her master her dance grew ever more desperate and at times i had to throw her from me then she lay at the slave stake she held out a hand to me i went to her and seized her by the upper arms and threw her to her feet she looked at me frightened you did not do badly slave girl i said but now it is time for you to learn how to truly dance before a man master she cried in misery be as you were i told her immediately frightened she stood again before me knees flexed hands raised above her head gracefully the backs of her wrists facing one another in one of the attitudes of the slave dancer i jerked the tether on her throat this is a tether i said it is to be well incorporated in your dance you are a tethered slave do not forget it you may fight the tether you may love it it may confine your body you may use it to caress your body an invitation to your master a surrogate symbol of his domination of you you need not dance always on your feet a woman can dance beautifully on her knees moving as little as a hand or on her back or belly or side in all things do not forget that you are a slave are you now commanding me to dance before you she asked yes i said you dance now as a commanded slave and if i am not well pleased have no fear but what you will be well beaten if not slain yes master she said i then stepped back from her when i clap my hands i said you will dance slave yes master she said i then struck my hands together and terrified the girl danced she had not been taught the tether dance one of the most beautiful of the slave dances of gor but she improvised well indeed it was hard to believe that she had not had training i am inclined to believe that the need dances and display dances of the human female may be at least in their rudiments instinctual i suspect there is a genetic disposition in the woman toward this type of behavior and that certain of the movements closely associated with luring behavior and love movements may also be genetically based one reason for supposing this to be the case is that a girls growth in certain forms of dance skills does not follow a normal learning curve it is rather like the human beings ability to acquire speech which also does not follow a normal learning curve it seems reasonably likely that facility in acquiring speech which would have enormous survival value has been selected for similarly a womans marvelous adaptability to erotic dance may possibly have been selected for at any rate whatever the truth may be in these matters feminine women perhaps to the horror of their more masculine sisters seem to take naturally to the beauties of erotic dance at the very least perhaps inexplicably they are marvelously good at it these genetic dispositions of course if they exist can be culturally suppressed i watched the girl dance she was quite good the needs of human beings are a matter of biology the values in a culture are the values of certain men many people take the values of their culture for granted as though they were somehow a part of the furniture of the universe they should realize that the values they are taught are the values of particular men and often unfortunately of men who long ago were shortlived ignorant uninformed unhealthy and quite possibly of unsound mind perhaps human beings should from the viewpoints of contemporary information and modern medicine reevaluate these perhaps anachronistic value structures values need not be something one somehow mysteriously knows a result of having forgotten the conditioning process by means of which they were instilled but could be something chosen something selected as instruments by means of which to improve human life it is not wrong for human beings to be happy now you are becoming a woman i told her she knelt on one knee her right her left leg was flexed the tether was taken in a turn about her left thigh her hands too were on her left thigh her head was down but turned toward me her lip trembled continue to dance slave i told her yes master she said i watched her and marveled it is interesting to note that such movements those of slave dances despite the inhibitions of rigid cultures may occur in a girls sleep and may even occur almost spontaneously when she nude alone passes before a mirror in her bedroom how shocked she may be to suddenly see her body move as that of a slave could it have been she who so moved later perhaps to her surprise she finds herself standing before the mirror she is naked and alone then perhaps scarcely understanding what is occurring within her she sees the girl in the mirror has begun to dance the movements are not dissimilar perhaps to those of women who thousands of years ago danced in firelit caves before their masters then knowing well that it is she herself who is the dancer she dances brazenly boldly before the mirror well does she present her bared beauty before it in the movements the attitudes and postures of the female slave then perhaps she falls to the rug scratching at it pressing her belly to it i want a master she whispers i now stood up my arms were folded the girl now was upon her knees at my feet the tether on her neck slung back behind her to the slave stake still in her dance she began to lick and kiss at my body i then took her by the upper arms and held her half lifted from her knees before me please do not whip me she begged i then by the upper arms dragged her to the side of the slave stake i put her on her knees there she looked up at me you danced well as a slave i said thank you master she said she looked up at me trembling what are you i asked a slave she said fully and only a slave i asked she regarded me her entire body began to shake the secret slave in her then was summoned forth she crept from the dungeon into the sunlight she knelt then on the gravel of the courtyard small and beautiful and naked at the feet of masters yes master said the blondhaired barbarian i am fully and only a slave then suddenly she threw back her head and sobbed with joy then she put her head to my knees and holding them covered them with kisses then she put her head to my feet she covered them too with kisses i felt her hair on my feet i felt the hot tears of her joy yes she whispered i am fully and only a slave the secret slave i saw was then free of her dungeon never again could she be put back in it the blondhaired barbarian raised her head tears were in her eyes the secret slave too had raised her head tears too had been in her eyes thank you master said the blondhaired barbarian thank you master had breathed the secret slave you are my slave i said to the blondhaired barbarian i took her by the hair i looked into her eyes you are the slave of men i said yes my master she said the secret slave then knelt joyfully in the sunlit courtyard on the cruel gravel she kissed the steel collar thrust to her lips she closed her eyes joyfully as it was locked upon her small fair throat she wore then locked upon her neck that for which she had yearned in the long years of her imprisonment the sweet liberating uncompromising collar of public bondage i am free breathed the blondhaired barbarian at last i am free beware how you speak slave i said yes master she said she looked up at me tears in her eyes i feel so free she said in a sense you are free and in a sense you are not free i said the sense or one of the senses in which you are free i said is the sense of emotional freedom you a slave have now honestly admitted to yourself in your own heart fully that you are truly a slave this eliminates conflicts this produces a sense of emotional joy and fulfillment you are now at peace with yourself you are now content with yourself the sense in which you are not free is an obvious one you are a slave totally and are fully at the mercy of your master or masters yes master she said i seized her hair and twisted her head to the side cruelly oh she cried do you think you are free i asked no master she wept i released her i crouched back a bit watching her she lifted her head i am very happy she said i did not speak i love being under the total domination of a male she said i moved more closely to her i took her by the upper arms crouching near her did i please my master by my dancing she asked yes i said how can i please my master more she asked i then by her upper arms my grip tight upon them pressed her gently but forcibly backwards she then lay beside the thick slave stake her shoulder blades in the dirt the tether was still upon her throat yes master she whispered i have never been so happy before in my life as this night master she whispered she lay on her side her back to me i tied her hands behind her back you are janice i told her naming her thank you master she said putting her head back i had used her several times during the night and several times she had squirming in the helpless throes of the slave orgasm screamed and sobbed herself mine i had not known such sensations could exist she had said they are attainable only by the slave i told her they are the surrender and submission spasms of the owned woman the girl who must yield absolutely and totally holding nothing back to her master i see master she had said they cannot in the nature of things be attained by the free woman i said for she is her own mistress not the slave of a master yes master had said the girl did you like them i asked i loved them she said do you like being a slave i asked i love it she said then she had said please master rape me again and i had done so i checked the knots on her wrists the girl was secured thank you for naming me janice she said it is a pretty name i said and it will give me a means by which to summon you when i wish you to fetch and serve yes master she said then she turned about to lie on her right side to face me her hands were tied behind her back i love wearing that name as a slave name she said i looked at her it was the name of that girl on earth whom i was she laughed that pretentious foolish little slut so haughty and smug so proud of herself so concerned to deny that anyone so lofty as herself could possibly be a slave it gives me great pleasure to see that her master now puts her own name on her and forces her to wear it openly and publicly as a slave name the name janice i said apart from such considerations is a beautiful name for a slave i will try to be worthy of it she said if you are not i said it may be soon changed yes master she said a free womans name of course tends to remain constant a gorean free woman does not change her name in the ceremony of the free companionship she remains who she was in such a ceremony two free individuals have elected to become companions the earth woman as a consequence of certain mating ceremonials may change her last name the first and other names however tend to remain constant from the gorean point of view the wife of earth occupies a status which is higher than that of the slave but lower than that of the free companion the case with slaves of course is much different from that of free women either those of gor or earth their names are simply given to them as the names of animals they may be altered or changed at will indeed sometimes a slave is not even given a name the names a slave wears of course are functions of the masters pleasure they can own a name no more than they can own anything else it is they who are owned some masters have favorite names for girls some masters may reward a hardworking girl with a lovely name others may torment a slave who has been insufficiently pleasing with a cruel or ugly name most girls of course are given beautiful and exciting slave names for the masters wish the girl too to be beautiful and exciting she is after all a slave what names count as being beautiful and exciting of course is partly a cultural matter for example many women of earth might be astonished to learn that their names which they may regard as simple or common names such as jane or alice are found extremely beautiful to the gorean ear to be sure the gorean commonly alters the pronunciation somewhat to conform with phonemic variations with which he is more familiar further as i may have mentioned many earthgirl names are found extremely provocative to the gorean male this probably has to do with emotive connotations resulting from his familiarity with such girls in his markets such names may suggest to him usually correctly that their lovely bearer is going to be an unusually helpless and delicious slave i once saw a girl in her chains dragged from the very market block and raped in the aisle for no other reason apparently than that the auctioneer had mentioned that her name was helen needless to say a slave girl as she changes collars may change names most girls in passing from the hands of one master into those of another will have had various names the name janice on gor is a slave name isnt it asked the girl yes i said do you object no master she said i find that delicious and wholly appropriate she leaned to me her hands tied behind her back and kissed me gently let us rest now slave girl i said yes master she said i awakened suddenly startled for the instant then i realized what was happening it was perhaps an ahn before dawn she lifted her head from my body it was hard to see her in the light the fire had burned down please do not whip me master she said frightened you may continue i told her she again bent her head to my body she knelt beside me in the darkness her hands were tied behind her back the tether was on her throat stop for a bit i told her yes master she said i felt her cheek against me thee she put her head down on my belly forgive me for disturbing your rest master she said i know that i should not do that beat me if you must i am not angry i said i could not help myself she said though i feared i might be beaten you do not know what it is to be a female slave i am so weak i was so overcome with desire for my master i am not angry i told her but do not let it happen too often it is i who will instruct you as to when to serve my pleasure but what of my needs she asked your needs i said will be satisfied if and when i please yes master she said it is perfectly acceptable for you to lie alone in the darkness miserable tormented by your needs i said for you are a slave yes master she said but may i not upon occasion beg to be used of course i said she then lifting her head began to lick and kiss softly at my body i looked up at the stars i listened to the noises of the jungle night how sweet and strong and beautiful it is she said i said nothing are you angry with me master she asked no i said i love to kiss you she said then she again put her head down on my belly do not stop slave i said again she lifted her head then i took her by the hair and drew her close to me master she asked perform i told her yes master she said i then forced her head downward and held her in place as is common with slaves you are skilled i told her she moaned softly quite skilled i said she moaned again a sweet soft piteous moan aiii i whispered softly and not releasing her holding her head to me reared to my feet half crouching she was gasping sobbing she was half lifted from her knees i looked down at her how incredibly beautiful she was in the jungle night so small so white and soft her small hands tied behind her the tether on her throat i gasped and put my head back taking air into my lungs then i lowered her gently to the ground she looked up at me i love you master she whispered i forced myself to remember that she was only a slave then i lay beside her i wiped her mouth with the back of my forearm i held her head in my hands and kissed her on the forehead then shuddering i clutched her in a few minutes i was calm in a quarter of an ahn she felt me move against her thigh you are strong master she said you are beautiful i told her you have told me she said that i might upon occasion beg to be used it is my intention to use you again i said you need not beg but may i not beg if i wish she asked of course i smiled i beg to be used master she whispered you are an incredibly beautiful and desirable woman i said how miserable it would be for men if you were not a slave but i am a slave she laughed and men may buy me and do what they want with me i kissed her will you not accede to the plea of your aroused slave master she asked perhaps i said i must now be silent on the matter and await your decision she said that would be wise i said you could beat me if you wished couldnt you she asked of course i told her i desire you she whispered we shall see i said oh she laughed then she said it is well that i spoke the truth she kissed me do you customarily subject your girls to such an examination she asked when it pleases me i said of course master she said we are slaves i again placed my hand upon her and she put her head back you see that i did not lie master she said yes i said i felt her small body move beneath my hand she lifted her body piteously am i not ready for my master she asked yes slave i said you are well ready ready as is an earth woman for the penetration of an equal she asked no i said ready as is a gorean slave girl begging for the least touch of her master it is true master she said no longer am i an earth woman i am now only a gorean slave girl nothing more are you loving and obedient slave i asked yes master she said i kissed her if i dared she said i would again beg to be taken you may beg i told her please take me master she begged please take me master what a slave you are i said yes master she said how do you wish to be treated i asked she pressed herself against me kissing half sobbing treat me as the amorous worthless slave i am she said you are not worthless i said you have a market value indeed it has been improved this night but i am a total slave she said that is true i said and a squirming aroused amorous one yes master she said i held her head in my hands i kissed her about the throat please take me master she begged with mercy i asked her no she whispered without mercy how incredible was that experience she said there are many ways to take a woman i told her even many ways to take her without mercy perhaps it is only the free who permit themselves to be imprisoned by routine she said perhaps i said i would not know i kissed her gently sleep now i said it is nearly light yes master she said it is light master she said softly i awakened i rolled over and lifted myself on one elbow i regarded her in the glistening moist jungle dawn she was lying beside me the tether on her throat her hands tied behind her back we must soon be on our way i said yes master she said i saw that she was very beautiful yesterday she had been a woman who had been enslaved this morning she was a slave master she asked i took her ankles and threw them apart yes my master she whispered later i stood over her and looked down upon her she looked up at me i love you master she said you will doubtless be bought and sold many times slave i said and will have many masters i will try to love my masters she said that would be wise on your part i told her yes master she smiled i looked down upon her perhaps someday she would find her love master he to whom she would be the perfect love slave sometimes such individuals know one another immediately sometimes not sometimes a man simply sees a naked woman in her chains upon the block and knows suddenly that she is the perfect one she who is destined to be the perfect love slave for whom he ha always sought sometimes a girl kneeling before a new master is seized by a sudden wild emotion perhaps it is something in the way his steel is locked upon her body perhaps it is something in the audacity and assurance with which he handles her she lifts her head meeting his eyes quickly she puts her head down trembling she knows then she has met one who may well be her love master one to whom she can be but the most helpless of love slaves i looked down at the girl lying at my feet perhaps someday i mused she would find her perfect love master he to whom she would be the perfect love slave until then let her be bought and sold and passed from hand to hand subject to exchanges and vendings and barterings let her know the joys and miseries of diverse bondages it did not matter for she was only a slave i kicked her with the side of my foot on your feet i told her yes master she said i let her stand there tethered and bound and naked while i ate some of the roast tarsk i brushed black ants from it i then removed the one end of the tether from the slave stake and drew her to the tarsk kneel and feed i told her she knelt and putting down her head bit at the tarsk after a time i pulled her away from it and again using the tether as a leash led her to a fan palm i tied the tether to the fan palm drink i told her yes master she said while she quenched her thirst and then knelt beside the fan palm i destroyed the signs of our encampment i even slowly painfully drew up the slave stake and discarded it in some growth it need not reveal that a slave or slaves had been tethered here i then tied the pieces of roast tarsk together in a heavy ring of meat then fetching the lovely slave my pretty beast of burden i stood her in the clearing i untied her hands and removed the tether from her throat i threw her the bit of bark cloth for her hips dress i told her yes master she smiled she wound the bit of cloth about her hips and tucked it in she then thrust it down further well over her hips that the loveliness of the slave belly be well revealed do i meet with the approval of my master she asked yes i said she posed before me smiling the morning garb she said of the well dressed slave girl often said i slave girls are kept naked save for their collar and brand ah she said and i do not even have a collar how deprived i am but i am wearing my brand you cannot take it off i said that is true she smiled it marks you well i said she drew up the bark skirt yes she said it does how did you get it i asked some cruel brute burned it into my flesh with a hot iron she said i recall i said i love my brand she said most girls do i said it makes me prettier doesnt it as well as marking me as what i am a slave yes i said a brand makes a woman a thousand times more beautiful it is not just the aesthetic loveliness of the mark of course though that in itself incredibly enhances a womans beauty it is of course even more its meaning i understand master she said what is its meaning i asked it means that i am a slave she said yes i said one of the most helpless beautiful exciting and desirable of women she who is owned she who is at the complete mercy of the master she who must well serve and obey in all things she entered my arms and melted to me we must be on our way i told her then i lowered her to the ground youre going to rape me arent you she asked yes i said i threw the ring of tarsk meat about her neck over her shoulders she stumbled a bit under the weight then she straightened herself i know why most slave girls do not desire to escape their masters she said why i asked because we love them and desire to please them she said i turned her about and thrust her in the direction of our main camp where kisu and the others awaited us i followed her i carried the long leather strap that which had served as her tether looped in my hand i looked up at the sun we must hurry harta kajira i said faster slave girl i struck her with the straps a sharp blow that she might understand that she was not to daily yes master she said the squabbles of slaves please do not tie me tonight master begged tende be silent said kisu he then threw her on her stomach and tied her hands behind her back and crossed her ankles and bound them by a leather thong looped about her right forearm he fastened her to a small tree a few feet from our fire it had been a week since we had first on the height of the falls seen the flotilla of bila huruma pasangs behind us have you forgotten to tie me tonight master asked janice yes i have forgotten i said you forgot last night too she said that is true i said arent you going to tie me she asked no i said run away if you dare i neither dare to nor do i wish to she said lie here i said she lay where i had indicated her head at my thigh she snuggled closely to me janice whispered tende janice left my side to crawl to tende tende had struggled to a sitting position janice knelt while tende sat for tende was first girl mistress asked janice may i speak with you asked tende of course mistress said janice tende then struggled to her knees i knew then she wished to speak of her master how can i please kisu more she asked janice do you feel deep in your heart that you are a slave asked janice yes said tende in the most profound depths of my heart i feel that i am a slave then serve him as a slave fully said janice i will said tende the girls had spoken in gorean kisu had asked that i have janice and alice help tende with the language i had complied in the several weeks of our trip she had become reasonably fluent tende was an intelligent woman kisu too of course profited from these lessons indeed perhaps it was partly from his own interest that he insisted on these instructions for tende but too doubtless he thought it amusing that tende who had once been so proud be forced under his will to acquire a new language for my part i was pleased at both kisus and tendes growth in gorean considering ayari and myself and alice and janice it was clearly the most sensible choice for a common medium of communication janice then crawled back to my side he did not forget to tie me said alice she knelt a few feet from us her hands bound behind her a line running from her bound wrists to the same tree to which tende was tethered oh be quiet bound slave said janice untie me master begged alice let me serve you i will serve him said janice not pleasantly let me serve you master begged alice be quiet said janice or i will scratch your eyes out if i were not bound said alice i would claw you to pieces one of the aspects of the mastery inconvenient at times though it can be borne is the competition among girls for the attentions of the master indeed some masters keep more than one girl just for this purpose not merely to lessen the labors of each but that each may in the intensity of their rivalry strive to please him more than the other each wishes of course to undermine the position of the other and to become the favorite from the girls point of view there are few slaves who would not rather do double the labor and be the only wench in the masters compartments to be sure the loser in such a competition generally becomes the masters work slave and the winner his pleasure slave my own view on the matter for what it is worth is that a pleasure slave becomes even more marvelous when she is forced to function also as a work slave the girl who launders cleans and cooks for a master knows well she is owned in my own house i see that my favorite pleasure slaves girls such as lovely darkhaired vella perform their full share or if i please much more than their full share of servile labors it is not unusual to see her in a brief work tunic sleeveless and white sweating over the laundry tubs or on her hands and knees naked scrubbing the corridors in chains i recalled that she had upon occasion displeased me once a guest at first refused to believe that the lovely wench in pleasure silk a chain on her slave bracelets run to a ring on her serving collar who served his viands at a feast was the same girl whom he had spurned to one side with his foot that afternoon in a corridor i stripped her and put her on her hands and knees and he saw then that it was she even more astonished was he when i had her dance for him and the other guests you let such a superb slave scrub in your corridors he asked yes i said why he asked because it pleases me i told him master begged alice be quiet said janice whereas rivalries among men can be serious and dangerous the most that rivalries among slave girls can be is petty and vicious that is to be expected they are after all only small lovely animals i can please you more than she said alice no you cannot said janice i can insisted alice no said janice then she smiled if you are so pleasing she said then why is it that it is you who are trussed and tethered like a domestic tarsk at the slave post and it is i who lie free by my masters side alice fought her bonds and wept janice laughed do you think you are better than she i asked janice am i not master she inquired no i said i then took a line and tied janices hands behind her back and threw her to her side at the slave post by the free end of the line i tethered her like alice to the post now see what you have done said janice to alice now you have had us both tied alice did not seem displeased go to sleep now slaves i told them yes master said alice yes master said janice angrily are you angry i asked no master she said quickly please do not beat me slave said alice yes slave said janice i am a better slave than you said alice no you are not said janice go to sleep i said yes master said alice yes master said janice wreckage again we move upriver there said ayari pointing we put down the canoe we were carrying past the hurtling cataract we saw shattered on rocks the stern quarter of a river galley jagged planks dry and hot thrust up in the sunlight and lower wedged in pressed between rocks wet and black water foaming about it was the stern itself with its splintered sidehung rudder i waded out to it there was nothing left in the wreckage it could have been washed downriver for pasangs said ayari i nodded once before long ago we had recovered evidence of what had seemed to be another mishap on the river a chest or crate of trade goods we had managed to put them to good use we had not seen wreckage however the chest not lashed down properly might have been jolted or washed overboard too there might have been a capsizing we had not seen wreckage however shaba had not at that time as far as we knew lost a galley i put my shoulder against the wreckage i then put my back against it i freed it and twisting it plunged away westward downriver i returned to the rocks of the shore shaba now had but two galleys it was wise of you to free it said kisu he looked about the less evidence there is of strangers on the river the safer we shall all be i looked about too at the jungles they seemed quiet yes i said but i would have freed it anyway why asked kisu it is what is left of a ship i said it should be free how could i tell kisu who was of the land of the feeling of those who had known the waves of thassa you will not free me will you master asked janice kneel i said she knelt you are a woman i said you will be kept as a slave yes master she said now pick up your burden i said she picked up her burden and held it on her head with her two hands straighten your back i said yes master she said i then with ayari and kisu lifted the canoe again and again we moved upriver we do not trade tende the chief on his small stool pointed at tende kisu lifted beads before him of purple glass strung on wire the chief shook his head vigorously he pointed again at tende tende knelt beside kisu her hands tied behind her back in the weeks since her conversation with janice she had become to him a superb love slave this is hard for a woman to conceal the chiefs eyes glistened as he looked upon her kisu shook his head negatively in spite of the fact that tende had now become to kisu a superb love slave he still kept her under the strictest security often she cried about this but he was unrelenting i love you master she would weep i love you but he continued to treat her unremittingly with the discipline and harshness commonly accorded a fresh capture not with the authority and rough affection commonly given to a girl who is so enamored of her master that she can scarcely be beaten from his feet with whips she would cry alone at night secured to the slave post until kisu by a word or kick or blow would silence her the chief again pointed at tende kisu again shook his head negatively let us go said ayari nervously yes i said we rose to our feet and pushed through the villagers the chief called out behind us but we continued on i thrust a man away we hurried to the canoe and quickly thrust it into the river what ayari thought he saw in the forest ayari returned to the campfire suddenly he seemed startled janice is here he said yes i said janice looked up at him and alice what is it asked kisu i thought i saw her in the forest a moment ago he said was she not gathering wood no i said i leaped to my feet take me to where you think you saw her it was there said ayari a moment later pointing to a space between trees we investigated the area i crouched down and studied the ground in the moonlight i see no tracks i said doubtless it was a trick of the lights and shadows said ayari doubtless i said let us return to camp he said yes i said we are not pursued there is a village on the right said ayari we had in the past six days passed two other villages in these two other villages the men with shields and spears had rushed out to the shore to threaten us we had kept to the center of the river and had continued on there are women and children on the bank said ayari they are waving for us to come in it is pleasant to see a friendly village said alice let us take the canoe in said ayari we can perhaps trade for fruit and vegetables and you can obtain information on he whom you seek he called shaba it will be pleasant to sleep in a hut said janice there is often a night rain in the jungle occurring before the twentieth ahn we moved the canoe in toward the shore where are the men i asked yes said kisu where are the men the canoe was now about forty yards from the shore hold the paddles said ayari stop paddling they are behind the women i said turn the canoe said kisu fiercely hurry paddle suddenly seeing us turning about the crowd of women and children parted streaming out from behind them brandishing spears and shields knives and pangas crying out plunging toward us in the water were dozens of men spears splashed in the water about us bobbing under then floating one man reached us swimming but i struck him back with the paddle paddle hurry said kisu we looked behind us but we did not see the men putting canoes into the river they are not pursuing us said ayari perhaps they only wished to drive us away said alice perhaps said ayari they know the river better than us and do not desire to travel further eastward upon it perhaps i said what shall we do asked ayari continue on said kisu tende speaks to kisu i looked up at the stars i listened to the jungle noises and the small quiet crackle of the burning wood in the campfire tende knelt beside kisu bending over him i could hear her licking and kissing softly at his body her hands were tied behind her a line running to the small tree which served us in the camp as slave post her ankles too were crossed and tied both janice and alice now asleep lay near me neither was secured ah excellent slave said kisu he then took her by the hair excellent he said he then released her hair and she put her head down on his belly find me pleasing master she begged i do he said i love you master she said you are the daughter of my hated enemy aibu he said no master she said i am now only your conquered love slave perhaps he said do you think me any the less conquered than janice and alice my white sisters in bondage she asked perhaps not said kisu it is not easy to tell about such matters i too she said am only a slave lovingly and helplessly a slave but you are black he said it makes no difference she said i too am a woman and you have made yourself my master fully he did not speak do you hate me master she asked no he said do you not like me just a little she asked perhaps he said i love you she said perhaps he said can you not trust me just a little she asked i do not choose to do so he said it is strange she said the other girls sleep free beside their master and i who am so helplessly yours surely as much a slave as they am kept in severe constraints he did not speak why my master she asked it pleases me he said how can i convince you of my love she asked how can i earn your trust do you wish to be whipped he asked no master she said he rolled over and took her by the arms and put her to her back it seems a small thing she said that a girl beg to be permitted to sleep at her masters feet she lifted her lips and kissed him then she lay back do you think me less than the white slaves she asked no he said you are neither more nor less than they you are all alike in being slaves but i am the only tied slave she said yes he said could you not at least unfasten my ankles she asked ah he laughed you are a little slave tende when he had finished with her he did not retie her ankles you have not retied my ankles she said does this mean that you are now moved to treat me with a bit more kindness no he said it is merely that i may want you again before morning yes my master she laughed she then snuggled against him soon they were both asleep the net in the river look out cried ayari it seemed to rip up from the water extending across the river it rose before us reticulated and wet dripping a net a barrier of interwoven vines cut through shouted kisu at the same time behind us we heard shouting from each side of the river about two hundred yards behind we saw canoes dozens being thrust into the river cut through cried kisu ayari with his knife slashed at the vines we brought the canoe against the net so that i and kisu too each armed with a panga might slash at the woven wall which had on vine ropes sprung from shore lifted up before us the shouting behind us came closer the trap weighted just below the surface is activated by two vine ropes slung over tree branches ropes which are drawn taut when two logs to which they are attached one on each shore are rolled or dropped from a concealed scaffolding a signal which we had failed to note had doubtless been given the keen steel of our pangas smote apart thick vines water from the wet vines struck loose by our blows showered upon us get the canoe through cried kisu we turned the canoe a spear splashed near us ayari lifted aside vines the canoe vines sliding against its side slipped through paddle said kisu paddle for your lives we leave a village at night tarl whispered ayari yes i said we must leave this village he said we had now been on the river four months since we had first on the looming height of the falls observed the many ships and canoes of the forces of bila huruma far behind us we did not even know now if they were behind us or not too we had seen no new evidence of shaba ahead of us a month ago we had eluded the net of vines and by paddling into the darkness had escaped our pursuers they would not remain on the river at night it is impossible to convey in any brief measure the glory and length of the river and the hundreds of geographical features and the varieties of animal and vegetable life characterizing it and its environs the river alone seems a world of nature in its own right let alone the marvels of its associated terrain it was like a road to wonders a shining perilous enchanted path leading into the heart of rich hitherto unknown countries it in its ruggedness its expanse its tranquility its rages was like a key to unlock a great portion of a burgeoning continent a device whereby might be opened a new fresh world green mysterious and vast not a geographer i could scarcely conjecture the riches and resources which lay about me i had seen traces of copper and gold in cliffs the river and forests teemed with life fibrous medicinal and timber resources alone seemed inexhaustible a new world untapped beautiful dangerous was opened by the river i think it would be impossible to overestimate its importance what is wrong i asked i have been looking about the village in the darkness he whispered yes i said i have found the refuse dump he said within the walls i asked yes he said that is strange i said normally a village would have its refuse dump outside the walls i thought it strange too said ayari i took the liberty of examining it yes i said it contains human bones he said that is doubtless why it is kept within the walls i said i think so said ayari that way strangers will not see it before unsuspecting they enter the village they seemed friendly fellows i said they were however i admitted to myself not the most attractive lot i had ever seen their teeth had been filed to points i never trust a man said ayari until i know what he eats where are the men of the village i asked they are not asleep said ayari they are gathered in one of the huts i shall awaken janice and alice i said awaken kisu and tende i shall do so he whispered in a few ehn our things in hand we crept from the village by the time we heard men crying out in rage and saw torches on the shore we were safely on the river talunas see the size of it said ayari i do not think it will attack a canoe said kisu ayari shoved it away from the side of the canoe with his paddle and it with a snap of its tail disappeared under the water i have seen them before i said but they were only about six inches in length the creature which had surfaced near us perhaps ten feet in length and a thousand pounds in weight was scaled and had large bulging eyes it had gills but it too gulped air as it had regarded us it was similar to the tiny lung fish i had seen earlier on the river those little creatures clinging to the halfsubmerged roots of shore trees and as often as not sunning themselves on the backs of tharlarion those tiny fish called gints its pectoral fins were large and fleshy oh men we heard cry men men please help me take pity on me help me look master cried alice there near the shore a white girl she was slenderlegged and darkhaired she wore brief skins she ran down to the edge of the water her hands were not bound together but from each wrist there hung a knotted rope it was as though she had been bound and somehow had been freed please save me she cried help me i examined the condition of the skins she wore i noted also that she wore a golden armlet and on her neck a necklace of claws she also had about her waist a belt with a dagger sheath though the sheath was now empty save me please noble sirs she wept she waded out a few feet into the water she extended her hands to us piteously she was quite beautiful i considered the forest behind her the trees were thick the brush near the river heavy kisu and i dipped our paddles into the water master cried janice surely you cannot leave her here be silent slave girl i said to her yes master she said she choked back a sob she again dipped her paddle into the water please please help me we heard the girl cry then we had left her behind master sobbed janice be silent slave girl i said yes master she said look cried alice there is another now on the shore standing at a post chains about her body we saw a blond girl please help me she cried straining against the chains she like the first was dressed in brief skins and like the first was ornamented with an armlet and necklace too about her left ankle there was a golden bangle we removed the paddles from the water a beautiful wench said kisu yes i said please help me cried the girl straining against the chains save me save me take pity on me i have been left here to die take pity on me save me please save me have mercy on her master please begged janice you cannot simply leave her here to die i think we have lingered here long enough said kisu looking about this is a dangerous place agreed i said do not leave without her please noble masters begged janice please master begged alice please master begged tende what little fools you all are said kisu can you not see that it is a trap master asked tende kisu threw back his head and laughed master asked janice they speak gorean i pointed out thus they are not originally of the jungle the color of their skins alone white should make that clear to you consider the first girl the lengths of rope dangling from her wrists seemed rather long for any usual form of binding eighteen inches of rope is quite sufficient for tying a girls hands either before her body or behind too it is common to loop a wrist binding and use a single knot rather than tie each wrist separately perhaps she was tied about a tree said janice perhaps i said but too the rope was cut not frayed how would it have been cut i do not know master she said consider also i said that she retained her belt and dagger sheath a normal captor would surely have discarded these what need has a captured woman for such accouterments i do not know master she said too i said she like the girl at the post there on the shore wore clothing and ornaments one of the first things a captor commonly does with a woman is to take away her clothing she is not to be permitted to conceal weapons also it helps her to understand that she is a captive also of course a captor commonly wishes to look upon the beauty of his capture this pleases him also of course he may wish to form a conjecture as to its market value or the amount of pleasure he will force it to yield to him at the very least it seems reasonable that her ornaments and in particular those of gold would be removed from her one does not expect to find rich ornaments of gold on the body of a captured woman surely such things belong rather in the loot sank of her captor she might of course wear them later as her masters property he using them then to decorate his slave consider too the nature and condition of their garments the garments are not ripped or torn they show no signs of a struggle or of the abuse of their owner too they are skins of the sort which might be worn by free women huntresses not repcloth or bark cloth not rags of the sort which might be worn by slaves their bodies too said kisu showed no signs of lashings or bruises presumably then they were not fresh captures i nodded sometimes a free woman must be taught that she is now subject to discipline some women refuse to believe it until the whip is on them other clues too i said suggest that they are not what they seem consider the girl at the post her hands are not fastened over her head which would lift and accentuate the beauty of her breasts you must understand that a post is often used to display a girl not merely to secure her as it is we do not even know if her hands are truly fastened behind her or not we simply cannot see too captors in the forests natives of these jungles would not be likely to have chains to secure their captures please help me called the girl plaintively how long have you been at the post i called to her for two days she wept take pity on me help me please have you any doubt now i asked consider her condition it is prime does she truly seem to have been at the post for two days no master said janice too i said had she been at the post overnight is it not likely that tharlarion would have discovered her and eaten her from the chains yes master said janice i am too made uncomfortable by the thickness of the brush and trees in these areas both before and now they seem fit to conceal the numbers of an ambuscade perhaps we should hurry on said tende looking about take up your paddles said kisu continue on please stop begged the girl in chains do not leave a poor woman here to die but can we truly leave her asked janice yes said kisu yes i said janice moaned paddle i told her yes master she said as our canoe moved away we looked back after them cried the girl she slipped from her chains and bent to the grass beside her seizing up a light spear from the brush about her appeared numbers of girls similarly clad and armed we saw canoes being thrust into the water perhaps now you will paddle with a better will i said yes master said janice there were now some eight canoes behind us in each canoe there were five or six girls in the prow of the first canoe was the blond girl who had seemed to be chained at the post in the prow of the second was the slenderlegged darkhaired girl whom we had seen earlier she still had the dangling ropes knotted on her wrists will they overtake us cried alice it is unlikely i said in no canoe there are there more than six paddlers in this canoe too there are six paddlers and three of these are men in less than a quarter of an ahn we had considerably lengthened our lead on our pursuers do you not recall janice i asked in one of the villages long ago one of the men inquired if you were a taluna yes she said those behind us i said are talunas in half an ahn the canoes of the pursuers had fallen far back in a few ehn more they ceased the pursuit i am exhausted master said alice janice and tende too could no longer keep the stroke they gasped for breath they could scarcely lift their arms the paddle is like iron in my grasp said janice tende sobbed forgive me master she begged kisu her paddle struck the side of the canoe she almost lost it in the water then she put her head down gasping forgive me master she begged rest said kisu to her rest i said to janice and alice the girls then sick with the misery of their labor placed their paddles in the canoe alice and janice threw up into the water then trembling and gasping the girls lay down in the canoe ayari kisu and i continued to paddle the small men our camp has been attacked join me she laughed splashing in the water it was a lagoon opening off the river some hundred yards away i stood on the shore with one of the raiders spears in my hand there seemed no tharlarion or danger about but it would not hurt to maintain a vigilance in such a respect she was very lovely bathing in the water we were not now with the main group we had separated off as we did upon occasion to hunt also it is sometimes pleasant you must understand to be alone with a delightful slave clean yourself well slave i called to her that you may be more pleasing to my senses yes master she laughed what of you she called it is you who are the slave i told her yes master she said i thought i heard a rustling in the forest behind me it did not sound like the passage of a man or animal it seemed more like a wind moving among leaves yet there seemed to be no wind i turned and walked a few yards into the forest i did not now hear the sound it had been caused i assumed by an unusual current of air suddenly the girl from the lagoon uttered a scream immediately i spun about and ran to the edge of the trees come to shore i called to her at the far end of the lagoon where its channel leads to the river i saw what had alarmed the girl it was a large fish its glistening back and dorsal fin were half out of the water where it slithered over the sill of the channel and into the lagoon come to shore i said hurry i saw the large fish one of the bulgingeyed fish we had seen earlier a gigantic gint or like a gigantic gint it now having slipped over the channels sill disappear under the water hurry i called to her wildly she was splashing toward the shore she looked back once she screamed again its fourspined dorsal fin could be seen now the fish skimming beneath the water cutting rapidly towards her hurry i called sobbing gasping she plunged splashing through the shallow water and clambered onto the mud and grass of the bank how horrible it was she cried then she screamed wildly the fish on its stout fleshy pectoral fins was following her out of the water she turned about and fled screaming into the jungle with the butt of the spear i pushed against its snout the bulging eyes regarded me the large mouth now gulped air it then clumsily climbed onto the bank i stepped back and it on its pectoral fins and lifting itself too by its heavy tail clambered out of the water and approached me i pushed against its snout again with the butt of the spear it snapped at the spear its bulging eyes regarded me i stepped back it lunged forward snapping i fended it away i then retreated backward into the trees it followed me to the line of trees and then stopped i did not think it would wish to go too far from the water after a moment or so it began to back away then tail first it slid back into the water of the lagoon i went to the waters edge there i saw it beneath the surface its gills opening and closing then it turned about and with a slow movement of its tail moved away ayari and kisu referred to such fish as gints i accepted their judgment on the matter they are not to be confused however that is certain with their tiny brethren of the west help me i heard it was the voice of janice i moved rapidly toward the sound of her voice some fifty yards into the jungle i stopped there ringing a depression were more than a dozen small men they wore loincloths with vine belts from loops on the belts hung knives and small implements they carried spears and nets i do not think any of them were more than five feet in height i doubt that any of them weighed more than eighty pounds their features were negroid but their skins were more coppery than dark brown or black they did not seem to be one of the black races which are usually tall longlimbed and supple but their racial affinities seemed clearly to be more aligned with one or more of those groups than any others help me i heard janice cry i looked at the small men they did not seem threatening tal said one of them tal i said you speak gorean master cried janice i went to the edge of the depression there a few feet below me suspended in a gigantic web was janice one of her legs was through the web and an arm it was not simply the adhesiveness of the webs strands which prevented her from freeing herself but also its swaying and elasticity sinking beneath her as she tried to press against it i looked at the small men they seemed friendly enough yet none of them made any move to help janice master screamed janice i looked down the web was now trembling approaching her now moving swiftly across the web was a gigantic rock spider it was globular hairy brown and black some eight feet in thickness it had pearly eyes and black sidehinged jaws janice threw back her head and screamed with misery i slid down the side of the depression to the edge of the net i drew back the spear i carried i flung it headon into the spider it penetrated its body and slid almost through it reached up with its two forelegs and drew it out it then turned toward me as soon as it had turned in my direction away from the girl the small men howling and shrieking began to hurl their small spears into its body it stood puzzled on the web i scrambled about the side of the depression slipping once and retrieved the spear it was wet with the viscous body fluids of the arachnid it turned again and i slashing with the spear blade cut loose a jointed segment of its leg it charged and i thrust the spear blade into its face some of the small men then hurried about the depression striking at the beast with palm leaves distracting it infuriating it as it turned toward them i cut another segment of one of its rear legs from it it then unsteadily again moved toward me i slipped to the side and cut at the juncture of its cephalothorax and abdomen it began to exude fluid it retreated sideways from me it turned erratically the sidehinged jaws opened and shut a strand of webbing from one of its abdominal glands began to emerge meaninglessly i then as it dragged itself backward on the web cut away at its head the small men then flooded past me clambering on the web itself and began to crawl upon the beast with their knives cutting it to pieces i went then to the height of the depression the spear in hand the fluids of the beast drying upon it janice lay naked trembling in the web the great arachnid now lay on its back the small men swarming over it some stood to their knees in its body i cleaned the shaft and blade of the spear with moist leaves when i returned the small men had rolled the carcass of the beast to one side it reposed there gigantic and globular in the fashion of the rock spider its legs tucked beneath it the small men then stood again about the upper edge of the depression tal said their leader to me grinning tal i said to him master called janice i cannot free myself i looked down at her she was tangled and could get no footing i made as though to hold down to her that she might grasp it the shaft of the raiders spear immediately the small men rushed to me shaking their heads they tried to pull me away no said their leader no no i was puzzled the small men i recalled had originally stood about the upper edge of the depression impassively observing janices predicament they had made not the least effort to help her even when the eightlegged monster had emerged to claim her as his trapped quarry yet when i had fought the monster and when he had turned upon me they had sprung vigorously to my aid they had hurled their spears into the beast and had helping me distracted it in its ferocities then they had rushed past me and with their knives had boldly finished the creature but now it seemed they though obviously disposed to be friendly towards me did not wish to free janice the slave they wished me for some reason to leave her there helpless unable to free herself lying there at the mercy of the jungle surely either to starve or thirst to death or more likely to fall victim to some new predator i brushed the small men back get back i told them they moved back they were not pleased but too it did not seem they would try to stop me i extended the shaft of the spear to janice and she seizing it with one hand her free hand was drawn upward out of the net to the safety of the jungle floor then to my surprise when she stood safe trembling beside me the small men crowded about her and knelt down putting their heads to the ground what does it mean she asked they are showing you respect or obeisance i said i do not understand she said frightened of course i said now it is clear what she asked frightened stand stand i told the small men get up get up terrified the small men rose to their feet i looked at janice harshly are you not a slave girl in the presence of free men i asked forgive me master she cried swiftly she knelt the small men regarded her startled and frightened put your head to their feet i said kiss their feet beg their forgiveness for the affront you have shown them janice put down her head and kissed the feet of the small men forgive me masters she begged they looked at her in wonder get up i told the girl i then roughly tied her hands together behind her back the small men gathered around seeing that her hands truly were tightly tied this is a slave i told them they spoke quickly among themselves it was not in gorean we are the slaves of the talunas said one of the men their leader i nodded i had thought so from their behavior it was from the talunas too doubtless that they had learned their gorean we fish and hunt for them and make cloth and serve them said one of the men men should not be the slaves of women i said women should be the slaves of men we are small said a man the talunas are too large and strong for us they may be taken and made slaves as any women i said help us to rid ourselves of the talunas said the leader i have business on the river i said their leader nodded i then turned about and followed by the girl my slave made my way back to the lagoon to my surprise the small men in single file followed me at the lagoon i retrieved the girls barkcloth skirt and beads which she had discarded while bathing i slung the beads about her neck i adjusted the barkcloth skirt on her body i made certain it was well down on her hips i then looked about at the forest and then up at the sun i adjudged it too late to hunt further that day i then turned about and followed by the bound girl my slave made my way back towards our camp to my surprise the small men in single file again followed me kisu i called alarmed ayari tende alice unmistakably in the small camp i saw the signs of struggle too on the ground i saw shed blood they are gone said the leader of the small men they were taken by the mamba people those who file their teeth the word mamba in most of the river dialects does not refer to a venomous reptile as might be expected given its meaning in english but interestingly is applied rather generally to most types of predatory river tharlarion the mamba people were so to speak the tharlarion people the mamba people ate human flesh so too does the tharlarion it is thus doubtless that the people obtained their name how do you know it was the mamba people i asked they came through the forest on foot said the leader of the small people doubtless they were following you doubtless they wished to surprise you how do you know it was they i asked we saw them said one of the men it is our country said another we know much of what occurs here did you see the attack i asked we did not wish to be too close said another man we are a small people said another there were many of them and they are large we saw those of your party being led away said another man they were then alive i said yes said another man why did you not tell me of these things sooner i asked we thought you knew of the attack said one of the men and had fled thus escaping no i said i was hunting we will give you meat if you wish said one of the small men our hunting earlier today was successful i must attempt to rescue those of my party i said there are too many of the mamba people said one of the small men they have spears and knives i must make the attempt i said the small men looked at one another they spoke swiftly in a language i could not follow certain of the words but very few of them were recognizable there are linguistic affinities among most of the lake and river dialects the language they spoke however was far removed from the speeches of ushindi or ukungu in a moment the small men turned to regard me let us exchange gifts said their chieftain rid us of the talunas and we will help you you must be very brave i told them we can be brave said one of the men you are spear and net hunters i said this is my plan i capture the chief of the talunas lightly i dropped down within the stockade of the talunas it contained several small thatched huts it was not difficult to see in the light of the three moons i made my way quietly crawling stopping upon occasion to listen toward the more central huts in one of the huts one with a door tied shut from the outside i heard a rustle of chain i picked that hut which seemed the largest and most impressive one in the center of the camp on my belly quietly i entered it moonlight filtered in through the thatched roof and between the sticks which formed the sides of the hut she was sleeping within in her brief skins her weapons were at the side of the hut she lay on a woven mat her blond hair loose about her head i examined her thighs moving back the skins she wore they had never been branded she turned restlessly she was the girl who had feigned being chained at the post to lure us into a trap she was i was sure the leader of the talunas she had given commands in our pursuit she did not share her hut with another girl she threw her arm restlessly over her head i saw her hips move i smiled she was a woman in need she moaned i waited until her arms were again at her sides and she lay upon her back i saw her lift her haunches in her sleep she was starved for a mans touch such women in their waking hours are often tense and restless it is not unusual too for them to be irritable and many times they are hostile toward men many times they are not even fully aware of the underlying causes of their uncomfortable conscious states how horrified they might be if they were told that they were women and desired a master yet must they not on some level be aware of this would not their hostility toward the male who does not understand their needs or is too cowardly or weak to satisfy them not be otherwise inexplicable what other hurt could the uncooperative male be inflicting upon them the more he tries to please them the more they demand the more he tries to do what they claim to wish the more he finds himself disparaged and despised can he not see that what they really want is to be thrown to his feet and subjected totally to his will they wish to be women that is all but how can they be women if men will not be men how cruel a man is to deny to a woman the deepest need of her womanhood can they not care for them can they not see how beautiful they are and how marvelous but i steeled myself against thoughts of mercy for the blond beauty she was an enemy her head was then turned to the side she twisted restlessly in her sleep i waited until her head was back and she lay upon her back her arms at her side her small fists were clenched she whimpered needing a man she was indeed beautiful i thought she would look well naked on a slave block swiftly i knelt across her body pinning her down pinning her arms to her sides almost instantly frightened she wakened the trapped girls first impulse is to scream this may be depended upon as her mouth opened i with my thumb thrust the rolledcloth wadding deep into it in a moment i had lashed it in place i then threw her to her stomach and tied her hands behind her back i then put her again on her back her eyes were wild terrified over the gag with my knife i cut the skins from her you will not be needing these i told her i regarded her such women bring high prices i took her in my arms her eyes were frightened she shook her head fiercely negatively but her body as though in sudden relief desperately clasped me she twisted her head to the side and then again looked at me she shook her head negatively but her body thrust itself against me asking no quarter piteously and helplessly soliciting its full impalement very well i told her she looked at me in fury your eyes say no i told her but your body says yes her hips and thighs then began to move she put back her head in misery on the mat then in a moment there were tears in her eyes and she tried to lift her head and gagged mouth to touch me when later i crouched over her she sat up shuddering and put her cheek to my left shoulder i felt the lashings of the gag against my shoulder i thrust her to her back on the mat you are only bait i told her i then tied her ankles together and putting her over my shoulders her head hanging down over my back left the hut i left by way of the stockade gate i would leave an obvious trail the balance of the talunas have now been captured i hear of the marchers there they are we have them now cried the slenderlegged darkhaired girl i plunged through brush dragging the bound gagged blond girl running and stumbling bent over by the hair at my side the talunas more than forty of them plunged after us brandishing their weapons in hot pursuit i turned when i heard their sudden cries of surprise and then of rage and then of fear i tied the blond girl by her hair to a slender palm and strode back to the nets some of the talunas lay upon the ground tangled in nets the spear blades of the small men at their throats and bellies more than twenty of them struggled impeding one anothers movement in a long vine net about them the first girl i pulled from a net was the slenderlegged darkhaired girl i cuffed her and then threw her on her belly and bound her hand and foot i then drew forth another girl and treated her similarly then in a row lying on the jungle floor there were fortytwo captives i then released the blond girl from the palm tree and tying her ankles threw her with the rest i did not bother to ungag her release us said the darkhaired girl squirming in her bonds be silent said the leader of the little men jabbing his spear blade below her left shoulder blade the girl gritted her teeth frightened and was quiet remove their clothing and ornaments i told the little men this was done the little men then tied a vine collar on the throat of each girl and by the arms dragged them one by one to a longtrunked fallen tree about this tree encircling it were a number of vine loopings the little men then knelt each girl at one of the vine loopings pushing down their heads they then with pieces of vine rope fastened both under the vine collars on the girls tied down their heads close to the trunk the fortythree girls then knelt naked hands tied behind them ankles crossed and bound at the trunk of the fallen tree their heads tied down over it they could not slide themselves free sideways moving the vine loopings because of the roots of the tree at one end and its spreading branches at the other they were well secured in place their heads over the tree trunk one of the little men then with a heavy rusted panga probably obtained in a trade long ago walked up and down near them they shuddered they knew that if the little men wished their heads might be swiftly cut from them there are the mighty talunas i said many of the little men leaped up and down brandishing their spears and singing at the stockade of the talunas i said there was a prison hut within it i heard the chains of a prisoner the chains were heavy it is probably a male women such as talunas sometimes keep a male slave or two they are useful for example in performing draft labors i would keep him chained until a determination can be made of his nature he may be a brigand i then suggest that the stockade be examined for any other slaves or objects of interest or value then i would if i were you burn the stockade we will do these things grinned the leader of the small men i now i said must address myself to the attempt to rescue those of my party we must move quickly said the leader of the small men for there is going to be war on the river war i asked yes he said a great force of men is coming up the river and the peoples of the river are joining that they may be stopped he looked up at me there will be great fighting he said like never before on the river i nodded i had thought that it would be only a matter of time until the peoples of the river would mass in an attempt to stop the advance of bila huruma apparently they were now on the brink of doing so how many men may i have i asked two or three will be sufficient said the leader of the small men but because we are so fond of you i and nine others will accompany you that is perhaps generous i said but how do you propose that the camp of the mamba people be stormed with so few men we shall recruit allies said the small man they are nearby even now how many do you think you can recruit i asked so high i cannot count he said can you not give me some impression i asked i knew that the mathematics of these men who had no written tradition who had no complex cultural accumulation of intricate tallyings and abstract inventions would be severely limited they will be like the leaves on the trees like the bits of sand at the shore he said many i asked yes he said do you jest with me i asked no he said this is the time of the marchers i do not understand i said come with me he said the attack of the marchers we conclude our business in the village of the mamba people within the stockade of the mamba people there was much light and noise i could hear the sounds of their musical instruments and the pounding of their drums within the stockade too we could hear the chanting of the people and the beating of sticks carried in the hands of dancers i knew the stockade for it was the same from which we had earlier stolen away in the night two days ago the leader of the small people had led me into the jungle leaving behind the clearing where we had secured the lovely talunas their necks at the mercy of the panga we had trekked but a short way into the jungle when the leader of the small men held up his hand for silence i had then heard as i had once before but had been unable to place the noise the sound that strange sound as of a small wind moving leaves i had heard it before on the edge of the lagoon but had not understood it soon as we approached more closely quietly the sound became much louder it was now clearly distinguishable as a quite audible rustling or stirring but there was no wind the marchers said the leader of the small men pointing the hair on the back of my neck rose i saw now that the sound was the sound of millions upon millions of tiny feet treading upon the leaves and fallen debris of the jungle floor too there may have been mixed in that sound the almost infinitesimal sound audible only in its cumulative effect of the rubbings and clickings of the joints of tiny limbs and the shiftings and adjustments of tiny black shiny exoskeletons those stiff casings of the segments of their tiny bodies do not go too close said the leader of the small men the column of the marchers was something like a yard wide i did not know how long it might be it extended ahead through the jungle and behind through the jungle farther than i could see in either direction such columns can be pasangs in length it is difficult to conjecture the numbers that constitute such a march conservatively some dozens of millions might be involved the column widens only when food is found then it may spread as widely as five hundred feet in width do not try to wade through such a flood the torrent of hurrying feeders leaves little but bones in its path let us go toward the head of the column said the little man we trekked through the jungle for several hours keeping parallel to the long column once we crossed a small stream the marchers forming living bridges of their own bodies clinging and scrambling on one another crossed it also they rustling and black moved over fallen trees and about rocks and palms they seemed tireless and relentless flankers marshaled the column through the green rain forest the column moved like a governed endless whispering black snake do they march at night i asked often said the small man one must be careful where one sleeps we had then advanced beyond the head of the column by some four hundred yards it is going to rain i said will that stop them for a time he said they will scatter and seek shelter beneath leaves and twigs under the debris of the forest and then summoned by their leaders they will reform and again take up the march scarcely had he spoken but the skies opened up and from the midst of the black swirling clouds while lightning cracked and shattered across the sky and branches lashed back and forth wildly in the wind the driven darkly silver sheets of a tropical rain storm descended upon us do they hunt i shouted to the small man not really he said they forage can the column be guided i asked yes he grinned rubbing the side of his nose then he and the others curled up to sleep i looked up at the sky at the sheets of rain the lashing branches seldom had i been so pleased to be caught in such a storm within the stockade of the mamba people there was much light and noise i could hear the sounds of their musical instruments and the pounding of the drums too we could hear within the sounds of chanting and the beatings of the sticks carried in the hands of the dancers it is not so much that the column is guided as it is that it is lured this morning early the small men with their nets and spears had killed a small tarsk look had said the leader of the small men this morning scouts he had thrown to the forest floor a portion of the slain tarsk i watched the black segmented bodies of some fifteen or twenty ants some two hundred yards in advance of the column approach the meat their antennae were lifted they had seemed tense excited they were some two inches in length their bite and that of their fellows is vicious and extremely painful but it is not poisonous there is no quick death for those who fail to escape the column several of these ants then formed a circle their heads together their antennae quivering touching one another then almost instantly the circle broke and they rushed back to the column watch had said the small man to my horror i had then seen the column turn toward the piece of tarsk flesh we had further encouraged the column during the day with additional blood and flesh taken from further kills made by the small men with their nets and spears i looked up at the stockade i remembered it for it was the same from which we had earlier slipped away in the darkness of the night i rubbed tarsk blood on the palings behind me i could hear yards away a rustling we will wait for you in the jungle said the leader of the little men very well i said the rustling was now nearer those inside the stockade given their music and dancing would not hear it i stepped back i saw the column like a narrow black curtain dark in the moonlight ascend the palings i waited inside the stockade given the feast of the village the column would widen spreading to cover in its crowded millions every square inch of earth scouring each stick each piece of straw hunting for each drop of grease for each flake of flesh even if it be no more than what might adhere to the shed hair of a hut urt when i heard the first scream i hurled my rope to the top of the stockade catching one of the palings in its noose i heard a man cry out with pain i scrambled over the stockade wall a woman not even seeming to see me crying out with pain fled past me she held a child in her arms there was now a horrified shouting in the camp i saw torches being thrust to the ground men were irrationally thrusting at the ground with spears others tore palm leaves from the roofs of huts striking about them i hoped there were no tethered animals in the camp between two huts i saw a man rolling on the ground in frenzied pain i felt a sharp painful bite at my foot more ants poured over the palings now near the rear wall and spreading toward the center of the village it seemed there was a growing lengthening rustling living carpet of insects i slapped my arm and ran toward the hut in which originally our party had been housed in this village with my foot i broke through the sticks at its back tarl cried kisu bound i slashed his bonds i freed too ayari and alice and tende men and women and children ran past the doorway of the hut there was much screaming ants cried ayari alice cried out with pain we could hear them on the underside of the thatched roof one fell from the roof and i brushed it from my shoulder tende screamed suddenly bitten come this way i told them move with swiftness do not hesitate we struck aside more sticks from the rear of the hut and emerged into the rustling darkness behind it people were fleeing the village the stockade gate had been flung open one of the huts was burning wait kisu i cried alice cried out with misery kisu like a demented man ran toward the great campfire in the center of the village there in the midst of people who did not even seem to notice him he wildly overturned two great kettles of boiling water villagers screamed scalded the water sank into the earth kisus legs were covered with ants he buffeted a man and seized a spear from him kisu i cried come back i then ran after him a domestic tarsk ran past squealing kisu suddenly seized a man and hurled him about striking him repeatedly with the butt of his spear beating him as though he might be an animal he then kicked him and drove him against the fence it was the chieftain of the mamba people he drove the butt of the spear into the mans face breaking his teeth loose then he thrust the blade of his spear into his belly and threw him on his face beside the wall again and again kisu as though beside himself with rage drove the spear blade down into the mans legs until the tendons behind the knees were severed he then almost black with ants himself shrieking bit from the mans arm a mouthful of flesh which he then spat out the chief bleeding cried out with misery he lifted his hand to kisu kisu turned about then and left him by the wall hurry kisu i cried hurry he then followed me we looked back once the chieftain of the mamba people rolled screaming at the wall and then scratching and screaming tried to drag himself toward the gate the villagers however in their departure had closed it hoping thereby to contain the ants we acquire three new members for our party two of whom are slave girls i kicked her i will take this one i said the leader of the small people then untied the ankles of the blond girl and unbound the fastening that held her by her vine collar to the loop tied about the log stand up he told her she stood up she still wore her gag it had been removed only to feed and water her the leader of the talunas stood before me a vine collar on her throat her hands tied behind her back put your head down i told her she lowered her head i then went to the white male who had been the captive of the talunas released by the small people from his prison hut before they burned the taluna village he knelt in the clearing in the chain of the talunas shackles on his ankles and wrists connected to a common chain depending from a heavy iron collar you were with shaba i said yes he said an oarsman do i not know you i asked yes said he i am turgus who was of port kar it was because of you i was banished from the city the fault i smiled seems rather yours for it seems it was your design to do robbery upon me it had been he with his confederate sasi who had attempted to attack me in port kar along the side of the canal leading to the pier of the red urt he shrugged i did not know you were of the warriors he said how came you upon the river i asked when banished from port kar he said i must leave the city before sundown i took passage on a ship to bazi as an oarsman from bazi i went to schendi in schendi i was contacted by an agent of shaba who was secretly recruiting oarsmen for a venture in the interior the pay promised to be good i joined his expedition where now is shaba i asked doubtless by now said he he had been destroyed our ships were subjected to almost constant attack and ambush there were accidents a wreck and several capsizings we lost supplies we were attacked from the jungles there was sickness shaba did not turn back i asked he is dauntless said the man he is a great leader i nodded it was a judgment in which it was necessary to concur how came you to be separated from him i asked shaba lying ill in a camp he said gave permission that all who wished to leave might be free to do so you left i said of course he said it was madness to continue further on the river i and others making rafts set out to return to ngao and ushindi yes i said we were attacked the first night he said all in my party were killed save myself who escaped i wandered westward paralleling the river he cast a glance at the talunas trussed kneeling by the log their heads down fastened to it their necks helpless to the blow of the panga should it descend i fell to these women he said he lifted his chained wrists they made me their work slave he said surely they forced you to serve their pleasure as well i said sometimes they would beat me and mount me he said unchain him he is a male i said ayari with a key taken from a pouch found in the hut of the taluna leader unlocked the chains of turgus who had been from port kar you are freeing me he asked yes i said you are free to go i would choose to remain he said fight i told him what he asked strike at me i said but you have freed me he said strike i told him he struck out at me and i blocked the blow and striking him in the stomach and then across the side of the face sent him grunting and sprawling to the debris of the jungle floor he sprang to his feet angrily and i struck him down again he was strong four more times he rose to do combat but then he could not again climb to his feet he tried to do so but fell back i then pulled him to his feet it is our intention to go upriver i told him that is madness he said you are free to go i told him i choose to remain he said kisu and i i said indicating the former mfalme of ukungu are before you you will take your orders from us you will do what we tell you and well kisu lifted a spear and shook it turgus rubbed his jaw and grinned you are before me both of you he said have no fear i will take my orders and well insubordination i said will be punished with death i understand said turgus we are not gentlemen like shaba i said turgus smiled on the river said he shaba is not a gentleman either on the river he knew and all knew there must be strict discipline we now well understand one another do we not i asked that we do said he captain examine these women i said indicating the line of kneeling trussed talunas which among them pleases you most that one said he indicating the slenderlegged darkhaired girl who had been as we had determined second in command among the talunas there was a menace in his voice perhaps you remember her well from your enslavement i asked yes he said i do well remember her she is yours i said the girl began to involuntarily shudder no she begged please do not give me to him you are his i told her he will kill me she cried if he wishes i said please do not kill me she cried to turgus i will try to please you totally and in all ways he did not speak i will be the most loving and lowly slave a man could ask she wept please let me try to earn my life he untied her ankles and freed her vine collar from the loop on the trunk of the tree he threw her to her feet and pushed her head down submissively she then stood hands tied behind her beside the blond girl the leader of the talunas i took two pair of slave bracelets from the foot of the taluna camp girls such as talunas keep such things about in case slave girls should fall into their hands they are extremely cruel to slave girls whom they regard as having betrayed their sex by surrendering as slaves to men actually of course it seems likely that their hatred of slave girls which tends to be unreasoning and vicious is due less to lofty sentiments than to their own intense jealousy of the joy and fulfillment of their imbonded sisters the joyful slave girl obedient to her masters wishes is an affront and more frighteningly an unanswerable and dreadful threat to their most cherished illusions perhaps they wish to be themselves slaves why else should they hate them so i slipped the straps on the wrists of the blond girl a bit higher on her wrists i then below the straps snapped her wrists into one of the pairs of slave bracelets from the loot of the taluna camp i then untied the straps which had hitherto confined her wrists her hands then were still fastened behind her but now in slave bracelets i loosened the gag from the mouth of the blond girl and let it fall its wadding looped about it before her throat she threw up on the jungle floor the wadding smelled she threw back her head gasping for air i cleaned her mouth with a handful of leaves do you wish to be a slave girl i asked her no she said no very well i said i threw the other pair of slave bracelets to turgus he snapped them on the darkhaired girl and then as i had freed her wrists of the earlier binding which had been in her case a length of vine rope from the small people she looked at him puzzled do you wish to be a slave girl he asked no she said no no very well he said i grasped the hand of the leader of the small people in friendship i wish you well i said i wish you well he said then i and kisu followed by turgus and by janice alice and tende turned about to leave the clearing we would return to our hidden canoe beached near the river near which we had concealed many of our supplies what shall we do with these called the leader of the small people we turned about he indicated the line of miserable trussed talunas whatever you wish i told him they are yours what of those he asked he indicated the blond girl who had been the leader of the talunas and the darkhaired girl who had been her second in command they stood their hands braceleted behind them confused in the clearing they were ours i said we let them go let them go very well he said kisu and i and turgus and our girls alice janice and tende then left the clearing unlock our bracelets begged the blond girl she and the darkhaired girl had followed us to the edge of the river kisu and i and ayari were sliding our canoe from which we had removed its camouflage toward the water the girls janice alice and tende with the paddles and supplies accompanied us then we were at the edge of the water please begged the blond girl she turned that her wrists enclosed snugly in the linked steel bracelets might be exposed to me please unlock our bracelets she begged please please begged too the darkhaired girl kisu and ayari thrust the canoe into the water janice alice and tende wading placed the paddles and supplies in the canoe and then entering the narrow vessel assumed their places please free us begged the blond girl they are only slave bracelets i said free yourselves we cannot do so said the blond girl we are women and have only womens strength i shrugged please she begged again did you think noble free women i asked that you might do fully as you wished that no penalties would be inflicted upon you you cannot leave us here she wept she looked behind her fearfully at the jungle turgus and i waded to the canoe which kisu and ayari held steady in the water please begged the blond girl you cannot leave us here i turned to face her you have lost i told her i turned away there is another penalty which may be inflicted upon free women cried the blond i turned again to face her do not even speak of it i said it is too degrading and horrifying surely death is a thousand times more preferable i beg that other penalty said the blond kneeling in the mud on the shore i too cried the darkhaired girl kneeling too in the mud i too speak clearly i said we beg enslavement said the blond enslave us we beg of you enslave yourselves i said i declare myself a slave said the blond and i submit myself to you as my master she put her head down to the mud i declare myself a slave said the darkhaired girl and then she turned to face turgus and i submit myself to you as my master she then put her head down like the blond to the mud lift your head i said to the blond lift your head said turgus to the other girl the two girls lifted their heads anxiously you are now only two slaves i said yes master mid the blond yes master said the darkhaired girl they had declared themselves slaves the slave herself of course once the declaration has been made cannot revoke it that would be impossible for she is then only a slave the slave can be freed only by one who owns her only by one who is at the time her master or if it should be the case her mistress the legal point i think is interesting sometimes in the fall of a city girls who have been enslaved girls formerly of the now victorious city will be freed technically according to merchant law which serves as the arbiter in such intermunicipal matters the girls become briefly the property of their rescuers else how could they be freed further according to merchant law the rescuer has no obligation to free the girl in having been enslaved she has lost all claim to her former home stone she has become an animal if too she is sufficiently desirable it is almost certain she will not be freed as the goreans have it such women are too beautiful to be free too as often as not city pride enters into such matters such girls with other slave girls both of various cities and with the former free women of the conquered city now collared slaves too will often be marched naked in chains in the loot processions of the conquering cities it is claimed they have shamed their former city by having fallen slave and if they were good enough to be only slaves in the conquered city then surely they should be no more within the walls of the victorious city such girls usually are marched in a special position in the loot processions behind and before banners which proclaim their shame the people much abuse them and lash them as they pass such girls usually beg piteously to be sold to transient slavers it is hard for them to wear their collars in their own city kisu and ayari and turgus and i entered the canoe masters cried the blond kneeling in the mud her hands braceleted behind her wait cried the darkhaired girl you are slaves i told them you may be left behind the prow of the canoe swung slowly toward the center of the river do not leave us cried the blond she struggled to her feet and slipping waded splashing to the side of the canoe so too did the darkhaired girl the canoe was now in waistdeep water the blond wading beside it crying thrust her body against its side please she begged please both the girls still wore the vine collars on their throats which the small people had affixed on them that they might be fastened more easily at the fallen tree the blond too still had looped about her neck her gag lashing with its unrolled dependent wadding looped about it let us serve you as work slaves cried the blond yes master please cried the darkhaired girl the canoe continued to move and the two girls waded weeping beside it let us serve you as work and pleasure slaves cried the blond yes masters cried the darkhaired girl please please do you have the makings of a pleasure slave i asked the blond i held her by the vine collar at the side of the canoe yes master she wept yes master i too cried the darkhaired girl i pulled the blond into the canoe kneeling before me her back to me she was shuddering turgus drew the weeping trembling darkhaired girl too into the canoe she fainted overcome and he placed her on her side knees drawn up before him where are you from i asked the blond girl i and fina she said indicating with her head the darkhaired girl are from turia the other girls are from various cities in the south did you spy upon us once i asked further down the river yes she said it was i we then determined to try and trap you for slaves ayari then long ago had as i had suspected seen a taluna in the forest he had thought it might have been janice gathering wood how came you to the rain forests i asked i and fina and the others she said fled undesired companionships but now you have fallen slave i said yes master she said your entire band i said will doubtless know no nobler fate yes master she said she shuddered we now all of us belong to men yes i said you left our vine collars on she said you knew did you not that we would beg slavery yes i said but how could you know she asked though you and the others have fought your femininity i said yet you and they are both beautiful and feminine you knew that we were natural slaves she said of course i said i will no longer be permitted to fight my femininity will i she asked no i said you are now a slave girl you will yield to it and fully im frightened she said that is natural i said it will make me so loving and helpless she said yes i said can i dare too now she asked to be sensuous if you are not fully pleasing in all the modalities of the slave girl sensuous and otherwise i said you will be severely punished yes master she said or slain i said yes master she whispered the canoe moved into the center of the river i do not know how to be a slave girl she suddenly wept i thrust her head down you will begin i said by learning to be docile and submissive i then rewound the wadding and dragging her head up briefly by the hair from behind pushed it into her mouth and lashed it in place i then again thrust her head down also i said you will consider whether or not at a given time your master wishes to hear you speak if you are in doubt you may ask his permission to speak which may then be granted or denied as he pleases she nodded piteously signifying her slaves assent we then continued our journey eastward in a few moments she began to tremble tears fell from her eyes staining her thighs and the wood of the canoe bottom i put her then gently on her stomach her head turned to the left she shuddered and then exhausted by her ordeal fell asleep we paddled on we would let the new slaves sleep for a time then in an ahn or so we would put our hands upon them and holding them by the hair and the braceleted wrists thrust them half over the side immersing their heads and torsos in the river that they might be awakened we would then pull them back into the canoe tie their ankles to a thwart and remove their slave bracelets paddles would be thrust into their hands janice alice and tende might then rest and the new girls fresh raw slaves but now more cognizant than before of their condition might contribute to our progress on the river there is to be war upon the river tende will not be tied tonight can you read the drums ayari i asked kisu no said ayari no said kisu the drums have the rhythm of neither the ushindi nor ukungu speech said ayari two days ago we had left the country of the small people where we had made the acquaintance of turgus and acquired two new slaves an ahn later we could still hear the drums both behind us and before us keep paddling i told janice yes master she said we had cut new paddles carving them into shape that each member of our party free and slave might have his own lever if it became necessary to expedite our passage we wished each member of our party whether free or bond to be able to lend his strength to this work commonly however only four or five of us two men and two or three women paddled at a given time that way we were not only usually assured of a crew in readiness but we could spend longer hours on the river kisu had placed the finishing touches on the new paddles making them fit in grip and weight for turgus and the two new slaves the blond who had been the leader of the talunas and the darkhaired girl who had been her second in command we had also incidentally cut an extra paddle to go with the extra paddle we were already carrying the carrying of an extra paddle or paddles as i may have mentioned is a not uncommon precaution on the river ayari looked about himself he listened to the drums the jungle is alive he said suddenly alice screamed look she cried pointing we saw dangling over the water hung there by the neck the body of a man there was upon his body half torn away the blue of the scribe is it shaba asked kisu no i said it is one of his men said turgus grimly there is another cried alice about a hundred yards beyond the first body on the same side of the river it too suspended from a tree branch hung by the neck dangling over the water was a second body this one wore tattered brown and green it is another of shabas men said turgus i think it would be wise to turn back the drums pounded from the jungle both before us and behind us along the river continue on i said in a few ehn we had passed some six more bodies look over there said ayari on the shore we took the canoe to the shore and drew it up among the roots and brush it is one of the galleys of shaba is it not i asked turgus yes he said it was partially burned its sides wore weapon cuts the bottom had been hacked out of it with pangas or axes splintered oars lay about i do not think shaba continued further on the river said turgus the two new slaves the blond girl and the darkhaired girl remained in the canoe their ankles were fastened to two thwarts they had placed their paddles across the canoe and weary were bending over them there were three galleys i said i do not like the sound of the drums said ayari yes said turgus thoughtfully there were three galleys we found the wreckage of one earlier i said and now the wreckage of this one surely shaba could not have proceeded further said turgus hear the drums there was a third galley i said yes said turgus do you think shaba would have turned back i asked he was ill said turgus doubtless he has lost many men what hope could he have had do you think he would have turned back i asked no said turgus we shall then continue on i said we returned to the canoe and thrust it again into the muddy waters of the wide ua within the next ahn we passed more than sixty bodies dangling at the side of the river none was that of shaba about some of these bodies there circled scavenging birds on the shoulders of some perched small yellowwinged jards one was attacked even by zads clinging to it and tearing at it with their long yellowish slightly curved beaks these were jungle zads they are less to be feared than desert zads i believe being less aggressive they do however share one ugly habit with the desert zad that of tearing out the eyes of weakened victims that serves as a practical guarantee that the victim usually an animal will die portions of flesh the zad will swallow and carry back to its nest where it will disgorge the flesh into the beaks of its fledglings the zad is in its way a dutiful parent the drums i said may not have us as their object why do you say that asked ayari we heard them first i said far upriver of us the message whatever it is was then relayed downstream what then could be the message asked ayari i fear said turgus that it signifies the destruction of shaba what think you kisu i asked i think you are right about ourselves not being the object of the drums call said kisu and for the reason which you gave but i think too that if the destruction of shaba was the content of the message that we might well have heard drums yesterday and the day before when perhaps the second galley was destroyed why would the drums sound just now then shaba may live i said who knows asked kisu what then is the meaning of the drums pressed ayari i think that i may know i said i suspect that i too know said kisu grimly listen said ayari we ceased paddling yes i said yes said kisu we then heard drifting over the waters from upstream singing quickly i mid take the canoe to the left take shelter upon that river island we took the canoe quickly to a narrow river island almost a wooded bar on either side of which placidly flowed the ua scarcely had we beached the canoe and dragged it into the brush than the first of the many canoes rounded the southern edge of the island incredible whispered ayari get down slaves i said to the blond girl and the darkhaired girl who were tied by their ankles in the canoe they lay then on their stomachs in the canoe not daring to raise their heads the rest of us lay in the grass and brush and watched how many can there be asked ayari countless numbers i said it is as i had hoped said kisu hundreds of canoes were now passing the small island they were many of them long war canoes containing as many as fifteen or twenty men they paddled in rhythm and sang they were bright with feathers their bodies in white and yellow paint were covered with rude designs i was told of this by the leader of the small people i said it is the massing of the peoples of the river for war still the canoes streamed past us we could hear the drums in the background behind the singing throbbing and pounding out their message finally after a half of an ahn the last of the canoes had disappeared down the river kisu and i stood up tende too stood up well kisu said i it seems you have lured bila huruma to his destruction he will be outnumbered by at least ten to one he cannot survive your plan it seems has been fulfilled in your battle with the ubar it is you kisu who seems to have won kisu looked down the river then he put his arm about the shoulders of tende tonight tende he said i will not tie you the lake the ancient city we will enter the ancient city it is so vast said ayari it is larger than ushindi or ngao said turgus we guided our canoe over the shining placid waters of a broad lake it is i am confident i said the source of the ua into it must flow a thousand streams said kisu two weeks ago we had come to another high falls even higher than that from which we had long ago caught sight of the following forces of bila huruma pasangs behind in the distance we must be thousands of feet gorean given the length of the river the numerous plunging cataracts and the plateaus and levels we had ascended above sea level above the entrance points west of ngao and ushindi of the brown kamba and nyoka into the green waters of thassa from the falls at the edge of this unnamed lake we had been able to see far behind us the river had been clear here and there emerging from the lake were great stone figures the torsos and heads of men shields upon their arms spears grasped in their hands these great figures were weathered and covered with the patinas of age greenish and red lichens and mosses grew in patches on the stone vines clambered about them birds perched on the heads and shoulders of the great figures on ridgework near the water turtles and tharlarion sunned themselves how ancient are these things asked janice i do not know i said i looked at the huge figures they towered thirty and forty feet out of the water our canoe seemed small moving among them i studied the faces these men were of your race or of some race akin to yours kisu i said perhaps said kisu there are many black peoples where have the builders of these things gone asked ayari i do not know i said let us continue on said kisu thrusting with his paddle against the calm water how beautiful it is said janice there at the landing moored said ayari is a river galley it is the third galley said turgus the last galley of shaba c before us more than four hundred yards in width was a broad expanse of stone at the eastern edge of the huge lake it was a landing a hundred yards deep on it were huge pillars with iron rings where vessels might be moored at the back of the landing leading upward were flights and levels of steps extending the full length of the four hundred yards of the landing at the height on that level set far back was a great ruined building with stairs and white columns behind it extending backward was a ruined city with crumbling walls we could not from where we were conjecture its extent a tharlarion splashed from the landing into the water the landing was covered with vines at places and flanking the huge building at the top of the flights of stairs were more of the huge figures of warriors with shields and spears shaba must be here said turgus he was first to the source of the ua said kisu i unwrapped a panga from near my place in the canoe i freed a spear one that we had taken from the raiders so long ago take the canoe in i said moor it near the galley your long quest tarl my friend said kisu has now come to an end i stepped out onto the landing i slung the panga at my waist i carried the spear why do you seek shaba asked turgus your eyes have in them the look of one who embarks upon the business of the warrior do not concern yourself i told him do you mean harm to shaba he asked it will be necessary i presume i said to kill him i cannot permit that said turgus i was in service to shaba you are in service now i said to kisu and myself shaba treated me well said he he gave me and others full liberty to take our leave of him when we did have you a brigand honor i asked call it what you will said he angrily kisu struck turgus between the shoulder blades with the butt of one of the spears we dragged turgus half stunned to the landing there kisu threw him on his belly and tied his hands behind his back he then gagged him he then put a rope on his throat i regarded the slave girls onto the landing and onto your bellies i said alice and janice and the blond girl who had been the leader of the talunas and her second in command the slenderlegged darkhaired girl and tende all left the canoe and lay on their bellies on the landing one by one we tied their hands behind their backs and then with a long strap put them in throat coffle i gagged the darkhaired girl for she was the slave of turgus she looked at me in misery i smiled she would be given absolutely no opportunity whatsoever to attempt to give an alarm to shaba should we come upon him thinking such an action on her part might please her master i think this was wise on my part i had seen her squirming with joy in the arms of turgus she had been well conquered and certainly might now strive to serve him in just such a harrowing detail even though it might be at the risk of her own life the gag preventing her from acting in such a contingency could well save her life it would not be necessary then for kisu or me to cut her throat follow me i said get up turgus said ayari holding to his neck rope turgus unsteadily staggered to his feet i started up the stairs kisu a step behind me then came ayari and turgus behind them single file their hands tied behind them came five slave girls tende was first for she was first girl then came janice and alice and then the blond girl and lastly the slenderlegged darkhaired girl i had some days ago removed the gag from the blondhaired girl the formerly proud leader of the talunas was now well tutored in docility and deference and already she was showing early signs of emergent growth in vitality and sensuousness too she was becoming happy her gag no longer necessary on her as an instructional or disciplinary device was that which now packed the pretty face of the darkhaired girl she who had been her second in command who now brought up the rear of the coffle bila huruma like this asked the blond girl of janice crouch down further said janice take the tether in both hands one above and one below your left thigh hold the tether tightly against your left thigh feel it there now move your hips like this like this asked the blond girl yes said janice i watched the blond girl how flushed and excited was her face how free of tension and tightness how free of anxiety and stress there is an incredible effusive release of energy and happiness when a woman stops fighting herself it requires an inordinate amount of energy of course to maintain the stern rigidities of selfsuppression and constriction selfdenial selftorture pretense hypocrisy and conformance to external alien standards must exact their inevitable costs their damage and toll is torn not only from the heart but from the tissues of the body as well the laws are implacable the consequences inexorable the equations of misery are registered not only in the conscious annals of pain but too are tallied no less in the very chemistry of the body the human being is the only animal we know who tortures itself it need not do so yet how few human beings understand that and how few believe it truly should this not be done really with a chain asked the blond girl i have done it myself only with a tether said janice a chain however might be nice surely this drilling in the stone at my feet said the blond was for a chain probably said janice the blond stopped and straightened up she was covered with sweat if i learn to do this well she asked do you think my master might permit me a garment janice shrugged if your performance merits it and if you are sufficiently pleasing to him in all ways he might deign to throw you a rag to cover your prettiness i will try to be pleasing to him said the blond see that you do said janice but remember that he is my master before he is yours yes mistress said the blond the two new slaves addressed our older girls as mistress kisu and i thought that would be useful in keeping order among them in any training situation of course it is common for the girl being trained to address a female trainer whether the trainer is bond or free as mistress strict discipline is essential in slave instruction you are not really much larger than i said janice no mistress said the blond the blond was about five and a half feet tall and would have weighed i conjecture about twentynine stone gorean about one hundred and sixteen pounds now sit down and cross your ankles said janice loop the tether about them as though they were bound when i give the signal unloop the tether as though it were unbound rise then and stretch as a slave girl before your master yes mistress said the blond i smiled to myself never when she was on earth i conjectured had janice thought that she would one day be giving instruction in of all things the arts of pleasing a man earth women it is well known are above such things unless perhaps they are brought naked to gor and placed in steel collars they then quickly enough become desperately eager to learn the delightful and sensuous arts this makes sense their lives depend on it not bad said janice you will teach me things to do with my mouth and tongue wont you begged the blond perhaps said janice if you gather wood for me and wash clothing for me with the exception of that of my master i will i will said the blond girls seek eagerly to learn from one another that is enough said kisu he pulled apart turgus and the darkhaired girl they were still gagged and had their hands tied behind them kisu then crossed and bound the ankles of each i looked about the great room it was perhaps two hundred feet in width and depth with tall columns it was filled with great blocks of stone which had fallen perhaps centuries ago from the roof the walls were still generally intact the floor save where it was cluttered was generally smooth save for certain drillings through which chain might be passed some chains little more than fragile collections of rust ready to crumble at a touch lay about the room was reached by a broad flight of stairs and in the rear of the room there was another broad flight of stairs leading upward to another landing and walk on the walls which circled about still largely standing there were dim mosaics the chamber had apparently long ago been used in the enslavement and training of women doubtless taken in the raids and wars of those who had built these mighty halls some of the mosaics showed the clothing of miserable captives being taken from them others showed them being tied and whipped doubtless to introduce them quickly and mercifully to the concept of being under discipline others showed them being marked by hot irons and placed in collars others showed them kneeling head down in submission before their masters others showed them being danced before their masters others showed them serving the intimate pleasures of their masters we had chosen this room in which to camp because of the girls they had been thrilled with the mosaics almost fainting they had begged to dance and be used women learn from example if one presents them only with masculine images presented in approval contexts they will often attempt dutifully to conform to these alien models if one on the other hand permits them to be aware of genuine female images presented within contexts of honesty openness and permissibility it is natural for them to feel deep biological affinities for what is portrayed for what it is worth women tend on the whole to be unsuccessful in conforming to masculine images and tend to take gracefully and naturally to feminine images toward which they seem to have genetic predispositions perhaps that is because that is what they really are not men but women sex is not superficial not one cell in the body of a woman is the same as that in the body of a man i saw tende in the arms of kisu he had not tied her at night since we had seen the forces of the river peoples pass the island on which we had hidden those forces of incredible numbers which had doubtless wiped out bila huruma his flotilla and his battalions of askaris i approached the blond and she knelt swiftly head down i had her stand and lashed her wrists behind her back she was already tethered lie down i told her she lay down on the stone floor are you going to tie me asked alice i tied her hands behind her back then i tied her neck to the neck of the darkhaired girl using the collie strap lie down i told her she lay down prepare to be bound i told janice please do not bind me wheedled janice approaching me looking up at me running her finger on the left shoulder of my tunic do you question my will i asked swiftly she knelt her head to my feet no master she said please do not whip me she lifted her head and held to my legs please master let me serve your pleasure instead you have already this evening i said as the others danced and served well i have only begun to be aroused master she said i took her by the hair and pulled her she half crawling then half crouching and walking to where lay the darkhaired girl and alice i put her on her knees there and tied her hands behind her back i then added her to the coffle strap she looked up at me the coffle strap dangling from her throat attaching her to alice and then to the darkhaired girl please master she said lie down i told her she lay down first on her left shoulder and then on her back i looked down upon her and considered putting her under the whip let me placate you she begged she lifted her body to me please master she begged i looked down at her you are a beautiful slave i said please master she begged very well i said her offense that of questioning my will required discipline but the whip of the furs i decided would be sufficient you made her moan well said kisu she is a sweetly hipped hot slave i said i joined kisu at the small fire in the ruins of the great building he was sitting near it crosslegged tende lay beside him unbound her head on her hands i looked back at janice who hands tied behind her back fastened in the coffle lay on her side i smiled i think there is no music more pleasing to a mans ears than the moans of a yielding slave girl you see tende asked kisu you are the only slave here who is not bound yes master she smiled thank you master put wood on the fire said kisu she laughed you are a beast master she said she rose to her feet and fetched wood which she placed on the fire then she lay as before beside kisu may i face my master asked janice who lay as i had placed her facing away from us there were bruises on her body for i had taken her on the stones yes i said she struggled about that she might face us her eyes were moist she pursed her lips and then delicately kissed with them as though her mouth might be upon my body i blew her a kiss brushing it from the side of my face towards her in the gorean fashion i then looked away from her master she said i love you be silent slave girl i said not looking at her yes master she said sobbing she was an excellent slave and would doubtless know many loves until she a superb love slave might at last find herself fallen helplessly and totally into the absolute power of such a man as she had never dreamed might exist he who to her in the personal and intricate chemistry of couples would be her ideal master one powerful and uncompromising and strict one capable of seeing that she served well one capable of whipping her if need be but yet one loving and tender one who would be to her the perfect love master it did not seem likely that she would be again sold what would be the point of it the city is large said kisu it is quite possible that we will never find shaba within it we must continue the search i said i am certain he is here somewhere suddenly janice screamed and we leaped to our feet askaris had entered the room perhaps two hundred of them armed msaliti was with them and with them too at their head was an unmistakable figure black and huge with shield and spear bila huruma cried kisu the scribe tende fled from the feet of kisu running to bila huruma she knelt at his feet weeping i will go with you she cried do not hurt them do not kill them i will come willingly with you you have found me please i beg of you to let the others go let them be free great ubar who is this woman asked bila huruma kisu stepped back startled tende looked up at bila huruma stunned have you not sought me great ubar she asked was it not for me that you journeyed upon the river where is shaba asked bila huruma i do not know i said great ubar cried tende who is this asked bila huruma i do not know said msaliti i have never seen her before bila huruma looked down at the halfnaked slave suppliant at his feet have i ever seen you before he asked no master she said i thought not he said had i done so doubtless i would have recalled the lines of your body i was tende of ukungu she said who is tende of ukungu asked the ubar ah said msaliti she was to be sent to you by aibu chieftain in ukungu that the alliance between the empire and ukungu be consolidated ukungu is part of the empire said bila huruma no cried kisu seizing up a spear bila huruma paid kisu no attention he looked down at tende kneeling at his feet looking up at him a lovely slave gift said bila huruma a lovely token of esteem and good will but scarcely sufficient to consolidate a matter as weighty as a political alliance she was the daughter of aibu said msaliti she was to have been companioned to you companioned inquired bila huruma yes said msaliti this exquisite slut was once a free woman asked bila huruma yes said msaliti is that true my dear asked bila huruma yes master she said tende of ukungu he asked i was once tende of ukungu she said i am now only tende the slave and am called tende only because my master was pleased to put that name upon me did you once wear the regalia of the free woman asked bila huruma yes master she said you wear now the rags and beads of a slave he said yes master she said they become you he said thank you master she said rags and beads are more attractive on a woman than gowns are they not he asked yes master she said it was true it is fitting that you were enslaved tende he said for your body is lovely enough to be that of a slave thank you master she said i do not understand one thing here he said master she asked my reports were apparently mistaken he said master she asked tende of ukungu was said to have been proud and cold your reports were not mistaken master she said they were correct tende of ukungu was a proud cold woman but you are not she he said no master she said i am now only tende the slave of kisu my master are you responsive and hot he asked tende put down her head yes master she said bila huruma smiled tende did not raise her head my master has conquered me she said excellent said bila huruma please great ubar begged tende suddenly lifting her head tears in her eyes do not do harm to my master kisu be silent slave snapped kisu yes master she wept you are now only a worthless slave tende said msaliti if my ubar chooses to take you to please his senses he will otherwise he will not yes master she said i have many slaves said bila huruma and many of them are more beautiful than you on your belly yes master said tende frightened now crawl back to your master said bila huruma yes master said tende there were some two hundred askaris in the room and msaliti and bila huruma kisu and i stood facing him kisu with a spear in hand ayari was behind us and to the left the girls in the coffle were now all awake the darkhaired girl could not rise to her feet for her ankles were tied alice and janice however were on their feet too the blondhaired girl who had been the leader of the talunas was on her feet where she was tethered the strap going through the drilled stone at her feet turgus in his gag and bound hand and foot lay on his side let us fight called kisu to bila huruma tende lay on her belly at his feet we did not expect to see you again i said i fought my way through said bila huruma i retain two hundred and ten men three galleys and four canoes i salute your generalship and your indomitable will i said you did well let us fight called out kisu lifting and clutching his raiders spear who is that fellow asked bila huruma kisu the rebel of ukungu said msaliti you saw him once in your court kneeling before you in chains it was at much the same time that you first saw too mwoga the high wazir of aibu chieftain of ukungu he discussed with you at that time if your recall my ubar the girl tende daughter of aibu she who was to have been companioned to you she who now lies upon her belly a slave at his feet ah yes i recall said bila huruma he looked at kisu the one with the size and temper of a kailiauk he said yes said msaliti prepare to do battle said kisu to bila huruma our war is done and you have lost said bila huruma my war is not done while i still have the strength to clutch a spear said kisu grimly there are over two hundred askaris kisu i said do battle with me singly if you dare called kisu to bila huruma ubars i pointed out to kisu seldom see much point in engaging in single combat with common soldiers i am mfalme of ukungu said kisu you were deposed i said with all due respect kisu you are not of sufficient political importance to warrant a duel with a ubar appoint me again mfalme of ukungu said kisu to bila huruma if you find that necessary really kisu said ayari what sign have you seen of shaba inquired bila huruma like yourself doubtless only his galley we too search for him i do not think he is far said bila huruma that is my hope i said where is the golden chain i gave you in my chambers asked bila huruma in the supplies in our canoe i said no longer he said he gestured to an askari who threw me the chain i thought i would find you here said bila huruma i recognized the chain thank you ubar i said i again looped the chain about my neck fight challenged kisu i seek shaba said bila huruma i do not wish to be distracted by this brash malcontent fight cried kisu shaking the raiders spear i could be behind the guard of that clumsy weapon in a moment said bila huruma to kisu why do you think i adopted the stabbing spear for my soldiers we have such weapons cried kisu we had two such weapons ayari held one the other was behind in the canoe do you know their techniques asked bila huruma their utilities and tricks the subtleties of their play no said kisu but i will fight you anyway you are a strong man and a good and brave man kisu i said but bila huruma and his men are trained fighters desist in your madness if i slay bila huruma said kisu i slay the empire that is highly unlikely i said the empire like gold is valuable should it fall from the hand of one man it would likely be seized up by the hand of another i do not choose to meet you in battle said bila huruma and if you attack me then i must either slay you or have you slain he is a trained fighter kisu i said do not fight him what am i to do asked kisu my recommendation said ayari would be to stab him when he is not looking or perhaps to poison his palm wine i cannot do such things cried kisu what then am i to do put up your spear i told him with a cry of rage he drove the butt of the spear down on the stone we all all in that room regarded kisu he stood there the butt of the spear on the stone the blade over his head he held the spear under the blade his hands over his head his head was down his shoulder shook he wept tende crept to his feet and kissed him sobbing too why do you seek shaba asked bila huruma doubtless for the same reason you too seek him i said msaliti twitched nervously at the side of bila huruma we have come far great ubar he said we have endured many hardships and dangers these few men constitute but one last obstacle in your path we outnumber them considerably clear them away give orders to your askaris to do away with them bila huruma looked at me for the moment he seemed lost in thought bila huruma we heard the voice came from the height of the stairs behind me and to my left that leading to a higher level in the building an open court which lay above us we all looked to the height of the stairs there in blue rags yet standing proudly was a scribe i am bila huruma said the ubar that is known to me said the scribe he looked about down at us is one called tarl cabot among you he asked i am he i said msaliti reacted suddenly it was a name apparently not unknown to him his hand darted to the hilt of the dagger sheathed at his hip but he did not draw the weapon i will take you to shaba said the scribe the battle blood and steel we survive i had hoped that you would follow said shaba when you were put upon the rogues chain i feared it might be the end of you i cannot tell you how overjoyed i am to find that you are here shaba drawn and worn lay upon a couch blankets behind his head his left arm seemed useless and he was haggard with disease then said i remove these manacles in which i have been placed the scribe had led us through the city ascending and descending streets making our way through various buildings following various ancient avenues flanked by the ruins of what must once have been an impressive grandeur bila huruma and i had followed the scribe most closely then had come the members of our various parties kisu had kept our girls with the exception of tende in coffle we had unbound the ankles of the darkhaired girl and of turgus we had kept them gagged the neck rope of turgus had been in the keeping of ayari then we had come more than two hundred of us to a fortresslike ruin on a raised level we had been requested to wait within the ancient threshold which had once held a gate shabas men had to some extent refortified the ruin placing stones within the threshold so that only one man at a time might enter too between the edges of the walls over the stones they had erected a barrier of lashed poles shaba had still with him some fifty men while the rest of our two parties including bila huruma had waited within the threshold i was conducted across the broad stone court to its center where on a huge stone couch of ancient design lay shaba before being allowed to approach him closely shabas men ringing me with spears placed me in manacles locking my hands behind my back it was thus that i stood now before the geographer of anango shaba is dying had said the scribe who had conducted us to this place do not speak long i regarded shaba please my friend said shaba to me forgive the manacles but surely you must understand that they constitute a sensible precaution of my part about shabas neck on a thin golden chain hung a ring it was heavy and golden much too large for the finger of a man in the ring was a silver plate opposite the bezel on the outside of the ring was a circular recessed switch you display the ring boldly i said shaba touched the ring on his right hand now he wore another ring the fang ring which filled with kanda i had seen earlier in schendi a scratch from that ring would destroy a kailiauk in a matter of seconds do you think ill of me tarl cabot he asked you are a traitor to priestkings i said you have stolen the tahari ring i am a scribe and a man of science and letters said shaba surely you can understand the importance of the ring to me it can bring wealth and power i said such things are not of interest to me said shaba the tribal stitching of tattoo marks on his dark face wrinkled with a smile but i do not expect you to believe that he said i do not i said how hard it is for two who do not share caste to understand one another he said perhaps i said i took the ring for two reasons he said first it made possible the ascent of the ua without it we should not have come this far in many villages and among hostile peoples the demonstration of the power of the ring as i had hoped permitted us safe passage on the river i am afraid i am regarded as something of a wizard had it not been for the ring i and my men would have been slain many times he smiled at me my exploration of the ua he said would not have been possible without the ring surely you are aware that possession of the ring is dangerous i said i am well aware of that he said with his right hand he gestured about himself he indicated the walls of the fortresslike enclosure within which he had ensconced himself and his men too about this enclosure at the foot of stairs leading from it was a broad shallow moat waters from the lake circulated through the city and fed this moat in it as had been demonstrated by the hurling of a haunch of tarsk into the waters crowded and schooling were thousands of blue grunt this fish when isolated and swimming free in a river or lake is not particularly dangerous for a few days prior to the fullness of the major gorean moon however it begins to school it then becomes extremely aggressive and ferocious the haunch of tarsk hurled into the water of the moat slung on a rope had been devoured in a matter of ihn there had been a thrashing frenzy in the water and then the rope had been withdrawn severed the moat had been crossed by a small floating wooden bridge tied at each end this had been built being extended outward from the opposite shore by shabas men the effectiveness of the moat aside from the barrier of the water itself would become negligible with the passing of the full moon until the next the grunt following the mating frenzy synchronized with the full moon would return to the lake given the habits of the fish i had little doubt but that this place was an ancient mating ground for them for the grunt populations tend to return again and again to the places of their frenzy wherever usually in a lagoon or shallow place in a river they may be the grunt now schooling in the open moat come in from the lake could well be the posterity of grunt populations dating back to the time when the city was not in ruins but in the height of its glory and power the grunt in the moat were for a time an effective barrier but surely shaba and his men realized that it must be temporary suddenly the hair on the back of my neck rose i now understood the practicality of their present situation you were waiting for us i said of course said shaba and if you had not come by today i do not know what we would have done the wall of the grunt i said it has protected you for some four or five days it proved enough said shaba it gave you time to arrive you have been followed by kurii i said yes said shaba that is our belief we have however seen only tracks i fear even now however they may be gathering they must be somewhere in the city your man was courageous to come and fetch us i said he is ngumi said shaba he is courageous indeed we did not know if he would get through i did not know a scribe could be so courageous i said there are brave men in all castes said shaba we may have been permitted however to come through i said that msaliti gain entrance to the fortification asked shaba of course i said perhaps he said you said i said that you took the ring for two reasons but you mentioned only one that it facilitated your journey upon the ua look there said shaba indicating a table to one side on which there lay a cylindrical leather case with a leather cap and four notebooks heavy and bound with leather i see i said there is a map case there he said and my notebooks i have in my journey charted the ua and in the notebooks i have recorded my observations those things though you of the warriors may not understand this are priceless your records would doubtless be of value to geographers i said they are said shaba of inestimable value to all civilized men perhaps i said the maps those records said shaba open up a new world think not only in terms of crass profit my friend of the bounties there to hunters and trappers to traders and settlers to planters and physicians but to all men who wish to understand who wish to know who wish to unveil hidden secrets and penetrate hitherto unsolved mysteries in these maps and records for those who can understand them lie the first glimpses of new and vast countries in these maps and in these notes and drawings there are treasures and wonders he looked at me intently and that he said is the second reason i took the ring i do not understand i said i did not expect to survive this journey nor to return he said i am pleased that i have come this far that i have found the source of the ua yes i said i took the ring he said not only to facilitate my journey but that you or another would follow that there would be someone who could bring my maps and notes back to civilization you fled i said fearing me shaba smiled the ua said he seems a strange avenue of escape no my friend i did not flee rather i began my voyage of exploration my expedition into the interior what of the moneys those vast sums wrought from the kurii the notes negotiated in schendi i asked they were to defray the costs of outfitting the expedition of hiring the men he said surely you do not object to my making use of the funds of kurii for such a purpose they should be pleased to have made their contribution to so noble a project you distribute your treacheries impartially i said doubtless that is to your credit do not think too poorly of me tarl said shaba this was to me the opportunity of a lifetime if i have erred i have erred in the cause of my caste and in that more generally of humankind he regarded me a little sadly what do you think priestkings would do with the ring he asked it would not be important to them but to me to men it is momentous indeed i doubt that priestkings would even wish to permit the use of the ring to men it seems possible to me they would regard its use as contravening their structures on human technology perhaps i said i truly would not know how they might view the matter so said shaba i took the ring with it i have explored the ua i have found her source with it too i have lured you after me that my maps and notes might be returned safely to civilization i looked down at the map case and the notebooks yes said shaba it is those things which i have purchased with the theft of the ring and my life he suddenly tensed i saw that he was in pain guard them well my friend he said why did you flee the palace of bila huruma i asked shaba had fled i recalled with three galleys bila huruma with the balance of his ships and supplies had followed him it is perhaps he whom i have most wronged said shaba sadly and yet i think that in fleeing his palace i may have saved his life i do not understand i said bila huruma my patron and protector said shaba stood between msaliti and myself msaliti had already attempted one attack on his life that in which jambia the assassin died by the osts that same attack in which he sought to implicate you yes i said as long as i remained in the palace bila huruma was in danger he said when i fled there would be no reason for msaliti to plot his death yet i knew well that when i fled bila huruma would follow me of course i said msaliti would then have no alternative but to tell bila huruma of the ring and then join with him in bila hurumas attempt to seize it hoping later to secure it for himself i do not think bila huruma has followed me for the ring smiled shaba why else i asked shaba said nothing no other motivation could bring him to this place i said other than to kill for the ring its power would make him absolute and invincible perhaps smiled shaba how is it i asked that you fear you may have wronged bila huruma that seemed as unlikely to me as a fellow worrying about wronging a larl who was padding along upon his trail by using him for my purposes said shaba what purposes i asked shaba lay back on the blankets for a moment he shut his eyes in pain i watched the ring on the chain about his neck shaba weary opened his eyes he looked at me he was weak i have no interest in your maps and notebooks i said i have come for the ring have these manacles removed give me the ring there was suddenly a scream from the height of the wall i spun about to see one of shabas men reel about and then plunge bloody from the walls height to the stones below then rimmed against the blue tropical sky i saw arms upraised a redspattered panga in its right paw the huge towering shaggy figure of a kur there were screams from below then i heard the screams of wild kurii from all about encircling the walls i saw the height of a slender tree trunk suddenly protruding against the sky leaning against the wall from the outside a kur scrambled up the trunk and leaped down over the wall at other places too i saw the heads of kurii broad and fanged eyes blazing arms and paws thrust over the wall one of the kurii screamed a stabbing spear thrust in its chest bila huruma swiftly deployed his askaris i saw kisu a raiders spear over this head held in both hands rush toward a crouching kur one just leaped into the courtyard remove these manacles i cried to ngumi the scribe at the side of shaba he who had conducted us to this place eight or ten more kurii dropped inside the wall lightly for their weight and crouched there for the moment pangas in their fangs the knuckles of their paws on the stones i saw msaliti draw his knife and slip to the side askaris rushed up stone stairs to the height of the walls where the lateral walkways had not crumbled i saw one thrust back another tree trunk then i saw four of them cut from the to of the wall by a charging kur one wielding a giant panga i saw kurii too thrusting their arms through the barrier of lashed poles mounted over the stones at the threshold ayari small ayari joined the askaris there thrusting with a stabbing spear through the poles free me i cried maddened to the scribe i fought the manacles i saw more kurii clambering over the walls the scribe threw a wild look at shaba free him said shaba i saw two kurii on all fours pangas in their fangs look towards us i heard screams at the threshold i saw the poles being splintered and smote apart by pangas one of the slave girls somewhere screamed a manacle its double bolt thrust back by the key opened many of the kurii i suspected were gorean kurii wild degenerate kurii descendants of marooned kurii or survivors of crashed ships others i feared were ship kurii hurry i cried one of the two kurii who had been looking at us suddenly lifted his arm and pointed towards us on all fours moving with an agility and speed frightening in so large a beast they charged the other manacle snapped free i saw one of the beasts throw itself panga still in its fangs toward shaba reaching for the ring on its chain i hurled the loosened manacles into the face of the other kur the beast who had attacked shaba suddenly drew back startled puzzled it looked at its paw where there was a flash of bright blood the panga fell from its fangs the beast who confronted me howling tore the manacle from its slashed moonlike eye its mouth was bloody where it had bitten dn the steel of the panga i scrambled leaping half crawling to the place on the stones where ngumi had after putting me in manacles dropped my belt sheath and dagger i rolled wildly to the side the panga of the beast who followed me with a great ringing sound and a flash of sparks smote down on the stone the beast who had attacked shaba lay dead by his couch shaba was coughing and spitting blood the blade of his fang ring that containing kanda was exposed and bloody i threw myself to the side again and again the great panga fell the table on which reposed the map case and notebooks of shaba seemed to explode in two wood splintering and flying to the sides the map case and notebooks scattering showering upward the kur roaring and snarling looked about for the moment it had lost me i kept to its blind side then uttering the war cry of koroba i leaped upon its back and an arm about its throat plunged the dagger to its heart i felt the great body shuddering under me and i leaped away from it i spun about i saw another kur at shaba again shaba interposed the fang ring i saw the six digits of the paw close on the chain about shabas neck and then the digits released the chain and the beast slipped back limply it sat for a moment and then unsteadily fell to the side i thrust the bloody dagger between my teeth on it i tasted the blood of kur i seized up the panga which had been carried by the beast i had slain it was heavy i must needs use two hands to wield it i looked back once to shaba who head down was clutching at the blankets of the couch they were covered with blood ngumi ran to him shaba lifted his head fight he said save yourselves i will never leave you cried ngumi then he cried out half cut in two i leaped forward and frontally struck the kur which had slain ngumi its broad head was cut open to the neck i looked down at ngumi the tribal stitching on his face so startling and paradoxical in a scribe a man of civilization was identical to that on the face of shaba help i heard they are breaking through i ran to the threshold and leaping upon the stones screaming struck at the arms and paws which were thrusting back the barrier of lashed poles paws and arms severed flew bloody from the blade kurii howling drew back others are coming over the walls i heard free me i heard i ran to turgus and slashed his bonds he seized up a stabbing spear from a fallen askari and ran to fight i then slashed away the bonds of the huddled crouching slave girls master cried janice they might now have some chance to flee yet they were enclosed within the walls a human female who falls to a male conqueror may sometimes by submitting herself totally to him as a slave save her life at least until he determines whether or not she is sufficiently pleasing kurii on the other hand generally have little interest in human females except as food i turned to meet the attack of another kur i blocked his blow with the panga and was from the force of it thrown back a dozen feet he struck again and i was hurled back to the wall the panga had almost been ripped away from me my hands stung he struck again and stone showered out from the wall to the right of my head i slipped to the side and caught him with the panga striking across the hip and lower abdomen he grunted and stepped back holding splinters of bone and loops of intestine in its paw i then struck its head away kisu watch out i cried kisu turned but a figure interposed itself between him and the attacker a stabbing spear was thrust into the belly of the kur and then stabbing five times more in the belly and chest and throat the interposing figure forced back the bewildered enraged beast an askari then struck the beast from behind thrusting his stabbing spear deep into its back below the left shoulder blade the beast turned to attack its new menace and he who had been the interposing figure now behind it as it had turned thrust his own stabbing spear deep into its back as had the askari the beast sank to its knees and snapping crawled toward the retreating askari for more than a dozen feet until it collapsed on the stones kisu glared at he who had been the interposing figure my thanks ubar he then said then each kisu the rebel and bila huruma ubar of the equatorial empire side by side addressed themselves to thwarting the attack of new kurii i held the panga in two hands my mouth was bleeding as i had cut myself on the dagger clenched between my teeth i looked about i thrust the dagger through my tunic it held in place in the pierced cloth by its hilt i wiped blood from my face i rejoined the fray i struck a kur from behind that was towering over a fallen askari opening the shaggy skull to the nape another i struck too from behind severing the spinal column it had been bent over pausing to feed i saw yet more kurii clambering over the wall others pressed again now at the lashed poles over the stones at the threshold i ran toward the threshold i hacked them back they drew back a leader roaring and gesticulating then others brought forth two of the slender tree trunks they had been using to scale the walls i threw back my head to breathe i checked that the dagger was still caught in my tunic i thrust it through another place too in the tunic too easily earlier it might have been lost how have we been surprised i asked ayari who was at the threshold the guards at the small bridge were surprised and killed he said they took the bridge and crossed the moat it is a slaughter i said i looked about the oval leather shields and the stabbing spears of the askaris might have been ideal armament for invincibility in tribal warfare but they afforded little in the way of martial equity when compared to the weighty slashing pangas of the kurii they were not the mighty axes and heavy shields of torvaldsland bila huruma was screaming at his men he himself had discarded his shield or it had been struck from him single them out he cried attack in fives one engage four strike he is improvising tactics said ayari he is a ubar i said one askari might fend a committed blow of the panga with the iron blade of his stabbing spear four others might then swarming upon the beast drive their weapons repeatedly into it these kurii were on the whole wild kurii not ship kurii each would be used to fighting alone terrible and solitary hunting its own kills in the ancient manner they might be in proximity to one another but each functioned in effect as an isolated unit they were horrifying and ferocious but were not trained there are too many i said it is true that we are lost said ayari but we shall make a good fight of it well said said i small rogue i saw bila huruma slip to one knee a mighty kur stood over him his panga raised over his head then from behind bila huruma there was a wild cry of ukungu and a raiders spear in its length thrust past the ubar and buried itself in a red wound in the kurs heart my thanks rebel said bila huruma regaining his feet kisu pulled his weapon free and grinned i now owe you nothing he said true said bila huruma and then again side by side rebel and ubar they fought one of the kur leaders then marshaling his forces formed them in loose lines that they might no longer be singly attacked i had little doubt but what he was a ship kur i admired his ability to control the degenerate recruited kurii he commanded there was perhaps in them the vestige or memory perhaps passed on in an oral tradition of the disciplines and dignities in their past notably doubtless that of ship loyalty we are finished now i said they will fight together bila huruma now gathered his men about him many were covered with blood there were probably no more than a hundred left then with him i saw more kurii dropping over the wall suddenly behind us there was a splintering of lashed poles and bindings too tore loose again and again then the trunks of small trees struck at the barrier fending us from the main forces of the attacker we must hold them cried ayari it cannot be done i said the framework of lashed poles suddenly broke half apart and kurii swarmed within some with pangas some with clubs and sharpened sticks we fell back from the stones literally swept from our rampart by the irruption of the wood and the flood of massive charging bodies the panga then was gone from my hands wrenched away lost in the body of the kur in which i had buried it form i cried get the wall to your backs men streamed past me to take a stand by the wall i leaped upon a kurs chest holding to him by my left hand clenched in fur behind its shaggy neck i drove the dagger torn from my tunic again and again into its chest the kur had worn rings of gold in its ears i had little doubt it was a ship kur i slipped free as the animal screamed and reeled about then fell falling among the stones and wood scratching at the stone i saw torgus drive a stabbing spear into the chest of a maddened kur then it seemed kurii were all about me yet scarcely aware of me intent rather on the men at the wall i drove my dagger into the belly of one which was pressing past me and in its rush it hardly understanding that it was wounded was carried dragged holding to the beast and dagger for fifty feet among the kurii i wrenched the dagger free and as another kur suddenly seeing me among them truly seeing me reached for me i thrust the dagger upward it is difficult to reach the kurs brain with so small a weapon it may be done however with the proper angle of elevation through the socket of the eye it may also be done through the ear and where the skull is thinner the temple the kur roared with pain and i lost the dagger it wrenched away as the kur threw its claws to its face it pulled loose the dagger howling then it reached for me i backed away it died before it reached me i pressed back and then on either side of me was with men weapons clashed at the line of war the golden chain i had received from bila huruma which he had returned to me retrieving it from our raiders canoe was covered with blood i saw a kur reaching over the wall behind our men i sprang upon the worn stone stairs leading at this point to the wall i kicked it back over the wail another finding footholds in the ancient stone clambered upward i removed the golden chain and lashed it in the face and it fell backwards from the wall to the stones some twenty feet below i raced along the walls top and thrust back one of the free trunks put against it two kurii leaped from it as it toppled i then saw a kur below within the wall it was behind our line of men it drew back the panga i leaped from the walls height to its shoulders and looped the golden chain about its neck it reached for me but could not dislodge me i kept my head low and my body away from the pangs i tightened the chain it flung itself against the wall and i was half crushed my back felt wet and bits of rock stung in my back i tightened the chain tenaciously i felt the claws of the kur tearing at my back i then felt the sudden rupture of the cartilage of its throat still it clawed at me it could make no sound its tongue was half bitten through the panga fell to the ground it stood unsteadily my hands were bloody on the golden chain its links deep almost unseen in the throat of the kur then it fell i leaped free of it and tore loose the chain looping its bloody links about my own neck i picked up the fallen panga to my horror the beast reached for me i saw its great lungs expand and its eyes looking at me it sucked air into its body through its ruptured throat blood emerged from its mouth it is not easy to kill a kur it reached again for me i struck it with the panga and then struck it again forgive me my friend i said the blows had not been those of a warrior but of a butcher i was unsteady and weak my hands had trembled i hoped that it would not regard itself as dishonored by my clumsiness i heard bila huruma rallying his men by the wall then he cried charge his audacity had taken the kurii by surprise but in moments viciously bila huruma kisu turgus ayari and the askaris had been forced back again the situation was hopeless and yet i think the kurii had been taught respect for men i saw a kur leader quickly and methodically aligning his beasts i doubted but what it would take more than one charge by the massed forces of the kurii to my surprise i saw the kur leader a huge brown kur doubtless from one of the far ships lift his panga in salute to the black ubar bila huruma then breathing heavily raised his stabbing spear in his dark and bloody fist askari hodari he cried i shook with emotion it was much honor he had done the beast not even human confronting him the salute of the kur commander had been acknowledged and returned the words bila huruma had uttered were of course in the native tongue of ushindi one might translate them in the context i suppose as brave soldier a better translation however i think especially since there is no other way to say this in the ushindi tongue is doubtless the simpler one warrior i have it we heard cry we looked to the stones at the threshold there stood msaliti an upraised bloody dagger in one hand and in the other held high over his head on its chain a dangling ring he has the ring i cried msaliti shook the chain over his head i have it i have it he cried i looked to the couch of shaba about it lay dead kurii and slaughtered askaris shaba coughing held his chest the poison ring the fang ring had been emptied msaliti had awaited his opportunity he had then fallen upon shaba from the wounds i adjudged shaba had been struck at least four or five times he had then seized the chain and ring and run to the threshold the kurii were between us and msaliti the kur commander raised his paw his lips drew back over his fangs it was a sign of kur triumph or pleasure then he swiftly communicated commands to his beasts msaliti leaped down from the stones and withdrew from the fortresslike enclosure the kurii facing us then snarling watching us not turning their backs began to withdraw they obeyed their commander he had won he would not now risk more of his beasts too he would wish to use them to guarantee the safe passage of the ring to his prearranged rendezvous from whence it would be eventually returned to the steel worlds or on this planet used devastatingly against men and priestkings i panga clutched in two hands lunged after the beasts kisu seized me holding me back bila huruma too interposed himself between me and our shaggy adversaries no cried kisu no cried bila huruma it is madness to follow stay with us tarl cried ayari turgus too seized an arm i could not free myself from kisu and turgus release me i said you can do nothing now said kisu they will destroy the bridge i said we will be prisoners here tonight is the full moon said ayari tonight if you wish you may wade through the fish unharmed tomorrow they will have returned to the lake release me i cried you can do nothing now said kisu i held watched the departure of the kurii they obedient to their orders withdrew i admired the kur commander that he had been able to instill in his fierce beasts such discipline as they withdrew some dragged with them the fallen bodies of askaris bila huruma hurried to the side of shaba i shook loose of turgus and kisu and ran to the stones at the threshold as i ascended to their height i saw the floating bridge cut free at our end it was then dragged to the opposite side and hauled onto the level between myself and the beasts there lay the broad uneasy moat some forty feet across stirring with the movements of the crowded fish i descended from the stones which had been piled in the threshold by shabas men the better to fortify the walled area i looked across the moat at the kurii kisu and turgus and ayari stood behind me on the other side of the moat msaliti lifted the chain and ring over his head i have won he cried the kur commander took the chain from him and looped it over his head i have won cried msaliti the kur commander than gave orders to one of his beasts msaliti screamed with misery as the animal lifted him high over his head and then threw him into the moat almost instantly msaliti was on his feet and then he screamed and fell and again regained his feet and fell again there was a thrashing about him a churning in the water and it seemed the water exploded with blood and bubbles msaliti as though moving through mud howling waded through the packed slippery voracious bodies i tore the raiders spear from kisu and extended it to msaliti who screaming grasped it we drew him from the water his feet and legs were gone we struck tenacious fish from his body he then lay on the level and we with strips of cloth tried to stanch his bleeding the kurii on the other side of the moat single file then padded away we fought to save msaliti finally with tourniquets we managed to slow and then stop the bleeding bila huruma then stood beside me on the level near the moat shaba is dead he said msaliti lifted his hand to the ubar my ubar he said bila huruma looked down at msaliti sadly then he said to his askaris throw him to the fish my ubar cried msaliti and then he was lost in the moat the fish swarming about him i suddenly felt janice clinging to my arm weeping there was leather on her throat and on her wrists anal ankles were the deep marks of freshly slashed binding fiber she and the other girls during the action had one by one been caught by kurii and put in throat coffle the coffle had then been dragged to a corner of the fortresslike enclosure there the girls without being removed from the coffle had been thrown on their bellies and bound hand and foot they had then been left there left for later squirming and helpless tied as fresh meat an askari after the withdrawal of the kurii had freed them oh my master wept janice holding me we are alive my master i looked bitterly across the moat i had failed then i held the girls head to my shoulder and as she wept i considered the fortunes of war i saw the narrow column of kurii disappear among the distant buildings i clasped the slave closely to me do not cry sweet slave i told her then i too but in bitterness and misery shed tears we will leave the ancient city i have examined the maps and notebooks i said to bila huruma were all recovered he asked yes i said we stood now on a broad level to it led the several flights of broad stairs ascending from that vast marble landing with its marble mooring posts which lies at the western edge of the ancient city that landing to which we had first come days ago after our crossing of the lake the great building with its tall columns some broken fallen aside in its ruins lay behind us flanking it on each side were the towering figures of stone warriors their stern gaze facing westward shabas galley and the three galleys and canoes of bila huruma and our raiders canoe which had served us so long and faithfully could be seen far below us where they were moored at the landing we looked out over the placid vast lake on the level to one side we had built a great pyre bila huruma himself with his own hands had cast the ashes of shaba high into the air where the wind would catch them and carry them over the city and to the jungles beyond a part of shaba thus would continue his geographers trek a bit of white ash blown on the wind evanescent but obdurate brief but eternal something irrevocably implicated in the realities of history and eternity this lake forming the source of the ua i said he named lake bila huruma cross that out said bila huruma write there instead lake shaba i will do so i said for a time bila huruma and i watched the galleys and canoes being readied for casting off hunting had been done supplies had been gathered of his forces bila huruma retained some ninety askaris of shabas men some seventeen survived i am a lonely man said bila huruma shaba was my friend yet you pursued him i said that you might overtake and slay him doing robbery upon him bila huruma looked at me puzzled no he said i followed him to protect him he was my friend in our plans he was to take one hundred galleys and five thousand men but he fled with three galleys and perhaps not even two hundred followers i wished to lend him the support and defense of ships and numbers you were not to accompany him on the originally projected expedition i said of course not he said i am a ubar then why did you follow him i asked i wanted the forces to get through he said shaba might have brought them through i might have brought them through i was not certain others could do so but you are a ubar i said i was also his friend said bila huruma to a ubar a friend is precious he said we have so few shaba told me i said that he had wronged you bila huruma smiled he regretted bringing me out upon the river by subterfuge he said yet he may have saved my life by fleeing the palace one attempt already had been made upon my life he thought that if he had fled i would no longer be in any immediate danger i nodded msaliti needing the protection of the ubar and his men on the river would surely desist at least temporarily in plotting against his life to be sure msaliti had no interest in slaying the ubar for its own sake such a murder was to be only a method for removing an obstacle in the path to the tahari ring did msaliti not encourage you to venture in pursuit of shaba i asked did be not inform you of something of great value which lay in the possession of shaba no said bila huruma an effort of such a nature was not necessary of his part i was determined he only begged to accompany me which permission i of course granted it seems i said that shaba expected me or another to follow him upon the river yes said bila huruma he did not expect to survive for some reason he wanted you to follow or another perhaps that his maps and notebooks might be returned safely to civilization it seems so i said why did he not expect to survive asked bila huruma the river the dangers illness i speculated the beasts surely said bila huruma yes i said the beasts too and you too said bila huruma surely you would have killed him to obtain whatever it was you sought yes i said had it been necessary i would have killed for what i sought it must be very precious said bila huruma i nodded it was i said was he asked the kurii took it i said those who attacked us the beasts i see he said shaba i said told me that he had used you for his purposes i think it was in that sense rather than in simply having brought you upon the river that he felt he had wronged you of this he spoke to me before he died said bila huruma i do not understand i said how you were used for his purposes is it not now clear he asked smiling no i said i was to protect you he said on your return downriver that the maps and notebooks might safely reach the environs of civilization i stood on the landing stunned kisu climbed the stairs to where we stood the galleys the vessels are ready he said very well said bila huruma we will join you momentarily i said kisu nodded and returned down the stairs to where the galleys and canoes were moored we were both tricked said bila huruma you do not seem bitter i said i am not he said we may burn the maps and notebooks i said of course he said i cannot do so i said nor i smiled the ubar we shall take them back to ushindi and you may then with a suitable escort convey them down the nyoka to schendi ramani of anango who was the teacher of shaba awaits them there shaba planned well i said i shall miss him sorely said bila huruma he was a thief and a traitor i said he was true to his caste said bila huruma a thief and a traitor i said angrily bila huruma turned away and looked back at the ruins of the huge building at the great stone statues worn and covered with vines and at the city lost and forgotten lying to the east there was once a great empire here he said it is gone now we do not even know who raised and aligned these stones forming walls and temples and laying out gardens and broad avenues we do not even know the name of this empire or what the people may have called themselves we know only that they built these things and for a time lived among them empires flourish and then it seems they perish yet men must make them or destroy them i said yes said bila huruma looking down then at the galleys and canoes kisu was there waiting for us yes he said some men make empires and others would destroy them which is the noblest i asked i think said bila huruma it is better to build than it is to destroy even though ones work may fall into ruin i inquired yes said bila huruma even though ones work may fall into ruin do you know i asked what i and msaliti sought from shaba of course he said shaba before he died told me all it was not rightfully his i said he was a thief and a traitor he was true to his caste said bila huruma i turned away from the ubar and began to descend the steps to the waiting vessels wait said bila huruma i turned to face him and he descended the stairs until he reached where i stood shaba he said asked me to give this to you it was concealed upon his person he pressed into my hand a large ring one too large for a human finger it was golden with a silver plate on the outside of the ring opposite the bezel was a circular recessed switch on the ring itself there was a tiny unmistakable scratch my hand trembled shaba said bila huruma asked me to extend to you his thanks and apologies he had need of the ring you see on the ua as you might expect he found it of great utility his thanks i asked his apologies he took the ring on loan so to speak said bila huruma he borrowed it he hoped you would not mind i could not speak it was his intention to return it himself said bila huruma but the attack of the beasts so sudden and unexpected intervened i closed my hand on the ring do you know what you are giving me i asked a ring of great power said bila huruma one which can cast upon its wearer a mantle of invisibility with such a ring i said you could be invincible perhaps smiled bila huruma why do you give it to me i asked it was the wish of shaba said bila huruma i had scarcely known such friendship could exist i said i am a ubar said bila huruma in my life i have had only two friends now both are gone shaba was one i said of course said bila huruma who was the other i asked the other i had killed he said what was his name i asked msaliti he said the explosion we leave the ancient city let us leave called kisu the ubar and i descended the steps together that we might make our departure from the landing from the eastern shore of lake shaba it was then that the explosion occurred it took place several pasangs away there was a blast of light a great towering blade of fire stormed upward against the tropical sky there was a vast spreading billowing cloud of dust and leaves the earth shook the waters of lake shaba roiled men cried out and girls screamed we felt a shock wave of great heat and saw trees falling there was a rain of rocks branches and debris and then it was quiet save for the water lapping against the landing and the sides of the wooden vessels to the southwest there was a darkness in the sky in places the tops of standing trees still burned then the fires no longer sustained by the heat of the blast one by one vanished unable to overcome the living freshness of the wood what was that asked kisu it is called an explosion i said what is its meaning asked bila huruma it means i think i said that it is now safe to descend the river i smiled to myself the false ring would never be delivered to the sardar let us proceed said bila huruma cast off the lines i called to the men soon the four galleys and the canoes including our raiders canoe were upon the lake i tied the tahari ring about my neck where it hung with the golden chain of bila huruma on my chest near me in the canoe wrapped in waterproof oiled skins and tied to a floatable frame were the map case and notebooks of shaba i looked back once at the city and once at the darkness in the sky to the southwest i then lowered my paddle and thrust back against the waters of the lake what occurred in nyundo the central village of the ukungu region where is aibu cried kisu we stood in the clearing of nyundo the central village of the ukungu region mwoga spear in hand a shield on his arm came out to greet us he is dead said mwoga tende behind kisu cried out with misery how did he die asked kisu by poison said mwoga i now am chieftain in ukungu my spear says it is not true said kisu my spear said mwoga says that it is true we shall then let them decide said kisu small leather strips customarily sheath the blades of the spears of ukungu both mwoga and kisu had now removed these tiny strips from their weapons the edges of the blades gleamed each man carried too a shield on the ukungu shield there is commonly a tuft of feathers this is fastened at one of the points of the shield when the tuft of feathers is at the bottom of the shield the shield being so held this is an indication that the hunter seeks an animal when the tuft of feathers is at the top of the shield the shield so held it is an indication that the quarry is human on both the shield of kisu and mwoga the tufts were now at the top i would make a better mfalme than aibu said mwoga it was thus that i had him killed the fight was brief and then kisu withdrew the bloodied point of his weapon from the chest of mwoga who lay at his feet you fight well said bila huruma will you now see to the slaughter of those who supported mwoga no said kisu my quarrel is not with them they are my fellow tribesmen they may remain in peace in the villages of ukungu once kisu said bila huruma you were little more than a kailiauk with the obstinacy and crudity of the kailiauks power quick to anger thoughtless in your charges now i see that you have learned something of the wisdom of one worthy to be a mfalme kisu shrugged proceed with us further to ushindi said bila huruma msaliti is gone i shall have need of one to be second in my empire better to be first in ukungu said kisu than second in the empire you are first in ukungu said bila huruma naming kisu to power i shall fight you from ukungu said kisu why asked ella huruma i will have ukungu free said kisu bila huruma smiled ukungu he said is free men cried out in astonishment clean now the blade of your spear kisu said bila huruma put once more upon it the sheathing strips of guarding leather turn your shield so that the feathers lie again at its base i will clean and sheath my spear said kisu i will turn my shield kisu handed his weapons to one of the villagers he and bila huruma embraced it was thus that peace came to ukungu and the empire i board again the palms of schendi i will take ship for port kar it is not necessary to chain me like this master said janice she knelt on the hot boards of the wharf at schendi her ankles were shackled and her small wrists locked behind her in slave bracelets a tight belly chain locked on her running to a heavy ring in the wood about a foot from her secured her in place she was stripped on her throat locked was a steel collar it read i am owned by bosk of port kar that is a name by which i am known in many parts of gor it has its own history before said janice looking up at me in my collar when i might have fled and did in port kar i was not even secured now when i know what i do what it is to be a slave girl on gor and would be terrified to so much as move from this place without permission i am heavily chained it is common to secure female cargo before loading i said it should have been done before yes master she said i looked down at her even if you were not chained and wished to escape i said i do not think such a venture would now be practical no master she said i am now branded i am now collared greetings said captain ulafi to me greetings said i to him is this the little troublemaker he asked looking down at janice i do not think she will cause you trouble now i said janice put her head down to the boards of the wharf forgive me master she said if i once displeased you lift your head said ulafi janice looked up at him how beautiful she has become said ulafi it is difficult to believe that she is the same girl he regarded her she has become a sensuous dream he said she is a slave i said i shrugged what fools men are to let any woman be free he said perhaps i said you wish to take passage again on the palms of schendi he asked for return to port kar with your permission captain i said the arrangements have been made he said i pressed into his hands the coins on which we had agreed we sail shortly he said with the tide when i had returned to schendi i had borne with me notes from the court of bila huruma the moneys which i had lost when apprehended in schendi for seizure and transportation to the canal had been returned to me i had obtained again too my sea bag and its enclosed articles i had received these back from the woman who had rented me the room off the street of tapestries the sea bag lay at my feet in it with my other things was a chain of gold which i had received long ago from bila huruma it had shared much of my equatorial odyssey about my neck on a leather string inside my tunic i wore the tahari ring i thought of bila huruma and the loneliness of the ubar i thought of shaba and his voyages of exploration the circumnavigation of lake ushindi the discovery and circumnavigation of lake ngao and the discovery and exploration of the ua even to the discovery of its source in the placid waters of that vast lake he had called lake bila huruma but by the wish of bila huruma i had changed its name to lake shaba he was surely one of the greatest if not the greatest of the explorers of gor i did not think his name would be forgotten i am grateful had said ramani of anango who had once been the teacher of shaba i had delivered to him and to two others of his caste the maps and notebooks of shaba ramani and his fellows had wept i had then left them returning to my lodgings copies would be made of the maps and notebooks they would then be distributed by caste brothers throughout the cities of civilized gor the first copies that were made by anyone had already however been made by the scribes of bila huruma in ushindi ramani need not know this will you continue work on the canal i had asked bila huruma yes he had said when lakes ushindi and ngao had been joined by the canal a continuous waterway would be opened between thassa and the ua one might then via either the kamba or the nyoka attain lake ushindi one might then follow the canal from ushindi to ngao from ngao one could enter upon the ua one could then for thousands of pasangs follow the ua until one reached its terminus in lake shaba and lake shaba itself was fed by numerous smaller streams and rivers each giving promise like the tributaries of the ua itself to the latency of new countries the importance of the work of bila huruma and shaba one a ubar the other a scribe and explorer could not in my opinion be overestimated i thought of small ayari with whom i had shared the rogues chain and my adventures upon the ua he wore now the robes of the wazir of bila huruma it was a wise choice i thought on the part of bila huruma ayari had proved his hardiness and worth in the journeys upon the ua he was facile with languages and had connections with the villages of nyuki on the northern shore of ushindi which was the territory of his fathers birth and because of his connections with kisu with the ukungu districts on the ngao beyond this he had been born and raised in schendi and accordingly spoke gorean fluently adding to these things his intelligence and his shrewdness and humanity he seemed to me ideally suited for his work such a man might profitably be employed by a ubar who wished to improve his relations not only with the interior but too with the city of schendi one of the major ports of civilized gor too ayari was one of the few men who had ascended the ua and lived to speak of it he would doubtless figure prominently in the longrange programs and plans of bila huruma in time i had little doubt that ayari would become one of the most important men in the equatorial regions of gor i smiled to myself there were probably few who thought that the little rogue of schendi the son of a lad who had once fled a village for stealing melons would one day stand at the side of a throne but i thought most fondly of kisu he who was now again mfalme in ukungu to this day as one may see upon the map the land of ukungu stands as a sovereign free state within the perimeter of the empire of bila huruma before bila huruma had left the village of nyundo central village of the ukungu villages he had spoken to kisu if you wish he had said indicating tende who knelt beside them i will take this slave and arrange for her sale in schendi i will then have whatever moneys she brings returned to you thank you ubar had said kisu but i will keep this woman in ukungu is it your intention to free her asked bila huruma no had said kisu excellent had said bila huruma she is too beautiful to be free tende had looked up at kisu i will try to please my master well she had said we had remained that night in the village of nyundo i remembered the feast well in addition to its political importance it had given the talunas an opportunity to learn to dance and serve their progress in femininity had not been much advanced by their work at the oars of a galley i smiled in our journey downriver we had found the small people marching the talunas westward to sell them the talunas stripped were being marched in tandem pairs each pair fastened in the long coffle two forked sticks are lashed together the fork of the first stick goes to the back of the neck of the first girl another stick then is thrust crosswise under the chin of the first girl and tied on the fork holding her in the fork the fork of the second lashed stick is before the throat of the second girl another stick then is thrust crosswise behind the neck of the second girl and lashed in place the hands of each girl are tied behind their backs each pair bound and fastened in the sticks is then added as a unit to the coffle the second girl in one pair unless she is the last in the long line and the first girl in the succeeding pair unless she is the first in the long line are fastened together by neck ropes thus is the coffle formed when we found the talunas being herded along by the small people we had brought our vessels to shore we bought the entire band of captive talunas for a crate of beads and five pangas we relieved the caught beauties of the coffle and chained them four to a bench to certain of the thwarts of one of the galleys oars we then thrust in their hands four girls to one oar that they might be able to move the levers there were enough girls in this arrangement for five oars to a side with one girl left over who could carry food and water to her laboring sisters a long chain was run lengthwise in the galley and fastened to rings at both stem and stern the left ankle of the extra girl the fetchandcarry girl who was already in wrist rings joined by a foot of chain was then locked in one of two ankle shackles joined by about eighteen inches of chain the right ankle shackle was then passed under the long chain and snapped shut about her right ankle she was thus by her lovely legs and body and shackled ankles literally fastened about the long chain which served then as a slaves runchain permitting her movement but strictly by intent controlling its scope she might move back and forth lengthwise in the galley and to the benches performing her labors but could not leave the vessel or indeed even touch its bulwarks too it did not permit her to move as far as its rudder on this galley the floating prison for the talunas both those on the benches chained to the thwarts and the fetchandcarry girl we put five askaris one for the rudder for the river galley is single ruddered and four should the girls at the oars require encouragement or the fetchandcarry girl be in any way not completely pleasing with whips the river must be made safe had said bila huruma when the right ankle of the fetchandcarry girl the last girl to be chained had been snapped in its shackle fastening her by chain and body about the runchain what will you do with them i asked i will have them sold in schendi he said i think that many of the talunas did not realize that their labors at the oar were intended to be temporary before the first ahn was out many were sweating and moaning with pain begging that they might be released to be taught the more typical softer labors of the female slave it was hard to blame them for the oar of a river galley is normally drawn by a strong man if the journey had not been downriver i do not think it would have been practical to put them at oars at all the fetchandcarry girl of course scolded the talunas for their weakness the next day however it was she herself who sweated at an oar crying out in pain under the whips of the vigilant askaris while another took her place she had not realized that the fetchandcarry girl would be changed daily in this way no taluna would have to spend more than forty consecutive days at an oar it had not taken the original fetchandcarry girl more than an ahn at the oar incidentally before she too had begged to be relieved of its pain that she might be taught lighter duties even those involving perfumes and silks more fitting more suitable to the bodies and dispositions of female slaves the wharves were busy i saw two slave girls nude and chained being delivered to a ship the talunas last night in a lot had been sold to the black slavers of schendi the entire lot had gone for only two silver tarsks i had then seen them one by one heads down crawl to the slave circle there they had rendered submission to men they were then placed in wrist and throat coffle their left wrists linked by one chain their fair throats by another and led away they would be kept for a time in one of the underground pens beneath one of the fortresses of the black slavers they would be given balms for their backs and oils for their blistered hands and taught the duties of slaves in a few weeks they would be ready healed and cleaned and to some extent trained for the northern markets girls such as talunas silked and perfumed and placed under the iron will of a man make superb slaves two however who had once been talunas would not be with them these were the blondhaired girl who had once been their leader whom i decided to name lana and the darkhaired girl who had been her second in command now the slave of turgus he had named her fina i looked to my left on the wharf the blondhaired girl who had been the taluna leader now the slave girl lana knelt there near her too was alice both girls were stripped and had their hands braceleted behind their back they were chained by the neck to the same ring master said the girl who had been the taluna leader lana yes i said you are taking me to port kar she said yes i said it is natural for a girl to fear the very name of that city will men be cruel to me in port kar she asked you will be treated as the slave you are i said she shuddered there is a saying in gorean that the chains of a slave girl are heaviest in port kar i did not think truthfully however that port kar was unusual in its treatment of female slaves gorean men generally are not easy with them the saying is probably motivated not so much by an objective analysis of the treatment of enslaved women in that city as by the fear and distrust which port kar has historically precipitated in the hearts of its enemies if i had to make a choice i would suspect that it might be most difficult for a woman to wear her chains in the city of tharna there are complex historical reasons for this tharna is one of the few gorean cities in which the great majority of its women are enslaved normally only about one in forty or so gorean women in the cities is enslaved free gorean women incidentally enjoy a prestige and status which it seems to me is higher than that of the normal earth woman what is done in port kar asked lana to a girl who is not found to be fully pleasing commonly i said she is bound hand and foot and thrown to the urts in the canals she looked at me aghast the chain was lovely on her throat fastening her kneeling to the ring on the wharf she pulled against the slave bracelets confining her hands behind her back but could not of course free herself i would try if i were you i said to please my master i will try desperately to please him she said see that you do i said yes master she said alice put her cheek to my thigh i then felt her lips at my thigh as she kissed me i put my hand in her hair and roughly affectionately shook her head she looked up at me please keep me at least for a little time she said perhaps i said thank you master she said i looked down at her she like janice i thought would somewhere sometime make someone a superb love slave until that time let her be put out again and again on the market ngoma who was of the crew of ulafi and two other crew members then came up to me we shall be sailing soon he said the cages are ready i nodded i freed janice of her shackles bracelets and belly chain she remained kneeling she had not been given permission to rise ngoma put his hand in her hair i then freed alice and lana of their bracelets and neck chains they too remained kneeling for they too had not received permission to rise the two other crew members then put their hands in their hair ngoma looked at me i nodded put them in their cages i said he pulled janice to her feet holding her head at his hip and then leading her behind him bent over conducted her up the gangplank to the deck of the palms of schendi it will soon be time to board called ulafi to me he was on the stern castle of his vessel very well i said his first and second officers gudi and shoka were near him i looked about there were as yet two empty slave cages on the deck of the palms of schendi cages for which i had arranged ho here i called to the man from the tavern of pembe he saw me and hurried toward me dragging a leashed blindfolded sweetly hipped naked slave with him her hands were braceleted behind her back when he reached me he kicked her legs from beneath her and she knelt trembling at my feet he removed her leash and bracelets he then roughly removed the collar of the tavern of pembe from her throat ngoma i called the man from the tavern of pembe then unknotted her blindfold and tore it away from her head oh cried she who had been evelyn ellis looking up at me blinking startled i own you now i said it had been she who had once served kurii in this city yes master she said ngoma coming down the gangplank arrived at my side i recalled her well from before when she had served shaba msaliti and myself i recalled her well too from the tavern of pembe i was the first months ago to have taught her something of the meaning of a collar i had purchased her last night unknown to herself when she had not been on the floor of the tavern she had cost two silver tarsks oh master she cried overjoyed submit i said swiftly she knelt back on her heels her knees wide and lifted and extended her arms wrists crossed as though for binding her head was down between her arms i submit myself fully and as a slave she said i tied her wrists together and locked a collar on her drawn from my sea bag i am yours she said you are evelyn i said yes master she said thank you master put her in a cage i said to ngoma it will be done he said evelyn was led away drawn by the hair bent over to be thrust in one of the small slave cages on the deck these cages at their corners by chains are fastened to cleats this prevents their movement in rough weather i thought of janice i smiled yesterday afternoon for the first time i had spoken in english to her you speak english she had cried startled of course i had said but she moaned i spoke in english before you when i thought you could not understand i revealed my inmost thoughts and feelings to you totally yes i said oh she wept what an exposed slave you made me of course i said are you of earth she asked no she said a man such as you could never have been of earth i was once of earth i said long ago i looked at her i am now however like yourself only of gor she had then knelt before me i beg to be used by my gorean master she said i then took her by the arms and threw her to the furs master master cried sasi running toward me her hands braceleted behind her back i took her in my arms you are looking well pretty little slut i said the man from the tavern of filimbi to which she had been sold after i had been taken from schendi some months ago was but a few feet behind her he had unleashed her that she might run to me she still wore a brief work tunic from the tavern with the sign of the tavern a flute on its back filimbi was the name of the proprietor but it is also an inland word for flute in the morning tavern girls sometimes wear work tunics as certain labors such as laundering and scrubbing may be set them in the afternoon and evening of course they are dressed if they are dressed at all for the pleasure of the proprietors customers sometimes particularly in low paga taverns the girl will be permitted to wear besides her brand and collar only perfume or if the proprietor wishes perfume and chains like evelyn i had bought sasi yesterday without her knowledge for delivery to the wharf this morning she cost me two and five two silver tarsks and five of copper you did not forget me she cried you are too pretty to forget i told her the man from the tavern of filimbi removed the bracelets from her wrists then as she looked down shyly an unexpected modesty in a slave he unsashed parted and drew away the work tunic she wore it was after all the property of the tavern she was exquisite kneel and submit slave i said swiftly then did she kneel and submit herself totally as a slave to me swiftly then were her wrists bound and her throat encircled in my collar it is time to board called ulafi greetings turgus i said as he came up to me it was nice of you to come to see me off who is this marvelous little slave who kneels at your feet he asked looking down at sasi surely you recognize your former accomplice of port kar i asked she he asked then he said lift your head girl sasi lifted her head yes master she said is it you sasi he asked yes master she said marvelous he said your own slave fina i said referring to the darkhaired girl kneeling behind him and to his left has also shown considerable improvement in beauty she put down her head happily she was in a brief tunic she was collared once i recalled she had been second in command among the talunas turgus had picked her out from among them some forty girls to be his personal slave his choice had been excellent once a cold and arrogant taluna the girl knelt now happily at his heels she had been taught submission and love from my sea bag i handed turgus a letter in this letter i said i have inscribed a petition that you be pardoned for your offenses in port kar it is addressed to the council of captains that body sovereign in port kar of which i am a member with this letter you may if you wish return to the city it is my expectation that the council will rule favorably on the pardon if they do not you will at least have ten days in which to take your departure from the city he took the letter i am grateful he said but why would the council rule favorably he asked we have fought together i said that is true he said will you return to port kar i asked i have moneys here in schendi he said notes which i have drawn upon my return from the ua moneys connected with my fees for accompanying shabas expedition they will last me many months it is less dangerous now for an outlander to remain in schendi i said since ayari became wazir to bila huruma yes he grinned no longer now did bila huruma demand men from schendi for the canal this alteration in policy in itself had inaugurated a new era and climate in the relations between schendi and the empire of bila huruma i had little doubt but what ayari had clarified to bila huruma the value of the friendship and facilities of the men of schendi with this letter i said indicating the document you may return when you wish i would advise you however should the ruling as i would expect be in your favor to consider the adoption of an honest occupation if the magistrates do not apprehend you you might in port kar run afoul of the caste of thieves they are sometimes jealous of their prerogatives he smiled i think i may go to a new city he said i think i may make a new beginning somewhere perhaps i will go to turia or ar they are great cities i said rich in opportunities for the shrewd and ambitious i looked at him do you regret i asked what has occurred to you in these past months no he said i have had the honor of serving with shaba and with yourself i have traveled the ua i have witnessed her source these things are grand he then looked back and down at the girl kneeling near him and too he said i have found a wondrous slave she put down her head smiling joyful that her master had spoken highly of her though she was only a slave then again he looked at me he smiled i have no regrets he said i am not dissatisfied i am well pleased we clasped hands i wish you well i said i wish you well he said it is time to board called ulafi i lifted sasi to her feet and then threw her over my shoulder i reached down with my free hand and picked up my sea bag i then ascended the gangplank and boarded the palms of schendi
