the flashman papersthat great collection of manuscript discovered in a saleroom in leicestershire in continues the career of the author harry flashman from the point where the first instalment ended in the autumn of the first packet described his expulsion from rugby school in and followed his subsequent military career in england india and afghanistan the second packet covers two separate periods of several months in and there is an intriguing fouryear gap which the author seems to indicate he has covered elsewhere in his memoirs the present instalment is of historical importance insofar as it describes flashmans encounters with several persons of international celebrityincluding one most eminent statesman whose character and actions may now be subjected to some reappraisal by historians it also establishes a point of some literary interest for there can be no doubt that a link exists between flashmans german adventure and one of the bestselling novels in the victorian period as with the first packet i have confined myself to correcting the authors occasional lapses in spelling where flashman touches on known history he is remarkably accurate especially when one considers that he was writing in his eighties wherever he appears to make a minor slip i have left it uncorrected in the text but i have added such notes and comments as seemed appropriate like most memorialists flashman is vague about exact dates where these can be established i have entered them in the notes gmf royal flash if i had been the hero everyone thought i was or even a halfdecent soldier lee would have won the battle of gettysburg and probably captured washington that is another story which i shall set down in its proper place if brandy and old age dont carry me off first but i mention the fact here because it shows how great events are decided by trifles scholars of course wont have it so policies they say and the subtly laid schemes of statesmen are what influence the destinies of nations the opinions of intellectuals the writings of phiosophers settle the fate of mankind well they may do their share but in my experience the course of history is as often settled by someones having a bellyache or not sleeping well or a sailor getting drunk or some aristocratic harlot waggling her backside so when i say that my being rude to a certain foreigner altered the course of european history it is a considered judgement if i had dreamed for a moment how important that man was going to be id have been as civil as the devil to him yesmelording and stroking his back but in my youth and ignorance i imagined that he was one of those to whom i could be rude with impunity servants tarts bagmen shopkeepers and foreignersand so i gave my unpleasant tongue free rein in the long run it nearly cost me my neck quite apart from changing the map of the world it was in when i was barely out of my teens but already famous i had taken a distinguished part in the fiasco known as the first afghan war emerged with a heros laurels been decorated by the queen and lionised all over london the fact that i had gone through the campaign in a state of abject terrorlying deceiving bluffing and running for dear life whenever possible was known to no one but myself if one or two suspected they kept quiet it wouldnt have been fashionable to throw dirt at the valiant harry flashman just then so there i was in big bluff handsome harry beloved of london society admired at the horse guards possessed of a beautiful wife apparently affluent seen in the best company gushed at by the mamas respected by the men as the perfect beau sabreur the world was my oyster and if it wasnt my sword that had opened it no one was any the wiser they were golden days those the ideal time to be a hero is when the battle is over and the other fellows are dead god rest em and you take the credit even the fact that elspeth was cheating me made no real difference you would never have thought to see her angelic face golden hair and expression of idiotic innocence that she was the biggest trollop that ever wore out a mattress but i was certain before id been home a month that she was having it off with at least two others at first i was furious and plotting revenge but she had the money you see through that damned old scotch moneybags of a father of hers and if i had played the outraged husband id have been in queer street without even a roof over my head so i kept quiet and paid her out by whoring to my hearts content it was a strange situation we both knew what was what but we pretended to be a happily married couple we still bounced about in bed together from time to time and enjoyed it but the real life was to be had outside respectable society apart i was in with the fast set idling gaming drinking and raking about the town it was the end of the great days of the bucks and blades we had a queen on the throne and her cold white hand and her pokerbacked husbands were already setting their grip on the nations life smothering the old wild ways in their cometojesus hypocrisy we were entering into what is now called the victorian age when respectability was the thing breeches were out and trousers came in bosoms were being covered and eyes modestly lowered politics was becoming sober trade and industry were becoming fashionable the odour of sanctity was replacing the happy reek of brandy the age of the corinthian the plunger and the dandy was giving way to that of the prig the preacher and the bore at least i was in at the death of that wicked era and did my bit to make it die hard you could still gamble in the hells about hanover square carouse with the toughs in the cyder cellars or leicester fields take your pick of the wenches in piccadilly set on the police at whitehall and pinch their belts and hats break windows and sing bawdy songs all the way home fortunes were still lost at cards and hazard duels were fought life could still be openly wild if you cared for it it has never been the same since they tell me that young king edward does what he can nowadays to lower the moral tone of the nation but i doubt if he has the style for it the man looks like a butcher one night my chum speedicut who had been with me at rugby and had come sucking round me since my rise to fame suggested we should go to a new haunt in st james i think it was the minor club in fact we could try our luck at the tables first and then at the wenches upstairs he said and afterwards go to the cremorne and watch the fireworks topping the night off with devilled ham and a bowl of punch and perhaps some more girls it sounded all right so after collecting some cash from elspeth who was going to store street to listen to one mr wilson sing scottish songs i set off with speed for st james it was a frost from the start on the way to the club speed was taken with the notion of boarding one of the new buses he wanted to argue with the cad about the fare and provoke him into swearing the bus cads were quite famous for their filthy language and speed reckoned it would be fun to have him get in a bate and horrify the passengers but the cad was too clever for speed he just turned us off without so much as a damnyoureyes and the passengers tittered to see us made asses of which did nothing for our dignity or good temper and the club turned out to be a regular hellthe prices even for arrack and cheroots were ruinous and the faro table was as crooked as a line of russian infantry and a damned sight harder to beat its always the same the more genteel the company the fouler the play in my time ive played nap in the australian diggings with golddust stakes held a blackjack bank on a south sea trader and been in a poker game in a dodge city livery stable with the pistols down on the blanketand ive met less sharping in all of em put together than youd find in one evening in a london club we dropped a few guineas and then speed says this aint much fun i know a better game i believed him so we picked up two of the cyprians in the gamingroom and took them upstairs to play loo for each others clothes i had my eye on the smaller of the two a pert little redhaired piece with dimples thinks i if i cant get this one stripped for action in a dozen hands then ive lost my talent for palming and dealing from the bottom but whether id taken too much drinkfor we had punished a fair amount of arrack dear as it wasor the tarts were cheating too the upshot was that i was down to my shirttail before my little minx had removed more than her shoes and gloves she was trilling with laughter and i was getting impatient when a most unholy din broke out on the floor below there was a pounding of feet and shouting whistles blowing and dogs barking and then a voice yelled cut and run its the traps christ says speed grabbing for his breeches its a raid lets get out of this flash the whores squeaked with panic and i swore and struggled into my clothes its no joke trying to dress when the peelers are after you but i had sense enough to know that there wasnt a hope of escaping unless we were fully cladyou cant run through st james on a fine evening with your trousers in your hand come on speed was shouting theyll be on us in a moment what shall we do wails the redhaired slut do what you dam well please says i slipping on my shoes goodnight ladies and speed and i slipped out into the corridor the place was in uproar it sounded like a battle royal down on the gamingfloor with furniture smashing and the cyprians screaming and someone bawling in the queens name on our landing there were frightened whores peeping out of the doorways and men in every stage of undress hopping about looking for somewhere to run to one fat old rascal stark naked was beating on a door bawling hide me lucy he beat in vain and the last i saw of him he was trying to burrow under a sofa people nowadays dont realise that in the forties the law was devilish hot on gaminghells the police were forever trying to raid them and the hellowners used to keep guarddogs and scouts to watch out for them most hells also had special hiding places for all gambling equipment so that cards dice and boards could be swept out of sight in a moment for the police had no right of search and if they couldnt prove that gaming had been going on they could be sued for wrongful entry and trespass evidently they had caught the minor st james club napping with a vengeance and it would be police court and newspaper scandal for us if we couldnt cut out pretty sharp a whistle shrilled at the foot of the stairs the trollops screamed and slammed their doors and feet came pounding upwards this way says i to speed and we darted up the next flight it was another empty landingthe top oneand we crouched by the bannisters waiting to see what happened they were hammering on the doors below and presently someone came scampering up he was a fair chinless youth in a pink coat oh my god says he what will mother say he stared wildly round where can i hide in there says i thinking quickly and pointed at a closed door god bless you says he but what will you do well hold em off says i get out of it you fool he vanished inside and i winked at speed whipped his handkerchief from his breast and dropped it outside the closed door then we tiptoed to a room on the other side of the landing and took cover behind its door which i left wide open from the lack of activity on this floor and the dustsheets in the room it obviously wasnt in use presently the peelers came crashing up spotted the kerchief gave a great view halloo and dragged out the pink youth but as i had calculated they didnt bother with our room seeing the door open and naturally supposing that no one could be hiding in it we stood dead still while they tramped about the landing shouting orders and telling the pink youth to hold his tongue and presently they all trooped off below where by the sound of things they were marshalling their prisoners and being pretty rough about it it wasnt often they raided a hell successfully and had a chance to mistreat their betters by george flashy whispered speed at last youre a foxy one and no mistake i thought we were done when youve been chased by bloody afghans says i you learn all there is to know about lying low but i was pleased at the way my trick had worked just the same we found a skylight and as luck had it there was a convenient flat roof close by over what proved to be an empty house we prised up another skylight crept down two flights of stairs and got out of a back window into a lane so far excellent but speed thought it would be capital to go round the front and watch from a safe distance while the peelers removed their victims i thought it would be fun too so we straightened our clothes and then sauntered round into the end of the street sure enough there was a crowd outside the minor club to see the sport the bobbies were there in their high hats and belts clustering round the steps while the prisoners were brought down to the closed carts the men silent and shamefaced or damning their captors for all they were worth and the trollops crying for the most part although some had to be carried out kicking and scratching if we had been wise we would have kept well clear but it was growing dusk and we thought wed have a closer look we strolled up to the fringe of the crowd and as bad luck had it who should be brought out last wailing and whitefaced but the youth in the pink coat speed guffawed at the woebegone look of him and sang out to me i say flashy what will mother say the youth must have heard he twisted round and saw us and the spiteful little hound gave a yelp and pointed in our direction they were there too he cries those two they were hiding as well if we had stood fast we could have brazened it out i dare say but my instinct to run is too deep ingrained i was off like a hare before the bobbies had even started towards us and seeing us run they gave chase at once we had a fair start but not enough to be able to get out of view and duck into a doorway or area st james is a damned bad district to fly from the police instreets too broad and no convenient alleyways they were perhaps fifty yards behind for the first two streets but then they began to gaintwo of them with their clubs out yelling after us to stop i could feel myself going lame in the leg i had broken earlier in the year at jallalabad the muscles were still stiff and pains shot through my thigh at every stride speed saw what was up and slackened his pace hallo flash says he are you done for legs gone says i i cant keep up any longer he glanced over his shoulder in spite of the bad name hughes gives him in tom browns schooldays speedicut was as game as a terrier and ready for a turnup any timenot like me at all oh well then says he the deuce with this lets stand and have it out with em theres only twono wait though there are more behind damn em well just have to do the best we can old son its no use i gasped im in no state to fight you leave em to me cries he ill hold em off while you get out of it dont stand there man dont you see it wont do for the hero of afghanistan to be dragged in by the traps hellish scandal doesnt matter for me though come on you bluebellied bastards and he turned in the middle of the road sparring away and daring them to come on i didnt hesitate anyone who is ass enough to sacrifice himself for flashy deserves all he gets over my shoulder i saw him stop one trap with a straight left and close with the other then i was round the corner hobbling away as fast as my game leg would carry me it took me along that street and into the square beyond and still no bobbies hove in view i doubled round the central garden and then my leg almost folded under me i rested gasping against the railings faintly behind me i could hear speed still singing defiance and then the nearer patter of feet looking round for somewhere to hide i saw a couple of carriages drawn up outside a house fronting onto the railed garden they werent far and the two drivers were together talking by the horses in the first one they hadnt seen me if i could hobble to the rear coach and crawl in the peelers would pass me by hopping quietly is difficult but i got to the coach unseen by the drivers opened the door and climbed in i squatted down out of sight heaving to get my breath back and listening for sounds of pursuit but for several moments all was still they must be off the scent thinks i and then i heard a new sound mens and womens voices were coming from the doorway of one of the houses there was laughter and cries of goodnight some chattering on the pavement and the sound of footsteps i held my breath my heart pounding and then the carriage door opened light came in and i found myself staring into the surprised face of one of the loveliest girls i have ever seen in my life nothe loveliest when i look back and review the beautiful women i have known blonde and dark slim and buxom white and brown hundreds of the creaturesstill i doubt if there was one to touch her she was standing with one foot on the step her hands holding back the skirts of her red satin gown bending forward to display a splendid white bosom on which sparkled a row of brilliants matching the string in her jetblack hair dark blue eyes very large stared down at me and her mouth which was not wide but very full and red opened in a little gasp god save me exclaims she a man what the devil are you doing sir it wasnt the kind of greeting you commonly heard from ladies in the young queens day i may tell you any other would have screamed and swooned thinking quickly i decided that for once truth would answer best im hiding says i i can see that says she smartly she had a most lovely irish lilt to her voice who from and why in my carriage if you please before i could answer a man loomed up at her elbow and at sight of me he let out a foreign oath and started forward as though to protect her please please i mean no harm i said urgently im being pursued the police no im not a criminal i assure you i was in a club that was raided the man just stared at me but the woman showed her teeth in a delightful smile and then threw her head back chuckling i smiled as ingratiatingly as i could but for all the effect my charm had on her companion i might as well have been quasimodo step out at once snaps he in a cold clipped voice at once do you hear i conceived an instant dislike for him it was not only his manner and his words but the look of him he was big as big as i was slimhipped and broadshouldered but he was also damned handsome he had bright grey eyes and one of those cleancut faces beneath fair hair that make you think of moral norse gods too splendid altogether to be in the company of the beauty beside him i started to say something but he barked at me again and then the woman came to my aid oh let him be otto says she cant you see hes a gentleman i would have thanked her gratefully but at that moment there were heavy feet on the pavement and a grave voice inquiring if the gentleman had seen anyone running through the square the peelers were on the scent again and this time i was cornered but before i could move or speak the lady had seated herself in the coach and hissed getup off the floor you booby i obeyed in spite of my leg and dropped gasping into the seat beside her and then her companion damn his eyes was saying here is your man constable arrest him if you please a police sergeant poked his head in at the door surveyed us and said to the fair man doubtfully this gentleman sir of course who else well the bobby was puzzled seeing me sitting there large as life are you sure sir the fair man rapped out another foreign oath and said of course he was sure he called the sergeant a fool oh stop it otto says the lady suddenly really sergeant its too bad of him hes making game of you this gentleman is with us rosanna the fair man looked outraged what are you thinking of sergeant i dont play the fool otto says i taking my cue and delighted to have my hand squeezed by the lady come on man get in and lets be off home im tired he gave me a look of utter fury and then a fine altercation broke out between him and the sergeant which the lady rosanna seemed to find vastly amusing the coachee and another constable joined in and then suddenly the sergeant who had been frowning oddly in my direction while the argument raged stuck his head into the coach again and says wait a minnit i know you dont i youre capn flashman bigod i admitted it and he swore and slapped his fist the ero of julloolabad cries he i smiled modestly at miss rosanna who was looking at me wideeyed the defender of pipers fort cries the sergeant well well says i its all right sergeant the ector of afghanistan cries the sergeant who evidently studied the press damme well eres a go he was beaming all over his face which didnt suit my denouncer at all angrily he demanded that i be arrested he is a fugitive he declared he invaded our coach without permission i dont give a dam if e invaded buckinam palace without permission says the sergeant turning back to me corporal webster sir third guards under major macdonald at ougoumont sir honoured to know you sergeant says i shaking his hand honours mine sir deed it is now then you sir lets ave no more of this youre not english are you i am a prussian officer says the man called otto and i demand capn flashman is a british officer so you dont demand nothink says the sergeant now then lets ave no trouble he touched his hat to us and gave me a broad wink wish you goodnight sir an you maam i thought the german would have an apoplexy he looked so wild and his temper was not helped by the lovely rosannas helpless laughter he stood glaring at her for a moment biting his lip and then she controlled herself sufficiently to say oh come along otto get into the coach oh dear oh dear and she began laughing again i am happy you are amused says he you make a fool of me it is of a piece with your conduct of this evening he looked thoroughly vicious very good madam perhaps you will regret it dont be so pompous otto says she its just a joke come and i prefer choicer company says he that of ladies for example and clapping on his hat he stepped back from the carriage door oh the devil fly away with you then cried she suddenly angry whip up driver and then i had to open my mouth leaning across her i called to him how dare you talk so to a lady damn you says i youre a foulmouthed foreign dog i believe if i had kept silent he would have forgotten me for his temper was concentrated on her but now he turned those cold eyes on me and they seemed to bore like drills for a moment i was frightened of the man he had murder on his face i shall remember you says he and then oddly i saw a look of curiosity come into his eyes and he stepped a pace closer then it was gone but he was memorising me and hating me at the same time i shall remember you he said a second time and the coach jerked forward and left him standing by the gutter in spite of the momentary fear he had awakened in me i didnt give a button for his threatsthe danger was past i had recovered my breath and i could devote my attention to the important question of the beauty alongside me i had time to examine the splendour of her profilethe broad brow and ravenblack hair the small ever so slightly curved nose the pouting red cupids bow the firm little chin and the white round breasts pushing themselves impudently up from the red satin gown the scent of her perfume the sidelong look of her dark blue eyes and the wanton husky irish voice were all invitations as anyone will tell you put harry flashman next to a woman like that and one of two things is inevitablethere will either be screams and slaps or the lady will surrender sometimes both in this case just from the look of her i knew there would be no screaming and slapping and i was right when i kissed her it was only a moment before her mouth opened under mine and i promptly suggested that since my leg was still painful a womans touch on it would soothe the cramp out of my muscles she complied very teasingly and with her free hand was remarkably skilful at fending off my advances until the coach reached her house which was somewhere in chelsea by this time i was in such a state of excitement that i could barely keep my hands still while she dismissed her maid and conducted me to her salon talking gaily about anything and acting the cool minx i soon put a stop to that by popping her breasts out the minute the door was closed and bearing her down on to the settee her reaction was startling in a moment she was grappling with me digging her nails into me and twining her limbs round mine the fury of her lovemaking was almost frighteningive known eager women plenty of them but miss rosanna was like a wild animal the second time later in the night was even more feverish than the first we were in bed by then and i had no clothing to protect me from her biting and raking nails i protested but it was like talking to a mad woman she even began to leather me with something hard and heavya hairbrush i believeand by the time she had stopped writhing and moaning i felt as though i had been coupling with a roll of barbed wire i was bruised scratched bitten and stabbed from neck to backside in between she was a different creature gay talkative witty and of a gentleness to match her voice and looks i learned that she was marie elizabeth rosanna james no less the wife of a fellowofficer who was conveniently out of town on garrison duty like myself she was recently returned from india where he had been stationed she found life in london deadly dull such friends as she knew were stiff and boring there was hardly any of the bright life she craved she wished she was back in india or anywhere she might have some fun that was why my appearance in her carriage had been so welcome she had spent a preposterously dull evening with her husbands relatives escorted by the german otto whom she found stuffy to a degree just the sight of a man who looked as though he had some oh some spunk in himwas enough for me says she i wouldnt have turned you over to the police my dear not if you had been a murderer and it was a chance to take down that conceited prussian muffwould you believe that a man who looks so splendid could have ice and vinegar in his veins who is he i asked otto oh one of these germans making the grand tour in reverse sometimes i think theres a bit of the devil in him but he keeps it well hid he behaves so properly because like all foreigners he likes to impress the english tonight just to try and breathe some life into that collection of prigs i offered to show them a spanish danceyou would have thought id said something indecent they didnt even say oh my dear just turned their heads to one side the way these english women do as though they were going to be sick she tossed her head enchantingly kneeling on the bed like a naked nymph but i saw the glitter in ottos eyes just for an instant ill be bound hes not so prim among the german wenches at schonhausen or wherever it is i thought there was too much of otto and said so oh yes are you jealous then says she sticking out her lip at me youve made a bad enemy there my dear or is the famous captain flashman careless of enemies they dont concern me german french or nigger says i i dont think much of your otto at all well you should says she teasing for hes going to be a great man some dayhe told me so i have a destiny he said whats that i asked him to rule says he so i told him i had ambitions tooto live as i please love as i please and never grow old he didnt think much of that i fancy he told me i was frivolous and would be disappointed only the strong he said could afford ambitions so i told him i had a much better motto than that what was that says i reaching out for her but she caught my hands and held them apart looking wicked courageand shuffle the cards says she damned sight better motto than his says i pulling her down on top of me and im a greater man than he is anyway prove itagain said miss rosanna biting at my chin and at the cost of more scratches and bruises i did that was the beginning of our affair and a wild feverish one it was but it couldnt last long for one thing she was so demanding a mistress that she came near to wearing me out and if she was a novelty she was one i didnt altogether enjoy she was too imperious and i prefer softer women who understand that it is my pleasure that counts not with miss rosanna though she used men it was like being eaten alive and god help you if you werent ready to command everything had to be at her whim and i got sick of it it was about a week after our first meeting that i finally lost my temper we had had a tempestuous night but when i wanted to go to sleep she had to chatter onand even a husky irish voice can get sickening when youve heard too much of it and seeing me inattentive she suddenly shouts on guard which was her warcry before a tumble and jumped on me again in heavens name says i get off im tired nobody gets tired of me she flashed back and started teasing me into action but i was pegged out and told her to let me alone for a moment she persisted and then she was sulky and then in an instant she was in a raging fury and before i knew it i had given her the back of my hand and she was coming at me like a wildcat screaming and clawing now ive dealt with raging women before but id never met anything like her she was dangerousa beautiful naked savage flinging everything that came within reach calling me the foulest names andi admit it freelyterrorising me to the point where i grabbed my clothes and ran for it bastard and coward was the least of it i remember and a chamber pot smashing on the doorjamb as i blundered through i roared threats at her from the corridor at which she darted out white with fury flourishing a bottle and i didnt stay for more one way and another ive probably had more practice in dressing running than most men but this time i didnt bother until id got out of shot at the foot of the stairs i was badly shaken i can tell you and not my own man again till i was well away from her house and pondering in my philosophic way on means of getting my own back on the vicious badtempered slut it will seem to you to be the usual sordid conclusion to so many flashman amours but i have dwelt on it at some length for good reason it wasnt only that she was in her way as magnificent a creature as ive ever had the good fortune to mount and comes back to my mind whenever i see a hairbrush that alone would not be sufficient no my excuse is that this was my first encounter with one of the most remarkable women in my lifeor in the life of anyone in the nineteenth century for that matter who could have guessed then that marie elizabeth rosanna james would turn a crowned head rule a great kingdom and leave a name to compare with dubarry or nell gwynn well she was flashys girl for a week at least which is something to boast of but i was glad to be shot of her at the time and not just because of the way she treated me i discovered soon after that she hadnt been altogether truthful about herself she hadnt mentioned for example that her soldier husband was in the process of divorcing her which would have been enough to scare me away to less controversial beds if id known it sooner apart from the unpleasant social aspects of being cited i couldnt have afforded it but she was important in my life in another wayshe had been the means of my meeting the splendid otto you could say that it was through her that the mischief was born between him and me and our enmity shaped his future and the worlds nothing might have come of it though had i not run into him again by pure chance a month or so later it was at tom percevals place in leicestershire where i joined a party to see nick ward fight some local pug and to do a little hunting in toms coverts young conyngham who was a fool of a gambler was there and old jack gully who had once been champion of england and was now a rich ironmaster and retired from the house of commons as well there were about a dozen others whom ive forgotten and speedicut toowhen id told him how id spent the night of his arrest he just roared with laughter and tried flashys luck well only the brave deserve the fair and be insisted on telling everyone how it had happened himself lying in a dirty cell full of drunkards while i was bumping a beauty most of the company were at toms place when i arrived and when he met me in the hall he told me theyre all old acquaintances but one a foreigner that i cant get rid of damn him friend of my uncles and wants to see something of our rustic ways while hes here trouble is hes full of bounce and some of the fellows are rather sick of it already it meant nothing until i went into the gunroom with him where the boys were cheering up the cold night with punch and a roaring fire and who should be there very formal in long coat and trousers among all the buffs and boots but otto he stiffened at the sight of me and i brought up short the fellows gave a hurrah when i came in and thrust punch and cheroots at me while tom did his duty by the stranger baron says hethe brute has a title thinks i permit me to present captain flashman flash this is baron otto von er dammit von schornhausen aint it cant get my confounded tongue round it schonhausen says otto bowing stiffly with his eyes on mine but that is in fact the name of my estate if you will pardon my correction my family name is bismarck its an old mans fancy no doubt but it seemed to me that he said it in a way that told you you would hear it again it meant nothing to me of course at the time but i was sure that it was going to and again i felt that prickle of fear up my back the cold grey eyes the splendid build and features the superb arrogance of the man all combined to awe me if youre morally as soft as butter as i am with a good streak of the toadeater in you theres no doing anything with people like bismarck you can have all the fame that i had then and the good looks and the inches and the swaggerand i had those toobut you know youre dirt to him if you have to tangle with him as the americans say you know youll have to get drunk first i was sober so i toadied honoured to make your acquaintance baron says i giving him my hand trust youre enjoying your visit we are already acquainted as im sure you remember says he shaking hands he had a grip like a vice i guessed he was stronger than i was and i was damned strong in body at least you recollect an evening in london mrs james was present by god says i all astounded so i do well well and here you are eh damme i never expected well baron im glad to see you aye hum i trust mrs james is well surely i should ask you says he with a thin smile i have not seen the lady since that evening no well well i havent seen a great deal of her lately myself i was prepared to be pleasant and let bygones be bygones if he was he stood smiling with his mouth considering me do you know says he at length i feel sure i have seen you before but i cannot think where that is unusual for i have an excellent memory no not in england have you ever been in germany perhaps i said i hadnt oh well it is of no interest says he coolly meaning that i was of no interest and turned away from me i hadnt liked him before but from that moment i hated bismarck and decided that if ever the chance came to do him a dirty turn i wouldnt let it slip past me tom had said he was full of bounce and at supper that night we got a good dose of it it was very free and easy company as you can imagine with no women present and we ate and drank and shouted across the table to our hearts content getting pretty drunk and nobody minding his manners much bismarck ate like a horse and drank tremendously although it didnt seem to show on him he didnt say much during the meal but when the port went round he began to enter the conversation and before long he was dominating it ill say this for him he wasnt an easy man to ignore you would have thought that a foreigner would have kept mum and watched and listened but not he his style was to ask a question get an answer and then deliver judgementfor instance he says to tom what was the hunting like and tom remarking that it was pretty fair bismarck said he looked forward to trying it although he doubted if chasing a fox could hold a candle to the boarhunting he had done in germany since he was a guest no one pulled his leg although there were a few odd looks and laughs but he sailed on lecturing us about how splendid german hunting was and how damned good at it he was and what a treat we were missing not having wild pigs in england when he had done and there was one of those silences speed broke it by remarking that i had done some boarhunting in afghanistan the fellows seemed to be looking to me to take the talk away from bismarck but before i had the chance he demanded in afghanistan in what capacity were you there captain flashman everyone roared with laughter at this and tom tried to save his guest embarrassment by explaining that i had been soldiering there and had pretty well won the war singlehanded he neednt have minded for bismarck never turned a hair but began to discourse on the prussian army of all things and his own lieutenants commission and how he regretted that there were so few chances of active service these days well says i you can have any that come my way and welcome the fellows roared but bismarck frowned you would avoid dangerous service says he i should just think i would says i winking at speed if only they had known how true that was damned unpleasant dangerous service bullets swords chaps killing each otherno peace and quiet at all when the laughter had died down tom explained that i was joking that i was in fact an exceptionally brave man who would miss no chance of battle and glory bismarck listened his cold eye never leaving me and then would you believe it began to lecture us on a soldiers duty and the nobility of serving ones country he obviously believed it too he rolled it out so solemnly and it was all some of the younger men could do to keep their faces straight poor old tom was in an anguish in case we offended his guest and at the same time obviously nearly out of patience with bismarck i wish to god my uncle had found some other poor devil to bearlead him says he later to speedicut and me was there ever a bigger bore and ass how am i to deal with the fellow eh we couldnt help him in fact i resolved to keep as far out of bismarcks way as possible he unsettled me he was so damned superior tom was wrong in one thing bismarck wasnt an ass whatever else he might be in some ways he was like that outstanding idiot cardigan under whom i had served in the th hussars but only on the surface he had the same splendid certainty in everything he said and did he looked on the world as created for him alone he was right and that was that but where cardigans arrogant eye had the shallow stare of the born fool bismarcks didnt you could see the brain at work behind it and those who listened only to his rather monotonous sermonisings and noticed only his lack of humourof our kind of humour anywayand put him down as a pompous dullard were well wide of the mark i wanted nothing to do with him anyway but in that short visit at toms place bismarck still contrived to touch me on the raw twiceand in the only two things that i am any good at too coward and rascal that ive always been i have had two talents for foreign tongues and for horses i can master almost any language in short time and ride anything with a mane and tail looking back i can almost believe that bismarck smelled these two gifts and set out to hip me over them i dont remember how the conversation at one breakfast came to touch on foreign speechusually it was women and drink and horses and pugs with an occasional high flight on something like the scandalous rate of income tax at d in the pound but it did and my gift was mentioned bismarck lounging back in his chair gave a sneering little laugh and said that it was a useful talent in headwaiters i was furious and tried to think of some cutting retort but couldnt later it occurred to me that i might have fixed him with a look and said it was also a useful gift in german pimps but it was too late then and you could never be quite sure with his remarks whether he was jibing or simply stating what he thought was a fact so i just had to ignore him the second setdown came on a days hunting when we had had poor sport and were riding home conyngham drawing rein on top of a slight rise from which you could see miles of rolling countryside in every direction points to a church which was just visible in the distance through the late afternoon haze and cries out whos for a steeplechase oh too much of a fag says tom anyway its getting dark and the beasts may go wrong i vote for home steeplechase says bismarck what is that it was explained to him that the object was to race straight across country for the steeple and he nodded and said it was an excellent sport good for you cries conyngham come on you fellows you flashy are you game too far says i for like tom i didnt fancy taking hedges on wettish country with the light starting to fail nonsense cries bismarck what gentlemen are the english backward in their own game then you and i marquis shall we have it out together with you tallyho yells conyngham and of course the other asses took off after them i couldnt hang back so cursing bismarck i clapped in my heels and gave chase conyngham led the field over the first meadows with bismarck dose behind but a couple of hedges checked them and the rest of us caught up i hung back a little for steeplechasing in the style of your oldfashioned bucks when you just go hellforleather at everything is as quick a road to a broken neck as i know if you have an eye for ground and watch how the leaders jump and land you can reap the benefit of their discoveries without the risk of going first so i rode a nice easy chase for the first mile or so and then we came into light woodland with trees well spaced out and i touched my hunter and moved up there is a moment every jockey knows when he feels his mount surge forward and he lies with his head down being brushed by the mane and sees the gap narrowing ahead of him and knows he has the legs of the field i felt it then as i thundered past the ruck hearing the thud of the hooves and seeing the clods thrown up from the wet turf feeling the wind in my face as the trees flew past even now i see the scarlet coats in the fading light and smell the rainsodden country and hear the yelps of the fellows as they cheered each other on and laughed and cursed god it was good to be young and english then we thundered through the woodland like a charge of dragoons and were out on a long rising incline conyngham held the lead to the crest but as we came over and down it was the turn of the heavier men bismarck went past him and then i too we pounded down to the hedgerow bismarck went over like a birdhe could ride i may sayand i launched my hunter at the same gap and came through on his heels i stayed with him over hedges lanes ditches and fences until i saw the steeple perhaps half a mile away and now thinks i is the time to get my nose in front i had the speed in hand his head came round as i drew level and he hammered in his heels and plied his crop but i knew i had the distance of him he was leading by half a length as we took a rail fence then we were on pasture with only one hedge between us and the common that ran up to the churchyard i inched up level and then led by a head scanning the distant hedge for a good jump it was a nasty one high hawthorn with trees at intervals throwing their shade over the hedgerow there was one place that looked likely where the hawthorn thinned and only a couple of rails covered the gap i clapped in my heels and made for it first over was a certain winner as we closed in with me half a length in front i realised that even at the rails the jump was a good five feet i didnt half fancy it for as hughes pointed out flashman was good only at those games which didnt entail any physical risk but there was nothing for it i had bismarck headed and must keep my lead so i steadied the hunter for the jump and then out of nowhere came bismarcks grey at my elbow challenging for the jump give way i roared my jump damn your eyes by god he paid not the slightest heed but came boring in neck and neck with me for the fence we were almost knee to knee as we rushed down on it get out blast you i yelled again but he was just staring ahead teeth clenched and whip going and i knew in an instant that it was a case of pull up or have the most unholy smash as two horses tried to take a jump where there was only space for one as it was i came within an ace of a hellish tumble i reined back and at the same time tried to swerve from the gap the hunter checked and swung away and we scraped along the face of the hedge with no more damage than a few scratches while master bismarck cleared the rails with ease by the time i had trotted back cursing most foully the rest of the chase was thundering up bismarck was waiting at the lychgate looking cool and smug when we arrived dont you know to give way to the leader says i boiling angry we might have broken our necks thanks to you come come captain flashman says he it would have been thanks to you if we had for you would have been foolishly challenging the stronger rider what says i and who the devil says you are the stronger rider i won did i not says he it was on the tip of my tongue to say that he had ridden foul but the way the other chaps were hallooing and telling him what a damned fine race he had ridden i thought better of it he had gone up in their estimation he was a damned goodplucked un they shouted and they clapped him on the back so i contented myself with suggesting that he learn the rules of horsemanship before he rode in england again at which the others laughed and cried thats right flash damn his eyes for him and made a joke out of bluff flashys bad temper they hadnt been close enough to see exactly what had happened and none of them would have imagined for a minute that neckornothing flashman would give way in the breach but bismarck knew and it showed in his eyes and the cold smile he gave me but i had my own back on him before the week was out and if my initial rudeness in london was the first spark in the mischief between us what was now to come really started the fire it was on the last day after we had been to see the fight between nick ward the champion and the local pug it was a good afternoons sport with the pug getting his nose broken and half his teeth knocked out bismarck was greatly interested and seemed to enjoy watching the loser being battered as much as i did myself at supper that night the talk was naturally of the fight and old jack gully who had refereed held the floor he wasnt normally an overtalkative man despite the fact that he had been an mp but on his two lovesthe prize ring and horsefleshhe was always worth listening to though it was more than thirty years since he had held the belt himselfand since retiring he had become most prosperous and was well received everywherehe had known and seen all the greatest pugs and was full of stories of such giants as cribb and belcher and the game chicken of course the company would have listened all nighti dont suppose there was a man in england peel russell or any of them who could have commanded such universal attention as this quiet old boxing champion he must have been close to sixty then and whitehaired but you could see he was still fit as a flea and when he talked of the ring he seemed to light up and come alive bismarck i noticed didnt pay him much attention but when jack paused after a story our german suddenly says you make very much of this boxing i see now it is an interesting enough spectacle two of the lower orders thrashing each other with their fists but does it not become boring after a while once or even twice perhaps one might go to watch but surely men of education and breeding must despise it there was a growl round the table and speed says you dont understand it because youre a foreigner it is our game in england why in germany according to what youve said fellows fight duels without any intent to kill each other but just to get scars on their heads well we wouldnt think much of that let me tell you the schlager endows a man with honourable scars says bismarck what honour is there in beating an opponent with your fists besides our dueling is for gentlemen well as to that mynheer says gully smiling gentlemen in this country aint ashamed to use their fists i know i wish id a guinea for every coroneted head ive touched with a straight left hand mine for one any time you please jack cries conyngham but in the use of the schlager there is soldierly skill bismarck insisted and rapped his fist on the table oho thinks i whats this has our prussian friend perhaps got a little more liquor on board than usual he was a mighty drinker as ive said but it occurred to me that he might not be holding it so well tonight if you think theres no skill in prizefighting my friend youre well out of court says one of the others a heavyfaced guardee named spottswood didnt you see ward this afternoon take the starch out of a chap three stone heavier than himself oh your fellow ward was swift and strong says bismarck but speed and strength are common enough i saw no sign of skill in that butchery and he emptied his glass as though that settled the matter well sir says old jack smiling there was skill aplenty and you can take my word for it you wouldnt see it cos you dont know what to look for just as i wouldnt know what to look for in your schlagwhatyoucallems no says bismarck likely you would not and the tone of his voice made gully look sharp at him although he said nothing then tom perceval sensing that there might be trouble if the subject wasnt changed started to say something about hunting but i had seen my chance to set this arrogant prussian down and i interrupted him perhaps you think boxing is easy says ito bismarck dye fancy you could hold your own in a mill he stares at me across the table with one of those brawlers says he at length a gentleman does not come to physical contact with those people surely we dont have serfs in england says i there isnt a man round this table wouldnt be glad to put em up with nick wardaye and honoured too but in your casesuppose there was a sporting german baron whose touch wouldnt sully you would you be ready to try it with him hold on flash says perceval but i carried on or a gentleman from among ourselves for example would you be ready to go a round or two with one of us those cold eyes of his were damned uncomfortable on me but i held his gaze for i knew id got him he considered a moment and then said is this a challenge good god no says i only you think that our good old game is just a brawl and id like to show you different if i were asked id be ready enough to try my hand at this schlager business of yours well what dye say i see you are smarting for revenge after our race the other day says he smiling very well captain i shall try a round with you i believe he had weighed me up for a coward who wouldnt be much good in which he was right and that he also thoughtlike many another ignoramusthat boxing was pure brute force and nothing more in which he was wrong also he had seen that a good part of it was body wrestling of which no doubt he had some experience and he knew he was pretty well as big and strong as i but i had a surprise in store for him not with me says i im no nick ward anyway my idea is instruction not revenge and the best instructor in the whole wide world is sitting within ten feet of you and i nodded at gully all i intended was to make a fool of bismarck which i knew gully could do with one hand behind his back and so cut his comb for him i hadnt any hope that gully would hurt him for unfortunately old jack like most champions was a gentle kindly sort of fool indeed at my proposal he burst out laughing lord flashy says he dye know how much i used to be paid to come up to scratch and you want to see it free you dog but bismarck wasnt laughing that is a foolish proposal says he mr gully is too old gullys laugh was wiped off his face at once now wait a moment mynheer says he but i was ahead of him again oh is that it says i you wouldnt be chary about milling with a professional would you everyone was talking at once of course but bismarcks voice cut through them i have no interest in whether he is a professional or not or the fact that he was once in jail says i but only in the fact that he is very much older than i as to his being in prison what has that to do with anything you know best about that says i sneering now dammit hold on here says perceval what the devil is all this flashy ah im sick of his airs says i and his sneers at jack there all right hes your guest tom but he goes a bit far let him put up or shut up i only suggested he should try a round with a real boxer to show him that his jibes were wide of the mark and he turns up his nose as though gully werent good enough for him its the wrong side of enough i say not good enough roars jack whats this no one said anything of the sort cries tom flashy i dont know what youre driving at but captain flashmans intention is apparently to annoy me says bismarck he has not succeeded my only objection to boxing with mr gully was on the score of his age thatll do about my age thankee says jack going red im not so old i cant deal with anyone who dont know his place they calmed him down and there was a lot of hubbub and noise and nonsense and the upshot was that most of them being slightly fuddled anyway got the notion that i had suggested friendlylike to bismarck that he try a round with gully and that somehow he had insulted old jack and looked down on him it was spottswood who calmed things over and said there was no cause for shouting or hard feelings the point is does the baron want to try his hand in a friendly spar thats all if so jackll oblige wont you jack no no says jack who was cooled again why i havent stood in a ring for thirty years man besides he added with a smile i didnt understand that our guest was eager to try me that brought him a lofty look from bismarck but spottswood says tell ye what jack if youll spar a round or two with him ill sell you running ribbons he knew jacks weak spot you see running ribbons was own brother to running reins and a prime goer jack hummed and hawed a bit saying no no his fighting days were long done but the fellows seeing him waver and delighted at the thought of watching the famous gully in action urged him on cheering him and slapping him on the shoulder well well says jack at last for his flash of illtemper had quite gone now and he was his placid self if you must have it ill tell you what ill do to convince the baron here that theres maybe more in the noble art than meets his eye ill engage to stand up in front of him with my hands down and let him try to plant me a few facers what dye say to that sir he asks bismarck the german who had been sitting very disdainful looked interested despite himself you mean you will let me strike you without defending yourself jack grins at him i mean ill let you try says he but i must strike youunless you run away i reckon youre not too clever in our lingo yet says jack smiling but looking keen what with too old and running away you know but dont worry mynheerill stand my ground there was a great commotion while the table was thrust against one wall and the carpet rolled up and everyone piled furniture to the sides of the room to leave space for the exhibition perceval was the only one who wasnt delighted at the prospect taint fair says he not to a guest i dont like it yell not hurt him jack dye hear not a hair of his head says old jack but his vanity may be a bit bruised when he discovers it aint so easy to hit a good milling cove as he imagines says speed laughing thats what i dont like either says perceval it looks as though were making a fool of him not us says i hell be doing it himself and serve the german windbag right says spottswood whos he to tell us our faults damn him i still dont like it says perceval curse you flash this is your doing and he mooched away looking glum at the other end of the room conyngham and one of the other chaps were helping bismarck off with his coat you could see he was wondering how the devil he had got into this but he put a good face on it pretending to be amused and interested when they fastened the gloves on him and jack and explained what was expected of him spottswood led the two of them to the centre of the floor where a line had been chalked on the boards and holding one on either hand called for silence this aint a regular mill says he no no says spottswood this is a friendly exhibition in the interests of good sportsmanship and friendship between nations our old and honoured friend jack gully champion of champions at this there was a great hurrah which set old jack grinning and bobbinghas generously engaged to let herr otto von bismarck stand up to him and try if he can to hit him fair on the head and body mr gully engages further not to hit back but may if he wishes use his hands for guarding and blocking i shall referee cries of shame watch out for him baron hes a wrong unand at my word the contestants will begin and leave off agreed now baron you may hit him anywhere above the waist are you ready he stepped back leaving the two facing each other it was a strange picture the big candelabra lit the room as clear as day shining on the flushed faces of the spectators sitting or squatting on the furniture piled round the panelled walls on the sporting prints and trophies hung above them on the wide empty polished floor on the jumble of silver and bottles and piled plates on the table with its winestained cloths on the two men toe to toe at the chalk line there was never a stranger pair of millers in the history of the game bismarck in his shirt and trousers and pumps with the big padded mauleys on his fists may have been awkward and uncertain but he looked well tall perfectly built and elegant as a rapier with his fair cropped head glistening under the light he reminded me again of a nasty norse god his lips were tight his eyes narrow and he was studying his man carefully before making a move gully on the other handoh gully in my time ive seen mace and big jack heenan and little sayers and i watched sullivan beat ryan and took off oscar wilde over that fight too but i doubt if any of them could have lived with gully at his best not that i ever saw that best but i saw him face up to bisinarck nearly sixty years old and that is enough for me like most poltroons i have a sneaking inward regard for truly fearless strong men fools though they may be and i can have an academic admiration for real skill so long as i dont suffer by it gully was fearless and strong and incredibly skilful he stood on the balls of his feet head sunk between his massive shoulders hands down his leathery brown face smiling ever so slightly his eyes fixed on bismarck beneath beetling brows he looked restful confident indestructible time cries spottswood and bismarck swung his right fist jack swayed a little and it went past his face bismarck stumbled someone laughed and then he struck again right and left the right went past jacks head the left he stopped with his palm bismarck stepped back looking at him and then came boring in driving at jacks midriff but he just turned his body sideways lazily almost and the german went blundering by thumping the air everyone cheered and roared with laughter and bismarck wheeled round whitefaced biting his lip jack who didnt seem to have moved more than a foot regarded him with interest and motioned him to come on again slowly bismarck recovered himself raised his hands and then shot out his left hand as he must have seen the pugs do that afternoon jack rolled his head out of the way and then leaned forward a little to let bismarcks other hand sail past his head well done mynheer he cried that was good left and right thats the way try again bismarck tried and tried again and for three minutes jack swayed and ducked and now and then blocked a punch with his open hand bismarck flailed away and never looked like hitting him and everyone cheered and roared with laughter finally spottswood called time and the german stood there chest heaving and face crimson with his efforts while jack was as unruffled as when he started dont mind em mynheer says he theres none of em would ha done better and most not so well youre fast and could be faster and you move well for a novice are you convinced now baron says spottswood bismarck having got his breath back shook his head that there is skill i admit says he at which everyone raised an ironical cheer but i should be obliged he goes on to jack if you would try me again and this time try to hit me in return at this the idiots cheered and said he was damned game and a sportsman and perceval said he wouldnt have it and demanded that the bout should stop at once but old jack smiling his crooked smile says no no tom this fellows more of a boxing man than any of you know id not care to mill with anyone who didnt hit back ill spar gentlelike and when he goes home he can say hes been in a fight so they went to it again and jack moved about now smooth as a dancer for all his years and tapped his glove on bismarcks head and chin and body while the other smashed away at him and hit nothing i encouraged him by hawhawing every time he missed for i wanted him to realise what an ass he looked and he bore in all the harder flailing at jacks head and shoulders while the old champion turned feinted and slipped away leaving him floundering thats enough shouts someone time out you fellows and lets drink to it and there were several voices which cried aye aye at which jack dropped his hands and looked to spottswood but bismarck rushed in and jack in fending him off with a left tapped him a little harder than he meant to and bloodied his nose that stopped the german in his tracks and jack all crestfallen was stepping in to apologise when to everyones amazement bismarck ran at him seized him round the waist swung him off his feet and hurled him to the floor he landed with a tremendous crash his head striking the boards and in a moment everyone was on his feet shouting and cheering some cried foul while others applauded the germanthey were the drunker onesand then there was a sudden hush as jack shook his head and slowly got to his feet he looked shaken and furious too but he had himself in hand all right mynheer says he i didnt know we was holding and throwing i dont suppose anything like it had happened to him in his life before and his pride was wounded far worse than his body my own fault for not looking out says he well well let it go you can say youve downed john gully and he looked round the room slowly as though trying to read what everyone was thinking best stop now i think says he at last you do not wish to continue cries bismarck he looked fairly blown but the arrogant note in his voice was there as ever gully stared at him a moment best not says he the room was uncomfortably quiet until bismarck laughed his short laugh and shrugged his shoulders oh very well says he since you do not wish it two red spots came into jacks pale cheeks i think its best to stop now says he in a hard voice if youre wise mynheer youll make the most of that as you please says bismarck and to my delight he added it is you who are ending the bout you know jacks face was a study spottswood had a hand on his shoulder and perceval was at his side while the rest were crowding round chattering excitedly and bismarck was looking about him with all his old bounce and side it was too much for jack right says he shaking spottswood off put your hands up no no cries perceval this has gone far enough i quit to nobody says jack grim as a hangman end the bout is it ill end it for him sure enough for gods sake man says perceval remember who you are and who he is hes a guest a stranger a stranger who threw me foul says old jack he dont know the rules it was a mistake it was a fair throw no twasnt old jack stood breathing heavily now lookee says he i give it him he threw me not knowing it was an unfair advantage when i was off guard on account of having tapped his claret i give it him he was angry and didnt think cos id been making a pudding of him ill shake hands wi him on all of thatbut i wont have him strutting off and saying i asked to end the fight nobody says that to meno not tom cribb himself by god everyone began to yammer at once perceval trying to push them away and calm jack down but most of us well content to see the mischief increaseit wasnt every day one could see gully box in earnest which he seemed ready to do tom appealed to bismarck but the german smiling his superior smile just says i am prepared to continue after that try as tom might he was overruled and presently they were facing up to each other again i was delighted of course this was more than i had hoped for although i feared that gullys good nature would make him let bismarck off lightly his pride was hurt but he was a fairminded fool and i guessed he would just rap the german once or twice smartly to show him who was master and let it go at that perceval was hoping so at all events go easy jack for gods sake he cried and then they set to i dont know what bismarck hoped for he wasnt a fool and gully had demonstrated already that the german was a child in his hands i can only suppose that he thought he had a chance of throwing gully again and was too damned conceited to escape gratefully at any rate he went in swinging both arms and jack rapped him over the heart and then cracked him a neat left on the head when he was off balance which knocked him down time cries spottswood but bismarck didnt understand and bounding up he rushed at gully and with a lucky swing caught him on the ear jack staggered righted himself and as if by instinct smacked two blows into bismarcks belly he went down gasping and wheezing and perceval ran forward saying that this was the end he would have no more of it but the german when he had straightened up got his breath back and wiped the trickle of blood from his nose was determined to go on gully said no and bismarck sneered at him and the upshot was that they squared away again and gully knocked him off his feet but still he got up and now gully was sickened and refused to go on and when he held out his hand bismarck struck at him at which gully hammered him one in the face which sent him headlong and on the instant gully was cursing himself for a badtempered fool and calling for spottswood to take off his gloves and tom was raising bismarck off the floor and a splendidly gory face he presented too and there was a tremendous hubbub with drunk chaps crying shame and stop the fight and hit him again and perceval almost crying with mortification and gully stamping off in a corner swearing he hadnt meant to hurt the fellow but what could he do and bismarck whitefaced being helped into one of the chairs where they sponged his face and gave him brandy there were apologies and protestations and gully and bismarck finally shook hands and jack said he was ashamed of himself as an englishman and would bismarck forgive him bismarck with his mouth puffed and split where jacks last blow had caught him and his fine aristocratic nose crusted with his own bloodid have given twenty guineas to see it properly smashedsaid it was nothing and he was obliged to mr gully for the instruction he then added that he was capable of continuing and that the fight had not been stopped at his request at which old jack took a big breath but said nothing and the others cheered and conyngham cried good for the prussian a dam game bird he is hurrah this was the signal for the drinking to start again in earnest while two of the company flown with pugilistic ardour put on the mauleys and began to spar away drunkenly and losing their tempers finished up savaging each other on the floor perceval stayed by bismarck muttering apologies while the german waved them away and sipped brandy through his battered mouth gully simply went over to the sideboard and poured drink into himself until he was completely foxed no one had ever seen him so shaken and unhappy before or known him drink more than the most modest amount but i knew why he was doing it he was ashamed it is a terrible thing to have ideals and a conscience to say nothing of professional pride he told me later he would have been better to suffer being thrown beating bismarck had been the most shameful thing he ever did he said id have been delighted to do it personally if id had his skill id have left that german upstart without a tooth in his head as it was when the boozing was at its height and the uproar was deafening i chanced by where bismarck was still sitting sipping delicately at his glass he turned and caught my eye frowned and said still i cannot place you captain it is most intriguing but it will come back no doubt however i trust you were not disappointed with your evenings entertainment it might have been better says i grinning at him even so you contrived very well i have you to thank for these and he touched his lips and reddened nose one day i shall hold you to your promise and show you the schlager play i look forward to that we shall see how much credit you obtain from my countrys sport more than youve got from mine i hope says i laughing let us hope so says he but i doubt it go to the devil says i he turned away chuckling to himself after you i think one of the difficulties of writing your memoirs is that they dont run smooth like a novel or play from one act to the next ive described how i met rosanna james and otto but beyond a paragraph in the times announcing her divorce from captain james towards the end of the year i didnt hear of her again for months as for bismarck it was a few years before i ran into him again and then it was too soon so in the first place i must skip over a few months to my second meeting with rosanna which was brought about because i have a long memory and a great zeal in paying off old scores she had put herself on the debit side of flashys ledger and when the chance came to pay her out i seized on it it was the following summer while i was still in london officially waiting for uncle bindley at the horse guards to find me an appointment and in fact just lounging about the town and leading the gay life it wasnt quite so gay as it had been for while i was still something of an idol in military circles my gloss was beginning to wear a bit thin with the public yesterdays hero is soon forgotten and while elspeth and i had no lack of invitations during the season it seemed to me that i wasnt quite so warmly feted as i had been i wasnt invariably the centre of attraction any longer some chaps even seemed to get testy if i mentioned afghanistan and at one assembly i heard a fellow say that he personally knew every damned stone of pipers fort by now and could have conducted sightseers over the ruins thats by the way but it was one of the reasons that i began to find life boring me in the months that followed and i was all the readier for mischief when the chance came i forgot exactly what took me to one of the haymarket theatres on an afternoon in maythere was an actress or an acrobat she may have been whom i was pushing about just then so it may have been her in any event i was standing in the wings with some of the gents and mooners during a rehearsal when i noticed a female practising dancesteps on the other side of the stage it was her shape that caught my eye for she was in the tight fleshings that balletdancers wear and i was admiring her legs when she turned in profile and to my astonishment i recognised rosanna she was wearing her hair a new way parted in the centre and held behind her head in a kerchief but there was no mistaking the face or the figure splendid piece aint she says one of the mooners they say lumleyhe was the managerpays her a fortune pon my soul i would myself what oho i thought to myself whats this i asked the mooner offhand who she might be why shes his new danseuse dont you know says he it seems that opera hasnt been bringing in the tin lately so lumley imported her specially to dance between the acts thinks shell make a great hit and with those legs ill be bound she will see here and he pushed a printed bill into my hand it read her majestys theatre special attraction mr benjamin lumley begs to announce that between the acts of the opera donna lola montez of the teatro real seville will have the honour to make her first appearance in england in the original spanish dance el oleano aint she a delight though says the mooner gad look at em bouncing when she struts thats donna lola montez is it says i when does she perform dye know opens next week says he therell be a crowd and a half shouldnt wonder oh lovely lola well id never heard of lola montez but i saw there was something here that needed going into i made a few discreet inquiries and it seemed that half the town was talking about her already for lumley was making a great todo about his beautiful new attraction the critics were slavering in advance about the belle andalusian and predicting a tremendous success but nobody had any notion that she wasnt a genuine spanish artiste at all but i was in no doubt about her id been close enough to rosanna james to be sure at first i was just amused but then it occurred to me that here was a heavensent opportunity to have my own back on her if she was exposed denounced for what she really was that would put paid to her making a hit it would also teach her not to throw pisspots at me but how to do it best i pondered and in five minutes i had it pat i remembered from the conversations we had had during our passionate week her mention of lord ranelagh who was one of the leading boys about town just then she was forever chattering about her admirers and he was one she had turned down snubbed him dead in fact i knew him only to see for he was a very topflight corinthian and didnt take much heed even of heroes if they werent out of the top drawer but all id heard suggested that he was a firstclass swine and just the man for me i hunted him out at his club slid inside when the porter wasnt looking and found him in the smokeroom he was lying on a couch puffing a cigar with his hat over his brows i spoke right out lord ranelagh says i how are you im flashman he cocked an eye lazily under the brim of his hat damned haughty im certain i havent had the honour says he good day to you no no you remember me says i harry flashman you know he pushed his hat right back and looked at me as if i was a toad oh says he at length with a sneer the afghan warrior well what is it i took the liberty of calling on your lordship says i because i chanced to come across a mutual acquaintance i cannot conceive that we have any drawls he unless you happen to be related to one of my grooms i laughed merrily at this although i felt like kicking his noble backside for him but i needed him you see so i had to toadeat him not bad not bad says i but this happens to be a lady im sure she would be of interest to you are you a pimp by any chance if so no my lord im not says i but i thought you might be diverted to hear of mrs jamesmrs elizabeth rosanna james he frowned and blew ash off his ridiculous beard which covered half his shirtfront what of her and what the devil has she to do with you why nothing my lord says i but she happens to be taking the stage at her majestys next week masquerading as a famous spanish dancer donna lola montez she calls herself and pretends to be from seville an impudent imposture he digested this while i watched his nasty mind working how dye know this says he ive seen her at rehearsal says i and theres no doubt about itshes rosanna james and why should this be of interest to me i shrugged at this and he asked what my purpose was in telling him oh i was sure you would wish to be at her first performanceto pay your respects to an old friend says i and if so i would solicit a place for myself in your party i entertain the same affection for her that im sure your lordship does he considered me youre a singularly unpleasant creature says he why dont you expose her yourself since thats obviously what you want your lordship im sure has a style in these things and you are well known while i i didnt want to be the centre of any scandal although i wanted to have a front seat to see the fun i can do your dirty work eh well well youll go that is no concern of yours says he good day may i come my dear sir i cannot prevent you going where you choose but i forbid you absolutely to address me in public and he turned over on his side away from me but i was satisfied no doubt he would go and denounce donna lola he had his own score to pay off and was just the sort of mean hound who would do it too sure enough when the fashionable crowd was arriving at her majestys the following monday up rolls lord ranelagh with a party of bloods in two coaches i was on hand and tailed on to them at the door he noticed me but didnt say anything and i was allowed to follow into the omnibusbox which he had engaged directly beside the stage one or two of his friends gave me haughty stares and i took my seat very meek at the back of the box while his lordship showed off at the front and his friends and he talked and laughed loudly to show what firstrate bucks they were it was a splendid housequite out of proportion to the opera which was the barber of seville in fact i was astonished at the gathering there was the queen dowager in the royal box with a couple of foreign princelings old wellington wrinkled and lynxeyed with his duchess brougham the minister the baroness de rothschild count esterhazy the belgian ambassador and many others all the most eminent elderly lechers of the day in fact and i hadnt a doubt that it wasnt the music they had come for lola montez was the attraction of the night and the talk through the pit was of nothing else rumour had it that at certain select gatherings for the highest grandees in spain she had been known to dance nude it was also being said that she had once been the leading light of a turkish harem oh they were in a fine state of excitement by the time the curtain went up my own idea of theatrical entertainment i admit is the musichall strapping wenches and low comedians are my line and your fine drama and music bore me to death so i found the barber of seville a complete fag fat italians screeching and not a word to be understood i read the programme for a bit and found more entertainment in the advertisements than there was on the stagemrs rodds anatomical ladies stays which ensure the wearer a figure of astonishing symmetry i remember thinking that the leading lady in the barber could have profited by mrs rodds acquaintance also highly spoken of were jacksons patent enema machines as patronised by the nobility when travelling i wasnt alone i noticed in finding the opera tedious there were yawns in the pit and wellington began to snore until his duchess dug him in the ribs then the first act ended and when the applause died away everyone sat up expectant there was a flourish of spanish music from the orchestra and lola shot dramatically on to the stage im no authority on the dance the performer not the performance is what i pay to see but it seemed to me that she was damned good her striking beauty brought the pit up with a gasp she was in a black bodice cut so low that her breasts seemed to be in continual danger of popping out and her tiny pink skirt showed off her legs to tremendous advantage the slim white neck and shoulders the coalblack hair the gleaming eyes the scarlet lips curled almost in contemptthe whole effect was startling and exotic you know these throbbing spanish rhythms well she swayed and shook and stamped her way through them in splendid passion and the audience sat spellbound she was at once inviting and challenging i doubt if there was any gesture or movement in the whole dance that a magistrate could have taken exception to and yet the whole effect of it was sensual it seemed to say bed meif you dare and every man in the place was taking her clothes off as he watched what the women thought i cant imagine but i guess they admired her almost as much as they disliked her when she finished abruptly with a final smash of her foot and clash of cymbals from the orchestra the theatre went wild they cheered and stamped and she stood for a moment still as a statue staring proudly down at them and then swept straight off the stage the applause was deafening but she didnt come back and there were sighs and a few groans when the curtain went up again on the next act of the opera and those damned macaronis began yelping again through all this ranelagh had sat forward in his chair staring at her but never said a word he didnt pay the least attention to the opera but when lola came on for her second dance which was even more tempestuous than the first he made a great show of examining her through his glasses everyone else was doing the same of course in the hope that her bodice would burst which it seemed likely to do at any moment but when the applause broke out wilder than ever he kept his glasses glued to his eyes and when she had gone he was seen to be frowning in a very puzzled way this was all leading up to the denoument of course and when she bounced on snapping her fan for the third time i heard him mutter to his nearest neighbour you chaps keep your eyes on me ill give the word mind and then well see some fun she swirled through the dance showing splendid amounts of her thighs and gliding about sinuously while peeping over her fan and at the finish there was a perfect torrent of clapping and shouting with bouquets plopping down on to the stage and chaps standing up and clapping wildly she smiled now for the first time bowing and blowing kisses before the curtain and then suddenly from our box there was a great hissing in unison at which the applause faltered and died away she turned to stare furiously in our direction and as the hissing rose louder than ever there were angry shouts and cries from the rest of the theatre people craned to see what the row was about and then ranelagh climbs to his feet an imposing figure with his black beard and elegant togs and cries out very distinctly why this is a proper swindle ladies and gentlemen that woman isnt lola montez shes an irish girl betsy james there was a seconds silence and then a tremendous hullabaloo the hissing started again with cries of fraud and impostor the applause began and sputtered out and angry catcalls and boos sounded from the gallery in a moment the whole mood of the theatre had changed taking their cut from ranelagh and his toadies they began to howl her down a few coins clattered on the stage the conductor gaping at the audience with his mouth open suddenly flung down his baton and stamped out and then the whole place was in a frenzy stamping and calling for their money back and shouting to her angrily to get back to the bogs of donegal she was standing blazing with fury and when she moved towards our box some of the chaps scrambled back to get out of harms way she stood a moment her bosom heaving her eyes sweeping the boxoh yes she recognised me all right and when she began to curse at us i think it was me as much as ranelagh she was getting at unfortunately she swore in english and the mob caught it and yelled louder than ever then she dashed down the bouquet she was holding stamped on it kicked it into the orchestra and with one last damnation in our direction ran from the stage as the curtain fell i must say i was delighted i hadnt thought it could go off so well as we crowded out of the place the barber of course was entirely forgotten in the sensationi came up to ranelaghs elbow and congratulated him i couldnt have paid her out so splendidly myself and i told him so he gave me a cold nod and sailed off the snobbish bastard but i wasnt in a mood to mind too much that was me quits with mistress lola for her brickbats and insults and i went home in high good humour she was finished on the london stage of course lumley dismissed her and although one or two attempts were made to present her at other theatres the damage was done all sorts of people now seemed to remember her as mrs james and although she wrote a letter of denial to the press no one believed it a few weeks later she had disappeared and that thought i was the end of lola montez so far as i was concerned and good riddance a brilliant bedmate i dont deny in her way and even now the picture of her kneeling naked among the bedclothes can set me itchingbut id never liked her particularly and was glad to see her sent packing but it wasnt the end of her by any means although it was some years before i saw her againin circumstances that i couldnt have dreamed ofone heard of her from time to time through the papers and always it was sensational news she seemed to have a genius for thrusting herself into high places and creating scandal first there was a report of her horsewhipping a policeman in berlin next she was dancing on the tables during a civic banquet in bonn to the outrage of prince albert and our queen who were on a state visit at the time then she was performing in paris and when the audience didnt take to her she stripped off her garters and drawers and flung them at the gallery she started a riot in the streets of warsaw and when they tried to arrest her she held the peelers off with pistols and of course there were scores of lovers most of them highlyplaced the viceroy of poland the tsar of russia and liszt the musician she took up with him two or three times and once to get rid of her he locked her in a hotel room and sneaked out by the back door i met him later on by the way and we discussed the lovely lola and found ourselves much in agreement like me he admired her as a tumble but found her all too overpowering she is a consuming fire he told me shaking his white head ruefully and ive been scorchedoh so often i syrnpathised she had urged me on in lovemaking with a hairbrush but with him it had been a dogwhip and he was a frail sort of fellow you know at all events these scraps of gossip reached me from time to time over the next few years in that time i was out of england a good dealas will be set down in another packet of my memoirs if im spared to write them my doings in the middle forties of the century dont fit in with my present tale though so i pass them over for the moment and come to the events to which my meeting with lola and otto bismarck was the prelude i can see now that if i hadnt deserted speedicut that night hadnt been rude to bismarck hadnt set jack gully on to give him a beating and finally hadnt taken my spite out on lola by peaching on her to ranelagh without all these ifs i would have been spared one of the most frightening and incredible experiences of my life another glorious chapter in the heroic career of harry flashman would not have been written and neither would a famous novel however ive seen too much of life to fret over ifs and buts theres nothing you can do about them and if you find yourself at the end of the day an octogenarian with money in the bank and drink in the housewell youd be a fool to wish that things had fallen out differently anyway i was home again in london in with cash in my pocket for oncemy own cash too dishonestly got but no dirtier than the funds which old morrison my fatherinlaw doled out as charity to keep us respectable for my wee daughters sake his wee daughter my elspeth was as pleased to see me as she ever was we still suited very well between the sheets however much she was playing loose with her admirers i had ceased worrying about that too however when i arrived home hoping for a few months rest to recover from the effects of a pistolball which had been dug out of the small of my back there was a nasty shock awaiting me my dear parentsinlaw mr and mrs morrison of paisley were now in permanent residence in london i hadnt seen much of them thank god since i had married their beautiful emptyheaded trollop of a daughter several years before when i was a young subaltern in cardigans hussars we had detested each other then they and i and time hadnt softened the emotion on either side to make matters worse my father was away from home in the past year or two the old fellow had been hitting the bottle pretty hardand pretty hard for him meant soaking up liquor in every waking moment once or twice they had had to put him away in a place in the country where the booze was sweated out of him and the pink mice which nibbled at his fingers and toes were shooed awaythat was what he said anywaybut it seemed that they kept coming back and he was off getting another cure a fine thing sniffed old morrisonwe were at dinner on my first evening home and i had hoped to have it in bed with elspeth but of course we had to do the polite by her parentsa fine thing indeed hell drink himsel intae the grave i suppose probably says i his father and grandfather did so i dont see why he shouldnt mrs morrison who in defiance of probability had grown with the years even more like a vulture gave a gasp of disgust at this and old morrison said he didnt doubt that the son of the house would follow in his ancestors besotted footsteps shouldnt wonder says i helping myself to claret ive got a better excuse than they had and whit does that mean sir bridled old morrison i didnt bother to tell him so he started off on a great rant about ingratitude and perversity and the dissolute habits of myself and my family and finished up with his ageold lamentation about his daughter having married a wastrel and a ruffian who hadnt even the decency to stay at home with his wife like a christian but must be forever wandering like ishmael hold on says i for i was sick of this since i married your daughter i have been twice abroad on my countrys service and on the first occasion at least i came home with a good deal of credit ill wager you werent slow to boast about your distinguished soninlaw when i came back from india in and what have ye made of it sneers he what are ye a captain still and like to remain one youre never tired of reminding elspeth in your letters that you keep this family this house and the rest of it buy me a majority if military rank means so much to you damn yer impudence says he is it no enough that i keep you and yer drunken father oot o the poorshoose where ye belong id have thought so says i but if you want me to shoot up the military tree as wellwhy it costs money you know aye weel deils the penny yell get from me snaps he enough is bein spent on wanton folly as it is and it seemed to me he darted a look at his vinegary spouse who sniffed and coloured a bit whats this i wondered surely she hasnt been asking him to buy her a pair of colours horse guards wouldnt have taken her anyway not for a commission farriersergeant perhaps but no higher no more was said at dinner which ended in a merry atmosphere of poisonous illwill but i got the explanation from elspeth when we had retired for the night it seemed that her mother had been growing increasingly concerned at her inability to get elspeths two virgin sisters married off the oldest girl mary had been settled on some commercial creature in glasgow and was breeding at a rare rate but agnes and grizel were still single i said surely there were enough fortunehunters in scotland ready to take a shot at her fathers money but she said no her mother had discouraged them she was flying higher reasoning that if elspeth had been able to get me who had titled relatives and was at least halfway into the great world of fashionable society agnes and grizel could do even better shes mad says i if they had your looks it might be a halfchance but one sight of your dear parents is going to scare any eligible sprig a mile off sorry mdear but they aint acceptable you know my parents certainly lack the advantages says elspeth seriously marrying me had turned her into a most wonderful snob that i admit but father is extremely rich as you are aware to hear him its no fault of ours if he is and you know harry that quite a few of our titled acquaintances are not too nice to look above a fine dowry i think with the right introductions that mama might find very suitable husbands for them agnes is plain certainly but little grizel is really pretty and their education has been quite as careful as my own it isnt easy for a beautiful woman with blue eyes a milky complexion and corngold hair to look pompous especially when she is wearing only a french corset decorated with pink ribbons but elspeth managed it at that moment i was overcome again with that yearning affection for her that i sometimes felt in spite of her infidelities i cant explain it beyond saying that she must have had some magic quality something to do with the childlike thoughtful look she wore and the pure helpless stupidity in her eyes it is very difficult not to like a lovely idiot since youre so welleducated says i pulling her down beside me lets see how much you remember and i put her through a most searching test which being elspeth she interrupted from time to time with her serious observations on mrs morrisons chances of marrying off the two chits well says i when we were exhausted so long as i aint expected to help launch em in society i dont mind good luck to it i say and i hope they get a duke apiece but of course i had to be dragged into it elspeth was quite determined to use my celebrity for what it was still worth on her sisters behalf and i knew that when she was insistent there was no way of resisting her she controlled the pursestrings you see and the cash i had brought home wouldnt last long at my rate of spending i knew so it was a fairly bleak prospect i had come back to the guvnor away in the grip of the quacks and demon drink old morrison in the house carping and snuffling elspeth and mrs morrison planning their campaign to inflict her sisters on unsuspecting london and niyself likely to be roped inwhich meant being exposed in public alongside my charming scotch relations i should have to take old morrison to my club and stand behind mrs morrisons chair at partiesno doubt listening to her teaching some refined mama the recipe for haggisand have people saying seen flashys inlaws they eat peat dont you know and speak nothing but gaelic well it wasnt english surely oh i knew what to expect and determined to keep out of it i thought of going to see my uncle bindley at the horse guards and beseeching him to arrange an appointment for me to some regiment out of towni was off the active list just then and was not relishing the idea of halfpay anyway and while i was hesitating in those first few days at home the letter came that helped to solve my difficulties for me and incidentally changed the map of europe it came like the answer to a pagans prayer along with a dun from some tailor or other an antipopish tract a demand for my club subscription and an invitation to buy railway sharesall the usual trash why i should remember the others i dont know i must have a perverse memory for the contents of the big white envelope should have been enough to drive them out of my head it was a fine imposing coverbest quality paper with a coatofarms on the back which i have before me now there was a shield quartered red blue blue and white and in the quarters were a sword a crowned lion what looked like a fat whale and a pink rose plainly it was either from someone of tremendous rank or the manufacturers of a new brand of treacle inside there was a letter and stamped at the top in flowery letters surrounded by foliage full of pinkbottomed cupids were the words grдfin de landsfeld and who the deuce i wondered might she be and what did she want with me the letter i reproduce exactly as it now lies in my hand very worn and creased after sixty years but still perfectly legible it is i think quite the most remarkable communication i have ever receivedeven including the letter of thanks i got from jefferson davis and the reprieve i was given in mexico it said most honoured sir i write to you on instruction of her grace the countess de landsfeld of whom you had the honour to be acquainted in londres some years ago her grace commands me to inform you that she holds the warmest recollection of your friendship and wishes to convey her strongest greetings on this occasion i made nothing of this while i couldnt have recited the names of all the women i had known i was pretty clear that there werent any foreign countesses that had slipped my mind it went on sir while her grace doubts not that your duties are of the most important and exacting nature she trusts that you will have opportunity to consider the matter which on her command i am now to lay before you she is confident that the ties of your former friendship no less than the chivalrous nature of which she has such pleasing memory will prevail upon you to assist her in a matter of the most extreme delicate now hes certainly mad this fellow thinks i or else hes got the wrong chap i dont suppose there are three women in the world who ever thought me chivalrous even on short acquaintance her grace therefore directs me to request that you will with all speed after receiving this letter make haste to present yourself to her in mьnchen and there receive from her own lips particulars of the service which it is her dearest wish you will be obliged to render to her she hastens to assure you that it will be of no least expense or hardship to you but is of such particular nature that she feels that you of all her many dear friends are most suitable to its performing she believes that such is the warmth of your heart that you will at once agree with her and that the recollection of her friendship will bring you at once as an english gentleman is fitting honoured sir in confidence that you will wish to assist her grace i advise you that you should call on william greig sons attorneys at their office in wine office court londres to receive instruction for your journey they will pay ј in gold for your travelling etc further payments will be received as necessary sir her grace commands me to conclude with the assurance of her deepest friendship and her anticipation of the satisfaction of seeing you once again accept dear sir etc r lauengram chamberlain my first thought was that it was a joke perpetrated by someone not quite right in the head it made no sense i had no idea who the grдfin de landsfeld might be or where mьnchen was but going over it again several times it occurred to me that if it had been a fake whoever had written it would have made his english a good deal worse than it was and taken care not to write several of the sentences without howlers but if it was genuine what the devil did it mean what was the service for which some foreign titled female was willing to slap ј into my palmand that only a first instalment by the looks of it i sat staring at the thing for a good twenty minutes and the more i studied it the less i liked it if ive learned one thing in this wicked life it is that no one however rich lays out cash for nothing and the more they spend the rummer the business is likely to be someone i decided wanted old flashy pretty badly but i couldnt for the life of me think why i had no qualification that i knew of that suited me for a matter of the most extreme delicate all i was good at was foreign languages and riding and it couldnt be some desperate risk in which my supposed heroism would be valuabletheyd as good as said so no it beat me altogether i have always kept by me as many books and pamphlets on foreign tongues as i can collect this being my occasional hobby and since i guessed that the writer of the letter was pretty obviously german i turned up an index and discovered that mьnchen was munich in bavaria i certainly knew no one there at all let alone a grдfin or countess for that matter i hardly knew any germans had never been in germany and had no acquaintance with the language beyond a few idle hours with a grammar some years before however there was an obvious way of solving the mystery so i took myself off to wine office court and looked up william greig sons i half expected they would send me about my business but no there was as much bowing and scraping and pray to step this way sir as if i had been a royal duke which deepened my mystification a young mr greig smoothed me into a chair in his office he was an oily rather sportylooking bargee with a very smart blue cutaway and a large lick of black hair not at all the city lawyer type when i presented my letter and demanded to know what it was all about he gave me a knowing grin why all in order my dear sir says he a draft for ј to be issued to you on receipt with proof of identitywell we need not fret on that score hey captain flashman is well enough known i think haha we all remember your famous exploits in china afghanistan says i to be sure it was the draft negotiable with the bank of england yes all in perfect order sir but who the devil is she who is who my dear sir this grдfin whatshernamelandsfeld his smile vanished in bewilderment i dont follow says he scratching a black whisker you cannot mean that you dont have the ladys aquaintance why her man writes to you here ive never heard of her says i to my knowledge well says he giving me an odd look this is dam most odd you know my dear sir are you sure quite apart from this letter which seems to suggest a most ah cordial regard well i had not thought there was a man in england who had not heard of the beauteous countess of landsfeld well youre looking at one now says i i cant believe it cries he what never heard of the queen of hearts la belle espagnole the monarch in all but name of the kingdom of bavaria my dear sir all the world knows donna maria dewhat is it again and he rummaged among some papersaye here it is donna maria de dolores de los montez countess of landsfeld come come sir surely now at first the name meant nothing and then it broke on me de los montez you dont mean lola montez but who else sir the close friendindeed some say more than friendof king ludwig why the press is never without some fresh sensation about her some new scandal and he went on chattering and smirking but i never heeded him my head was in a spin lola montez my rosannaa countess a monarch in all but name a royal mistress by the sound of it and she was writing to me offering me hard cashplainly i needed more information forgive me sir says i breaking in on his raptures the title misled me for id never heard it before when i knew lola montez she was plain mrs james oh dear me my dear sir says he very whimsical those days are far behind us now our firm in fact represented a mrs james some years ago but we never talk of her oh no i daresay not but the countess of landsfeld is another mattera lady of quite a different colour haha when did she come by the title why some months ago how you should not ive been abroad says i until this week i hadnt seen an english newspaper in almost a year ive heard of lola montezs doings of course any time over the past three years but nothing of this oh and such doings hey says he beaming lewdly well my dear sir your friend at courthahais a very great lady indeed she has the kingdom under her thumb makes and breaks ministers dictates policiesand sets all europe by the ears upon my word some of the storieswhy there was an article in one of the sheets calling her the modern messalina he dropped his voice and pushed his greasy face towards me and describing her picked bodyguard of splendid young menwhat sir hey she goes abroad with a guard of cuirassiers riding behind her coach sets her dogs on whoever dares to cross her pathwhy there was some unfortunate who didnt doff his cap sirflogged almost to death true sir and none dare say her nay the king dotes on her his courtiers and ministers hate her but go in fear and trembling the students worship her for luxury and extravagance there has been nothing like her since la pompadour they say why sir she is the nineday wonder well well says i little mrs james pray sir he pretended distress not that name i beg you it is the countess of landsfeld who is your friend if i may be so bold as to remind you aye so it is says i will you tell me what she wants of me then my dear sir says he smirking a matter of the most delicate is it not what that may besurely you are in a better position than i to say eh haha but you will be going to bavaria i take it to hear the particulars from her own lips that was what i was asking myself it was unbelievable of course lola a queen to all intentsthat was wild enough but lola seeking my helpwhen our last encounter had been distinguished by the screaming of abuse and the crashing of chamberpotsto say nothing of the furore at the theatre when she had seen me among her betrayers well i know women are fickle but i doubted if she remembered me with any affection and yet the letter was practically fawning and she must have dictated the sense of it if not the words it might be she had decided to let bygones be bygonesshe was a generous creature in her way as so many whores are but why what could she want me forall she knew of me was my prowess in bed did the maitresse en titre want to instal me as her lover my mind which is at its liveliest in amorous imagination opened on a riotous vision of flashy pride of the hareem but no i have my share of conceit but i could not believe that with the pick of all the young stallions of a palace guard she was yearning for my bonny black whiskers and yet here was a lawyer authorised on her behalf ready to advance me ј to go to munichten times more than was necessary for the journey it made no sort of senseunless she was in love with me but that was out of court id been a good enough mount for a week or so no doubt but there had been nothing deeper than that i was certain what service then could i perform that was so obviously of importance i have a nose for risk the uneasy feeling that had come over me on first reading her letter was returning if i had any sense i knew i would bid the greasy mr greig goodday and tell him to tear his draft up but even the biggest coward doesnt run until some hint of danger appears and there was none here at alljust my uneasy instinct against which there was the prospect of getting away from my damned relationsoh god and the horrors of accompanying the morrisons into societyand the certainty of an immediate tidy sum with more to follow and sheer curiosity too if i did go to bavaria and the signs were less pleasant than appeared at presentwell i could cut stick if i wanted and the thought of renewing acquaintance with lolaa warm and friendly lolatickled my darker fancies from greigs reports even if they were only half true it sounded as though there was plenty of sport at the court of good king ludwig palace orgies of roman proportions suggested themselves with old flashy waited on like a sultan and lola mooning over me while slaves plied me with pearls dissolved in wine and black eunuchs stood by armed with enormous goldmounted hairbrushes and while cold reason told me there was a catch in it somewherewell i couldnt see the catch yet time enough when i did mr greig says i where can i cash this draft getting away from london was no great bother elspeth pouted a little but when i had given her a glimpsea most fleeting oneof lauengrams signature and of the letters cover and used expressions like special military detachment to bavaria and foreign court service she was quite happily resigned the idea that i would be moving in high places appealed to her vacant mind she felt vaguely honoured by the association the morrisons didnt half like it of course and the old curmudgeon flew off about godless gallivanting and likened me to cartaphilus who it seemed had left a shirt and breeches in every town in the ancient world i was haunted by a demon he said who would never let me rest and it was an evil day that he had let his daughter mate with a footloose scoundrel who had no sense of a husbands responsibilities since thats the case says i the farther away from her i am the better you should be pleased he was aghast at such cynicism but i think the notion cheered him up for all that he speculated a little on the bad end that i would certainly come to called me a generation of vipers and left me to my packing not that there was much of that campaigning teaches you to travel light and a couple of valises did my turn i took my old cherrypicker uniformthe smartest turnout any soldier ever had anywherebecause i felt it would be useful to cut a dash but for the rest i stuck to necessaries among these after some deliberation i included the duelling pistols that a gunsmith had presented to me after the bernier affair they were beautiful weapons accurate enough for the most fastidious marksman and in those days when revolving pistols were still crude experimental toys the last word in hand guns but i pondered about taking them the truth was i didnt want to believe that i might need them when you are young and raw and on the brink of adventure you set great store by having your sidearms just right because you are full of romantic notions of how you will use them even i felt a thrill when i first handled a sabre at practice with the th light dragoons and imagined myself pinking and mowing down hordes of ferocious but obligingly futile enemies but when youve seen a sabre cut to the bone and limbs mangled by bullets you come out of your daydream pretty sharp i knew as i hesitated with those pistols in my hands that if i took them i should be admitting the possibility of my own sudden death or maiming in whatever lay ahead this was you see another stage in my development as a poltroon but id certainly feel happier with em uncomfortable reminders though they were so in they went and while i was at it i packed along a neat little seamans knife it isnt an englishmans weapon of course but its devillish handy sometimes for all sorts of purposes and experience has taught me that as with all weapons while you may not often need it when you do you need it badly so with a word to uncle bindley at horse guardswho said acidly that the british army might survive my absence a while longerand with half of my ј in my money belt i was ready for the road only one thing remained to do i spent a day searching out a german waiter in the town and when i had found a likely fellow i offered him his fare home and a handsome bonus just to travel along with me i had no german at all but with my gift for languages i knew that if i applied myself on the journey to munich i should have at least a smattering by the time i arrived there ive often said that the ideal way to learn a language is in bed with a wench but failing that an alert intelligent travelling companion is as good a teacher as any and learning a new tongue is no hardship to me i enjoy it the fellow i picked on was a bavarian as luck had it and jumped at the chance of getting home his name i think was helmuth but at any rate he was a firstrate choice like all germans he had a passion for taking pains and when he saw what i wanted he was all enthusiasm hour after hour in boat train and coach he talked away to me repeating words and phrases correcting my own pronunciation explaining grammatical rules but above all giving me that most important thing of allthe rhythm of the language this is something which only a few people seem to have and i am lucky to be one let me catch the rhythm and i seem to know what a man is saying even if i havent learned all the words he uses i wont pretend that i learned german in a fortnight but at the end of that time i could pass my own elementary test which is to say to a native tell me speaking slowly and carefully what were your fathers views on strong drink or religion or horses or whatever came to mindand understand his reply fairly well helmuth was astonished at my progress we did not hurry on the journey which was by way of paris a city i had often wanted to visit having heard that debauchery there was a fine art i was disappointed whores are whores the world over and the parisian ones are no different from any other and french men make me sick always have done im degenerate but they are dirty with it not only in the physical sense either they have greasy minds other foreigners may have garlic on their breaths but the frogs have it on their thoughts as well the germans are different altogether if i wasnt an englishman i would want to be a german they say what they think which isnt much as a rule and they are admirably well ordered everyone in germany knows his place and stays in it and grovels to those above him which makes it an excellent country for gentlemen and bullies in england even in my young day if you took liberties with a working man you would be as likely as not to get a fist in your face but the lowerclass germans were as docile as niggers with white skins the whole country is splendidly disciplined and organised and with all their docility the inhabitants are still among the finest soldiers and workers on earthas my old friend bismarck has shown the basis of all this of course is stupidity which you must have in people before you can make them fight or work successfully well the germans will trouble the world yet but since they are closer to us than anyone else we may live to profit by it however all this i was yet to discover although i had an inkling of it from studying helmuth on our journey i dont bore you with details of our travels by the way nothing happened out of the ordinary and what i chiefly remember is a brief anxiety that i had caught the pox in paris fortunately i hadnt but the scare i got prejudiced me still further against the french if that were possible munich when we reached it i liked the look of very well it was clean and orderly on the surface prices were far below our own the folk were either civil or servile and the guidebook which i had bought in london described it as a very dissolute capital the very place for old flash thinks i and looked forward to my stay i should have known better my eagerness to see lola again and my curiosity about what she wanted had quite driven away those momentary doubts i had felt back in london more fool i if i had known what was waiting round the corner i would have run all the way home and felt myself lucky to be able to run we arrived in munich on a sunday and having dismissed helmuth and found a hotel in the theresienstrasse i sat down to consider my first move it was easy enough to discover that lola was installed in a personal palace which the besotted ludwig had built specially for her in the barerstrasse presumably i might stroll round and announce my arrival but it pays to scout whenever you can so i decided to put in an hour or two mooning round the streets and restaurants to see what news i could pick up first i might even gain some hint of a clue to why she wanted me i strolled about the pleasant streets for a while seeing the hofgarten and the fine residenz palace where king ludwig lived and drank the excellent german beer in one of their openair beergardens while i watched the folk and tried out my ear on their conversation it could hardly have been more peaceful and placid even in late autumn it was sunny and the stout contented burghers with their pleasantfaced wives were either sitting and drinking and puffing at their massive pipes or sauntering ponderously on the pavements no one hurried except the waiters here and there a group of young fellows in long cloaks and gaudy caps whom i took to be students stirred things a little with their laughter but for the rest it was a drowsy easy afternoon as though munich was blinking contentedly in the fine weather and wasnt going to be bustled by anybody however one way and another by finding a french newspaper and getting into talk with people who spoke either french or english i picked up some gossip i soon found that one did not need to ask about lola the good muncheners talked about her as britons do about the weather and with much the same feeling in other words they thought she was bad and would get worse but that nothing could be done about her anyway she was it seemed the supreme power in bavaria ludwig was right under her thumb she had swept out the hostile ultramontane cabinet and had it replaced largely with creatures of her own and despite the fact that she was a staunch protestant the catholic hierarchy were powerless against her the professors who count for much more there than do ours in england were solidly against her but the students were violently split some detested her and had rioted before her windows but others calling themselves the allemania constituted themselves her champions and even her bodyguard and were forever clashing with her opponents some of these allemania were pointed out to me in their bright scarlet caps they were a toughlooking crew tightmouthed and coldeyed and given to strutting and barking and people got out of their way pretty sharp however with ludwig infatuated by her lola was firmly in the saddle and according to one outspoken french journalist whose story i read her supremacy was causing alarm far outside bavaria there were rumours that she was an agent of palmerston set on to foment revolution in germany to the other powers striving to hold down a growing popular discontent that was spreading throughout europe she appeared to be a dangerous threat to the old regime at least one attempt had been made to assassinate her metternich the archreactionary master of austria had tried to bribe her to leave germany for good the truth was that in those days the world was on the edge of general revolution we were coming out of the old age and into the new and anything that was a focus of disorder or instability was viewed with consternation by the authorities so lola was not popular the papers fumed against her clergymen damned her in their sermons as a jezebel and a sempronia and the ordinary folk were taught to regard her as a fiend in human shapeall the worse because the shape was beautiful here ends professor flashmans historical lecture much of it cribbed from a history book but some of it at least learned that first day in the munich beergardens one thing i was pretty sure of and it flies in the face of history whatever may be said lola was secretly admired by the common people they might shake their heads and look solemn whenever her cavalry escort drove a way for her through a crowd of protesting students they might look shocked when they heard of the orgies in the barerstrasse palace they might exclaim in horror when her allemania horsewhipped an editor and smashed his pressesbut the men inwardly loved her for the gorgeous hoyden she was and the women hid their satisfaction that one of their own sex was setting europe by the ears whenever the insolent tempestuous montez provoked some new scandal there was no lack of those who thought good for you and quite a few who said it openly and what the devil did she want with me well i had come to munich to find out so i scribbled a note that sunday evening addressed to the chamberlain lauengram saying that i had arrived and was at his disposal then i wandered over to the residenz palace and looked at lolas portrait in the public gallerythat gallery of beauties in which ludwig had assembled pictures of the loveliest women of his day there were princesses countesses actresses and the daughter of the munich towncrier among others and lola looking unusually nunlike in a black dress and wearing a cometojesus expression underneath it was inscribed a verse written by the king who was given to poetry which finished up oh soft and beauteous as a deer art thou of andalusian race well he was probably in a position to know about that and to think that only a few years ago she had been a penniless dancer being hooted off a london stage i had hoped considering the urgency of lauengrams original letter to me to be bidden to lolas palace on the monday but that day and the next went by and still no word but i was patient and kept to my hotel and on the wednesday morning i was rewarded i was finishing breakfast in my room still in my dressinggown when there was a great flurry in the passage and a lackey came to announce the arrival of the freiherr von s tarnberg whoever he might be there was much clashing and stamping two cuirassiers in full fig appeared behind the lackey and stationed themselves like statues on either side of my doorway and then in between them strolled the man himself a gay young spark who greeted me with a flashing smile and outstretched hand herr rittmeister flashman says he my privilege to welcome you to bavaria starnberg very much at your service and he clicked his heels bowing youll forgive my french but its better than my english better than my german at any rate says i taking stock of him he was about twenty of middle height and very slender with a cleancut handsome face brown curls and the wisp of a moustache on his upper lip a very cool jaunty gentleman clad in the tight tunic and breeches of what i took to be a hussar regiment for he had a dolman over his shoulder and a light sabre trailing at his hip he was sizing me up at the same time dragoon says he no hussar english light cavalry mounts must be infernally strong then says he coolly well no matter forgive my professional interest have i interrupted your breakfast i assured him he had not splendid then if youll oblige me by getting dressed well lose no more time lola cant abide to be kept waiting and he lit a cheroot and began to survey the room damnable places these hotels couldnt stay in one myself i pointed out that i had been kept kicking my heels in one for the past three days and he laughed well girls will be girls you know says he we cant expect em to hurry for mere men however much they expect us to jump to it lolas no different from the restin that respect you seem to know her very well says i well enough says he negligently sitting himself on the edge of a table and swinging a polished boot for a messenger i mean says i to take some of the starch out of him but he only grinned oh anything to oblige a lady you know i fulfil other functions when im so inclined and he regarded me with an insolent blue eye i dont wish to hurry you old fellow but we are wasting time not that i mind but she certainly will and we mustnt have that no indeed i imagine you have some experience of the ladys fine latin temper by god id tame it out of her if she was mine but shes not thank heaven i dont have to humour her tantrums you dont eh not hers nor anyone elses says master von starnberg and took a turn round the room whistling cocksure men irritate me as a rule but it was difficult to take offence at this affable young sprig and i had a feeling that it wouldnt do me much good if i did so while he lounged in my sittingroom i retired to the bedchamber to dress i decided to wear my cherrypicker rig with all the trimmings of goldlaced blue tunic and tight pants and when i emerged starnberg cocked an eye and whistled appreciatively saucy regimentals says he very pretty indeed lola may not mind too much having been kept waiting after all tell me i said since you seem to know so much why do you suppose she sent for me im assuming you know that she did oh aye says he well now knowing lola i suggest you look in your mirror doesnt that suggest an answer come now says i i know lola too and i flatter as easily as the next man but she would hardly bring me all the way from england just to why not says he she brought me all the way from hungary shall we go he led the way down to the street the two cuirassiers marching at our heels and showed me into a coach that was waiting at the door as he swung himself in beside me with his hand on the windowframe his sleeve was slightly pulled back and i saw the starshaped white scar of a bulletwound on his wrist it occurred to me that this von starnberg was a tougher handful than he looked at first sight i had noticed the genuine cavalry swing toes pointing as he walked and for all his boyishness there was a compact sureness about him that would have sat on a much older man this is one to keep an eye on thinks i lolas house was in the best part of munich by the karolinen platz i say house but it was in fact a little palace designed by king ludwigs own architect regardless of expense it was the sight of it shining new like a little fairytale castle from italy with its uniformed sentries at the gate its grilled windows its magnificent gardens and the flag fluttering from its roof that brought it home to me just how high this woman had flown this magnificence didnt signify only money but powerunlimited power so why could she want me she couldnt need me was she indulging some whimperhaps going to repay me for being in ranelaghs box the night she was hissed off the stage she seemed to be capable of anything in a moment after clapping eyes on her palace i was cursing myself for having comefear springs eternal in the cowards breast especially when he has a bad conscience after all if she was so allpowerful and happened to be vindictive it might be damned unpleasant here we are says starnberg aladdins cave it almost justified the description there were flunkeys to hand us out and more uniformed sentries in the hall all steel and colour and the splendour of the interior was enough to take your breath away the marble floor shone like glass costly tapestries hung on the walls great mirrors reflected alcoves stuffed with white statuary and choice furniture above the staircase hung a chandelier which appeared to be of solid silver and all of it was in a state of perfection and brilliance that suggested an army of skivvies and footmen working full steam aye its a roof over her head i suppose says starnberg as we gave our busbies to a lackey ah lauengram here is rittmeister flashman is the grдfin receiving lauengram was a dapper little gentleman in courtdress with a thin impassive face and a birdlike eye he greeted me in french which i learned later was spoken a good deal out of deference to lolas bad germanand led us upstairs past more lackeys and sentries to an anteroom full of pictures and people i have a soldiers eye for such things and i would say the loot value of that chamber would have kept a regiment for life with a farm for the farriersergeant thrown in the walls appeared to be made of striped silk and there was enough gold on the frames to start a mint the folk too were a prosperouslooking crew courtly civilians and military in all the colours of the rainbow some damned handsome women among them they stopped their chattering as we entered and i took advantage of my extra three inches on starnberg to make a chest touch my moustache and give them all the cool lookover he had barely started to introduce me to those nearest when a door at the far end of the room opened and a little chap came out backwards stumbling over his feet and protesting violently it is no use madame cries he to someone in the far room i have not the power the vicargeneral will not permit ach no lieber herr gott he cowered back as some piece of crockery sailed past him and shattered on the marble floor and then lola herself appeared in the doorway and my heart took a bound at the sight of her she was beautiful in her royal rage just as i remembered although now she had clothes on and although her aim seemed as vague as ever she appeared to have her wrath under better control these days at all events she didnt scream you may tell dr windischmann says she her rick husky voice charged with contempt that if the kings best friend desires a private chapel and confessor she shall have one and he shall provide it if he values his office does he think he can defy me oh madame please cries the little chap only be reasonable there is not a priest in germany could accept such a confession after all your highness is a lutheran and lutheran fiddlesticks im a royal favourite you mean thats why your master has the impertinence to flout me let him be careful and you too little man lutheran or not favourite or not if i choose to have a chapel of my own i shall have it do you hear and the vicargeneral himself shall hear my confession if i think fit please madame oh please the little fellow was on the verge of tears why do you abuse me so it is not my fault dr windischmann objects only to the suggestion of a private chapel and confessor he says well what does he say the little man hesitated he says he gulped he says that there is a public confessional at nфtredame and you can always go there when you want to accuse yourself of any of the innumerable sins you have committed his voice went up to a squeal his words madame not mine oh god have mercy as she took one furious step forward he turned and ran for his life past us his hands over his ears and we heard his feet clatter on the stairs lola stamped her foot and shouted after him damned papist hypocrite and at this the sycophantic crowd in the antechamber broke out in a chorus of sympathy and reproach jesuit impertinence intolerable affront scandalous insolence silly old bastard impossible arrogance of these prelates says a stout florid man near me im church of england myself says i this had the effect of turning attention on me lola saw me for the first time and the anger died out of her eyes she surveyed me a moment and then slowly she smiled harry flashman says she and held out a hand towards me but as a monarch does palm down and pointing to the ground between us i took my cue stepping forward and taking her fingers to kiss if she wanted to play good queen bess who was i to object she held my hand for a moment afterwards looking up at me with her glowing smile i believe youre even handsomer than you were says she i would say the same to you rosanna says i cavalier as bedamned but handsome is too poor a word for it mind you it was true enough ive said she was the most beautiful girl i ever met and she was still all of that if anything her figure was more gorgeous than i remembered and since she was clad in a loose gown of red silk with apparently nothing beneath it i could study the subject without difficulty the effect of her at close quarters was dazzling the magnificent blue eyes the perfect mouth and teeth the white throat and shoulders and the lustrous black hair coiled up on her headyes she was worth her place in ludwigs gallery but if she had ripened wonderfully in the few years since i had last seen her she had changed too there was a composure a stateliness that was new you would always have caught your breath at her beauty but now you would feel a little awe as well as lust i was leering fondly down at her when starnberg chimes in rosanna says he whats this lola a pet name dont be jealous ruth says she captain flashman is an old very dear friend he knew me long beforeall this and she gestured about her he befriended me when i was a poor little nobody in london and she took my arm in both of hers reached up and kissed me smiling with her old mischief well if that was how she chose to remember our old acquaintance so much the better listen all of you she called out and you could have heard a pin drop the rittmeister flashman is not only the closest to my heart of all my english friendsand those you remember include the noblest in the landbut the bravest soldier in the british army you see his decorationsshe leaned across me to touch my medals and the presence of two almost naked beautifully rounded breasts just beneath my face was delightfully diverting lola was always vain of her bosom and wore it all but outside her gown i wished i had had a pinch of snuff to offer her who ever saw a young captain with five medals she continued and there was a chorus of murmured admiration so you see he is to be honoured for more reasons than that he is my guest there is no soldier in germany with a higher reputation as a christian champion i had sense enough to look quizzical and indulgent at this for i knew that the most popular heroes are those who take themselves lightly i had heard this kind of rot time without count in the past few years and knew how to receive it but it amused me to see that the audience as usual took it perfectly seriously the men looking noble and the women frankly admiring having delivered her little lecture lola took me on a tour of introduction presenting baron this and countess that and everyone was all smirks and bows and polite as pie i could sense that they were all scared stiff of her for although she was her old gay self laughing and chattering as she took me from group to group she was still the grande dame under the happy surface with a damned imperious eye oh she had them disciplined all right only when she had taken me apart to a couch where a flunkey served us tokay while the others stood at a respectful distance did she let the mask drop a little and the irish began to creep back into her voice let me look at you comfortably now says she leaning back and surveying me over her glass i like the moustaches harry they become you splendidly and the careless curl oh its the bonny boy still and you are still the most beautiful girl in the world says i not to be outdone so they say says she but i like to hear it from you after all when you hear it from germans its no complimentnot when you consider the dumpy cows theyre comparing you with some of em aint too bad says i carelessly aint they though i can see i shall have to keep an eye on you my lad i saw baroness pechman wolfing you up a moment ago when she was presented which one was she come thats better the last one you metover there with the yellow hair shes fat overblown yees poor soul but some men like it im told not i rosanna rosanna she repeated smiling i like that you know that no one ever calls me by that name now it reminds me of englandyouve no notion how famous it is to hear english again in conversation i mean like this was that why you sent for mefor my conversation thatand other things what other things says i seeing a chance to get down to business whats this very delicate matter that your chamberlain talked about oh that she put on a coy look that can wait a little you must know i have a new motto since i came to bavaria pleasure before business she gave me a sleepy look from beneath those glorious black lashes that made by heart skip a little you wouldnt be so ungallant as to hurry me would you harry not where business is concerned says i leering again pleasures another matter wicked she says smiling lazily like a sleek black cat wicked wicked wicked it is remarkable what fatuities you can exchange with a beautiful woman i can think shame when i consider the way i sat babbling with lola on that couch i would ask you only to remember that she was as practised a seductress as ever wore out bed linen and just to be beside her even in a room full of people was in itself intoxicating she was overpowering like some rich tropical flower and she could draw a man like a magnet the same dr windischmann vicargeneral whose name she had been taking in vain so recently once said that there was not even a priest in his charge who could have been trusted with her liszt put it more bluntly and accurately when he observed to me as soon as you meet lola your mind leaps into bed anyway i mention this to explain how it was that after a few moments with her i had forgotten entirely my earlier misgivings about her possible recollection of our parting in london and my fears that she might harbour a grudge against me for the ranelagh affair she had charmed me and i use the word exactly laughing and talking with her over the tokay only one thought was in my mind to get her bedded as swiftly as might be and the devil with anything else while we were chatting so amiably and i poor ass was succumbing to her spell more people were arriving in the anteroom and presently she had them called up with lauengram playing the majordomo and talked to them in turn these levees of hers were quite famous in munich apparently and it was her habit to hold court to all sorts of folk not just distinguished visitors and such odds and ends as artists and poets but even statesmen and ambassadors i dont recall who was there that morning for between lola and the tokay i was not paying much heed but i know they scraped and fawned to her no end presently she announced that we would all go to see her cuirassiers at exercise and there was a delay while she went off to change when she returned it was in full hussar rig which showed off her curves admirably and would have caused the police to be called in london the sycophants oohed and aahed and cried wunderschцn and we all trooped after her to the stables and rode out to a nearby park where a couple of squadrons of cavalry were going through their paces lola who was riding a little white mare took great pleasure in the spectacle pointing with her whip and exclaiming authoritatively on the manoeuvres her courtiers echoed her applause faithfully all except rudi starnberg who i noticed was watching with a critical eye like myself i ought to know something about cavalry and certainly lolas cuirassiers were a smart lot on parade and looked very well as they thundered past at the charge starnberg asked me what i thought of them very fine i said better than the british says he with his cocky grin ill tell you that when ive seen em fight says i bluntly you wont deny theyre disciplined to perfection cries he on parade says i no doubt theyd charge well in a body too but lets see em in a mкlйe every man for himself thats where good cavalry prove themselves this is true of course no one would run faster from a melee than i but starnberg wasnt to know that for the first time he looked at me almost with respect nodding thoughtfully and admitted i was probably right lola got bored after half an hour or so and we returned to her palace but then we had to turn out again because she wanted to exercise her dogs in the garden it seemed that whatever she did everyone else was expected to tag after her and by god her amusements were trivial after the dogs there was music indoors with a fat bastard of a tenor sobbing his soul out and then lola sang herselfshe had a fine contralto as it happensand the mob raised the roof then there was a reading of poetry which was damnable but would probably have been even more painful if i had been able to understand it fully and then more conversation in the anteroom the centre of it was a longjawed toughlooking fellow whose name meant nothing to me at the time he talked interminably about music and liberal politics and everyone lionised him sickeningly even lola when we went into an adjoining room for a buffet erfrischung as the germans call itshe introduced him to me as herr wagner but the only conversation we had was when i passed him the ginger and he said danke but my memories of that afternoon are necessarily vague in view of what the night was to bring forth briefly i stayed at the palace all day being unconscionably bored and impatient to get lola by herself which looked like being damned difficult there was such a crowd always in attendance on her from time to time we had a word or two but always with others present and when we dined i was halfway down the table with the fat baroness pechman one one side of me and an american whose name ive forgotten on the other i was pretty piqued with lola for this quite apart from the fact that i thought i deserved a place near her at the table top the yankee was the damnedest bore you ever met and the giggling blonde butterball on my other side was infuriating in her shrieks of amusement at my halting german she also had a tendency to let her hand stray on to my thigh beneath the tablenot that i minded the compliment and she would have been pretty enough in a babyfaced way if she had weighed about six stones less but my mind was on the lovely lola and she was a long way off being bored i was careless and didnt keep too close an eye on my glass it was a magnificent dinner and the wines followed each other in brilliant succession everyone else punished them tremendously as the germans always do and i simply followed suit it was understandable but foolish i learned in later years that the only safe place to get drunk is among friends in your own home but that evening i made a thorough pig of myself and the long and short of it was that flashy got beastly drunk to quote my old friend tom hughes not that i was alone the talk got steadily louder faces got redder jokes got coarserthe fact that half those present were women made no differenceand eventually they were roaring and singing around the table or staggering out to be sick no doubt and what conversation there was consisted of shouting at full pitch i remember there was an orchestra playing incessantly at one end of the hall and at one point my american companion got up unsteadily on to his chair amid the cheers of the multitude and conducted them with a knife and fork presently he tumbled down and rolled under the table this is an orgy thinks i but not a proper orgy i got it into my headquite understandably that such a bacchanalia should be concluded in bed and naturally looked round for lola she had left the table and was standing off in an alcove at one side talking to some people i got up and weaved my way through such of the guests as were standing aboutthose who were fit to stand that isuntil i fetched up in front of her i must have been heroically drunk for i can remember her face swimming in and out of focus she had a diamond circlet in her dark hair and the lights from the chandelier made it glitter dazzlingly she said something i dont recall what and i mumbled lets go to bed lola you an me you should lie down harry says she youre very tired not too tired says i but im damned hot come on lola rosanna lets go to bed very well come along then im sure she said that and then she turned away and i followed her out of the din and stuffiness of the banqueting chamber into a corridor i was weaving pretty recklessly for i walked into the wall once but she waited for me and guided me to a doorway which she opened in here she said i stumbled past her and caught the musky sweetness of her perfume i grabbed at her and dragged her to me in the darkness she was soft and thrilling against me and for a moment her open mouth was under mine then she slipped away and i lost my balance and halffell on to a couch i called out to her to come back and heard her say a moment just in a moment and then the door shut softly i halflay on the couch my head swimming with drink and my mind full of lustful thoughts and i believe i must have passed into a brief stupor for suddenly i was aware of dim light in the room and a soft hand was stroking my cheek lola says i like a mooncalf and then there were arms round my neck and a soft voice murmuring in my ear but it was not lola i blinked at the face before me and my hands came in contact with bare plump fleshany amount of it my visitor was baroness pechman and she was stark naked i tried to shove her off but she was too heavy she clung to me like a leech murmuring endearments in german and pushing me back on the couch go away you fat slut says i heaving at her gehen sie weg dammit dont want you want lola i might as well have tried to move st pauls she was all over me trying to kiss me and succeeding her fat face against mine i cursed and struggled and she giggled idiotically and began clawing at my breeches no you dont says i seizing her wrist but i was too tipsy to be able to defend myself properly or else she was strong for all her blubber she pinned me down calling me her duckling of all things and her chicken and then before i knew it she had suddenly hauled me upright and had my fine cherrypicker pants round my knees and was squirming her fat backside against me oh eine hammelkeule she squeaked kolossal no woman does that to me twice im too susceptible i seized handfuls of her and began thrusting away she was not lola perhaps but she was there and i was still too foxed and too randy to be choosy i buried my face in the blonde curls at the nape of her neck and she squealed and plunged in excitement and i was just settling to work in earnest when there was a rattle at the door handle the door opened and suddenly there were men in the room there were three of them rudi starnberg and two civilians in black ruth was grinning in delight at the sight of me caught flagrante seducto as we classical scholars say but i knew this was no joke drunk as i was i sensed that here was danger dreadful danger when i had least expected it it was in the grim faces of the two with him hard tightlipped fellows who moved like fighters i shoved my fat baroness quickly away and she went down sprawling flabbily on her stomach i jumped back trying to pull up my breeches but cavalry pants fit like a skin and the two were on me before i could adjust myself each grabbed an arm and one of them growled in execrable french hold still criminal you are under arrest what the devil for i shouted take your hands off me damn you what does this mean starnberg youre arrested says he these are police officers police but my god what am i supposed to have done starnberg arms akimbo glanced at the woman who had climbed to her feet and was hastening to cover herself with a robe to my amazement she was giggling behind her hand i wondered was she mad or drunk i dont know what you call it in english says he coolly but we have several impolite names for it here off you go gretchen and he jerked a thumb towards the door in gods name thats not a crime i shouted but seeing him silent and smiling grimly i struggled for all i was worth i was sober enough now and horribly frightened let me go i yelled you must be mad i demand to see the grдfin landsfeld i demand to see the british ambassador not without your trousers surely says rudi help i roared help let me loose you scoundrels ill make you pay for this and i tried in frenzy to break from the grip of the policemen ein starker mann observed rudi quiet him one of my captors shifted quickly behind me i tried to turn and a splitting pain shot through the back of my head the room swam round me and i felt my knees strike the floor before my senses left me i wonder sometimes if any man on earth has come to in a cell more often than i have it has been happening to me all my life perhaps i could claim a record but if i did some american would be sure to beat it at once this awakening was no different from most of the others two damnable pains one inside and one outside my skull a stomachful of nausea and a dread of what lay ahead the last was quickly settled at any rate just as grey light was beginning to steal through the bars of my windowwhich i guessed was in a police station for the cell was decenta uniformed guard brought me a mug of coffee and then conducted me along a corridor to a plain panelled room containing a most officiallooking desk behind which sat a most officiallooking man he was about fifty with iron grey hair and a curling moustache and cold eyes flanking a beaky nose with him standing at a writing pulpit beside the desk was a clerk the guard ushered me in bleary unshaven bloodstained and in the fiends own temper i demand to be allowed to communicate with my ambassador this instant i began to protest at the outrageous manner in which be quiet says the official sit down and he indicated a stool before the desk i wasnt having this dont dare to order me about you cabbageeating bastard says i i am a british officer and unless you wish to have a most serious international incident to answer for you will i will certainly have you whipped and returned to your cell if you do not curb your foul tongue says he coldly sit i was staring flabbergasted at this when a cheerful voice behind me said better sit down old fellow he can do it you know and i wheeled round to find rudi starnberg lolling against a table by the door which had hidden him from me when i came in he was fresh and jaunty with his undress cap tilted forward rakishly over one eye smoking a cheroot in a holder you cried i and got no further he shushed me with a gesture and pointed to the stool at the same time the official rapped smartly on his table so i decided to sit my head was aching so much i doubt if i could have stood much longer anyway this is doctor karjuss says rudi he is a magistrate and legal authority he has something to say to you then he can start by telling me the meaning of this dastardly illtreatment cries i ive been set upon my skull cracked thrown into a filthy cell denied the right to see my ambassador and god knows what else yes by the lord ive been threatened with flogging too you were placed under arrest last night says karjuss who spoke tolerable french you resisted the officers they restrained you that is all restrained me they bloody well halfkilled me and what is this damned nonsense about arrest whats the charge hey as yet none has been laid says karjuss i repeat as yet but i can indicate what they may be he sat very prim and precise his cold eyes regarding me with distaste first obscene and indecent conduct second corruption of public morals third disorderly behaviour fourth resisting the police fifth youre mad i shouted this is ridiculous dyou imagine any court in the world would convict me of any of this on the strength of what happened last night good god there is such a thing as justice in bavaria i suppose there is indeed snaps he and i can tell you sir that i do not merely imagine that a court could convict youi know it could and it will my head was reeling with all this oh to the devil ill not listen to this i want to see my ambassador i know my rights and your ambassador would be of no help to you i have not yet mentioned the most serious complaint it is possible that a charge of criminal assault on a female may be brought against you at this i staggered to my feet in horror thats a lie a damned lie my god she practically raped me why she that would not be the evidence she would give before a judge and jury his voice was stone cold baroness pechman is known as a lady of irreproachable character her husband is a former commissioner of police for munich i can hardly imagine a more respectable witness but but i was at a loss for words but a horrible thought was forming in my brain this is a plot thats it its a deliberate attempt to discredit me i wheeled on starnberg who was negligently regarding his nails youre in this you rascal youve given false witness dont be an ass says he listen to the magistrate cant you stunned and tenified i sank on to the stool karjuss leaned forward a thin hand tapping the table before him i had the impression he was enjoying himself you begin to see the seriousness of your position sir i have indicated the charges which could be broughtand without doubt provedagainst you i speak not as an examining magistrate but as a legal adviser if you like these are certainties no doubt you would persist in denial against you there would be at least four witnesses of high characterthe two police officers who apprehended you baroness pechman and the freiherr von starnberg here your wordthe word of a known duelist over women a man who was expelled for drunken behaviour from his school in england how the devil did you know that our gathering of information is thorough is it not so you can guess what your word would count for in the circumstances i dont care i cried you cant hope to do this im a friend of the grдfin landsfeld shell speak for me by god when she hears of this the boot will be on the other foot i went no further another horrid thought had struck me why hadnt the allpowerful lola whose lightest word was law in bavaria intervened by now she must know all about it why the ghastly affair had happened in her own palace she had been with me not five minutes before and then in spite of my aching reeling head the full truth of it was plain lola knew all about it yes hadnt she lured me to munich in the first place and here i was within twentyfour hours of meeting her again trapped in what was obviously a damnable deliberate plot against me god was this her way of punishing me for what had happened years before when i had laughed at her humiliation in london could any woman be so fiendishly cruel hating so long and bitterly that she would go to such lengths i couldnt believe it and then karjuss spoke to confirm my worst fears you can hope for no assistance whatever from the grдfin landsfeld says he she has already disclaimed you i took my aching head in my hands this was a nightmare i couldnt believe it was happening but ive done nothing i burst out almost sobbing oh i galloped that fat trot yes but wheres the crime in that dont germans do it for christs sake by god ill fight this my ambassador a moment karjuss was impatient it seems i have talked to no purpose can i not convince you that legally you are without hope and on conviction i assure you you could be imprisoned for life even on the minor charges it would be possible to ensure a maximum sentence of some years is that clear this inevitably is what will happen if by insisting on seeing your ambassador and enlisting his interest you cause the whole scandal to become public at the moment i would remind you no charges have been formulated and they neednt be says rudi from behind me unless you insist of course this was too much for me it made no sense whatever no one wants to be unpleasant says rudi all silky but we have to show you where you stand dont you see to let you see what might happenif you were obstinate youre blackmailing me then i stared from the thinlipped karjuss to the debonair stripling in gods name why what have i done what dye want me to do ah says he thats better he tapped me twice smartly on the shoulder with his ridingswitch much better do you know doctor he went on turning to karjuss i believe there is no need to trouble you any longer im sure the rittmeister flashman has at least realised theer gravity of his situation and will be as eager as we all are to find a mutually satisfactory way out of it im deeply obliged to you doctor even in my scared and bewildered state i noticed that karjuss took his dismissal as a lackey does from a master he stood up bowed to starnberg and with his clerk at his heels strode out of the room thats better too said young rudi i cant endure these damned scriveners can you i wouldnt have troubled you with him really but theres no doubt he explains legal technicalities well cigar no hes explained nothing except that im the object of a damned conspiracy god why do you do this to me is it that damned bitch lola is this how she takes her revenge on me tuttut says rudi be calm he seated himself on the edge of karjusss desk swung his legs a moment and looked at me thoughtfully then he gave a slow chuckle its too bad really i dont blame you for being annoyed the truth is we havent been quite honest with you youre sure you wont have a cigar oh well heres how it is he lit himself another weed and held forth i think karjuss has convinced you that youre in a most devilish mess if we choose we can shut you up for ever and your own ambassador and your government would be the first to say amen considering the charges i mean trumpedup lies i shouted false blasted witnesses but of course as you yourself said a dastardly plot but the point isyoure caught in it with no choice but to do as youre told if you refusethe charges are brought youre convicted and goodnight and the insolent young hound grinned pleasantly at me and blew a smokering you devil cries i youyou dirty german dog austrian actually anyway you appreciate your position oh i appreciated it no question of that i didnt understand how or why they had done this to me but i was in no doubt of what the consequences would be if i didnt play their infernal game for themwhatever it was blustering hadnt helped me and a look at rudis mocking face told me that whining wouldnt either robbed of the two cards which i normally play in a crisis i was momentarily lost will you tell me why youve done thiswhy to me what can you want of me in heavens name there is a servicea very important servicewhich only you can perform says he more than that i cant say at the moment but that is why you were brought to munichoh it was all most carefully planned lolas letterdictated by me incidentallywas not altogether inaccurate most delicate really sums it up but what service could there possibly be that only i youll have to wait and see and for heavens sake stop expostulating like the victim in a melodrama take my word for it we didnt go to so much trouble for nothing now youre a sellsible man im sure will you bow to the inevitable like a good chap that bitch lola i growled shes up to the neck in this this villainy i suppose up to a point not up to the neck she was the means of getting you to germany but it wasnt her idea we employed her assistance we who the devils we my friends and i but you shouldnt be too hard on her you know i doubt if she bears you any illwillin fact i think shes rather sorry for youbut she knows which side her bread is buttered and powerful as she is there are those in germany whom even she finds it wise to oblige now no more silly questions are you going to be a good boy or arent you it seems ive no choice excellent now well have that crack in your head seen to get you a bath and some clean linen and then what then you and i will make a little journey my dear flashman or may i call you harry you must address me as rudi you know dirty dog and devil and swine and so on are all very well between comparative strangers but i feel that you and i may be on the brink of a really fruitful and profitable friendship you dont agree well im sorry but well see now if youll come along i have a closed carriage waiting which will take us to a little place of mine where well have you repaired and made all klimbim as the prussians say devilish places these jails arent they no proper facilities for a gentleman at all well what could i do but trot along at his heels with a mouthful of apprehension whatever they were up to i was in for it and in the meantime there was nothing to do but go with the tide with my sure instinct i knew that the service i was being blackmailed into was sure to be unpleasant and quite likely damned dangerous but my queasy guts didnt interfere with my logical process im a realist and it was already in my mind that in whatever lay aheada journey initially according to rudi some opportunity of escape must surely present itself unless you are actually locked up escapes are not as difficult as many folk think you simply bolt seize the first available horse and go like hell for safetyin this case probably the austrian frontier or would switzerland be better it was farther but rudi and his sinister friends probably had influence in austria and they would not reckon on me trying a forced ride to the swiss border oh by the way says rudi as we left the police office and he handed me into a carriage to a man of action like yourself it may seem that an opportunity will arise of giving me the slip dont try it i would kill you before youd gone five yards and he smiled genially as he settled himself opposite me youre mighty sure of yourself growls i with cause says he look here he gave his right arm a shake and there was a pocket pistol in his right hand im a dead shot too naturally says i but i decided it was probably true anyone who keeps a pistol in his sleeve can usually use it and in all modesty im probably your master with the sabre as wellor with a knife says master rudi putting his pistol away so you see it wouldnt pay you to run for it i said nothing but my spirits sank a few notches lower he was going to be an efficient watchdog rot him the more so since he believed me to be a man of action he knew enough of my reputation no doubt to put me down as a desperate dangerous fellow who didnt give a damn for risks if hed known me for the poltroon i was he might have been less alert so in the meantime i was at the mercy of freiherr rudolf von starnberg and if id known him then as i knew him later id have been even more nervous than i was for this gay devilmaycare youngster with his curly head and winning smile was one of the hardest cases ive ever encountereda thoroughly bad unscrupulous and fatally dangerous ruffianand as you can imagine i have known a few not many of them scoundrels that they were delighted in wickedness for its own sake but rudi did he enjoyed killing for example and would kill laughing he was without shame where women were concerned and without pity too i dare say there may have been crimes he didnt commit but it can only have been for want of opportunity he was an evil vicious cruel rascal we got on very well really i suppose all things considered this was not just because i shared most of his vices but because he believed erroneously that i shared his only virtue which was courage he was too young to know what fear was and he imagined that i was as big a daredevil as he was himselfmy afghan reputation was pretty glorious after all but in addition i must admit that he could be a good companion when he chosehe had a great fund of amiable conversation and a filthy mind and loved the good things of lifeso it was not difficult to get along with him he was all consideration that first day at the house he took me to there was a most competent french valet who dressed and bathed my head provided me with a bath and a suit of my own clothesfor they had brought my baggage from my hoteland later cooked us both a most splendid omelette before we set off for the station rudi was in haste to catch the train we were bound for berlin he told me but beyond that i could get nothing out of him wait and see says he and while youre waiting id be obliged if you would stop talking french and practise your germanyoure going to need it with that mysterious instruction i had to be contentand i had to be obedient too for devil a word of french would he say or listen to from then on however with a bottle of hock inside me the unknown future looked a little less bleak and when we boarded the evening train i was at least momentarily resigned to my situation time enough to start fretting again when we reached berlin the journey took us three days although nowadays you would do it in a matter of hours but those were the early years of railways and the line between munich and berlin was not complete i know we did part of the trip by coach but i cant recall where one night we spent in leipzig certainly but i was paying no great heed to my surroundings as the miles went by my apprehension was growing againwhat the devil did they want me for i tried several times to pump rudi but without success youll find out in good time was all he would say with a knowing grin ill tell you this muchid do the job in a moment if i had the chance i envy you indeed but youre the only man for itand dont fret its well within your powers that should have cheered me up but it didnt after all my powers so far as he and the world knew them were all concerned with war slaughter and heroism and i wanted none of that if i could help it but i had sense enough not to let him get a glimpse of my lily liver no doubt if my worst fears were realised hed see all he wanted of it in time we spent much of our time in the train playing picquet and ecartй and recognised each other as fairish sharps but neither of us was able to take much interest in the game i was too inwardly nervous and he was too busy keeping an eye on mehe was one of these extraordinary folk who can be on the hair trigger of action for days and nights on end and not once in that journey was there a decent chance to take him unawares not that id have dared to try if there had been i had got a healthy respect for young rudi by now and didnt doubt that he would shoot me without the slightest hesitation and take his chance on the consequences so we came to berlin on a night of bitter snow and wind and there was another coach at the station to whirl us away through the busy lamplit streets even with our furcollared coats and rugs and hot bricks it was damnably chilly in that coach after the warmth of the train and i wasnt cheered by the fact that our journey was obviously not going to be a short onethat much was clear from the fact that we had a couple of hampers of food with us and a basket of bottles as well it lasted another three days what with snowchoked roads and the coach shedding a wheel and damned uncomfortable it was i guessed we were travelling west at about twenty miles a day but beyond that there was nothing to be learned from the dreary german landscape the snow stuck to the windows and the coach was like an icehouse i cursed and grumbled a good deal but stamberg sat patiently in his corner huddled in his greatcoat whistling softly through his teethhis observations were either insolently cheerful or caustic and i couldnt decide which i disliked more it was towards evening on the third day that i awoke from a doze to find rudi with the window down peering out into the dusk the snow had stopped for the moment but there was a keen wind whistling into the coach and i was about to tell him brusquely to shut the window before we froze when he pulled his head in and said journeys end thank god now for some decent food at last and a proper bed i leaned forward to look out and ive seen cheerier prospects we were rolling slowly up a long avenue of trees towards a huge bleak house half mansion half castle in the fading light with the wintry sky behind it it looked in silhouette like the setting for some gothic novel all towers and spires and rugged stonework there were lights in some of the windows and a great lantern shone yellow above the pointed archway of its main door but they served only to exaggerate the ancient gloom of the place childe flashy to the dark tower came thinks i and tried not to imagine what lay within it proved to be a match for the exterior we were shown into an immense stoneflagged hall hung round with faded tapestries and a few old trophies of arms and the chase there were archways without doors leading out of it and in keeping with a general air of medieval ghastliness there were even torches burning in brackets on the walls the place felt like a tomb and the ancient butler who received us would have made an excellent gravedigger but what daunted me most of all was the presence in the hall of a strapping trio of fellows all of military cut who welcomed rudi and weighed me up with cold professional eyes one was a massive closecropped typical prussian whose fleshy face was wealed with a great sabre cut from brow to chin the second was a tall supple sinister gentleman with sleek black hair and a vulpine smile the third was stocky and stout balding and ugly all were in undress uniforms and as toughlooking a set of customers as you could wish for my spirits sank even farther as i realised that with this crew on hand my chances of escape had dwindled out of sight rudi performed introductions my friends kraftstein the big prussian clicked his heels de gautet a bow from the sinister scaramouche and bersonin the bald ugly one barely nodded like you and me they are military men as you see youll find they are devoted to your welfare and er safekeeping says master rudi pleasantly and any one of them is almost as tough as i am nicht wahr ich glaube es says the sleek de gautet showing his teeth another confident bastard and decidedly unpleasant while he and kraftstein stayed talking with rudi i was conveyed to a room on the second floor by bersonin and while he kept a bleak eye on me i was graciously permitted to change wash and eat a meal which the ancient butler brought it was tolerable food with an excellent rhenish and i invited the taciturn bersonin to join me in a glass but he shook his head i tried my german on him but getting nothing but grunts for my pains i turned my back on him and devoted myself to my meal if he wanted to play the jailer he could be treated like one presently back comes master rudi very debonair in a clean shirt freshlypressed breeches and polished boots with the brothers grimm kraftstein and de gautet at his heels all fed and watered says he capital i can see you two have been getting along famously i trust our good bersonin hasnt overwhelmed you with his inconsequential chatter no he grinned impudently at bersonin who shrugged and scowled my what a madcap he is went on rudi who had evidently dined too and was back at the top of his most amiable form well come along with me and well see what other entertainment this charming establishment can offer all the entertainment i want is to find out what the devil im doing here says i oh you havent long to wait now says he and he con ducted me down the corridor up another stairway and into a long gallery just as we set foot in it there sounded from somewhere ahead of us the unmistakeable crack of a pistolshot i jumped but rudi only grinned over his shoulder rats says he the place is thick with em weve tried poison and dogs but our host believes in more direct methods there he goes again he added as another shot sounded they must be out in force tonight he paused in front of a stout metalstudded door here we are cries he throwing it wide and waving me in your patience is rewarded it was a fine spacious room far better appointed than anything i had seen so far with carpet on the flags a bright fire in the huge grate solidlooking leather furniture several shelves of books round the panelled walls and a long narrow polished table running down the centre under a brilliant candelabra at the far end of the table sat a man his feet cocked up on the board reloading a long pistol and at the sight of him i stopped as though i had walked into a wall it was otto von bismarck in a lifetime that has included far too many unpleasant surprises i can think of few nastier shocks than that moment strange as it seems from the very start of this german affair bismarck had never even crossed my mindprobably because i didnt want to remember him having done the dirty on him in england with john gully id had no wish ever to meet him againespecially at such a disadvantage as now well when youve caused a man to be cut up by a prize pug and made him look an idiot into the bargain you bar renewing his acquaintance in a lonely castle with four of his hired thugs ushering you into his presence equally alarming was the discovery that he was at the bottom of the plot that had snared me if it had looked sticky before it looked a lot worse now welcome to schцnhausen mr flashman says he with the vaguest curl of a smile at the corner of his mouth pray be seated bersonin set a chair for me at the table end opposite bismarck and then took station by the door the other three stood by the fireplace rudi leaning against the overmantel bismarck studied me along the tables length he looked as nasty as ever with those pale blue eyes and his arrogant stare his face had roughened up a bit though since i first knew him and he was sporting a heavy moustache booze and guzzling had added a good deal of flesh to him especially about the neck my heart was thumping like a hammer and as always when i am scared half out of my wits my face was going red bismarck misread the signs you dont appear pleased to see me says he laying aside his pistol but then why should you there is a score to settle on my side i still miss a tooth thanks to your pugilist friend he paused while i quaked however dont imagine that i contrived your coming all the way here from england just to settle a personal difference it happens amazing though it may seem that i need you what do you think of that my god says i if thats so why the devil didnt you ask me like a civilised human being instead of going through that damned charade in munich of all the ridiculous dangerous yes and damned badmannered dont be a fool we will not pretend that if i had asked you you would have come it was necessary to use guile and force in turn to ensure your presence here and to further ensure that you would bepliable for you have been left in no doubt what will happen to you if you do not do exactly what i require ive been left in no doubt that ive been bloody well kidnapped and assaulted and falsely accused ive been left in no doubt that youre a damned villain and shall we leave these vapourings he broke in harshly you know something of what i am and i know exactly what you area brutal lecherous ruffian yes but with certain abilities which you will use as i direct what the devil is it you want curse you what use can i possibly be to you that is better give him a brandy kraftstein and a cigar now then mr flashman you will listen to me and what i tell you will never be repeatednever as you love your life as i think back on it now it is still difficult to believe that it happenedthat i really sat in that long room with a glass and a cigar while that cold masterful man who was to be the greatest statesman of his age outlined to me the amazing plan which was to be the first small steppingstone in his great career it was mad incredible nonsense but it is true bismarck then was nothingin the political sense anyway but he had dreamed his dreams and now he was setting about in that cold german certainty to make them realities strange isnt it that without me he could not have begun as he did he needed the lecherous brutal ruffian let me begin by asking you a question says he what do you know of schleswig and holstein never even met em says i rudi laughed aloud and de gautet gave his sidelong smile bismarck didnt show any amusement they are states he said not persons i shall tell you about them and he began to explain what historians call the schleswigholstein question i wont bore you with it here because even diplomats agree that it is the most infernally complex affair that ever bedevilled european politics nobody has ever got to the bottom of itindeed palmerston once said that only three people understood it one was pam himself and he had forgotten it another was a famous statesman and he was dead and the third was a german professor and he had gone mad thinking about it so there but the nub was that the two states which lay directly between denmark and the german confederacy were nominally ruled by the king of denmark although most of the inhabitants were germans both germany and denmark claimed schleswig and holstein and the people living there were forever arguing about who they should belong to that then was the famous question and of course bismarck knew the answer it is beyond dispute says he that these two states are german by right it has become of the first import that they should be german in fact i couldnt see what the devil this had to do with me and said so be silent and listen he snarled you will see very soon now answer me in the intervals between your drinking and whoring and hunting do you take any interest in politics well im a tory i suppose havent ever bothered to vote mind you why gerrechter herr gott says he this gentlemenhe glanced at the others is a specimen of the ruling caste of the most powerful country on earthfor the present incredible is it not his eyes scornful he turned back to me you know in effect nothing of affairs of stateyour own or any others very good but even you mr flashman must be aware that of late all over europe there have been storm clouds gathering there is a dangerous sentiment of liberalism fostered by socalled progressive groups of intellectuals which is infecting the populaces of states discontent and disaffection have been created everywhere there are movements for reformhe spat the word outreform that slogan of the shiftless by which they mean destruction of stability in the hope that they will find some pickings among the ruins reform yes your own country has given in to it as probably even you have heard should think i have my guvnor lost his seat in the house and with what result concession has bred anarchy as it always does are your masses satisfied of course not they never are not that he ever spent much time there of course but as yet england has not reaped the full consequence of her statesmens stupidity it will come in time just as it is coming all over europe we have been wasted and enfeebled by peace these thirty years past until there is hardly a man in europei except metternichwith the vision to see beyond the borders of his own state to look past the petty trivialities of his own domestic politics at the dark picture of the continent they blind themselves to what is happening all about them they consider only how to safeguard their own miserable little countries with no thought for the whole they cannot see it seems that unless those who lead and rule europe stand together for the preservation of order and government they will be swept away piecemeal on a rising tide of revolution he had worked himself into a mild passion by this time his eyes were bright and he was crouched forward in his chair hurling his words down the table at me well says i i grant you things are a bit slack here and there and my wife has remarked that good servants are getting damned hard to find but if you think englands in for revolution youre well off the mark we leave that sort of thing to frogs and niggers i am not interested in your imbecile observations i tell you what is in europe and what its consequences must be unless measures are taken to prevent it here in germany we have the cancer in a malignant form the liberal movements are afoot throughout the confederacy as a member of the prussian diet i see them at work openly in berlin as a rural landowner i am aware of them even in the countryside i see them sapping the strength of the german people if such insidious doctrines have their way in a loose undisciplined confederacy such as ours the result will be chaotic germany and especially german unity for which farsighted men have laboured for generations will receive a mortal blow from which it might take a century to recover that she cannot afford the world is on the move the great nations are already jockeying for position in the race for power which is sure to move with incredible swiftness now that science and industry are providing the impetus if germany is to take her place among the leaders she must have unity she must have strength she must have disciplinehis great fist smacked the table with each phrase she must submit herself to the guidance and government of a supreme authority who will do for her what napoleon did for france what washington did for america these were not liberals mr flashman these were not progressive intellectuals germany must have her napoleon if she is to have her waterloo i was sick of all his bombast mind you the moment id said it i wished i hadnt for he stopped dead and stared at me in silence with those blazing blue eyes then he sat back in his chair and spoke quietly there will be no waterloo however this is academic and certainly wasted on a mind such as yours i have said enough i think to explain to you the necessity for ensuring that the spread of liberal thought must be checked before it breeds revolution proper for this there must be measures wherever possible to buttress existing government and to preserve order stability must be maintained wherever seditious influences are at work and nowhere are they more in evidence than in schleswig and holstein i wondered when we should get back to them says i and glanced at the others to see how they had taken bismarcks tirade young rudi was blowing smoke rings at the ceiling but de gautet was all ears and as for kraftstein he was pointing like a damned retriever as though ready to bark in admiration it occurred to me that if he found bismarcks claptrap absorbing there was probably no lack of other idiots in germany who would do so too if you care to study the map of europe above that bookcase bismarck continued you will see that at the eastern limit of holstein where it adjoins mecklenburg there is a small duchy called strackenz it like schleswig and holstein has ties both with germany and denmark like them also it is riven internally by contending parties being a rural backward province it is of less apparent importance than its larger neighbours but this is an illusion in fact it is the spark on the tinder if the dissension between the contending parties in strackenz were to erupt into disorder this would undoubtedly be used by revolutionary elements as an excuse to foment unrest in the neighbouring provinces denmark and germany could become involvedbelieve me great wars have begun over smaller matters than strackenz is it plain to you that the peace must be kept in this little province if it is then given time german diplomacy will ensure the incorporation of schheswig and holstein into the german confederacy and the process of our national unification will have begun but if in the immediate future anything should occur to plunge strackenz into unrest if the rival factions there should be given any crisis to exploitthen my work will be ruined before it has been commenced i cant say i gave a tuppenny damn about his work or the building of a united german state and i couldnt for the life of me see what all this had to do with me still i could only listen bismarck was leaning forward again staring at me and tapping the table such a crisis is at hand here are the facts strackenz is ruled by a duchess irma who has recently reached marriageable age she is exceedingly popular with her subjects being young and personable and therefore supremely fitted to rule in the eyes of superstitious peasants it has been arranged that she should marry a prince of the danish royal family a nephew in fact of king christian himself one prince carl gustaf this informs you of the importance that denmark attaches to even such a tiny province as strackenz the point is that the marriage will be hailed by the danish faction in strackenz who are an unusually troublesome grouppossibly because they are so far away from denmark itself and if they are contented strackenz will continue in peace its german population will know how to wait he added with confidence i confess i stifled a yawn but he ignored it politically then the match is not only desirable but essential its stabilising influence apart i am not without hopes of carl gustaf with whom i am acquainted he would make a popular consort and ruler in strackenz he hesitated his eyes unwinking on mine and i stirred impatiently well then says i good luck to the happy couple and god bless em all and tiny tim will you come to the point as far as im concernedif i am at all which im beginning to doubt oh you are says he nodding grimly i said there was a crisis in strackenz it is this as things stand the wedding which is to be solemnised in six weeks time cannot take place cant it now why not prince carl gustaf who is in many ways an admirable young man has nevertheless his share of young mens folly bismarck paused he has contracted a social disease which makes it impossible that he marry at least for the time being a what a social disease you mean hes got a dose of clap i let loose a guffaw well thats damned inconsiderate of him bad luck on countess whatshername too still boys will be boys eh but that makes things awkward i agree what are you going to do about it bisinarck didnt reply for a moment there was a dead silence in the room an expectant silence that made me uneasy well says i at length what next bismarck stood up abruptly went over to a desk against the wall and took a small object from it he weighed it in his hand as he paced slowly back to the table if the wedding does not take place strackenz will explode the danish party will see to it liberal agitators will whip up antigerman feeling with tales of a plot but it is obviously impossible for prince carl to marry for several months when his condition has responded to treatment he seemed to expect a comment so i suggested the wedding be postponed on what pretext if the real reason were known the marriage could never take place at all obviously and the strackenz pot would boil over at the moment no one knows of carl gustafs malady except his own physician and two highlyplaced danish ministers the rest of denmark like germany and strackenz suspects nothing amiss and expects the wedding to go forward you say only three people know that this prince has cupids measles then how do you i have my own sources the three i mentioned the prince and ourselves are the only people who know rest assured he juggled the object in his hand the wedding must take place well hell just have to marry her clap and all wont he what else out of the question says de gautet speaking for the first time humanitarian reasons apart it would surely be discovered afterwards and the ensuing scandal would have as disastrous an effect as a postponement of the marriage well then talk sense says i if the prince cant marry her in six weeks the weddings off aint it youll have to think of something else we have says bismarck and the wedding will take place youre talking bloody nonsense says i anyway what the hell do i care what has all this to do with me bismarck tossed down on the table the thing he had been holding it slithered along the length of the wood and stopped in front of me i saw it was a gold case oval and about four inches long open it says bismarck i touched the catch and the thing sprang open in it was a miniature in very fine colour showing a man in uniform youngish but with a completely bald head which gave him an unnatural look he wasnt badlooking though and it seemed to me i knew him and then the case dropped from my fingers and the room seemed to swim about me for i did know him saving the bald head the face in the miniature was my own it was all too familiar from my own mirror the likeness was uncanny exact prince carl gustaf of denmark says bismarck and his voice seemed to be coming through a fog im not often at a loss for words but at that moment i sat stricken dumb the enormity of the ideafor it was as plain as a pikestaff in an instantwas beyond reasonable comment i just sat and gaped from them to the miniature and back and rudis jovial laugh rang out magnificent cries he id not have missed that moment for a dukedom i wish you could have seen your faceyour own face i mean you will remember says bismarck that when we first met in london i was puzzled to remember where i had seen you before i had not of coursebut i had seen the young prince carl when he visited berlin i realised then that you were doppelgдngers identical bodies and regarded it as an interesting fact no more three months ago when i first learned of the princes indisposition and that his response to treatment was too slow to make it possible that he be married on the required date i remembered the fact again i perceived that here lay a way out at first as you may appreciate i rejected the notion as absurd then i applied myself to study it minutely and saw that it was possible incredible perhaps but still possible i planned it step by step and saw that with proper care and preparation it was more than thatit was virtually certain of success my decision taken i set in motion the events that have brought you here to schцnhausen at last i found my tongue youre mad i shouted youre a raving lunatic youd substitute me for him to to pose to attempt the maddest most ridiculous silence he shouted and came round the table his face working with passion do you suppose i have entered on this matter lightly that i have not examined it time and time again before i determined on it do you imagine i designed the plan that has brought you here and spent the time and money i have used without being certain that i could complete the whole business he bent down his face close to mine and spoke rapidly and quietly consider if you have the intelligence the minute thoroughness of the stratagem that has brought you this far planned my english numbskull with a care and precision that your slow wits cannot conceive genius says kraftstein jerking his head like a doll only one thing was a matter of chanceyour presence in england it was the prerequisite and by good fortune it was there the restorganisation bismarck took a breath and straightened up and as we have begun so we will proceed well i saw one thing he was mad they all were and by god if they thought they were dragging me into their lunacy they had got the wrong man i wont touch it says i and thats flat dyou think im as big a fool as you are good god man the things impossible i wouldnt last five minutes as a substitute for this poxedup danish fellow and what then eh bismarck considered me a moment then fill his glass kraftstein he walked back to his seat and stretched his legs it is perhaps unreasonable to expect you to accept the scheme without being convinced of its soundness tell me why do you suppose it might fail there were about seven hundred answers to that and i burst out with the first one that came to mind i couldnt get away with it how could i pretend to be a danish prince take my word for it that you could the likeness believe me is astounding no one would suspect the imposture for a moment but i dont speak danish dammit but you have a gift for languages remember in the few weeks available you can be given a smattering no more than that will be necessary for his highness speaks german indifferently well as you will before you take his place you have a tolerable fluency as it is but but well how the devil do you propose that i should take his place go to denmark i suppose and present suitable references balderdash you need not go to denmark i have been in constant communication with prince carl gustaf naturally he does not know of our plan but he does have great faith in me one of the ministers i mentioned is in my employ through him all has been arranged the prince will set out from denmark when the time comes with his retinue he has been led to believe that i have found a way out of his difficulties he is rather a simple fellow although amiable and supposes that i can arrange matters in that belief he will come to holstein en route to strackenz and in holstein the substitution will take place the mechanics you may leave to me it was like listening to some grotesque fairytale the cool precise way in which he told it was staggering but but this retinuehis people i mean the minister who is my agent will accompany the prince his name is detchard with him at your side you need have no fears and no one will suspect you why should they because ill give myself away in a hundred things man my voice my actionsgod knows what that is not so said bismarck i tell you i know the prince his voice his mannerismsall of it and i tell you that if you shave your head and upper lip your own mothers would not know you apart its true says rudi from the fireplace you arent just alike youre the same man if you learn a few of his habitsgestures that sort of thingit cant fail but im not an actor how can i you wandered in afghanistan disguised as a native did you not says bismarck i know as much about you as you do yourself you see if you can do that you can easily do this he leaned forward again all this has been thought of if you were not a man of action of proved resource and courage of geist und geschichlichkeit wit and aptitude i would not have entertained this scheme for a moment it is because you have all these things and have proved them that you are here now well that was all he knew god help him he believed the newspapers and my huge overblown reputationhe thought i was the daredevil flash harry of popular report the hero of jallalabad and all that tommyrot and there was no hope that i could persuade him otherwise but my god says i appalled what you are proposing is that i should go to strackenz and marry this damned woman i meanim married already you are a protestant this will be a roman ceremony it will be in no way binding on you morally or in fact who cares about that what i mean isid have to live with her as king of strackenz or whatever it is how could i what about the real prince carl he will be kept close under lock and key in a convenient place in mecklenburg he will there recover from his illness and in due course i will explain matters to himthe full truth i will point out to him that he has no choice but to continue with the remainder of my plan and whats that in gods name when he has recoveredin perhaps a month or two after your marriageyou will go hunting from a certain lodge you will become separated from your companions they will find you eventually or rather they will find the real prince he will have fallen from his horse and taken a slight graze on the head it will necessitate some days rest and recovely thereafter he will return to strackenz city and his bride if she notices any difference in him it will be attributed to the effect of his head wound but it will hardly cause her to suspect that he is not the man she married i expect that they will live and rule long and happily together and what the hell happens to me you my dear sir will by then be far over the frontiers of germanywith ten thousand pounds sterling in your pocket bismarck permitted himself a smile we do not ask you to work for nothing you see your silence will be assuredfor if you decided to tell your incredible tale who would believe it but why should you you will have come out of the affair most profitably aye profitably for you thinks i with a bullet in the back of my head or a knife between my ribs it was as clear as day that at the end of the affair id be a heap safer dead than alive from their point of view i looked from bismarck to the cheerfully smiling rudi who had perched himself on the table edge to kraftstein frowning at me from his massive height to de gautet with his snakes eyesi even glanced round at bersonin glowering in silence by the door by gum ive seen some pretty sets of villains in my time but i believe that if i were ever asked to recruit a band of cutthroats for some nefarious enterprise bismarcks beauties would head my list i see what is in your mind says bismarck he rose taking out his cigar case and presented me with a weed which he lit for me from a candle you do not trust me you believe that afterwards i should have you destroyed nicht wahr that i would break my promise oh well says i the thought hadnt occurred but now that you mention it my dear mr flashman says he credit me with some intelligence i have only to put myself in your shoesas im sure you have just been putting yourself in mine i should be highly suspicious if i were you i should require to be convinced that all wasabove board is it not i said nothing and he took a turn round the table ask yourself says he what i have to gain by playing you false security hardly so since you will be in no case living to do harm to us as ive said no one would believe your story which indeed would incriminate you if you were foolish enough to tell it what else killing you would present problems you are not a child and disposing of you might well cause some unforeseen complication in my plans were honest with you you see says rudi and kraftstein nodded vigorously de gautet tried to smile reassuringly like a contrite wolf and ten thousand pounds you may believe me is neither here nor there went on bismarck it is a cheap price to pay for laying the foundation of the new germanyand that is what is at stake here you may think we are daydreaming that we are foolish visionariesyou may even think us villains i do not care it does not matter it is a great thing that we are going to do and you are only a tiny pawn in itbut like all tiny pawns vital i need you and i am willing to pay for what i need he drew himself up virile commanding and full of mastery you seek guarantees of my good faith i have tried to show you that it is in my interest and germanys to keep faith to this i add my word as a junker a soldier and a gentleman i swear on my honour that what i have promised i shall fulfil and that when you have concluded your part in this scheme you shall have safeconduct out of germany with your reward and that no harm shall come to you he swung about on his heel and went back to his chair the others sat dead still and then after just the right interval had elapsed he added if you wish i can swear it on the bible for my own part i believe that a man who will tell a lie will swear one also i do neither but i am at your disposal it was very prettily said for a moment he almost had me believing him but id moved in just as seedy company as friend bismarck and was up to all the dodges i dont care about bible oaths says i and anyway im not sure that i like your little plot im no pauper you know which was a damned lie but there and im not sweatin to earn your ten thousand its dishonest its deceitful and its downright dangerous if there was a slip it would cost me my head and ours remember says de gautet you would be in a position to betray us if you were taken thanks very much says i that would be a great consolation but dyou know i dont think i care for the whole thing im all for a quiet life and even in a bavarian prison says young rudi sweetly serving ten years as a ravisher that cock wont fight says i even suppose you took me back to munich now how would you explain my absence between the supposed crime and my arrest it might not be so easy that made them think and then bismarck chimed in this is to waste time whatever pressures were used on you initially the point is that you are here now and i need hardly tell you what will happen if you refuse my offer we are very lonely here none saw you come none would ever see you go am i plain you have no choice in fact but to do as i require and collect the fee which i promise will be paid so there we were the good old naked threat they could slit my throat as neat as ninepence if they chose and none the wiser i was in a most hellish fix and my innards were churning horribly but there was no way outand they might be honest at the end of the day by god i could use ten thou but i couldnt believe they would come up to scratch i didnt even dare think of the risks of their harebrained impersonation scheme but on the other hand i couldnt contemplate the alternative if i refused on the one side a lunatic adventure fraught with frightful danger and possibly a handsome reward on the other sidedeath no doubt at the bare hands of herr kraftstein tell you what bismarck says i make it fifteen thousand he stared at me coldly that is too much the reward is ten thousand and cannot be increased i tried to look glum but this had cheered me up if he was intending to play me false in the end he wouldnt have hesitated to raise the stakes the fact that he didnt suggested he might be going to level after all youre no pauper you know chuckled ruth damn him i sat like a man undecided and then i cried ill do it then good man cries ruth and clapped me on the back i swear youre one after my own heart de gautet shook my hand and announced that they were damned lucky to have such a resolute resourceful cool hand in the business with them kraftstein brought me another glass of brandy and pledged me even bersonin deserted his post at the door and joined in the toast bismarck however said no more than very good we will begin our further preparations tomorrow and then took himself off leaving me with the four jacks in the pack they were all affability now we were comrades in fortune and jolly good fellows and they did their best to get me gloriously fuddled i didnt resist i was shaking with the strain and in need of all the fortifying liquor i could get but through all their noisy bonhomie and backslapping one thought kept pounding in my brain oh jesus in the soup again how in gods name shall i get out this time you can guess how much sleep i had that first night at schцnhausen well liquored as i was when bersonin and kraftstein helped me to bed and pulled my boots off my mind was all too clear i lay there fully clothed listening to the wind whining round the turrets and watching the candle shadows flickering on the high ceiling and my heart was pumping as though i had run a race the room was dank as a tomb but the sweat fairly ran off me how the devil had it all happened and what the devil was i to do i actually wept as i damned the folly that had ever made me come to germany i could have been safe at home pleasuring myself groggy with elspeth and sponging off her skinflint father facing nothing worse than the prospect of bearleading her family in society and here i was imprisoned in a lonely castle with five dangerous lunatics bent on dragooning me into a harebrained adventure that was certain to put my head in a noose and if i resisted or tried to escape they would wipe me out of existence as readily as they would swat a fly however as usual once i had cursed and blubbered myself empty my mind started searching for some ray of comfortanything to cling to for if you are coward enough your vainest hopes can be magnified beyond all reason six weeks bismarck had said before this impossible weddingsay five weeks or a month at least before my substitution for carl gustaf had to take place surely much could happen in that time clever and wary as they were bismarcks gang couldnt watch me all the timein four weeks there must be a moment when such a practised absconder as myself could cut and run for it a horse that was all i needed and a look at the sun or the stars and i was confident that my terror could outstrip bismarcks vengeance god knew how far away the frontier was but i was willing to wager my neck that i could reach it faster than any rider living my neck of course was exactly what i would be wagering with these jolly musings i passed the night imagining a score of madcap means of escapeand as many nightmares in which bismarck caught me in the act it was all a waste of time of course within me i knew that anyone who could plot as subtly as he had done wasnt going to give me the ghost of a hope of escaping and i had a shrewd suspicion that if a chance did arise id be too funky to take it these fellows would stop at nothing they proved it too on my first morning at schцnhausen the great oaf kraftstein summoned me at dawn and i was pulling on my boots when ruth strode in very fresh and whistling cheerfully rot him and did your highness sleep well says he i trust your highness is sufficiently rested after your journey i told him sourly that i wasnt in a mood for his comedy oh no comedy at all says he high drama and unless you want it to develop into tragedy youll act as youve never acted before from this moment you are his highness prince carl gustaf blood royal and lords anointed do you follow me you speak german and nothing elseyour danish well take care of presentlyand you will comport yourself as a member of the danish ruling house talk sense i growled i dont know how no but were going to teach youyour highness says he and for once his eyes had no laughter in them so the first thing is to make you look the part all right kraftstein and then and there despite my protests kraftstein sat me in a chair and set to work first cropping my hair and whiskers and then soaping and shaving my skull it was a long and unpleasant process and when it was done and i looked in the glass i could have burst into tears the ghastly creature with his great gleaming dome of a skull was a horrid parody of memy face surmounted by a naked convict head damn you i burst out damn you youve ruined me i expected them to mock me of course but neither twitched so much as a muscle your highness will be under the necessity of shaving your head daily murmured rudi kraftstein will instruct you now may i suggest that your highness wears uniform today they had that too rather a trim rig i had to admit in bottle green which fitted me perfectly and would have given me a fine dashing air if it hadnt been for that bald monstrosity above the collar admirable says rudi standing back from me may i compliment your highness on your appearance drop that blast you i snarled at him if i have to play your damned game youll spare me your infernal nonsense until it starts at least im your prisoner aint i isnt that enough for you he waited a moment and then says in exactly the same tone may i compliment your highness on your appearance i stood glaring at him on the point of swinging my fist into his impassive face but he just stared me down and i found myself saying all right if you mustall right very good your highness says he gravely may i respectfully suggest that we go down to breakfast i find that schцnhausen gives one a rare appetitethe country air of course will you lead on kraftstein i wasnt hungry but ruth attacked his food in good spirits and chattered away throughout the meal he treated me with a nice blend of familiarity and respect and you would never have guessed if you had seen us that it was all a sham he was a splendid actor and although it would have made me feel a complete fool if i hadnt been too miserable to mind i began to realise even then that there was method in what he was doing kraftstein just put his head down and gorged but on the one occasion he addressed me he too called me highness bismarck came in just as we were finishing and he for one wasnt playing charades he stopped dead on the threshold though at sight of me and then came into the room slowly studying my face walking round me and examining me carefully for a minute or more finally he says the likeness is astounding in effect he is carl gustaf so your friends have been trying to convince me i muttered excellent it is not quite perfect though two small details remain whats that says rudi the scars one either side the left immediately above the ear the one on the right an inch lower and running slightly downwardso and he drew his finger across my shaven skin the touch sent mice scampering down my spine by heaven youre right says rudi id forgotten how do we give him those my innards turned to water as bismarck surveyed me with his icy smile surgery it is possible ive no doubt kraftstein here could employ his razor most artistically youre not cutting my bloody head you bastard i shouted and tried to struggle out of my chair but kraftstein seized me with his enormous hands and thrust me back i yelled and struggled and he clamped his paw across my jaws and squeezed until the pain made me subside terrified but there is a better way says bismarck they can be administered in the proper formwith the schlager de gautet can do it without difficulty he added with a nasty look at me and it will satisfy a small debt that i owe to our friend here aye says rudi doubtfully but can he do it exactlythey must be in precisely the right places mustnt they no use giving him a wound where carl gustaf doesnt have one i have every confidence in de gautet says bismarck with a sabre he can split a fly on the wing i was listening to them appalled these two monsters calmly discussing the best means of giving me a slashed head if there is one thing i cant endure it is pain and the thought of cold steel slicing into my skull nearly made me swoon as soon as kraf tstein took his hand away i was yammering at them bismarck listened scornfully for a few seconds and then says silence him kraftstein the giant seized the nape of my neck and a fearful pain shot down my back and across my shoulders he must have fixed on some nerve and i screamed and writhed in his grasp he can go on doing that until you die says bismarck now get up and stop behaving like an old woman it wont kill you to have a couple of cuts from a schlager every german youth is proud to take them a little drink from the soupplate of honour will do you good for gods sake i burst out look ive agreed to do what you want but this is abominable i wont you will says bismarck prince carl gustaf has two duelling scars received while he was a student at heidelberg there is no question of your impersonating him without them i am sure he went on smiling unpleasantly that de gautet will administer them as painlessly as possible and if they cause you some triffing smart you may console yourself that they have been paid for in advance by your amiable friend mr gully you recall the occasion i recalled it all right and it was no consolation at all so now the swine was going to get his own back and if i resisted id have kraftstein pulling pieces out of me with his bare hands for my pains there was nothing for it but to submit and so i allowed myself to be led down to a big bare room off the courtyard where there were fencing masks and foils hung on the walls and chalk lines on the floor like a fencing school our gymnasium says bismarck you will spend some time here during your preparationyou are heavier than carl gustaf by a pound or two i should judge perhaps we can relieve you of some of it this morning coming from a man with sausages of fat beginning to bulge over his collar this was pretty cool but i was too busy gulping down my fear to mind presently de gautet arrived looking even more snakelike than he had the previous night and when bismarck explained what was to do you could see the rascals mouth start to water you must be exact to the inch says bismarck look here he stood in front of me drawing from his pocket the little miniature he had shown me last night glancing at it and then at me and frowning you see how they runso and so now the crayon and to my horror he took a fat black pencil which kraftstein held out and with great care began to mark on the skin of my head the places where the cuts were to go it was the final obscene touch that brought the bile up into my mouth so that i almost spewed at him he stood there his face close to mine hissing gently through his teeth and sketching away on my crawling flesh as though it had been a blackboard i shuddered away and he growled at me to be still i was paralysed i dont think that of all the beastly things that man ever did or all the terror he caused me that there was anything as loathsome as that casual marking of my skin for de gautet to cut at there is only one word for itit was german and if you dont understand what i mean thank god for it at last he was done and kraftstein could arm us for the schlager play it seemed horrible to me at the time but looking back from the safety of old age i can see that it is more childish than anything else for all their pride in taking scars to impress everyone with how manly they are the germans are damned careful not to cause themselves any serious damage kraftstein fitted big metal caps onto the crowns of our heads they were equipped with spectacles of iron in front to protect the eyes and nose and there were heavy padded stocks to go round our necks then there was a quilted body armour to buckle round our middles with flaps to cover the thighs and a padded bandage to wrap round the right arm from wrist to shoulder by the time we were fully equipped i felt like pantaloon with dropsy it was so ridiculous that i almost forgot to be afraid even when the schlager was put into my hand it looked such a ludicrous weapon that i couldnt take it seriously it was more than a yard long with a triangular blade and had a huge metal bowl at the hilt to protect the hand it must have been about a foot across the soupplate of honour says bismarck you have used a sabre i suppose ask your man about that when weve finished says i blustering with a confidence i didnt feel de gautet was swishing his schlager in a frighteningly professional way very good says bismarck you will observe that your opponents head is covered as is yours at all points except for the cheeks and lower temples these are your targetsand his i may tell you that with de gautet you are as likely to hit those targets as i was to strike mr gully you may cut but not thrust do you understand i shall call you to begin and to desist he stepped back and i found myself facing de gautet across the chalked floor rudi and kraftstein had taken their places along the walls but bismarck stayed within a couple of yards of us armed with a schlager to strike up our blades if need be de gautet advanced saluting with a flourish in his padding he looked like some kind of sausagedoll but his eyes were bright and nasty through the spectacles i didnt salute but came on guard sabrefashion right hand up above my head and blade slanting down before my face salute snaps bismarck pish to you says i guessing that it would offend his fine teutonic spirit to ignore the formalities i was getting cocky you see because all this paraphernalia had convinced me that the business wasnt really serious at all im not a sabre experta strong swordsman rather than a good one was how the masteratarms in the th hussars had described me and if i have to use one id rather it wasnt in single combat but in a mкlee where you can hang about on the outskirts roaring your heart out and waiting for an opponent with his back turned however it seemed to me now that i ought to be able to guard the unprotected areas that de gautet would be cutting at he came on guard the blades grated between us and then he twitched his wrist quick as light right and left aiming deft little cuts at the sides of my head but flashys nobodys fool i turned my wrist with his and caught the cuts on my own blade he cut again and the blade rang on my cap but i broke ground and let go a regular roundhouse slash at him like a dragoon full of drink with the schlager i learned later you are supposed to employ only wrist cuts but i was just an ignorant foreigner my sweep if it had landed would have loosed mr de gautets guts all over the floor but he was quick and turned it with the forte of his blade he came in again on guard his narrow eyes on mine and the blades rasped together he feinted and cut hard but i was there again and as we strained against each other i sneered at him over the crossed blades and exerted all my strength to bear down his guard i felt his blade giving before mine and then it whirled like lightning and it was as though a redhot iron had been laid against my right temple the pain and shock of it sent me staggering back i dropped my schlager and grabbed at my face and as bismarck jumped between us i saw the most unpleasant sight i know which is my own blood it coursed down my cheek and on to my hand and i howled and dabbed at the wound to try to staunch it halt cries bismarck and strode over to inspect my wound not because he gave a tuppenny damn about me but to see if it was in the right place he seized my head and peered to an inch he exclaimed and tipped his hand triumphantly to de gautet who smirked and bowed fahren sie fort cries bismarck stepping back and signing to me to pick up my schlager shaking with pain and rage and with the blood feeling as though it were streaming out of me i told him what he could do with it i wasnt going to stand up to be cut to bits for his amusement he went red with fury pick it up he rasped or ill have kraftstein hold you down and well set the other scar on you with a rusty saw its not fair i shouted i think my skulls fractured he damned me for a coward snatched up the schlager and thrust it into my hand and in case worse should happen i squared up to de gautet again resolving to take the other cut as quickly as possible and then to settle the account in my own way if i could he shuffled in full of bounce cutting smartly right and left i parried them tried a quick cut of my own and then flicked up my point to leave my left side unguarded instinctively he slashed at the gap and i took it with my eyes shut and teeth gritted against the pain my god but it hurt and i couldnt repress a shriek i reeled but kept a tight grip on my schlager and as de gautet stepped back satisfied with his butchery and glanced towards bismarck i forced myself into a sudden lunge that sent my point through his lousy body the next thing i knew i had been hurled to the floor and as i lay there blinded with my own blood all hell broke loose someone fetched me a tremendous kick in the ribs i heard rudi shouting and de gautet groaningdelightful soundand then i must have fainted for when i opened my eyes i was sprawled on one of the benches with kraftstein sponging the blood from my face my first thought was theyll settle my hash now for certain and then i realised that bismarck and de gautet had vanished and only young rudi was left grinning down at me i couldnt have done better myself says he not much anyhow our friend de gautet wont be quite so cockahoop another time not that youve damaged him muchyou barely nicked his sidebut hell ache for a day or two so will you of course lets have a look at your honourable scars my head was aching abominably but when he and kraftstein had examined it they pronounced it satisfactoryfrom their point of view de gautet had laid his cuts exactly and provided the wounds were left open they would quickly heal into excellent scars kraftstein assured me give you a most distinguished appearance says rudi all the little prussian girls will be fluttering for you i was too sick and shocked even to curse at him the pain seemed to be searing into my brain and i was halfswooning as kraftstein bandaged my skull and the pair of them supported me upstairs and laid me down on my bed the last thing i heard before i slipped into unconsciousness was rudi saying that it would be best if my highness rested for a while and i remember thinking it odd that he had slipped out of his playactors role for a while and then back into it that was my only experience of schlagerplay and it was one too many but it taught me something and that was a fearful respect for otto bismarck and his ruffians if they were capable of that kind of coldblooded mutilation then there was nothing they wouldnt do from that moment i put all thought of trying to escape from schцnhausen out of my mind i hadnt the game for it as to the scars they healed quickly under kraftsteins care ill carry them to my grave one close to my right ear the other slightly higher but just visible now that my hair is thinner neither is disfiguring fortunately indeed as rudi observed there is something quite dashingromantic about them theyve been worth a couple of campaigns i often think in giving people the wrong impression of my character they hurt most damnably for a couple of days though during which i kept to my room that was all the convalescence they would allow me for they were in a great sweat to begin what rudi was pleased to call my princely education this consisted of some of the hardest brain work ive ever had in my life for a solid month every waking hour i lived talked walked ate and drank prince carl gustaf until i could have screamed at the thought of himand sometimes did at its worst it amounted to gruelling mental torture but in recalling it now i have to admit that it was brilliantly done i wouldnt have believed it possible but the three of themrudi kraftstein and bersonincame as close as one humanly could to turning me into another person they did it subtly and persistently by pretending from the first that i was carl gustaf and spending hour after hour reminding me about myself i suppose to approach the thing in any other way would have been useless for it would have been constant admission of the imposture and what an idiot harebrained scheme it was they took me through that danish bastards life a hundred times from the cradle upwards until i swear i must have known more about him than he did himself his childhood ailments his relatives his ancestors his tutors his homes his playmates his education his likes his dislikes his habitsthere wasnt a call of nature that he had answered in twenty years that i wasnt letterperfect in by the time they had done hour after hour day after day they had me sitting at that long table while they poured fact after fact into mewhat food he liked what pets he had had what he read what colour his sisters eyes were what nursery name his governess had called him how long he had lived at heidelberg what his musical tastes were where they had got all their information god only knows but they had two huge folders of papers and drawings which seemed to contain everything that he had ever done and all that was known about him i couldnt tell you my own grandmothers christian name but god help me i know that carl gustafs greatuncles mastiff was called ragnar and he lived to be twentythree and what was your highnesss favourite game when you were little rudi would ask playing at sailors i would reply what was the english ship you boasted to your mother you had captured at copenhagen the agamemnon how did you come to capture it how the blazes do i know i was only three wasnt i i cant remember you have been told it was stuck in a mudbank in your infant reenactment you covered yourself in mud in a garden pond dont you remember that was the kind of thing i had to know and when i protested that no one was ever likely to ask me what games i had played when i was little they wouldnt argue but would pass patiently onto remind me of the fever i had had when i was fourteen or the time i broke my arm falling from an apple tree all our talk was conducted in german at which i made capital progressindeed rudis one fear was that i might be too proficient for carl gustaf apparently thdnt speak it too well for all his heidelberg education bersonin who despite his taciturnity was a patient teacher instructed me in danish but possibly because he himself only spoke it at second hand i didnt take to it easily i never learned to think in it which is unusual for me and i found it ugly and dull with its long vowels that make you sound as though you had wind but the real curse of my days was being instructed in the actual impersonation we had the tremendous advantage as i was to see for myself later that carl gustaf and i were real doppelgangers as like as two tits even our voices were the same but he had mannerisms and tricks of speech that i had to learn and the only way was for me to try attitudes and phrases over and over in different styles until rudi would snap his fingers and exclaim er ist es selbst now say it again and yet again for example it seemed that if you asked carl gustaf a question to which the normal answer would have been yes or of course he instead of contenting himself with ja would often say sicher which means positively certainly and he would say it with a jaunty air and a little stab of his right forefinger again in listening to people he would look past them giving tiny occasional nods of his head and making almost inaudible grunts of agreement lots of people do this but i dont happen to be one of them so i had to practise until i found myself doing it almost without thinking and he had a quick brisk laugh showing his teethi worked at that until my throat smarted and my jaws ached but this was easy compared with the contortions i went through in trying to mimic his trick of raising one eyebrow by itself i came near to setting up a permanent twitch in one cheek and eventually they decided to let it be and hope that no one noticed that my eyebrows perversely worked together fortunately carl gustaf was a cheerful easygoing chap much as i am myself but i had to work hard to try to correct the sulky look i get when pm out of sorts and my habit of glowering and sticking out my lower lip this ray of danish sunshine didnt glower apparently when he was in the dumps he showed it with an angry frown so of course i had to knit my brows until they ached how well i learned my lessons you may judge when i tell you that to this day i have his trick of rubbing one hand across the back of the other and that i entirely lost my own habit of scratching my backside royaltyi have bersonins solemn word for itnever claw at their arses to assist thought now the result of all this day after day and of the unbroken pretence that my captors kept up was remarkable and sometimes even frightening i suppose im a good actor to begin withafter all when youve been shamming all your life as i have it must come pretty naturalbut there were times when i forgot that i was acting at all and began to halfbelieve that i was carl gustaf i might be practising before the long cheval glass with rudi and bersonin watching and criticising and i would see this baldheaded young fellow in the green hussar rig flashing his smile and stabbing his forefinger and think to myself aye thats meand then my mind would try to recapture the picture of the dark damnyoumeladlooking fellow with the curly hair and whiskersand i would discover that i couldnt do it that was when i found it frighteningwhen i had forgotten what my old self looked like mind you my character didnt change these flashes were only momentary but i certainly began to believe that we would carry off the imposture and the terror that i had originally felt about it subsided to a mere craven apprehension of what the end of it all might bewhen payday came and the real carl gustaf had come back into his own however that was in the future and in the meantime i was floating with the tide as is my habit and letting my puppethandlers think that butter wouldnt melt in my mouth for their part they seemed to be delighted with my progress and one day about three weeks after i had come to schцnhausen on an evening when bismarck joined the rest of us at supper i did something which convinced rudi and bersonin that the first round was won at least we were sitting down to table myself at the head as usual and bismarck plumped down in his chair before i did now i was so used by this time to being seated first that i simply stared at him more in curiosity i imagine than anything else and he catching my glance actually began to get to his feet rudi who missed nothing couldnt repress a chuckle and a delighted slap of his thigh right royal otto says he to bismarck he had you feeling like a badmannered little schoolboy there ill swear bravo your highness youll do this was rather more familiarity with me than ruth had allowed himself since my duel with de gautet it didnt matter to me of course but bersonin was shocked and muttered that rudi was forgetting himself it occurred to me then that i was not the only one who was beginning to believe in my own royalty anyway i played up by remarking to bersonin casually that the freiherr was still at an age when impudence took precedence before dignity and was this hock that we were to drink again tonight bismarck observed all this impassively but i felt sure he was secretly impressed by the naturalness of my princely behaviour and even more by his own momentary reaction to it i should say in passing that bismarcks appearance that night was a rare one for days at a time i never saw him but from casual conversation among the others i gathered that he was frequently in berlinhe was a member of their parliament apparently when he wasnt kidnapping useful englishmen and plotting lиse majestй i also learned that he had a wife in the capital which surprised me somehow i had come to think of him as brooding malevolently in his lonely castle wishing he was emperor of germany i remembered that lola had thought he was a cold fish where women were concerned but it seemed that this was only a pose before his marriage apparently he had been saddling up with all the wenches on his estate and breeding bastards like a buck rabbit they called him the schцnhausen ogre in those days but of late he had been devoting himself to politics and his new wife bersonin said and taking a serious interest in his farm property a likely tale thinks i his only interest in politics was to get personal power no matter how and to gorge himself with food drink and women along the way nasty brute however as i say we didnt see much of him or of anyone else for that matter they kept me pretty well confined to one wing of the house and although there must have been servants i never saw one except the old butler there wasnt a woman in the place which was a dead bore and when i suggested to rudi that he might whistle up a wench or two to pass the evenings he just shook his head and said it was out of the question your highness must contain yourself in patience says he may i respectfully remind you that your wedding is not far off thanks very much says i and may i respectfully remind you that im feeling randified now and in no mood to hold myself in until my wedding to some young german cow who probably looks like a boatswains mate your highness need have no fears on that score says he and he showed me a portrait of duchess irma of strackenz which i must say cheered me up considerably she looked very young and she had one of those cold narrow disdainful faces that you find on girls who have always had their own way but she was a beauty no question her hair was long and blonde and her features very fine and regular she made me think of a story i remembered from my childhood about a snow princess who had a heart of ice well i could warm this one up always assuming our enterprise got that far in the meantime says i what say to some nice hearty country girl she could teach me some more german you know and i could teach her anatomy but he wouldnt hear of it so the weeks ran by and i suppose that gradually the nightmare impossibility of my position must have begun to seem less incredible than it looks now half a century after whatever happens to you however farfetched you get used to eventually ive found and when the time came to leave schцnhausen i was ready for it i was in a fair funk of course but so heartily thankful to be getting out of that draughty mausoleum that even the ordeal ahead seemed endurable it must have been a week or so after the meeting with bismarck that ive just described that i was summoned late one evening to his library they were all there rudi bismarck and the three wise men and i knew at once that something was up bismarck was still in his greatcoat with the last snowflakes melting on its shoulders and a little pool of water forming round each boot as he stood before the fire he looked me over bleakly hands behind his back and then says the scars are still too livid any fool can see they are recent this seemed an excellent reason to me for calling off the whole thing but kraftstein said in his ponderous way that he could attend to them he had a salve which could disguise their pinkness and make them look like old wounds this seemed to satisfy bismarck for he grunted and turned to rudi otherwise he is ready he can play the part your head depends on this remember his highness is ready to resume his duties says rudi bismarck snorted his highness he is an actor hired to play a part better he should remember that and the consequences of missing a cuehell be less liable to bungle it oh yes bersonin i know all about your theories i prefer realities and the reality of this mr flashman is that tomorrow you leave for strackenz you know what is to do the reward of successand the price of failure his cold eyes played over me are you dismayed oh no says i when its all over i intend to go back to england and take the place of prince albert dont you know rudi laughed but i saw kraftstein shake his headno doubt he was thinking that i didnt look enough like prince albert to get away with it sit down says bismarck give him a brandy de gautet he came to stand at the table head looking down at me listen to me carefully when you leave here tomorrow you will be accompanied by freiherr von starnberg and de gautet they will take you by coach to the rendezvous we have appointedyou need to know nothing more than that it is a country mansion owned by a nobleman who is to play host to prince carl gustaf for one night during his journey to strackenz the journey to the house will take two days but we are allowing three for safety on the appointed day carl gustaf and his retinue will arrive at the mansion in the afternoon it stands in wooded country but is easily accessible you will be waiting for evening and when it comes von starnberg and de gautet will take you into the grounds under cover of darkness you will be admitted by a man who is one of the only three in the world outside this room who is in our plot his name is detchard a danish minister entirely faithful to me he will conduct you secretly to the princes apartment in the meantime von starnberg will be effecting the removal of the real prince have i made myself clear so far by god he had and as i listened all my old fears came galloping back with a vengeance the thing was obvious lunacy and this outrageous creature standing so straight and immaculate in his greatcoat was a dangerous maniac but but look here i began suppose something goes wrongi mean suppose somebody comes he banged his fist on the table and glared at me nothing will go wrong no one will come righteous lord god do you suppose i know nothing do you imagine i have not planned every detail de gautet tell himwhat is the name of the servingmaid whose duty it will be to change the princes bed linen while he is at the house heidi gelber says de gautet starnberghow do you reach the princes dressingroom from the door where detchard will admit you twelve paces along a passage up the stairway to the right left at the first landing then ten paces along to a passage on the right the princes dressingroom is the first door on the left from door to doorfifty seconds says bismarck if you wish i can tell you the precise nature of the furnishings in the princes chamber and their positions in the room for example there is a statuette of a kneeling cupid on the overmantel now are you convinced that my organisation is sound and my information complete how do you know that some drunk footman wont come blundering along in the middle of everything i cried i thought he would hit me but he restrained himself it will not happen he said everything will fall out exactly as i have said there was no point in arguing of course i sat in despair while he went on once inside that room you will be prince carl gustaf that is the fact of paramount importance from that moment flashman no longer existsyou understand with you will be detchard and the princes physician orsted who is also privy to our plans if at any moment you are in doubt they will guide you and when you set out next morning on your royal progress across the border into strackenz you will find that among the dignitaries who will greet you will be both de gautet and starnbergit has been arranged that they will join your train as gentlemen of honour so you will not lack for friends he added grimly now drink your brandy i gulped it down i needed it at the back of my mind i suppose there had still been some futile hope that i would be able to slip out of this at the last moment but bismarck had squashed it flat i was going to have to go through with it with rudi and de gautet hovering alongside ready at the first false move to put a bullet into me i didnt doubt why the hell i asked myself for the thousandth time had i ever come to this bloody country the wedding will take place on the day after your arrival in the city of strackenz bismarck went on for all the world as though he had been telling me the time of day you have already received some instruction in the details of the ceremony of course and thenall plain sailing as your people say he sat down and poured himself a glass of brandy from the decanter he sipped at it while i sat mute staring at my glass well mr flashman what have you to say what the hell does it matter what i say i burst out ive no choice damn you to my amazement he actually chuckled he stretched his legs and twirled the stem of his glass between his fingers none at all says he grinning flashman you should be glad you will be making historyaye great history do you realise i wonder the magnitude of what we are doing we are nailing a little hinge to a door a great door which will open to reveal the destiny of a greater germany and youa halfpay officer of no account a pawn even in your own countrys affairs you are going to make it possible can you imagine what it means the man was positively beaming now with a kind of fierce joy in his eyes for we are going to win we six here we are staking ourselves our lives everythingand we are going to succeed i look at you and i know we cannot fail god has sent you to germany and i send you now to strackenz there was a nice little comparison there all right and in strackenz you will play such a game as has never been played before in the histoiy of the world and you will not faili know it what a destiny to be one of the architects of the new fatherland he lifted his glass i salute you and drink to our enterprise believe it or not he actually raised my spirits a little with that of course it was all humbug designed to put some backbone into methat was all he knewbut the man was so supremely confident it was infectious if he really believed we could bring it offwell perhaps we could the others cheered and we all drank and bismarck sighed and refilled his glass id never seen him anything like this before for the moment he was almost jovial showing an entirely new side of his natureall carefully calculated for my benefit i imagine how will we look back on this he mused when we are old and in our country places and the bold lads of a new day are elbowing for power in the chancelleries i wonder he shook his head i think i will wear leather breeches and allow myself to be laughed at in stettin wool market and sell two thalers cheaper to anyone who calls me baron and you flashmanyou will sit in your club in st james and grow fat on port and your memories but we will have lived by god we will have fought we will have won is it not something to have moved great affairs and shaped the course of time no doubt i should have shared his enthusiasm like kraftstein who was hanging on every word and looking like a ruptured bullock but all i could think to myself was god i wish john gully had really set to work on you what i said aloud was herr bismarck i am much moved and now with your permission i intend to get as drunk as possible afterwards tomorrow i shall be at your service since i cant do anything else but if im to shape the destiny of europe ill need a good skinful of liquor inside me to set me off so will you kindly oblige me with the bottle and a cigar and as many dirty drinking songs as you and your friends can remember and if this seems to you a coarse and pagan spirit in which to approach our glorious adventure for the fatherland wellyouve made your preparations let me now make mine as a result of the nights excesses which bismarck didnt discourage i had a raging headache and a heaving stomach on the morning of my departure from schцnhausen so i remember very little of it which is no loss for that matter my recollections of the journey north to strackenz are hazy too ive travelled too far in my time to be anything but bored by it and there was nothing to see that i recall except flat snowy fields the occasional village and bleak woodlands of bare black trees rudi was full of spirits as usual and de gautet was his smooth civil self but i knew he wouldnt forget or forgive that schlagerthrust in the guts i hadnt forgotten the two cuts i owed him either so we were even there he never referred to our encounter but now and then in the coach i would catch his dark eyes on me and then they would slide away looking anywhere but at me he was one who wouldnt be sorry of the excuse to draw a bead on my back if i tried to run for it following bismarcks lead both of them had dropped the pretence of calling me highnessbersonins theory as bismarck had called it being well enough in my training period i suppose but now considered unnecessary but they lost no chance of lecturing me on such subjects as the geography of strackenz the ceremonial forms of its court and the details of the wedding ceremony i suppose i took it all in for there was nothing else to do but it has all gone now we were three days on the road and the last afternoon of the journey took us deep into forestcountry all ghostly and silent under the snow it was very beautiful and solemn with never a soul to be seen along the rough track winding among the trees until about four in the afternoon we stopped in a little clearing where a small hut stood with thin smoke wreathing up from its chimney into the steely sky there were two or three brisklooking fellows in peasant clothes to rub down the horses and usher us into the cottagenot that i took them for peasants for i heard two of them in talk with rudi they were gentlemen by german standards but tough active customers for all thatthe kind wholl cut your throat and send back the wine at dinner afterwards we had a meal rudi and i while de gautet paced up and down and peered out at the darkening sky and consulted his watch and fidgeted generally until rudi told him to leave off and made him sit down and have a glass of wine with us i was getting fairly twitchy myself as the hours passed and rudi gave me a stiff brandy to steady me three hours fiom now says he and youll be tucked up in a silk nightgown with cg embroidered on it god i wish i was in your shoes how many commoners have the chance to be royalty ill show you one whos ready to resign his crown any time says i the shivers were beginning to run up my spine nonsense give you two days and youll be behaving as though youd been born to the purple issuing royal decrees against virginity probably what time is it de gautet we should be moving i heard the strain in his voice heighho says rudi stretching he was as cool as though he was off for an evening stroll come along then there was a slight altercation just before setting out when de gautet officiously helping me into my cloak discovered my pistols in the pockets id had them concealed in a pair of boots in my baggage at schцnhausen and was determined that they were going with me rudi shook his head royalty dont carry sidearms except for ceremony i do says i either they go with me or i dont go at all what good dyou suppose theyll be man none i hope but if the worst happens theyll perhaps buy me a little elbowroom de gautet was in a sweat to be off so in the end rudi cursed and grinned and let me keep them he knew i wouldnt be fool enough to make a bolt for it now with de gautet leading rudi and i behind and two of the others in the rear we struck out through the trees plodding ankledeep through the snow it was still as death all round and hellish dark but de gautet led on unerringly for perhaps quarter of an hour when we came to a high stone wall running across our front there was a wicket and then we were skirting past a thicket of high bushes which by their regular spacing must be in the garden of some great estate even in the darkness i could make out the level sweep of lawn under the snow and then ahead of us were the blazing lights of a huge mansion surrounded by terraces and hedged about by avenues of clipped bushes de gautet strode noiselessly up one of these with us hard on his heels there were stone steps rising to a wing of the house that seemed to be in darkness and then we were clustered round a small doorway under a great stone lintel and rudi was softly whistling marlbroug sen vaten guerre for a few seconds we waited breathing hoarsely like schoolboys who have robbed an orchard and then the door opened detchard de gautet went in and we followed there was a man in a frockcoat in the dimlylit passage he closed the door quickly behind usthe other two were still outside somewhereand motioned us to silence he was a tall distinguished old file with a beaky nose and heavy lower lip he had grey hair and a beard like a muffler round his jawline he glanced keenly at me muttered donner and turned to rudi a complication his highness has retired early he is already in his apartments aha thinks i clever little bismarcks bandobast didnt allow for this oh jesus were done for no matter says rudi easily he has three rooms he cant be in all of them at once this was gibberish to me but it seemed to reassure detchard without another word he led us along the passage up a stair into a welllighted and carpeted corridor and round a corner to a large doubledoor he paused listening cautiously turned the handle and peered in a moment later we were all inside detchard stood for a moment and i could hear my heart thumping like a paddlewheel the sound of voices came softly through an adjoining door from the next room his highness is in his bedchamber whispers detchard rudi nodded strip says he to me and de gautet bundled up my gear as i tore it off he knotted it all in my cloaki had just sense enough to remember my pistols and thrust them hurriedly under a cushionand then i was standing there mothernaked while detchard listened with his ear to the panels of the communicating door lucky little duchess irma murmurs rudi and i saw him grinning at me lets hope the real prince is as royally endowed he tipped me a mock salute very debonair bonne chance your highness ready de gautet together they went to the communicating door rudi nodded and in a moment they had opened it and slipped through with detchard behind them there was a second in which the murmur of voices sounded louder and then the door closed and i was left stark in a royal dressingroom in a german mansion all alone and palpitating for a moment there wasnt a sound and then something tumbled next door minutes passed a door was shut somewhere there was a muttering of voices in the corridor that sent me scampering behind the curtains and then silence several minutes passed and my teeth began to chatter with cold and apprehension at last i peeped out to see if there wasnt a gown or something to wrap up in there was plenty of furniture in the room the main article being an enormous decorated commodeit struck me as my usual luck that whereas most royal successions lead to a throne mine had got me nothing so far but a thunderboxbut devil a rag of clothing beyond a couple of towels so i wrapped up in the curtain as well as i could and waited fearfully then the door opened and detchards voice said softly wo sind sie i poked my head out he was carrying a big silk dressinggown thank god and i grabbed at it shuddering his highness has left the house says he everything is in train is all well with you oh splendidexcept that im almost frozen to death isnt there a fire in gods name there is a stove in the bedroom says he and ushered me through to a splendid apartment thicklycarpeted with a huge fourposter bed richlycurtained and a fine stove with its doors thrown wide to warm the room while i thawed out detchard stood with his grey head cocked considering me and toying with his seals it is truly amazing says he at last i did not believe it but you are the same man wonderful well i hope the other ones warmer than i am havent you any brandy he poured me a glass very carefully and watched me gulp it down you are nervous says he naturally however you will have the night to accustom yourself to theah novelty of your situation his highness retired early with a slight headache no doubt brought on by the fatigue of his journey so you will be undisturbed your host count von tarlenheim has given particular instructions you will meet him briefly tomorrow by the way before we set out for the border an amiable dotard his highnessor i should say your highnesshas been quite formal with him so far so there will be no questions asked if you are no more forthcoming tomorrow than politeness demands thank god for that says i i wanted time to play myself in so to speak and the thought of chattering to a breakfast table was out of court altogether the only people who have been close to you on the journey apart from myself are dr ostred your physician and young josef your valet he has been in your service only a day your old valet einar having become indisposed shortly after we set out convenient says i will he live of course you are much concerned about him he turned and i leaped violently as the door opened and a little anxiouslooking chap came in ah ostred says detchard and the little chap blinked looked at me at detchard and back at me again i thought he stammered that isyour pardon highness i supposed you had retired that you would be in bed he looked helplessly to detchard and i thought by heaven he thinks im the real man he couldnt make out what had gone wrong so here was a firstrate chance to put the thing to the test if i could fool my own doctor i could fool anyone i have a headache says i quite gently that doesnt mean that i have to take to my bed no no of course not highness he licked his lips perhaps you might take his highnesss pulse doctor says detchard and the little fellow came over arid took my wrist as though it was made of porcelain there were beads of sweat on his brow a little swift he muttered and glanced at my face he was scared and puzzled and then he literally leaped back as though he had seen a ghost he he he exclaimed pointing no ostred says detchard he is not the prince but the little doctor gargled speechlessly and i couldnt help laughing but he isidentical dear jesus i could not believe it i was sure when i saw him that something had gone amissthat it was still the prince my god what gave him away asks detchard the scars they are new and pink detchard snapped his teeth in annoyance the scars of course i had forgotten that might have cost us dear however we have the means to put it right and he took out a flask which i suppose rudi had given him and daubed at my wounds until he and the doctor were satisfied there says detchard when did you last shave your head last night it will do for the moment ostred will attend to it again tomorrow he pulled out his watch now it may be best if you and i doctor return to our hosts for my benefit he rattled off a few more details about tarlenheim and the arrangements for the morning your valet will look in shortly to see you to bed he concluded you may sleep easily believe me now that i have seen you my doubts are at rest i seriously question if your own father would detect the imposture ha you seei said your own father he smiled grimly i half believe in you myself and so your highness i have the honour to bid you goodnight they withdrew bowing and left me tremblingbut for once it wasnt funk i was elatedi had fooled ostred by god it was going to work i took a turn round the room grinning to myself drank another glass of brandy and another and stood beaming at myself in the mirror well prince harry thinks i if only elspeth could see you now and old moneybags morrison and lord godalmighty cardigan hed be glad enough to have royalty back in his fleabitten th hussars for i was royal for the moment a fullblown prince of the blood no less untilaye until bismarcks little game was played out and thenoh the blazes with him i had another glass of brandy and took stock of my royal surroundings sumptuous wasnt the word for themsilk sheets lace pillow solid silver cup and plate by the bedwith breast of chicken under a napkin bigod in case i felt peckish i resisted a temptation to slip the plate into a pocketplenty of time for lifting the lumber later this was only a stagingpost on the journey after all the pick of the loot would be in the palace of strackenz but i felt i could rough it here for the nightexcellent liquor a warm fire cigars in a tooled leather box even the pot under the bed was of the best china with little fatarsed cherubs running round it i plumped back on the bedit was like floating on a cloud well thinks i they may talk about cares of state and uneasy lies the head and all that tommyrot but this is the life for old flashy you may take my word for it next time you hear about the burdens of monarchy that royalty do themselves damned proud ive been one i know my eye fell on an ornament on the mantel a carved kneeling figure a little prickle ran through me as i realised that this was the cupid bismarck had mentionedby jove he knew his business that one down to the last detail i rolled off the bed and looked at it and felt a slight glow of pleasure as i realised it wasnt a cupid after allit was a nymph the great otto wasnt infallible then after all it was most obviously a nymph and contemplating it i realised there was one thing missing from my princely paradise bronze nymphs dont compare to real ones i hadnt had a woman since the blubbery baroness pechman had been so rudely plucked from my embraceand i hadnt really been able to get to proper grips with her before rudi had interrupted us fat and all as she was the thought of her was making me feverish and at that moment there was a soft tap at the door and a slim very soberlooking fellow slipped in this was obviously josef my valet i was on guard again in a moment is there anything your highness requires says he i dont think so josef says i and gave a yawn just going to bed and then a splendid idea occurred to me you may send up a chambermaid to turn down the covers he looked surprised i can do that sir now flashy would have growled damn your eyes do as youre bloody well told but prince carl gustaf merely said no send the chambermaid he hesitated a second his face expressionless then very good your highness he bowed and went to the door goodnight highness of course it was a damfool thing to do but what with the brandy and my randy thoughts i didnt care anyway wasnt i a prince and the real carl gustaf was no monk by all accountsand damned careless about it too so i waited in lustful anticipation until there was another knock and a girl peeped in when i called out to enter she was a pretty plump little thing curlyhaired and as broad as she was long but just the thing for me with my thoughts running on baroness pechman she had a bright eye and it occurred to me that josef was perhaps no fool she curtsied and tripped across to the bed and when i sauntered overslipping the doorbolt on the wayand stood beside her she giggled and made a great show of smoothing out my pillow all work and no play isnt good for little girls says i and sitting on the bed i pulled her on to my knee she hardly resisted only trying to blush and look demure and when i pulled down her bodice and kissed her breasts she cooed and wriggled her body against mine in no time we were thrashing about in firstrate style and i was making up for weeks of enforced abstinence she was an eager little bundle all right and by the time she had slipped away leaving me to seek a wellearned rest i was most happily played out ive sometimes wondered what the result of that encounter was and if there is some sturdy peasant somewhere in holstein called carl who puts on airs in the belief that he can claim royal descent if there is he can truly be called an ignorant bastard there are ways of being drunk that have nothing to do with alcohol for the next few days apart from occasional moments of panicstricken clarity i was thoroughly intoxicated to be a kingwell a princeis magnificent to be fawned at and deferred to and cheered and adulated to have every wish grantedno not granted but attended to immediately by people who obviously wish they had anticipated it to be the centre of attention with everyone bending their backs and craning their necks and loving you to ecstasyit is the most wonderful thing perhaps id had less of it than even ordinary folk especially when i was younger and so appreciated it more anyway while it lasted i fairly wallowed in it of course id had plenty of admiration when i came home from afghanistan but that was very different then theyd said theres the heroic flashman the bluff young lionheart who slaughters niggers and upholds old englands honour gad look at those whiskers which was splendid but didnt suggest that i was more than human but when youre royalty they treat you as though youre god you begin to feel that youre of entirely different stuff from the rest of mankind you dont walk you float above it all with the mob beneath toadying like fury i had my first taste of it the morning i left tarlenheim when i breakfasted with the count and about forty of his crowdgoggling gentry and gushing femalesbefore setting out i was in excellent shape after bumping the chambermaid and having a good nights rest and was fairly gracious to one and alleven to old tarlenheim who could have bored with the best of them in the st james clubs he remarked that i looked much healthier this morningthe solicitous inquiries after my headache would have put a royal commission on the plague to shameand encouraged i suppose by my geniality began to tell me about what a hell of a bad harvest theyd had that year german potatoes were in a damnable condition it seemed however i put up with him and presently after much handkissing and bowing and clanking of guardsmen about the driveway i took my royal leave of them and we bowled off by coach for the strackenz border it was a fine bright day with snow and frost all over the place but warm enough for all that my coach was a splendid machine upholstered in grey silk excellently sprung and with the danish royal arms on the panels there were cuirassiers bumping along in escort smart enoughand a great train of other coaches bringing up the rear i lounged and had a cheroot while detchard assured me how well things had gone and would continue to gohe neednt have bothered for i was in an exalted state of confidenceand then presently we rolled through our first village and the cheering began all along the road even at isolated houses there were smiling faces and fluttering handkerchiefs squires and peasants farmgirls and ploughmen infantswaving the red and white danish colours and the curious thistlelike emblem which is the badge of holstein labourers in their smocks staring mounted officials salutingthe whole countryside seemed to have converged on the strackenz road to see my royal highness pass by i beamed and waved as we rushed past and they hallooed and waved back all the harder it was a glorious dream and i was enjoying it to the full and then detchard reminded me drily that these were only holsteiners and i might save some of my royal energy for the strackenzians it was at the border of course that the real circus began there was a great crowd waiting the toffs to the fore and the mob craning and hurrahing at a more respectful distance i stepped out of the coach at detchards instruction and the cheers broke out louder than everthe crashing threefold bark that is the german notion of hiphiphiphooray an elderly cove with snowwhite hair thin and hobbling stiffly came forward bowing and handkissing to bid me welcome in a creaking voice marshal von saldern constable of strackenz whispered detchard and i grasped the old buffers hand while he gushed over me and insisted that this was the greatest day in strackenzs history and welcome thrice welcome highness in turn i assured him that no visitor to strackenz had ever arrived more joyfully than i and that if their welcome was any foretaste of what was to come then i was a hell of a fortunate fellow or words to that effect they roared and clapped at this and then there were presentations and i inspected a guard of honour of the strackenz grenadiers and off we went again with von saldern in my coach to point out to me objects of interest like fields and trees and thingsthe old fellow was as jumpy as a cricket i realised and babbled like anything which i accepted with royal amiability and then he had to leave off so that i could devote myself to waving to the people who were now lining the road all the way and in the distance there was the sound of a great throng and a tremendous bustle far away guns began to boom in salute and we were rolling through the suburbs of the city of strackenz itself the crowds were everywhere now massed on the pavements waving from the windows crouching precariously on railings and all yelling to beat the band there were flags and bunting and the thumping of martial music and then a great archway loomed ahead and the coach rolled slowly to a halt the hubbub died away a little and i saw a small procession of worthies in robes and flat caps approaching the coach ahead was a stalwart lad carrying a cushion with something on it the keys to the city quavered von saldern for your highnesss gracious acceptance without a thought i opened the door and jumped down which i gather was unexpected but was a happy act as it turned out the crowds roared at the sight of me the band began booming away and the little burgomaster took the keyshuge heavy things on an enormous collarand begged me to accept them as an earnest of the loyalty and love of the city your city highness he squeaked and your home i knew enough to say that i was deeply sensible of the great honour done me and to give him the keys back again and being somewhat exalted i felt it appropriate to slip my swordbelt over my head present the weapon to him and say that it would be everready in the defence of strackenzian honour and independence or some such stuff i didnt know it but that brief speech had an enormous political implication the danishstrackenzians being in a great sweat about the german threat to their liberty and the germanstrackenzians bursting to get away from danish sovereignty anyway the yell of applause that greeted it was startling the little burgomaster went red with emotion and taking the sword he pressed it back on me tears in his eyes and calling me the champion of strackenzian freedom i dont know which side he was on but it didnt seem to matter i believe if id shouted chairs to mend theyd have cheered just as loud i was then invited to enter the city and it seemed a good notion to me to ride in on horseback rather than go in the coach there was delight and confusion at this orders were shouted officers scampered to and fro and then a cavalryman led forward a lovely black gelding speed written in every line of him and i mounted amid scenes of enthusiasm i must have looked pretty fine if i say it myself they had dressed me that morning all in pale blue with the blue sash of the order of the elephant over my shoulder the uniform set off my excellent stature famously and since my disgusting bald head was covered by a plumed helmet а la tinbellies ive no doubt i looked sufficiently dashing the band played the cheering reechoed and i rode through the gateway into the city of strackenz flowers were showered from the balconies girls blew kisses the troops lining the street struggled to hold back the press and i waved and inclined my princely head left and right and smiled on my loyal subjectstobe well he can ride someone called out and a wit in the crowd shouted back aye duchess irma will find out all about that at which there was some commotion i was aware that for all the adulation and hurrahing there were those in the crowd who stood silent and even some who looked positively hostile these would be the germans no doubt who didnt want to see the state bound any closer to denmark however they were a small minority in the city at all events and for the most part it was flowers and laughter all the way with prince charming flashing his smile to the prettiest girls and feeling no end of a fellow probably because i was enjoying myself so much it was no time at all to the town hall i should say that strackenz isnt much of a city being no greater than one of our market towns although it has a cathedral and a ducal palace of some pretension for that matter the whole duchy isnt more than a dozen miles across by about thirty in length having been whittled down over the centuries from a fairsized province but it was a perfect hotbed of nationalist emotions german and danish and fiercely proud of its traditions including its ducal house the danish faction were overjoyed at the impending marriage hence their tumultuous welcome of me at the town hall there were more dignitaries and bowing and scraping and i was presented with an ornamental casket bearing the citys arms and invited to sign an order for a jail clearanceit being the custom here as elsewhere to celebrate joyous occasions by letting all the hooligans and harlots out of the local clink how this is supposed to add to the general jollity ive never understoodfurthennore although ive been in half the lockups between libby prison and botany bay myself no one has ever held a clearance that benefited me im against em on principle but i saw nothing for it here but to sign until the moment i actually took the pen in my hand and realised with a fearful qualm that one thing my instructors hadnt taught me was how to forge carl gustafs signature i didnt even know what his writing looked like probably i could have signed my own fist and no one would ever have spotted a difference but at the time i didnt dare to risk it for what seemed a year i hesitated at the great burgomasters table with the long roll of parchment stretched out in front of me and my pen poised while the crowd goggled expectantly and the little burgomaster stood waiting to pounce on my signature with the sandcaster and then my motherwit came back to me and i laid down the pen and said very quietly and seriously that before signing such a deliverywhich i reminded them was a grave matter indeedi would wish to hear a report from the justices assuring me that no malefactor who might prove a danger to the commonweal would be enlarged by the amnesty it could wait i said firmly for a day or two and added that i would find other and better ways of marking this happy occasion of my arrival that pious old hypocrite arnold my headmaster would have loved every word of it but there was a general air of disappointment round the table although one or two of the toadies muttered about a prudent prince and wagged their heads approvingly the little burgomaster looked ready to cry but agreed that my wishes would be met to the letter they all cheered up though at the next act of the comedy when a small child was led in to present me with a peach that they had been preparing for me in the hothouse of the local orphanage i say led in because the child was so lame he had to go on little crutches and there were sighings and affected cooings from the females present im no hand with children at all and have found them usually to be detestable noisy greedy little brats but it seemed best to be monstrously pleasant to this one so instead of just accepting the gift i racked my brains quickly for a touching gesture and was inspired to pick him uphe was no size at alland sit him on the table and talk to him and insisted that we eat the peach between us then and there he laughed and cried together and when i patted his head according to form he fastened on to my hand and kissed it the females were all snivelling foully by this time and the men were looking pitying and noble i felt ashamed and still do it is the only time in my life i have felt ashamed which is why i put it on record here and i still dont know why anyway i left the town hall in a thoroughly ill temper and when they told me that next on the programme was a visit to the local academy i as near as not told them id had enough of their damned infants for one day but i didnt of course and presently i was being conducted through the school by the professor who made an oration in my honour in greek and then put up his best boys to construe for my entertainment the things these honest asses imagine will delight royalty of course the selected pupils were the usual mealy wretches who are put up in all schools everywhere on such occasions pious manly little villains of the type i used to oppress myself in happier daystom brown could have made a football side out of em i dont doubt and had them crying play up and telling the truth fit to sicken you so i decided on a bit of mischief and looked to the back of the school for the local flashmanaye there he was a big surly lout biting his nails and sneering to himself theres a likely lad professor says i lets hear him construe so willynilly they had to put the brute up and he was papercolour at the shock of it of course he floundered and grunted and glared round for inspiration and the goodygoodies giggled and nudged each other and the professors frown grew blacker every minute stand down sir says he grimly and to me he shall be corrected highness i assure you thats your sort professor says i lay on with a will and i left in excellent humour there would be a raw backside in that school by night or i was mistakenmind you id sooner it had happened to the clever little sneaks but no doubt my counterpart would pass his smarts on to them in turn the crowds still filled the streets for my final progress to the palace which was a fine imposing pile on the outskirts of town with pillars and balconies and the running lion flag of strackenz floating from its roof with the danish colours alongside the people were jammed up to the railings and the sweep of the drive beyond was lined with the yellowjacketed infantry of the duchesss guard all in glittering backandbreasts with drawn swords trumpeters blew a fanfare the crowd surged and shouted and i cantered up the gravel to the broad palace steps there i turned and waved for the last time and wondered why people will make such a fuss over royalty its the same with us we have our tubby little teddy whom everyone pretends is the first gentlemen of europe with all the virtues when they know quite well hes just a vicious old rakerather like me but lacking my talent for being agreeable to order anyway i was aboard lily langtry long before he was that by the way all such lofty philosophical thoughts were driven from my mind when i entered the palace for there i met the duchess i was to marry next day in the old cathedral of strackenz and it is a tribute to her that while i have only the haziest memories of the brilliant throng that crowded the marble staircase and great ballroom my first glimpse of her remains fresh in my mind to this day i can still see her standing slim and straight on the dais at the far end of the room with the ducal throne framed in crimson behind her watching me as i approached with the spectators suddenly hushed and only the sound of my marching feet echoing through the silence this was one of the moments when it struck me this is all a fraud it isnt real here was i not prince carl gustaf of the ancient royal house of oldenbcurg but rascally old flashy of the vulgar and latelyarrived house of flashman striding ahead to claim my noble bride god i remember thinking the things people get me into and that thought probably prevented me from wearing the devilmaycare leer that i normally assume in the presence of beautiful women she was beautiful toofar more so than her portrait had made her out she couldnt have been more than twenty but already she had the hard cold loveliness that you find only among northern women with their fine long features looking as though they had been carved from marble her figure in an ivory dress with a train that spread out behind her was perhaps a trifle on the slim side with a hint of boyishness about it but everything was there and in good parade order she was crowned with a little silver diadem sparking with stones and her shining fair hair was pulled back and rolled into some kind of jewelled net behind her head the effect of it allso pale and pure and perfectwas rather aweinspiring i felt almost afraid of her the way she looked at me didnt help mattersthe grey eyes were cold and proud and i thought this is a spoiled arrogant madame if ever i saw one whatever her feelings might be about a duty marriage she didnt seem to care for me at first glance i knew she was looking at my glistening bald head and i thought angrily what a damned shame it was i hadnt my natural adornments of curly mane and whiskers the hand she held out for me to kiss was as pale and chilly as mist in a cemetery and just about as welcoming i took it murmuring about pleasure and honour and deeply heartfelt felicitous gratification and felt it quiver ever so slightly before it was withdrawn so there we stood together on the dais with me wondering what to say next and then someone in the watching multitude began to clap and in a moment they were crowding forward to get a closer look i suppose at the pair of us and everyone was pleased and happy and clapping away like mad i found myself grinning and nodding at them but her grace stood there quite serene with never a smile as though this was her due and rather a bore well thinks i this is going to be a chilly wooing and then an old cove in a frock coat with orders on his breast came bowing up beside us and turned to the throng with his hand raised for silence this turned out to be the chief minister one schwerin he made a neat little speech in which he managed to wrap up a nice complimentary welcome for me a note of homage for the duchess a patriotic boost for strackenz coupled with the state of denmark and a hint to the mob to keep their distance and stay out of the buffet next door until her grace and i saw fit to lead the way that was about the size of it and the good folkwho were a very welltrained courtchattered respectfully among themselves while schwerin brought forward the more distinguished to be presented to me these included the various emissaries to strackenz the british one among them and i found myself thanking god that id never moved in diplomatic circles at home or he might have remembered me as it was he and the others made their bows and when they had withdrawn the duchess indicated to me that we should sit down we did so both rather stiff and while the noble assembly pretended not to notice we began to get acquainted it was formality carried to nonsense of course and if i didnt have a clear memory of our opening exchanges i wouldnt believe them duchess irma i trust your highnesss journey has not been tedious flashy indeed no although i confess i have counted every moment in my impatience to be here duchess your highness is very gracious we of strackenz can only hope that you are not too disappointed in uswe are very small and provincial here flashy no one could be disappointed who was welcomed by so beautiful and noble a hostess duchess oh was the weather cold on your journey flashy at times occasionally it was quite warm nowhere so warm however as i find it here duchess you are too hot i shall order the windows opened flashy christ no that is i mean the warmth of your welcome and the people in the streets cheering duchess ah the people they are rather noisy well i dont give up easy but i confess i was fairly stumped here usually with young women i get along all too well formal chitchat isnt my stylea little gallantry a few jocularities to see if she will or she wont a pinch on the buttocks and off we go either that or off i go but i couldnt make anything of the duchess irma she kept her head tilted high and looked past me so composed and regal that i began to wonder was she perhaps terrified out of her wits but before i could take soundings on that she rose and i found myself escorting her into the antechamber where great tables were laid out with silver plate and crystal and a most scrumptious spread was served by flunkies while a little orchestra struck up in the gallery overhead i was sharpset and while one of the duchesss ladies looked after her i laid into the ham and cold fowls and chatted affably to the nobs and their ladies who were making the most of the grub themselves as the germans always do this kind of function normally bores me out of mind and beyond the fact that the food was unusually excellent and that the duchess seemed intent on not being left alone with me for more than a moment at a time i havent any sharp recollection of it i remember turning once in that gay company with its buzz of wellbred conversation and catching her eyes fixed on me she looked quickly away and i thought my god im marrying that woman tomorrow my heart took a skip at the thought she was unutterably lovely and then it took a lurch as i remembered the appalling risk that i ran every moment i was in strackenz and wondered what the penalty might be for marrying the heir to the throne under false pretences death certainly i tried to smile politely at the eager sycophantic faces around me and to listen to their incredible inanities of smalltalk while my mind raced away looking for a way out even although i knew it didnt exist i probably drank a little more than i should have donealthough i was pretty carefulbut at any rate the desperate feeling passed the good will of the strackenzians towards me was so evident and so fulsomely expressed that i suppose it overcame me and banished my fears i found i could even talk to the duchess without embarrassment although it was obvious to me if not to anyone else that she didnt like me she remained haughty and distantbut then she seemed to be the same to everyone and they swallowed it and sucked up to her afterwards old schwerin and a couple of his ministerial colleaguesi forget their namestook me aside and discussed the next days ceremony they were fairly vague as i remember and gassed a good deal about the political advantage of the match and the popular satisfaction and how it would have a good and stabilising effect her grace is very young of course says old schwerin very young he gave me rather a sad smile your highness is not so very much older but your education at a great court and your upbringing have perhaps prepared you better for what lies before you both it is a great responsibility for you but you will bear it honourably i murmured noble nothings and he went on it is much to ask of two young folki often feel that such marriages of state would be the better ofahlonger preparation perhaps i am a sentimentalist says he with a senile smirk but it has always seemed to me that a courtship would not be out of place even between royal personages love after all does not come in a day it depends what you mean by love thinks i and one of the others says to schwerin you have a great heart adolf i hope i have i hope so and your highness i know has a great heart also it will know how to understand ourour little irma she is very much like a daughter to us you seehe was going pink about the eyes by this time and although she seems so serene and proud beyond her years she is still very much a child well i could agree with him that she was an unusually armgant little bitch for her age but i kept a princely silence he looked almost pleading your highness he said at last will be kind to our treasure strange my own fatherinlaw had struck something of the same note before i married elspeth its a polite way of suggesting that you dont make too much of a beast of yourself on the honeymoon i assumed a look of manly understanding sirs says i what can i say except that i trust i shall always bear myself to your duchess as i would to the daughter of my oldest and dearest friend that cheered them up no end and presently the reception began to draw to a close and the noble guests imperceptibly melted away schwerin beamed paternally on the duchess and myself and hinted that as the next day was going to be an exhausting one we should take all the rest we could beforehand it was still only early afternoon but i was dogtired with the novelty and excitement of the morning and so we said our formal goodbyes to each other i made mine as pleasant as i could and the duchess irma received it with an inclination of her head and gave me her hand to kiss it was like talking to a walking statue then detchard who had been hovering off my port quarter for several hours closed in and with attendant flunkies escorted me to the suite reserved for me in the west wing of the palace they would have made a great fuss of me but he shooed them away and what i thought rather odd he also dismissed josef who was waiting to unbutton me and remove my boots however i realised he wished us to be private and when we passed through into my main salon i understood why for ruth starnberg and de gautet were waiting for us the sight of them damped my spirits it was a reminder of what i was here for with my custodians dogging me all the time from being the prince i was become playactor flashy again rudi sauntered across and without so much as byyourleave took hold of my wrist and felt my pulse youre a cool hand says he i watched you down below and on my oath you looked a most condescending tyrant how does it feel to play the prince i hadnt been used to this kind of talk in the past few hours and found myself resenting it i damned his impudence and asked where the blazes he had been all dayfor he and de gautet had been supposed to meet me with the others at the frontier he cocked an eyebrow at me regal airs eh well highness weve been busy about affairs of state if you please your affairs your state you might show a little appreciation to your loyal servants he grinned insolently but of course the gratitude of princes is proverbial then dont presume on iteven with temporary royalty i growled you can both go to the devil i want to rest de gautet considered me a little drunk perhaps damn you get out i do believe the infection has really taken chuckled rudi hell be calling the guard in a moment now seriously friend flashmanand here he tapped me on the chestyou can put away your illtemper for it wont answer it aint our fault if the duchess hasnt languished at you no you neednt damn my eyes but listen certain things have happened which mayi say may onlyaffect our plans my stomach seemed to turn to ice what dye mean by ill chance one of the danish embassy at berlina fellow hansen a senior officialarrived today in strackenz he was on his way home and broke his journey here to attend the wedding there was no convenient way to get rid of him so he will be there tomorrow well what about it says i there will be plenty of danes in the cathedral wont there whats one more or less detchard spoke from behind me hansen has been a friend of carl gustafs from childhood indeed the most intimate of all his companions your resemblance to carl gustaf is uncanny put in de gautet but will it deceive his oldest playmate jesus i sat stricken no no by god it wont it cant hell know me i jumped up i knew it i knew it were done for hell denounce me you you bloody idiots see what youve done with your lunatic schemes were dead men and lower your voice says rudi and take a grip on your nerves he pushed me firmly back into my chair your minds disorderedwhich is not surprising bersonin warned us that even a strong man may show signs of hysteria in the kind of position youre in hes no fool that one is he cried i what the hell can i do hell give me away this hansen and he will not says rudi firmly take my word for it i can see this thing clearly which you cant being the principal actor and i tell you there is not the slightest riskprovided you keep your head hell meet you for a moment at the reception after the wedding shake your hand wish you well and whistthat is all hes not looking for an impostor remember why should he we would not have told you said detchard if it could have been avoided but if we had not you might unwittingly have made some fatal blunder thats it exactly says rudi you had to be ready for him now we have decided what you shall say when he approaches you in the reception line detchard here will be at your elbow and will whisper hansen when he reaches you at the sight of him youll start look as delighted as you know how seize his right hand in both of yours shake it hard and exclaim erik old friend where did you spring from then whatever he says in reply youll give your merriest laugh and say this is the happiest surprise of this happy day god bless you for coming to wish me joy and that will be all ill see to it that he doesnt get near you before you leave for the lodge at strelhow where your honeymoon is being spent and suppose he sees through me what then this news had left me sick with fright suppose he isnt to be put off with this nonsense about happy surprises and i have to talk to him longer i had a dreadful vision suppose he shouts thats not the prince whatll you do then ill have done it long before he shouts anything says rudi quietly you may rely on that i wasnt so easily reassured my cowardly instincts were in full cry and it took all rudis and detchards arts of persuasion to convince me that the risk wasnt so terribleindeed that if i played my part properly it was barely a risk at all conduct yourself as you were doing an hour ago says rudi and the things as safe as sleep courage man the worsts past youve pulled the wool over all the eyes in strackenz this day and right royally too i thought there was even a hint of envy in his voice all thats to do now is stand up in church with the delightful duchess say your vows and then off for a blissful idyll in your forest lovenest aye let your mind run on the pleasures of putting that dainty little pullet to bed he nudged me and winked lewdly ill wager the next duke of strackenz has fine curly whiskers for all that his father wont have a hair on his face to bless himself with of course as so often turns out there wasnt time to be frightened ostred gave me a sleeping draught that night and in the morning it was all mad bustle and hurry with never fewer than a dozen folk round me from the moment i rose dressing me pushing me instructing me reminding mei felt like a prize beast in the ring as i was conducted down the great marble staircase to the waiting coach that was to carry me to the cathedral as we paused on the steps the sound thundered up from the waiting thousands beyond the palace railings the cannon boomed in the park and a great cheer rolled across the steep roofs of strackenz city god save prince carl wherever he may be muttered rudi forward your highness it should have been a day to remember i suppose but how much of detail does one recall of ones own weddingand it was my second as you know it seems now like a strange dream driving through the packed streets in the sunshine with the roar of the people buffeting my ears the blare of the trumpets the clatter of hooves and the coloured bunting fluttering bravely in the morning breezebut what sticks in my mind is the red birthmark on the back of the coachmans head which under his hat was as bald as my own and then there was the sudden dimness and hush of the great cathedral the pungent smell of the church the soaring stained glass and the carpeted stone flags underfoot there was the rustle as hundreds of people rose to their feet the solemn booming of a great organ and the hollow thud of my own footsteps on the stones and there was the shrill sweetness of the choristers and people softly moving to and fro about me and the splendid figure of the bishop of strackenz bearded to the eyes and for all the world like willie grace the great cricket champion nowadays i remember standing very lonely and afraid wondering if perhaps there was such a place as hell after alla question which had occupied me a good deal as a small boy especially when arnold had been terrifying us with sermons about kibrothhattaavah where i gathered all kinds of fornication and fun took place well what i was doing in that cathedral would have ensured me a single ticket to damnation no doubt of that but i consoled myself with the thought that the hereafter was the last thing to worry about just then and i remember too the duchess suddenly at my side pale and wondrously lovely in her white gown with her golden hair crowned with a fillet of brilliant stones and her tiny hand slipping into mine her clear voice answering the bishop and then my own husky and nervous they pressed a ring into my hand and i fumbled it on to her tiny finger my palms sweating and kissed her on the cheek when the old bishop gave the word she stood like a wax dummy and i thought poor old carl gustaf having to live with this cold fish all his life and the choir let go a great blast of sound as they placed the ducal coronets on our heads and the duchess took the gold staff of her sovereignty and the sword of state was buckled round my waist then the whole congregation rose and sang a hymn of rejoicing and various minor clergy decked us out in the remaining crown jewels i must say that for a small state strackenz was remarkably well off in this respect apart from the coronets and staff there were rings for my fingers and a magnificent solid gold chain set with emeralds which they hung round my unworthy neck it had a star of diamonds pendent from it that must have weighed half a pound the duchess did rather better she being the reigning prince while poor old flash was just her consort she had a collar of solid gems and her rings would have knocked mine all to pieces soldierly instinct dies hard and as the hymn drew to a close i was mentally computing the worth of all this jewelled splendour and how it could best be stowed emerald chain in one side pocket collar in tother rings and similar trifles in the fobsthe coronets would be bulky but they could probably be bent flat for convenience and the staff was slender enough to stick down your boot of course id probably never have the chance to lay my itchy fingers on this magnificent collection of loot again but it does no harm to take stock in advance you never know what opportunities may arise the crown jewels of the duchy of strackenz would have kept me and a dozen like me in tremendous style for life and they looked eminently portable i decided to keep them in mind there was a final hallelujah and amen and then we were out in the sunlight again with the crowd deafening us and the great bells of the cathedral pealing overhead there was an open state coach in which we rode side by side with the duchesss bridesmaids facing us and i played up to the mob and waved and beamed while my bride stirred a languid hand in their direction she did manage a smile or two though and even condescended to exchange a few civilities with me which was a great advance never mind thinks i itll soon be ho for the hunting lodge and beddybyes and then well bring the roses back to those pearly cheeks we drove slowly so that the populace could get a good look at us and their enthusiasm was so tremendous that the infantry lining the road had to link arms to hold them back there were children waving flags and screaming girls fluttering their handkerchiefs fellows throwing their hats in the air and old women sobbing and mopping at themselves at one point the troops gave way and the crowd clamoured right up to the coach stretching over to touch us as though we were holy relics if only theyd known theyd have scampered off far enough in case they caught flashys evil the duchess wasnt too pleased at being adored so closely and looked ahead pretty stiff but i shook hands like a good un and they cheered me hoarse at this point there was an odd incident above the cheering i was aware of a voice shouting from the back of the crowdno not shouting but declaiming it was a strong harsh trumpet of a voice although its words were lost in the tumult and its owner was a most oddlooking fellow who had scrambled up onto some kind of handcart and was haranguing the mob full blast there were soldiers struggling through the press to get at him and a knot of sturdy soberlooking chaps round the cart as though to shield the orator so i gathered he must be denouncing us or threatening a breach of the peace he wasnt a big chap in height but he was built like a bull across the shoulders with a huge shaggy head and a beard like a sweeps broom even at that distance i could see the flashing eyes as he thundered out his message thumping the air with his fist and laying it off like a mississippi campmeeting preacher full of virtue and fortyrod whisky the people nearest him and his group were shouting threats at him but he kept bawling away and it looked to me as though an excellent brawl was in prospect unfortunately just as the soldiers reached him and were trying to haul him down the coach moved out of vision so i didnt see how it came out the duchess had seen it too and we were no sooner at the palace than she summoned schwerin to the anteroom where we were resting and pitched straight into him who was that agitator how dared he raise his voice against me and whose neglect allowed it to happen her voice was perfectly level but she was obviously in a furious bait and the old minister fairly cowered before the slip of a girl have he and his rabble been arrested schwerin wrung his hands highness that this should have happened it is deplorable i do not know who the man was but will ascertain i believe he was one of the socialist orators orator says the duchess in a tone that would have frozen brandy revolutionary upstart and on my wedding day she turned to me it is my shame and my countrys that this affront should have taken place in your highnesss presence on this sacred occasion well i didnt mind i was more interested in her cold rage at what she conceived an affront to her noble dignity she had a fine spoiled conceit of herself to be sure i suggested that the man was probably drunk and that he had done no harm anyway denmark must be fortunate in its security against such dangerous criminals says she in strackenz we find it prudent to take sterner measures against these these orators schwerin i hold you responsible let me hear presently that they have been arrested and punished it would have sounded pompous from a bench of bishops from a nineteenyearold girl it was ridiculous but i kept a straight face i was learning fast about my little irma an imperious young piece i found myself hoping that she would be thwarted of her vengeance on my bigheaded revolutionary whoever he was he had looked the kind of likely lad who would sooner spar with the peelers than eat his dinner and keep things lively all round when she had sent schwerin packing and her ladies had adjusted invisible flaws in her appearance we proceeded with tremendous ceremony to the great ballroom where the brilliant throng had already assembled for the reception this is a bigger do than old morrison gave for elspeth and me in paisley thinks i but ill wager they cant drink more than those scotch rascals did the place was a blaze of splendid uniforms and gowns orders medals and jewellery twinkled everywhere aristocratic backs bent and a hundred skirts rustled in curtsies as we took our place on the dais for the guests to file by with their respectful congratulations you never saw such a pack of noble toadies in your life smirking their way past they all fawned over the duchess of course the squareheads clicking their heels and bowing stiffly the dagoes bending doublefor we had a fine selection from half the countries in europe after all duchess irma was the cousin of our own britannic majestywhich made me a sortofcousininlaw to her and albert i supposeand everyone wanted to have a grovel to us i was delighted to see though that the british ambassador confined himself to a jerky little bow and a felicitations maam and much happiness to both your highnesses thats the style thinks i good old england and damn all foreigners i just stood there nodding my head up and down until my neck creaked smiling and murmuring my thanks to each passing facefat thin sweating straining smiling adoring they came in all sizes and expressions and then detchards voice behind me whispered hansen and i glanced sharply to see a fairhaired longjawed young fellow just straightening up from his bow to the duchess he turned to me smiling expectantly and in my sudden nervousness i took a step forward grinning like a deaths head i shouldnt wonder grabbed him by the hand and cried erik old friend this is the most springing surprise of my happy day or something equally garbled i know that i bungled the words hopelessly but he just laughed and pumped my hand dear carlhighnessi had to come to wish you joy he had that manly sentimental look mistyeyed yet smiling which i personally can only manage in drink god bless you both god bless you too old friend says i wringing hard at him and then his smile faded a puzzled look came into his eyes and he stepped back god knows ive had my bad moments but seldom such a qualm of sickening dread as i experienced then i kept my aching grin because i was so paralysed with panic that i couldnt move a muscle waiting for the denunciation which i was certain was on his lips for a second he stared and then he made a sudden nervous gesture of apology and smiled again pardon he said your pardon highness carl he moved quickly aside to let in the next guest bowed again and then moved off towards the buffets where the other guests were assembling there i saw him turn staring back at me and presently he rubbed his brow with his fingers gave his head a quick shake as a man will who is putting some trifle out of his mind and gave his attention to a waiter who was proffering champagne i knew i was crimson with the shock and one knee was trembling violently but i forced myself to smile steadily as the guest before me bobbed in a deep curtsey and her escort swept me a bow i saw the concern in their faceswhen i turn red im a daunting sightso i forced a laugh forgive me i told them im out of breath with saying thank you to several hundred people they were delighted at being so familiarly addressed by royalty and then the crisis was past and i had time to steady myself but it had been a horrible moment and i must have gone through the rest of that reception like a man in a dream for i can remember nothing more until i was back in my own room alone with detchard rudi and de gautet drinking brandy from a glass that rattled against my teeth it was a bad moment was rudis verdict for a second i thought we were gone i had him covered from my pocket and i swear if he had taken an instant longer to smile id have shot him down and claimed he was preparing to assassinate you and god knows what might have come of that phew but he saw i wasnt the prince i beat on the arm of my chair he saw through me didnt he you saw him de gautetdidnt he i doubt it says he for a moment he thought there was something strange about youand then he told himself it was his own imagination you saw him shake his headhe had tried to puzzle it out but couldntand now he no more doubts you than he doubts himself by god i hope so i attacked the brandy again suppose he thinks better of it thoughbecomes suspicious hes being watched every moment he is in strackenz says rudi we have other reasons for keeping a sharp eye on master hansen whats that oh his journey here wasnt only to dance at your wedding we know that for months now he and other members of the danish government have been in correspondence with the more militant danish faction in strackenzpeople like the eider danes over the border only rather more dangerous they watch everything german like hawks hold secret meetings that sort of thing theres talk of a clandestine organisation the sons of the volsungs dedicated to fly to arms in the event of any threat from berlin to strackenzian independence rudi grinned pleasantly well settle with those gentlemen when the time comes for the present neither they nor friend hansen need trouble you the games all but won my boyand he slapped me on the shoulder with the wedding behind us theres nothing to do but sit out the weeks until otto gives the word that our good carl gustaf is ready to resume the role in which you are proving such a distinguished understudy then back to merry england for youand lets hope the delectable irma isnt too disappointed in the change shall we this was all very well but i was by no means sure that the worst was past id had some nasty turns in my brief life as prince carl gustaf and it seemed odds on there being a few more before theyd sweated the clap out of him and he could succeed me on the consorts throne and even then would bismarck keep faith i didnt want to think about that just yet but it was always at the back of my mind sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof but you have to watch your step at night too i was still shaking with the hansen business and for that matter i was probably suffering from the strain of two days impostureat any rate i punished a half bottle of brandy there and then without noticeable effect which is always a sign that the funks have got me good and proper rudi although he watched me closely whistling through his teeth didnt say me nay there was no further official business that day only the drive to the hunting lodge at strelhow ten miles from the city and i didnt have to be stonecold sober for that we were to set out in midafternoon and presently josef and various minions were admitted to begin my preparations for the road there was a great bustle as trunks and boxes were taken below stairs and i was divested of my ceremonial uniform and kitted out in cutaway and topper as befitted a gentleman bent on his honeymoon i was sufficiently recovered from my nervous conditionor else the booze was beginning to workto be able to discuss with rudi the merits of checked or striped trousers which had been the great debate among the london nobs that year i was a checker myself having the height and leg for it but rudi thought they looked bumpkinish which only shows what damned queer taste they had in austria in those days of course if youll put up with metternich youll put up with anything while we were talking an officer of the palace guard put in an appearance with an escort carrying drawn sabres to collect the crown jewellery which josef had removed with my uniform they had taken my coronet and state sword on our return from the cathedral but my chain and rings remained and these were now carefully stowed in velvetlined cases and given to the guard to carry away pretty things says rudi cocking his cheroot thoughtfully between his teeth where are you taking them fдhnrich to the clockroom herr baron says the young officer clicking his heels aye thats a strange place surely wouldnt a dungeon be safer if you please herr baron the clockroom is in the top of the main tower of the palace the tower has one stair which is under constant guard the youth hesitated i believe they are kept there because in the old dukes time it was his graces delight to visit the clockroom every day and examine the state treasure i was taking this in for what it was worth and noting that rudi von starnberg was showing an uncommon interest in it too dishonest young pup i knew what he was thinking we left the palace on the stroke of three to be cheered out of town by the loyal strackenzians who had been making the most of the free buffets and unlimited wine being dispensed in all the public buildings the whole population seemed to be halfshot and the applause as we drove through the streets was abandoned and hilarious i sat with the duchess in an open landau accompanied by rudi and a strikingly pretty redhaired ladyinwaiting whose foot he kept stroking with his boot during the journey otherwise he was on his best behaviour which meant that his conduct stopped just short of open insolence however irma was in no frame of mind to notice she was in something of a pet chiefly i gathered because schwerin had not been able to report the apprehension of the agitator who had been abusing us on our drive from the cathedral and there had been difficulties with her trousseau the people who were waving us goodbye were overfamiliar in their expressions the open carriage was not suitable for such a cold dayand so on every damned thing seemed to be wrong for no obvious reason to me it seemed that whatever the rest of her trousseau was like her blue travelling gown and fur hat а la hussar became her admirably i said so and she condescended to acknowledge the compliment but very formally we were still as distant as dowagers in church and it struck me again that for all her prim composure she was probably quaking underneath i found this gratifying and resolved to let her stew in it for a while i wasnt oversolicitous and for most of the journey we rode in silence it was a sunny afternoon and warm in spite of irmas complaint the road from strackenz runs through some splendid forest country which encloses an unusual feature for that part of the world in a short range of little crags and cliffs called the jotun gipfel they are very pretty very wild as our late queen would say and rather like the english lake hills in miniature apart from a few shepherds huts they are fairly empty most of the inhabitants of strackenz province living down in the flat lands near the city but they contain one or two beautiful mountain tarns in one of which stands the old castle of jotunberg which was the stronghold of the dukes of strackenz in the bad old days it was kept now by the bьlow family a strackenzian branch of the great german house of that name the hunting lodge of strelhow stands some miles from the jotun gipfel tucked away in the woods a little distance off the main road it has been the country seat of the ruling house for generations and is an excellent little box all rough timber and fur rugs with fine open fires leaded windows comfortable appointments and plenty of roomaltogether a bangup place we were travelling fairly informally there were two strackenzian aides for me apart from de gautet and ruth and the duchess had three ladies and about five maidsgod knows why she needed all those detchard had come too but elected to stay in the village and of course i had josef with me there were other servants and various grooms and attendants and it looked like being quite a lively country party and it waslively and deathly we arrived at the lodge just before dusk my bride was nervous and irritable and had the servants who came out to greet us scurrying in all directions there was a meal prepared in the panelled diningroom with a cheery blaze in the grate and all looking mighty snug and inviting but she excused herself and went off abovestairs with her ladyinwaiting and a cloud of lackeys hovering in her wake however we menfolk were sharpset and fell on supper with a will and after that the port and brandy and before long we were making a good roaring evening of it what with sensing that her haughty highness was out of sorts and the food and wine i was in excellent trim and although de gautet was his usual saturnine selfi was growing to loathe that sleek silent smilerudi and the two strackenzians took their cue from me and caroused like cricketers for all their other faults i must own that germans are excellent fellows at a gorginganddrinking party rudi was in fine fettle with his tunic undone and his curly hair atumble leading the singing in a capital baritone i was ladling the liquor down at a fair rate and had just reached that state where i begin to search for mischief when a footman brought down word that her grace the duchess was about to retire and requested that the disturbance of the evening should cease at this the others fell silent rudi sat back in his chair and smiled into his glass the strackenzians glanced uneasily at each other i got to my feet staggering a little and upsetting my chair and said that if her grace was retiring so was i i bade them goodnight and walkedrather unsteadily i imagineto the door one of the strackenzian aides jumps up and asked could he help my highness no thankee my son says i im of age you know at which he fell back blushing and as i strode out i heard rudi laughing and calling out gentlemen a toast the prince carl gustaf coupled if you follow me with her grace the duchess of strackenz i blundered upstairs shed my clothes in my dressingroom thrust josef out threw on a gown and strode through into the bedroom i was full of booze and lewdness and the sight of irma caught unawares standing there in a white nightgown did nothing to sober me her cold proud beauty brought out the worst in me i threw off the gown and she shrieked and covered her eyes cheer up little wife says i there wont be any more singing downstairs and i stooped and whipped the nightdress clean off over her head she gave a little cry and since i maintain that the best way to deal with nervous females is to treat em hearty i lifted her up bodily popped her on and stumped round the room singing this is the way the ladies ride trittrot trittrot trittrot as near as i can remember i sang it in english but i doubt if she noticed at all events i know we finished the business on the bed with me laughing weakly and babbling about hobbledee hobbledee and down in a ditch and assuring her that she was a damned fine duchess and a credit to her country i suppose i dozed off but i woke up and had at her again and being slightly more sober by this time i was aware that she lay as still as a corpse and didnt enter into the fun of the thing at all if it had been any other woman id have smartened her up with a few cuts across the rump but with a duchess one ought to practise patience i felt and i was right you see because after that i went to sleep leaving her lying there with her eyes closed like a beautiful ghost in the candlelight and what should awaken mei dont know how many hours laterbut a tiny hand creeping across my thigh and long hair snuggling up to my face and i thought well damme royal or not theyre all alike under the skin i was beat i can tell you but one must act like a gentleman so i went to work again and this time she clung like a leech just like elspeth i remember thinkingall chaste purity to look at maidenly beauty personified and randy as a monkey ive known too many women far too many to claim to understand em their minds work in ways too mysterious for me to fathom anyway my studies have generally been confined to their bodies which perhaps accounts for it but i know that duchess irma of strackenz was a different woman after that nightto me at any rate she had been a proud autocratic thoroughly spoiled little brat the day before nervous as a mouse and as cold as a whales backside and id not have been surprised if after the way id handled her shed been put off men for good but next morning she was positively meek in a thoughtful but apparently contented way and very attentive to me she seemed to be in a state of wonder almost and yet she was ready to talk to me and what was even more remarkable listen to me toonot that im a great hand at conversation in the mornings i dont mention this in a boastful way or to suggest that with a chap like me its just a matter of catch em young treat em rough roger em hard and they eat out of my hand far from it ive used women that way and had them try to repay me with cold steel or run a mile next time i looked at them but with irma for some reason it had quite the opposite effect i can say that from that night on as long as i knew her she treated me with something near to worship which shows you how stupid a lovestruck young woman can be all this of course made for a most happy sojourn at strelhow there was plenty to do during the day what with picnic parties for although some snow still lay it was pleasantly warm for the seasonand shooting in the woods and riding in the afternoon and in the evening we had musical entertainment from the ladies or played billiards and the food and drink were of the best i began to feel like royalty again with people waiting on me hand and foot and jumping to my slightest wish and it is mighty pleasant to have a beautiful young duchess hanging on your arm adoring you even if she does keep you from getting much sleep at nights it was the life all rightlazing feasting shooting tickling the pills in the billiard room and sweating it out in bed with irmaall the trivial amusements that are simply nuts to chaps like me rudi and de gautet were the only flies in the ointment for their very presence was a constant jog to my memory of the business in hand but strangely enough i became a little closer to de gautet for i discovered that he shared one of my chief interests which is horseflesh he was an authority of the true kind who never pretends more than he knows and in the saddle he was nearly as good as i was myself which is to say he would have been topnotch among any horsemen in the worldeven the cheyennes of the american plains who are the best i know we rode together a good deal but i made sure we always had one of the strackenzians or a couple of grooms alongim nervous about going into the woods alone with fellows whom ive cut open with a schlager and who im pretty sure havent forgotten it de gautet at any rate was a silent unassertive fellow which was more than could be said of the bold rudi now that he was confident i could play my role in perfect safety he was treating me exactly as he would have used the real prince carl which is to say with his customary impertinence of course he cared for no one and even let his bright eye play over irma while he would address her with that halfmocking deference which he seemed to reserve for his social superiors she was woman enough to be taken by his good looks and easy charm but she sensed i think that here was a real wrong un and confessed to me on one occasion that she was sure he was not a gentleman i promised to replace him with a new aide when we returned to the cityand took some malicious pleasure in telling him about it later so that he should realise that one woman at least had read him correctly but he was only amused i knew the chit had no taste says he why shes taken to you but dont imagine you can get rid of me so easily your highnessim your loyal obedient and everpresent servant until the time comes to end our little comedy he blew a smokering and eyed me tongue in cheek i think youll be sorry when its over wont you princely life suits you or im mistaken in fact he was mistaken oh it was very idyllic there in strelhow and i was idler than even royalty usually are but already i had a notion that the future that faced carl gustaf wasnt going to be all roses and wine it may seem rare to be a crowned head and no doubt if youre an absolute monarch with unlimited power its right enoughbut a prince consort which is more or less what i was isnt quite the same thing he cant trim the heads off those he dont like or order up any goodlooking skirt who takes his fancy hes always one step behind his adoring spouse and even if she dotes on himand who knows how long that will lasthe still has to get his own way if he wants it through her good leave even in those blissful early days with irma i could see how it would be and i didnt much like it god knows how our late lamented albert stuck it out poor devil if id been him six months would have seen me on the boat back to saxecoburg or wherever it was but perhaps he didnt mind playing second fiddlehe wasnt english however i consoled myself that i was having the best of both worldsmy luxurious enslavement was both enjoyable and temporary now and then i fretted a little over what the outcome of the comedy would be but there was nothing to be done about it either bismarck would keep his bargain or he wouldntand i forced myself to put the latter possibility out of my mind this is the real cowards way of coursei wanted to believe he would play fair and so i did even though common sense should have warned me that he wouldnt and as so often happens i almost fell a prey to my own comfortable lilylivered hopes we had been about ten days at strelhow i suppose when one evening we were in the billiard room and e talk turned to horses someonerudi i thinkmentioned the fine stable kept by a gentleman over beyond the jotun gipfel i expressed interest and it was suggested that next day we should ride over and call on him it was all very easy and casual like any of the other expeditions and picnics we had enjoyed and i gave it no thought at all so next morning de gautet and one of the strackenzian aides and i set off the quickest way was through the jotun gipfel on horseback and irma came with us by carriage as far as the road allowed thereafter we turned off towards the crags she fluttering her handkerchief lovingly after her departing lord and presently we were climbing into the hills by one of the bridlepaths that are the only tracks through that wild and picturesque little region it was a splendid day for such a jaunt clear and sunny and the scenery was pleasantany of our victorian artists would have sketched it in a moment with its nice little crags and trees and occasional waterfalls and would have thrown in a couple of romantic shepherds with whiskers and fat calves for good measure but we saw no one as we moved up towards the summit and i was enjoying the ride and musing on last nights sporting with irma when the strackenzian aides horse went lame ive often wondered how they arranged that for the horse was certainly lame and i doubt if the aidehis name was steubel just a boyhad anything to do with it i cursed a bit and de gautet suggested we turn and go back the boy wouldnt hear of it he would walk his horse slowly down to strelhow he said and we should go on de gautet looked doubtfulhe was a clever actor that onebut i was fool enough to agree i cant think now how i was so green but there it was i never thought of foul playi who normally throw myself behind cover if someone breaks wind unexpectedly was completely off guard i had my pistols to be sure and even my knife for id got into the wise habit of going armed whenever i left the lodge but de gautets manner must have disarmed me completely we went on together and about twenty minutes after parting from steubel we had reached the summit a pleasant little treefringed plateau split by a deep gorge through which a river rushed throwing up clouds of mist against the rocky sides the whole tabletop hemmed in by trees but there was a clear patch of turf near the edge of the gorge and here we dismounted to have a look down into the bottom a hundred feet below i dont care for heights but the scene was so pleasant and peaceful that i never felt a moments unease until de gautet spoke the jotunschlucht says he meaning the gorge and something in his voice sounded the alarm in my brain it may have been the flatness of his tone or the fact that he was closer behind me than i felt he should have been but with the instinct of pure panic i threw myself sideways on the turf turning as i fell to try to face him if his pistol hadnt misfired he would have got me i heard the click even as i moved and realised that he had been aiming pointblank at my back as i tried to scramble up he dropped it with an oath drew its mate from beneath his tunic and levelled it at me i screamed no no as he thumbed back the lock and he hesitated a split second to see if i should leap again and to make sure of his aim in a novel of course or a play murders are not committed so the villain leers and gloats and the victim pleads in my practical experience however killing gentlemen like de gautet are far too practised for such nonsense they shoot suddenly and cleanly and the jobs done i knew i had perhaps a heartbeat between me and damnation and in sheer terror i snatched the seamans knife from the top of my boot and hurled it at him with all my force sprawling down again as i did so if ive had more than my share of bad luck in my life ive had some good to make up for it i had some now the knife only hit him butt first on the leg but it caused him to take a quick step back his heel caught on a stone or tuft he overbalanced the pistol cracked the ball went somewhere above my head and then i was on top of him smashing blindly with my fists knees and anything else trying to beat him into the ground he was tall and active but nothing like my weight and flashy in the grip of mortal fear with nowhere to run to and no choice but to fight is probably a dreadful opponent i was roaring at the top of my voice and clawing at him for dear life he managed to shove me off once but he made the error of lunging for the fallen knife and i was able to get one solid fullblown boot against the side of his head he groaned and fell back his eyes rolling up in his head and collapsed limply on the turf for a moment i thought id killed him but i didnt wait about to see the training of years asserted itself and i turned and bolted headlong down the path with no thought but to put as much distance as i could between me and the scene of possible danger before id gone far i had to stop to be sickno doubt from the shock of my narrow escapeand during the pause i had time to consider what i was doing where could i run to not back to strelhow for certain the bismarck gang had shown their hand now and my life wouldnt be worth a china orange if i went anywhere they could come at me and why had they tried to kill me now what purpose was there in having me dead before the real carl gustaf was ready to take my place maybe he was ready although if hed been rotten with pox they had tidied him up mighty quick or had bismarcks whole tale been pure moonshine maybe carl gustaf was dead maybeoh maybe a thousand things i had no way of knowing as i think ive said before while fear usually takes control of my limbs particularly my running equipment it seldom prevents me from thinking clearly even as i stood there spewing i knew what had to be done it was essential that i make tracks out of strackenz at once but reason told me that to do that in safety i must have a clear notion of what my enemies were up to and the only man who could tell me that was de gautet if he was still alive the longer i hesitated the longer he had to revive my pistols were in my saddle holsters at the summit so back up the track i went at full speed pausing only near the top to have a stealthy skulk and see how the land lay the horses had gone scared no doubt by the pistol shot but de gautet was still where i had left him was he shamming it would have been like the foxy bastard so i lay low and watched him he didnt stir so i tossed a stone at him it hit him but he didnt move reassured i broke cover snatched up the knife and crouched panting beside him he was dead to the world but breathing with a fine red lump on his skull in a moment i had his belt off and trussed his elbows with it then i pulled off his boots secured his ankles with my own belt and felt comfortably safer several excellent ideas were already forming in my mind about how to deal with master de gautet when he came to and i waited with a pleasant sense of anticipation he had a hole in one sock i noticed there would be holes in more than that before id finished with the murderous swine presently he groaned and opened his eyes and i had the pleasure of watching his expression show bewilderment rage and fear all in turn well de gautet says i what have you got to say you backshooting rat you he stayed mum glaring at me so i tickled him up with the knife and he gasped and cursed thats it says i get some practice and see here im not going to waste time with you im going to ask questions and youll answer em smartly dyou see because if you dont well ill show you the advantages of an english public school education thats all now first why did you try to kill me what are you and our good friend otto bismarck up to he struggled but saw it was no go and lay still you will learn nothing from me says he your error says i see here by good luck i had a piece of string with me which i looped over two of his toes placing a nice sharp pebble in between them i put a stick through the loop and twisted it a little it always used to liven the rugby fags up although of course one couldnt go too far with them and de gautets response was gratifying he squealed and writhed but i held his legs down easily you see my boy says i youd better open your potato trap or itll be the worse for you you villain cries he sweating with fear is this how you treat a gentleman no says i enjoying myself its how i treat a dirty cowardly murdering ruffian and i twisted the stick hard he screamed but i kept on twisting and his yells were such that i had to stuff my glove in his mouth to quiet him id no real fear of interruption for he had been at such pains to get me alone that i doubted if any of his precious friends were in the district but it seemed best to keep him as mum as possible nod your head when youve had enough de gautet says i cheerfully when ive broken all your toes ill show you how the afghan ladies treat their husbands prisoners and i went back to work on him i confess that i thoroughly enjoyed it as only a true coward can for only your coward and bully really understand how terrible pain can be de gautet wasnt much braver than i am a few more twists and he was jerking his head up and down like punch and for some reason this put me into a great fury i gave him a few more twists for luck until the string broke then i pulled the gag out he was groaning and calling me filthy names so i taught him manners with the point of the knife in his leg now you bastard why did you try to kill me it was the barons order ah dear god never mind god what for what about my ten thousand pounds damn you it it was never intended that you would be paid you mean i was to be murdered from the start is that it he rolled over moaning and licking his lips looking at me with terror in his eyes if i tell you all oh my feet if i tell you do you swear on your honour as a gentleman to let me go why should i youll tell me anyway oh all right then on my honour as a gentleman now then but he insisted that i swear on my mothers memory too what he thought all that swearing was worth i cant imagine but he wasnt feeling himself i dare say and foreigners tend to take an englishmans word when he gives it thats all they know so i swore his oaths and it all came tumbling out the prince carl gustaf hadnt had pox at all he was clean as an old bone but bismarck had plotted with detchard to spirit him away and put me in his placeas they had indeed done the pox story had simply been an excuse for my benefit and if it seems ludicrously thin now i can only assert that it seemed damned convincing coming from bismanck in his lonely stronghold with kraftstein waiting to fillet me if i didnt believe it anyway their little plan was that after a few days when strackenz was convinced it had got a genuine consort for its duchess i was to be murdered in the jotun gipfel and de gautet was to vanish over the german border there would be a hue and cry and my body would be found and carried back to strackenz amid general consternation and then wonder of wonders papers would be found in my clothing to suggest that i wasnt prince carl at all but a daring english impostor called flashman an agent of lord palmerston if you please and up to godknowswhat mischief against the security and wellbeing of the duchy of strackenz there would be chaos and confusion and a diplomatic upheaval of unprecedented proportions i couldnt take it in at first you bloody liar dye expect me to believe this cockandbull for that matter who in the world would credit it everyone his face was working with pain you are not the princeyou would be identified for what you really areeven if it took time witnesses who knew you could be brought who would doubt itit is true my brain was reeling but in gods name what for what could bismarck gain from all this the discredit of englandyour lord palmerston utter bewilderment and rage in strackenz dane and german are on a knifeedge herethere would be bloodshed and disorder that is what the baron wantsah herr gott my feet are on fire damn your feet why the hell does he want bloodshed and disorder as apretext you know that strackenz and schleswig and holstein are bitterly divided between dane and german disorder in one would spread to the othersthe old rivalry between berlin and copenhagen would be fanned into flamefor the sake of german interest berlin would march into strackenz then into the other two who could stop her it is only theexcusethat is lacking and how would my murder be explained in gods name it would not needexplaining that you were an english agentthat would be enough well that seemed the silliest bit of all to me and i said so who was going to buy me as an agent feel the lining of your tunicon the right side for all his pain he couldnt keep a grin of triumph off his face it is therefeel by god it was i ripped out the lining with my knife and there was a paper covered in tiny cryptogramsgod knows what they meant but knowing bismarck ill wager it was good sound incriminating stuff i sat gazing at it trying to understand what de gautet had been telling me it has all been exactly planned says he it could not fail confusion and riot must follow on your deathand germany would seize the opportunity to march i was trying vainly to make sense of the whole incredible schemeand to find a flaw in it aha hold on says i this is all very finebut just because bismarck has fine ideas about marching into strackenz dont mean a thing theres a government in berlin i believesuppose they dont share his martial ardourwhat then but it is planned i tell you cries he he has friendsmen of powerin high places it is concertedand when the chance comes in strackenz they will act as he says he can force the thinghe has the visiondas genie aye perhaps he had the genius now of course i know that he could have done iti doubt if there was any diplomatic coup that that brilliant warped intelligence couldnt have brought off for all that he was the most dreadful bastard who ever sat in a chancellery he was the greatest statesman of our time yes he could have done ithe did didnt he in the end and where is strackenz now like schleswig and holstein it is buried in the german empire that otto bismarck built it was just my bad luck that i had been castthrough the sheer chance of an uncanny resemblanceto be the first foundationstone of his great dream this was to be his initial step to power the opening move in his great game to unify germany and make it first of the worlds states squatting there on the damp turf of the jotun gipfel i saw that the crazy scheme in which he had involved me had a flawless logic of its ownall he needed was something to strike a spark in strackenz and i was the tinder thereafter with him gently guiding from the wings the tragic farce could run its course de gautet groaned and brought me back to earth he was lying there this foul brute who would have put a bullet in my backaye and had already planted his sabre cuts in my skull in a rage i kicked himthis was the pass that he and his damned friends had brought me to i shouted stranded in the middle of their blasted country incriminated helpless certain to be either murdered by bismarcks crew or hanged by the authorities he roared and pleaded with me to stop aye you can howl now say i you were ready enough an hour ago to show me no mercy curse you a thought struck me i dont suppose you showed any to that poor danish sod either wheres carl gustaf then lying somewhere with his throat cut and a letter in his pocket saying a present from flashy and lord palmerston no nohe is alivei swear it he is being keptsafe what for what use is he to bloody bismarck he was not to benothing was to befall himuntil until until id had my weasand slit thats it isnt it you dirty dogs you where is he then if hes still alive at first he wouldnt say but when i flourished the knife at him he changed his mind in jotunbergthe old castle of the duke yonder over the cragsin the jotunsee i swear it is true he is under guard therehe knows nothing the baron leaves nothing to chanceif aught had gone wrong he might have been neededalive you callous hound and otherwisehe would have got a bullet too eh i had to give him some more toeleather before he would answer but when he did it was in some detail to ensure that no mischance should lead to his being rescued carl gustaf was in a dungeon in the castle with a handy shaft in its floor that came out somewhere under the jotunsee his body would never be found once they popped him down therewhich they would certainly do once they heard that my corpse had been delivered back to strackenz and the uproar over my identity was going nicely well it looked bad for carl gustaf in any eventnot that it was any concern of mine but it helped to fan my righteous indignation which was powerful enough on my own behalf i can tell you de gautet says i youre a foul creatureyou dont deserve to live another minute you swore he babbled struggling in his bonds you gave me your solemn promise so i did says i to let you go wasnt it well i will come along lets have you up i dragged him to his feet and took my belt from round his ankles he could hardly stand with the pain of his toes and i had to support him now de gautet says i im going to let you gobut where eh thats the point aint it what do you mean his eyes were staring with fear you promised so did bismarckso did you youre a dirty creature de gautet i think you need a wash i propelled him to the edge of the precipice and held him for a second ill let you go all right you murderous curdown there he let out a shriek you could have heard in munich and tried to wrench free but i held him fast and let him look just to let him know he was really going to die then i said gehen sie weg de gautet and gave him a push for an instant he tottered on the brink trying to keep his balance and screaming hoarsely then he fell out and down and i watched him turn slowly over in the air crash onto the jutting rocks halfway down the cliff and spin outwards like a rag doll with his legs waving before he vanished into the spray at the precipice foot it was an interesting sight id killed before of course although never in what you might call cold blood but ive never felt anything but satisfaction over the end of de gautet he deserved to die if anyone ever did he was a heartless cruel rascal and id have been lucky to come off as easily if things had been the other way round im not justifying myself either for torturing him or killing him for i dont need to both had to be donebut im honest enough to admit i enjoyed doing them he was a good horseman though however his death though firstrate in its way solved nothing so far as my immediate comfort and safety were concerned i was still in the very devil of a pickle i realised as i gazed round the empty clearing and tried to decide what to do next it was certain that de gautet had arranged some means of getting word quickly to rudi and co to say that flashy was a goner and all was well how long would it be before they realised something had gone wrong an hour or two a day i must assume it would be sooner rather than laterand then the hunt would be up with a vengeance with me as the poor little fox i had to get out of strackenz at oncebut where to these thoughts put me into a blue funk of course and i paced up and down that summit muttering where where oh jesus how can i get out of this then i steadied up telling myself that when youve been hounded by afghans and come safe home you need hardly take the vapours over a pack of germans which is just rubbish of course as i assured myself a second later ones as beastly dangerous as the other still this was a comparatively civilised country i spoke the language tolerably and id had enough experience of skulking surely to get me out of it i hadnt a horse and only a knife for protectionde gautets empty pistols were uselessbut the first thing was to get down from the jotun gipfel and plot my course as i went before starting out i burned the incriminating papers they had sewn in my tunic then i took to the woods at right angles from the path we had been following scrambling down over mossy rocks and through thick brushwood it wasnt easy going but i was too busy with my thoughts to notice much one point stuck clear in my mind and it was the advice given by the late lamented sergeant hudson when he and i were on the run from the afridis on the jallalabad road when the bastards are after you go in the direction where theyll never think o looking for youeven it its right back in their faces well i wasnt going to strelhow that was flat but if i was bismarck or rudi where would i expect flashy to run north for certain towards the coast less than a hundred miles away so that was out of court of the other directions which was the least likely for a fugitive all were hazardous since they would take me long journeys through germany but south seemed the most dangerous of all by god the last place they would expect me to make for was munich at the far end of the country where all the bother had begun my legs trembled at the thought but the more i considered it the better it seemed theyd never believe id risk it so they wouldnt look thereaway it was horribly chancy but i was certain that if hudson had been with me that was the way hed have pointed let me get a horseno matter howand i could be over the strackenz border by nightfall and galloping south id have to beg hire borrow or steal changes on the waywell it wouldnt be the first time i might even use the railway if it seemed safe to do so at any rate i was free for the moment and if they could catch old flashy with the wind up himwell they were smarter fellows than i thought they were i hurried on down the hillside and found myself after half an hour or so on more level land where the trees thinned out there was a wisp of smoke coming from behind a copse and i stole forward cautiously to have a looksee there was a little farmbuilding with great trees behind it but no one about except a few cows in the field to one side and an old dog drowsing in the yard it didnt look like the kind of place where the new ducal consort of strackenz would be known which suited methe fewer folk who got a glimpse of me the less chance bismarcks bullies had of getting on my track i was wondering whether to go forward boldly or scout round for a horse to pinch when the farm door opened and an old man in gaiters and a sugarloaf hat came out he was a peasant with a face like a walnut and when he saw me he brought up short and stood glowering at me the way country folk do at everyone who hasnt got dung on his boots i gave him a civil good day and told him my horse had thrown me while i was riding in the jotun gipfel could he oblige me with a remount for which i would pay generously and i showed him a handful of crowns he mumbled a bit watching me with the wary hostile eyes of the old and then said that his daughter was in the house she turned out to be a big strapping creature plain enough in the face but just about my weight so i gave her my best bow and repeated my request with a charming smile the long and short of it was that they sat me down in the kitchen with some excellent beer and bread and cheese while the old man went off round the house and presently came back to say that franz had gone to find willi who would be able to borrow wolfs horse no doubt and if the gentleman would be pleased to rest and eat it would be along in a little while i was happy enough with this for neither of them seemed to have any notion of who i wasor rather who i was supposed to beand it gave me the chance to get something under my belt they were both a little in awe though at having such a fine gentleman in their humble home and seemed too tonguetied to say much if the dotard hadnt been there i dare say i could have had the buxom piece dancing the mattress quadrille within the hour but as it was i had to confine my refreshment to the victuals and beer after an hour had passed though i began to get restless id no wish to linger here with rudi possibly combing the jotun gipfel for me already and when a second hour passed and then a third i became feverish the old clod kept assuring me in answer to my impatient demands that wolf or franz or willi would soon be along with the horse an excellent horse he added and there seemed to be nothing to do but wait chewing my nails while the old man sat silent and the woman went very softfooted about her work it was four hours before they came and they didnt have a horse what they did have though was weapons there were four of them hefty lads in peasant clothes but with a purposeful look about them that suggested they didnt give all their time to ploughing two had muskets another had a pistol in his belt and the leader who was a blond giant at least a head taller than i had a broadsword no less hanging at his side i was on my feet quaking at the sight of them but the big fellow held up a hand and made me a jerky bow highness says he and the others bobbed their heads behind him my bald head was evidently better known than id realised uneasily i tried to put on a bold front well my lads says i cheerfully have you a horse for me no highness says the big one but if you will please to come with us my master will attend to all your needs i didnt like the sound of this somehow who is your master then if you please highness i am to ask you only to come with us please highness he was civil enough but i didnt like it i want a horse my good fellow not to see your master you know who i am it seems well bring me a horse directly please highness he repeated stolidly you will come with us my master commands at this i became very princely and peremptory but it didnt do a straws worth of good he just stood there insisting and my bowels went more chilly every moment i hectored and stormed and threatened but in the end there was nothing for it i went with them leaving the farm couple roundeyed behind us to my consternation they led me straight back towards the jotun gipfel but although i protested they held their course the big fellow turning every now and then to mutter apologies while his pals kept their muskets handy and their eyes carefully on me i was beside myself with fright and anger who the devil were they i demanded and where was i being taken but not a word of sense was to be had from them and the only consolation i could take was a vague feeling that whoever they were they werent ruths creatures and didnt seem to mean me any harm as yet how far we tramped i dont know but it must have taken fully two hours i wouldnt have believed the jotun gipfel was so extensive or so dense but we seemed to be moving into deeper forest all the time along the foot of the crags the sun was westering so far as i could judge when i saw people ahead and then we were in a little clearing with perhaps a dozen fellows waiting for us stalwart peasants like my four guards and all of them armed there was a little cabin halfhidden among the bushes at the foot of a small cliff that ran up into the overhanging forest and before the cabin stood two men one was a tall slender seriouslooking chap dressed like a quality lawyer and grotesquely out of place here the other was burly and short in a corduroy suit and leggings the picture of a country squire or retired military man he had grizzled closecropped hair a bulldog face and a black patch over one eye he was smoking a pipe they stood staring at me and then the tall one turned and said urgently to his companion he is wrong i am sure he is wrong the other knocked out his pipe on his hand perhaps says he perhaps not he took a step towards me may i ask you sir what is your name there was only one answer to that i took a deep breath looked down my nose and said i think you know it very well i am prince carl gustaf and i think i may be entitled to ask gentlemen who you may be and what is the explanation of this outrage for a man with his heart in his mouth i think i played it well at any rate the tall one said excitedly you see it could not be otherwise highness may i save your apologies doctor says the short one they may be in order or they may not to me he went on sir we find ourselves in a quandary i hear you say who you are well my name is sapten and this is dr per grundvig of strackenz now may i ask what brings you to jotun gipfel with your coat muddied and your breeches torn you ask a good deal sir says i hotly must i remind you who i am and that your questions are an impertinence i shall aye it sounds like the real thing says sapten smiling a grim little smile well well see he turned his head hansen step this way if you please and out of the hut before my horrified gaze stepped the young man who had greeted me at the wedding receptionerik hansen carl gustafs boyhood friend i felt my senses start to swim with sick terror he had sensed something wrong thenhe couldnt fail to unmask me now i watched him through a haze as he walked steadily up to me and gazed intently at my face prince carl he said at last carl is it you is it really you i forced myself to try to smile erik god what a croak it was why erik what brings you here he stepped back his face white his hands trembling he looked from sapten to the doctor shaking his head gentlemen i dont know its he and yet i dont know try him in danish says sapten his single grey eye fixed on me i knew then i was done for bersonins efforts had been insufficient to give me more than the crudest grasp of one of the hardest tongues in europe it must have shown in my face as erik turned back to me for the damned old villain sapten added ask him something difficult erik thought a moment and then with an almost pleading look in his eyes spoke in the soft slipshod mutter that had baffled my ear at schцnhausen i caught the words hvor boede and hardly anything else christ he wanted to know where somebody lived god knows who desperately i said jeg forstar ikke to show that i didnt understand and it sounded so hellish flat i could have burst into tears slowly an ugly look came over his fair young face ny he said slowly de forstar my ikke he turned to them and said in a voice that shook he may be the devil himself it is the princes face and body but it is not carl gustaf my life on it there wasnt a sound in the clearing except for my own croaking breaths then sapten put his pipe in his pocket so says he right my lad into that hut with you and if you make a wrong move youre with your maker jacob he shouted sling a noose over the branch yonder cowards as shakespeare has wisely observed die many times before their deaths but not many of them can have expired in spirit more often than i and ive seldom had better reason than when sapten threw that order to his followers there was an air of grim purpose about the man that told you he would do exactly what he promised and that offhand instruction was more terrible than any mere threat could have been i stumbled into the hut and collapsed on a bench and the three followed me and closed the door now says sapten folding his arms who are you there was no question of brazening it out any more than there was hope of making a run for it my only chance lay in talking my way out of the noosenot that the three grim faces offered any encouragement but anyway here goes thought i reminding myself that theres no lie ever invented thats as convincing as halftruth gentlemen i began believe me i can explain this whole fearful business youre quite right i am not prince carl gustaf but i most solemnly assure you that these past few days i have had no choice but to pretend that i was that man no choiceand i believe when you have heard me out you will agree that the true victim of this abominable hoax is my unhappy self like enough says sapten since youll certainly hang for it no no i protested you must hear me out i can prove what i say i was forced to itdreadfully forced but you must believe me innocent where is the prince burst out hansen tell us that you liar i ignored this for a good reason my name is arnoldcaptain thomas arnold im a british army officerand my idiot tongue nearly added of no fixed abode and i have been kidnapped and tricked into this by enemies of strackenz that threw them into a talking both grundvig and hansen started volleying questions at me but sapten cut them off british army eh says he how many regiments of foot guards have you quick now why three humph says he go on well says i its an incredible tale you wont believe it probably not says sapten whom i was liking less and less get to the point so i told it them from the beginning sticking as close as i could to the truth my brain was working desperately as i talked for the tale wouldnt do entirely as it stood i left lola montez out of it and invented a wife and child for myself who had accompanied me to germanyi was going to need them i described my abduction in munich without reference to baroness pechman and related the schцnhausen episode exactly as it had happened otto bismarck eh says sapten ive heard of him and young starnbergaye we know of that one this is unbelievable exclaims grundvig the man is plainly lying in everything he says why who could easy doctor says sapten unbelievableyes he pointed at me hes unbelievable toobut hes sitting here in front of us he nodded to me continue thank god there was at least one cool head among them i went on relating how i came to strackenz how i had gone through the farce in the cathedral how de gautet had tried to murder me and how i had killed him in fair fight at the top of the jotun gipfel that morning saptens icy eye never left my face but grundvig kept giving exclamations of incredulity and horror and finally hansen could contain himself no longer why did you do it my god you villain why have you no shame no honour how could you live and commit such a monstrous crime i looked him full in the face like a man struggling with tremendous emotion why sir says i you ask why do you suppose i would have consented to this infamyhave played this awful masqueradeunless they had compelled me with a weapon that no man however honourable could resist i gave a mighty gulp they held my wife and child sir do you realise what that means i shouted the question at him and decided that this was the time to break down my god my god i exclaimed my precious jewels my little goldenheaded amelia shall i ever see thee again it would have had them thumping on the seatbacks in any theatre in london ill swear but when i raised my head from my hands there was no sign of frantic applause from this audience hansen looked bewildered and grundvigs long face was working with rage sapten was filling his pipe and prince carl gustafwheres he he asked i had thought at the beginning that eventually i might bargain with themmy life for the informationbut now instinct told me that it wouldnt answer sapten would have hanged me on the spot im sureanyway it wouldnt have suited the character i was trying desperately to establish in that i saw lay my only hopeto make them believe that i had been a helpless victim of a dastardly plot and god help me wasnt it true so i told them about jotunberg and the plans for disposing of carl gustaf grundvig clasped his temples hansen exclaimed in horror sapten lit his pipe and puffed in silence aye says he and then what this fellow tried to murder youyou killed him you say what did you propose to do next whywhyi hardly knew i was distraughtmy wife and childthe fate of the princei was halfmad with anxiety to be sure says he and puffed some more and this was all played out you tell us so that this otto bismarck could start to build a german empire well well youve heard what ive told you sir says i i warned you it was incredible but its trueevery word of it grundvig who had been pacing up and down spun on his heel i for one cannot believe it it is impossible major erik would anyone but a madman credit such a story it is not to be imagined he glared at me this manthis scoundrelcan you believe anyone as infamous as he has confessed himself to be not i for one says hansen sapten scratched his grizzled head just so says he and my heart sank but i suggest doctor and you too erik that theres a question to be asked can either of you and his bright eye went from one to the other looking at this fellow here a man who we know has successfully imposed himself for two weeks on a whole nationcan either of you in the face of the fact suggest a better story than hes told us they stared at him he nodded at me there he is account for him he knocked out his pipe if he has liedthen whats the true explanation they babbled a good deal at this but of course there was no answering him my story was enough to defy imagination sapten agreedbut any alternative must be equally incredible if we can accept that a doppelganger of the princes can take his place for two weeksand we know that has happenedthen i for one can accept anything says he you mean you believe him cries grundvig for want of evidence to disprove his storyyes my heart fluttered up like a maidens prayer you see says sapten grimly it fits havent we been starting at every german shadow this twenty years back you know that grundvig isnt fear for the security of our duchy the reason were here what are we sons of the volsungs for he shook his head show me a hole in this fellows tale for i cant see one at this they went into a frantic discussion which of course got them nowhere baffled they turned back on me what are we to do with him says grundvig hang him snaps hansen the swine deserves it for the crime he has committed against our duchess says grundvig glowering at me he deserves no less they were all looking like scotch elders in a brothel but i saw that here was my cue again i looked bewildered and then let outraged indignation take its place what do you mean by that i cried you were married to her for more than a week says sapten significantly i made hoarse noises of fury you infamous old man i shouted dyou dare to suggest my god sir have you forgotten that i am a british officer have you the effrontery to imply that i would i choked as with great rage but i doubt if sapten was much impressed the other two looked doubtful though i am not so dead to honour says i trying to look noble and angry together that i would stoop to carry my imposture as far as that there are some things that no gentleman and i broke off as though it was too much for me it must have been thought strange mutters grundvig palpitating i maintained a stiff silence they were quiet for a moment contemplating their duchesss virginity i suppose then grundvig said do you swear that that my word of honour says i as a british officer oh well that settles it says sapten and ill swear his mouth twitched under his moustache and at the risk of seeming disloyal gentlemen id suggest that the fate of prince carl gustaf is perhaps as important as what may or maynt have happened to well let it be he swung round on me youll stay here if you move outside this hut youre a dead manwhich you may be anyway before were done i suggest we continue our deliberations elsewhere doctor if what we have learned today is true we havent much time to prevent our duchess becoming a widow before shes been a bride to say nothing of saving her duchy for her come the door slammed behind them and i was left alone with my thoughts not pleasant ones but they could have been worse they seemed to have accepted my story and i was pretty sure that the fictitious parts of it would defy their efforts to pick holesthey werent important lies anyway but merely colour to enhance my character of innocentinthegripofcruelfate best of all i was reasonably sure they werent going to hang me sapten was the strong mind among them and while i read him as one who wouldnt think twice about taking human life if he had to there didnt seem any good reason why they should do away with me he was a realist and not swayed by emotion like grundvig and hansen but grundvig too i believed would stop short of murderhe seemed a decent sensitive sort of fool hansen was the one i offended most probably because he was the princes close friend he would have slaughtered me for old times sake so to speak but i fancied he would be outvoted so there i was with nothing to do but wait and think at least i was safe from bismarcks bravos which was something if these were the sons of the volsungsthe clandestine danish sympathisers whom rudi had spoken of with contempti couldnt be in better hands from that point of view rudi it seemed to me had underestimated them i had no idea what they could do about rescuing their precious prince from jotunberg and didnt care either but they looked a lively and workmanlike lot it was pleasant to think that they might put a spoke in bloody ottos little wheel after allsapten was just the man for that if i knew anything he was steady and saw quickly to the heart of things and seemed to be full of all the best virtues like resolution and courage and whatnot without being overhampered by scruple given him on the retreat from kabul our army would have got home safe enough and probably brought all the loot of the bala hissar into the bargain anyway i wasnt too displeased with my own situation and passed the time wondering when they would let me go god knows why i was so optimisticreaction possibly after having escaped unpleasant death twice in one daybut i ought to have known better if i had been thinking clearly id have realised that from their point of view the safest place for me was six feet under where i couldnt cause any scandal as it was what they got me into was very nearly as bad and caused me to die several more of shakespeares deaths i was left alone for several hours during which time the only soul i saw was the big peasant who brought me some food and beer it was night before my three inquisitors returned and i noticed that both sapten and hansen were splashed with mud about the legs as though theyd ridden hard sapten set down a lamp on the table threw aside his cloak and eyed me grimly captain arnold says he if that is your name you puzzle me i dont like being puzzled as these gentlemen here have pointed out no sane man would believe your story for a moment well maybe im not sane but ive decided to believe itmost of it anyway i dont know whether youre the biggest knave or the unluckiest wretch who ever drew breathi incline to the first view personally having a nice nose for knaveryno dont bother to protest weve heard all that but i cant be sure you see and it suits me to assume that youre honestup to a point so there i kept quiet fearful and hopeful together he produced his pipe and began to rub tobacco fortunately we can test you and serve our own ends at the same time he went on now then he fixed me with that cold eyeheres the point victim or scoundrel whichever you may be youve committed a monstrous wrong are you prepared to help to set it right with those three grim faces on me in the lamplight i was in no doubt about the right answer hereno doubt at all gentlemen says i god bless you whatever i can do and i couldnt think thank god that there was muchthat i shall do with all the power at my command i have been thinking as i sat here of the terrible aye we know sapten cut in you neednt tell us he lit his pipe puppuppup and blew smoke all we want is yes or no and i take it the answers yes with all my heart i cried earnestly i doubt it says sapten but never mind youre a soldier you say tell mehave you seen much service well i could answer truthfully to thati had seen plenty and i didnt see any need to tell him that id been sweating with panic all through it like a fool i implied that id been in some pretty sharp stuff and come out with some distinction the words were out before i realised that i might be talking myself into more trouble so says he well enoughyouve the look of a man of your hands we may have cause to be glad of that now then heres the position you tell us that prince carl gustaf is in jotunberg under guard of bismarcks men and that they can do away with him and leave no evidenceat the first sign of alarm theyll weight his body shove it down this hellhole of theirsand goodbye i noticed grundvig shudder so if we were to storm the place and it wouldnt be easyall that we would find would be a party of gentlemen who no doubt would have an innocent tale of being the guests of adolf bьlow the ownerhes tactfully out of the country by the way and wed have lost prince carl the jotunsee is deep and wed never even find his body hansen gave a little gasp and i saw there were absolute tears on his cheek so that wont do says sapten puffing away nowsuppose we leave jotunberg alone suppose we return you to streihow and wait and see what our german friends in the castle do then it would gain us time by god i didnt like this de gautet might have failed with me but some one else would surely succeedthe last place i wanted to be was anywhere on public view in strackenz they would hardly murder the prince says grundvig while you were on the consorts throne at least they have not done it yet it offers us time repeated sapten slowly but what could we do with it eh i tried to think of somethinganything perhaps if i were to abdicate i suggested hurriedly i mean if it would help waiting increases the risks though went on sapten as though i hadnt spoken of your discovery of the princes murder we cannot leave him there with those villains burst out hansen no so weve rejected that says sapten and we come back to the only coursea desperate and dangerous one for it may cost his life in the end but nothing else remains he paused and i felt my spine dissolve oh jesus here it was againwhenever i hear the words desperate and dangerous i know that im for it i could only wait to hear the worst to storm jotunberg is impossible says sapten it stands in the lake of the jotunsee and only at one point is it accessible from the shore where a causeway runs out towards it there were two guards on the causeway tonight at the outer end where the gap between causeway and castle is spanned by a drawbridge that bridge is raised which is a sign that those within know that their plans have gone astray doubtless when the man you killed this morning failed to return to his friends they took alarm two of them at any rate rode into the castle tonighthansen and i saw them a youngster a gay spark for all he looked little more than a boy and a big ruffian along with him starnberg and kraftstein says i major sapten they are a devilish pairtheyll stop at nothing well how many more were already in the castle we dont know probably no more than a handful but we could never hope to surprise them so we must find another way and quickly he sat back erik it is your scheme let him hear it one look at hansens facehis eyes were glittering like a fanaticsprepared me for the worst where a storming party must fail we may prevail by stealth two brave men could cross the jotunsee at night from the opposite bank by boat as close as they dared and then by swimming part of the fortress is in ruin they could land in the darkness enter the castle silently and discover where the prince is hidden then while one guarded him the other would hasten to the drawbridge and lower it so that our people hidden on the shore could storm across the causeway they could easily owerpower its garrisonbut somehow the princes life would have to be preserved while the fighting lasted whether this could be done he shrugged at least the two who had entered first could die trying and the very fact that they were telling me this informed me who one of those two was going to be of all the lunatic nohope schemes i ever heard this seemed to be the primest yet if they thought they were going to get me swimming into that place in the dark with the likes of rudi and kraftstein waiting for me they didnt know their man the mere thought was enough to set my guts rumbling with fright id see them damned first id sooner beswinging at the end of saptens rope that was what would happen of course if i refused while i was gulping down these happy thoughts grundvig whom id known from the first was a clever chapsensibly suggested that where two men could swim so could a dozen but hansen shook his fat head with determination no two may pass unobserved but not more it is out of the question he turned to look at me his face set his eyes expressionless i shall be one of the twocarl gustaf is my friend and if he is to die i shall count myself happy to die with him you do not know himyet without you he would not be where he is of all people you at least owe him a life will you come with me whatever i may be im not slowwitted if ever there was a situation made for frantic pleading in the name of common sense i was in it nowi could have suggested that they try to bargain with rudi or send a messenger to bismarck and tell him that they were on to his games i could have gone into a faint or told them that i couldnt swim or that i got hay fever if i went out after darki could simply have roared for mercy but i knew it wouldnt do they were deadly serious frightened men frightened for that danish idiot instead of for themselves as any sane man would have beenand if i hesitated or argued or did anything but accept at once they would rule me out immediately for a coward and a hypocrite and a backslider and then it would be the newgate hornpipe for flashy with the whole damned crew of sons of the volsungs hauling on the rope i knew all this in the few seconds that i sat there with my bowels melting and i heard a voice say in a deadly croak yes ill come hansen nodded slowly i do not pretend that i take you from choice i would sooner take the meanest peasant in our band but you are a soldier you are skilled in arms and in this kind of work you are a man of resource or you could never have done the infamous thing that has brought you here perhaps there is a queer fate at work in that at all events you are the man for this i could have discussed that with some eloquence but i knew better i said nothing and hansen said it will be for tomorrow night then and he and grundvig got up and went without another word sapten lingered putting on his cloak watching me at last he spoke it is one of the lessons a man learns as he grows old says he to put away desires and emotionsaye and even honourand to do what must be done with the tools to hand whatever they may be so i let you go with hansen tomorrow succeed in what is to do for as gods my witness if you dont ill kill you without pity he turned to the door perhaps i misjudge you i dont know in case i am guilty of that i promise that whatever befalls i shall not rest until i have ensured the safety of that wife and daughter who so concerned you earlier today but whom you seem to have forgotten tonight take comfort from the knowledge that little goldenhaired amelia is in my thoughts he opened the door goodnight englishman and he went out no doubt very pleased with himself i spent the next hour frantically trying to dig under the wall of the cabin with my bare hands but it was no go the earth was too hard and full of roots and stones i made a pitifully small scrape and then hurriedly filled it in again and stamped it down in case they saw what id been up to anyway even if i had succeeded in breaking out theyd have run me to earth in the forest they were trained woodsmen and id no idea where i was once my initial panic had passed i could only sit in miserable contemplation there was a slim chance that before tomorrow evening something might happen to change hansens lunatic planor i might receive a heavensent opportunity to escape although i doubted that failing these things i should certainly be launchedliterally toointo the most dangerous adventure of my life and with precious little prospect of coming through it so i would end here in a godforsaken miserable german ruin trying to rescue a man id never meti who wouldnt stir a finger to rescue my own grandmother it was all too much and i had a good selfpitying blubber to myself and then i cursed and prayed a bit invoking the god in whom i believe only in moments of real despair to intervene on my behalf i tried to console myself that id come out of desperate straits beforeaye but wasnt my luck about due to run out then no no jesus would see the repentant sinner right and i would never swear or fornicate or steal or lie againi strove to remember the seven deadly sins to make sure i missed none of them and then cudgelled my brains for the ten commandments so that i could promise never to break them againalthough mind you id never set up a graven image in my life i should have felt purified and at peace after all this but i found i was just as terrified as ever so i ended by damning the whole system i knew it would make no difference anyway that next day was interminable my heart was in my mouth every time footsteps approached the cabin door and it was almost a relief when sapten and his two companions came for me in the evening they brought a good deal of gear with them explaining that we should make all our preparations here before setting out and just the activity of getting ready took my mind momentarily off the horrors ahead first hansen and i stripped right down so that we could be rubbed all over with grease as a protection against the cold when we took to the water sapten whistled softly when he saw my scarsthe place where a pistol ball had burrowed from my side towards my spine the whipmarks left by the swine gul shah and the white weal on my thigh where my leg was broken at pipers fort it was an impressive collectionand even if most of them were in the rear they werent the kind of decorations you normally see on a coward youve been lucky says he so far when we had been thoroughly greased we put on rough woollen underclothesa most disgusting processand then heavy woollen shirts and smocks tucked into our breeches we wore stockings and light shoes and sapten bound bandages round our wrists and ankles to keep our clothing gathered in place now then says he to arms and produced a couple of heavy broadswords and an assortment of hunting knives if you want firearms youll have to persuade our friends in jotunberg to give you some he added useless to try to take them with you hansen took a sword and a long dagger but i shook my head havent you a sabre sapten looked doubtful but a search among his band of brigands outside produced the required articleit was old but a good piece of steel and i shuddered inwardly at the sight of it but i took it if i have to fight god forbid ill do it with a weapon i understand and if i was no angelo with a sabre at least id been trained in its use for the rest they gave me back my seamans knife and each of us was provided with a flask of spirits we carried the swords on our backs looped securely at shoulder and waist and hansen bound a length of cord round his middle there was some debate as to whether we should take flint and steel but there seemed no point to it finally we each had an oilskin packet containing some meat and bread and cheese in case as sapten cheerfully remarked we had time to stop for a snack you may feel the need of something when you get out of the water he added eat and drink if chance serves now then mr thomas arnold attend to me from here we ride to the jotunsee which will take us the best part of three hours there the boat is waiting with two stout men at the oars they will take you as close to the castle as seems advisablethere is a moon but we cant help that the clouds are thick so you should get close in unobserved then you swim for itand remember they will be watching and listening in yonder he let me digest this his head cocked and his hands thrust deep in his pocketsstrange how these pictures stay with oneand then went on once inside the castle hansen is in command you understand he will decide how to proceedwho is to guard the prince who to lower the bridge so far as we know it is wound up and down by a windlass knock out the pin and the bridge will fall that will be our signal to storm the causewayfifty men led by myself and grundvig here he paused pulling out his pouch it is not our intention to leave any survivors of the garrison they must all die says grundvig solemnly to the last man says hansen it seemed to call for something from me so i said hear hear serve us well in this added sapten and the past will be forgotten try to play us false he left it unspoken now is all clear it was clear right enough all too clear i did my best not to think of it i didnt want to know any more dreadful details indeeed the only question in my mind was a completely unimportant one and had nothing to do with what lay ahead but i was curious so i asked it tell me i said to hansen back in strackenz citywhat made you think i wasnt carl gustaf he stared at me in surprise you ask now very welli was not sure the likeness is amazing and yet there was something wrong then i knew in an instant what it was your scars are in the wrong placesthe left one is too low but there was more than that too i dont knowyou just were not carl gustaf thankee says i poor old bismarckwrong again how did you come by these scars asked sapten they cut them in my head with a schlager says i offhand and grundvig drew in his breath oh yes i added to hansen this is no kindergarten you are venturing into my lad these are very practical men as you may discover i was eager to take some of the bounce out of him thatll do growls sapten all ready then lassen sie uns gehen there were horses outside and men moving about us in the gloom we rode in silent cavalcade through the woods along a path that wound upwards into the jotun gipfel and then down through dense thickets of bush and bracken there was no chance of escape even if i had dared two men rode at my stirrups all the way we halted frequentlywhile scouts went ahead i supposeand i took the opportunity to sample the contents of my flask it held brandy about half a pint and it was empty by the time the journey was half done not that it made much odds except to warm me i could have drunk a gallon without showing it just then at last we halted and dismounted shadowy hands took my bridle and i was pushed forward through the bushes until i found myself on the banks of a tiny creek with water lapping at my feet hansen was beside me and there was much whispering in the dark i could see the vague outline of a boat and its rowers and then the moon came out from behind the clouds and through the tangled branches at the creeks mouth i saw the choppy grey water of the lake and rising out of it not three furlongs off the stark outline of jotunberg it was a sight to freeze your blood and make you think of monsters and vampires and bats squeaking in gloomy vaultsa gothic horror of dark battlements and towers with cloudwrack behind it silent and menacing in the moonlight my imagination peopled it with phantom shapes waiting at its windowsand they wouldnt have been any worse than rudi and kraftstein given another moment i believe i would have sunk down helpless on the shore but before i knew it i was in the boat with hansen beside me wait for the moon to die saptens hoarse whisper came out of the dark behind and presently the light was blotted out and jotunberg was only a more solid shadow in the dark but it was still there and all the more horrid in my minds eye i had to grip my chin to stop my teeth chattering sapten muttered again in the gloom the boat stirred as the dim forms of the towers moved and we were sliding out of the creek onto the face of the jotunsee the breeze nipped as we broke cover and then the bank had vanished behind us it was as black as the earl of hells weskit and deadly silent except for the chuckle of water under our bow and the soft rustle as the oarsmen heaved the boat rocked gently but we were moving quite quickly with the dim shape of the castle growing bigger and uglier every moment it seemed to me that we were rowing dangerously close to it i could see the faint glare of a light at one of the lower windows and then hansen softly said halt and the oarsmen stopped rowing hansen touched my shoulder ready i was trying to suppress the bile of panic that was welling up into my throat so i didnt answer folgen sie mir ganz nahe says he and then he had slipped over the side like an otter with hardly a sound for the life of me i couldnt bring myself to follow my limbs were like jelly i couldnt move but petrified though i was i knew i darent stay either let me refuse now and sapten would make cold meat of me very shortly afterwards i leaned over the side of the boat clumsily trying to copy hansen and then i had overbalanced and with an awful ponderous roll i came off the gunwale and plunged into the jotunsee the cold was hideous cutting into my body like a knife and i came up spluttering with the sheer pain of it as i gasped for breath hansens face came out of the darkness hissing at me to be quiet his hand searching for me underwater geben sie acht idiot stop splashing this is bloody madness i croaked at him christ its midwinter man well freeze to death he grabbed my shoulder while we trod water snarling at me to be quiet then turning from the boat he began to strike out slowly for the castle expecting me to follow for a second i considered the possibility even at this late hour of making for the shore and taking my chance in the woods but i realised i could never swim the distancenot at this temperature and with the sabre strapped to my back and my sodden clothes dragging at me i had to stay with hansen so i struck out after him as quietly as i could sobbing with fear and frustration god i remember thinking this is too bad what the hell had i done to deserve this left alone im a harmless enough fellow asking nothing but meat and drink and a whore or two and not offending anyone muchwhy must i be punished in this hellish fashion the cold seemed to be numbing my very guts i knew i couldnt go much longer and then a blinding pain shot through my left leg and i was under water my mouth filling as i tried to yell flailing with my good leg i came up bleating for hansen cramp i whimpered christ ill drown even then i had sense enough to keep my voice down but it was loud enough to reach him for next time i went under he hauled me up again swearing fiercely at me to be quiet and to stop thrashing about my leg my leg i moaned jesus im done for save me you selfish bastard oh god the cold my leg was one blinding pain but with hansen gripping me and holding my face above water i was able to rest until gradually it subsided to a dull ache i stretched it cautiously and it seemed to be working again when he was sure i could swim on he whispered that we must hurry or the cold would get us for certain i was almost past caring and told him so he and his bloody prince and sapten and the rest of them could rot in hell for me i said and he struck me across the face and threatened to drown me if i didnt keep quiet its your life too fool he hissed now be silent or were lost i called him the filthiest names i knew and then he swam on with me behind him striking out feebly enough but it wasnt far now another couple of freezing minutes and we were under the lee of the castle wall where it seemed to rise sheer out of the water and there wasnt a sight or sound to suggest we had been heard hansen trod water in front of me and when i came up with him he pointed ahead and i saw what seemed to be a shadowy opening at the foot of the wall there says he silence i cant take much more of this i whispered feebly ill freeze i tell youim dyingi know i am god damn you you scabbyheaded danish swine you wait for me he was swimming slowly into the gap in the wall and at that moment the moon chose to come out again striking its cold light on the rearing battlement above us and showing that the gap was in fact a tiny harbour cut out of the rock of the jotunberg itself to the left and ahead it was enclosed by the castle wall to the right the wall seemed to be ruined and there were dark areas of shadow where the moonlight didnt penetrate i felt a chill that was not from the water as i paddled slowly towards it exhausted and shocked as i was i could smell danger from the place when you burgle a house you dont go in by the open front door but hansen was already out of sight in the shadow i swam after him round an angle of the rock and saw him treading water with his hand up on the stone ledge that bordered the harbour when he saw me he turned face on to the stone put up his other hand and heaved himself out of the water for a second he hung there poised straining to pull his body onto the ledge the moonlight was full on him and suddenly something glittered flying above the water and smacked between his shoulder blades his head shot up and his body heaved convulsively for a second he hung motionless and then with a dreadful bubbling sigh he flopped face down on the stone and slid slowly back into the water as he slipped under i could distinctly see the knifehilt standing out of his back then he was floating halfsubmerged and i was scrabbling frantically away from him choking back the shriek of terror in my throat there was a low cheerful laugh out of the shadows above me and then someone whistled a line or two of marlbroug sen va ten guerre swim this way flashman prince of denmark said rudis voice i have you beaded and you wont float long if i put lead ballast into you come along theres a good chap you dont want to catch cold do you he watched me as i clambered miserably out shaking with fright and cold and stood hand on hip smiling easily at me this is a not entirely unexpected pleasure says he i had a feeling you would turn up somehow eccentric way you have of arriving though he nodded towards the water whos our dead friend i told him hansen eh well serve him right for a meddling fool i did him rather proud i thinktwentyfive feet an uncertain light and a rather clumsy huntingknifebut i put it right between his shoulders rather pretty work wouldnt you say but youre trembling man im cold i chattered not as cold as he is chuckled this hellish ruffian well come along ah but first the formalities he snapped his fingers and two men came out of the shadows behind him michael take the gentlemans sabre and that most unenglish knife in his belt excellent this way they took me through a ruined archway across a paved yard through a posternlike door in what seemed to be the main keep and into a vast vaulted hall with a great stone stairway winding round its wall to my left was a lofty arch through which i could see dimly the outline of massive chains and a great wheel i supposed this would be the drawbridge mechanismnot that it mattered now rudi humming merrily led the way upstairs and into a chamber off the first landing by contrast with the gloomy medieval stonework through which we had come it was pleasantly furnished in an untidy bachelor way with clothes papers dogwhips bottles and so on scattered everywhere there was a fire going and i made straight for it here says he pushing a glass of spirits into my hand michael will get you some dry clothes and while i choked over the drink and then stripped off my soaking weeds he lounged in an armchair so says he once i had pulled on the rough clothes they brought and we were alone de gautet bungled it eh i told them they should have let me do the businessif id been there you would never even have twitched tell me what happened possibly i was lightheaded with the brandy and the shock of what i had been through or my fear had reached that stage of desperation where nothing seems to matter anyway i told him how i had disposed of his colleague and he chuckled appreciatively you know i begin to like you better and better i knew from the first that wed get along splendidly and then what our dansker friends got hold of you didnt they seeing me hesitate he leaned forward in his chair come along now i know much more than you may think and can probably guess the rest and if you hold back or lie to mewell mr playactor youll find yourself going for a swim with friend hansen i promise you who sent you here it was the danish faction wasnt itsaptens precious bandits the sons of the volsungs i admitted i darent try to deceive himand what would have been the point sons of the volsungs sons of the nibelungs would be more appropriate and you and hansen were to try to rescue carl gustaf i wonder he mused how they found out about him no matter what did you expect to accomplish in heavens name two of you couldnt hope ah but wait a moment you were the mine under the walls werent you to open the way for the good major saptens patriotic horde he gave a ringing laugh dont look so surprised man dye think were blind in here weve been watching them scuttle about the shore all day why with a nightglass in the tower we watched your boat set out an hour ago of all the bungling illjudged badlymanaged affairs but what would one expect from that pack of yokels he roared with laughter again and how did they coerce you into this folly a knife at your back no doubt well well i wonder what theyll think of next now i was beginning to get some of my senses back what with the warmth and the rest of sitting down i was out of the fryingpan into the fire no question but i couldnt for the life of me see why he had killed hansen and taken me prisonerunless it was for information and when he had got all that he wanted what was he going to do with me i could guess yes what will they think of next he sauntered in front of the fireplace slim and elegant in his tightfitting black tunic and breeches and turned to flash his teeth at me suppose you tell me i dont know says i it was as youve guessed we were to try to release him and let down the bridge and if that failed they didnt say mm do they know our garrison they think only a few well guessedor well spied out not that itll help them if they try to storm the place their dear prince will be feeding the fishes in the jotunsee before theyre over the causewaydo they know that i wonder i nodded they know all about it he grinned happily well then we neednt fret about them need we it gives us time to consider how many men have they over yonder by the way and be very very careful how you answer i heard them say fifty wise flashman i knew you see suddenly he clapped me on the shoulder would you like to meet your royal twin ive been longing to bring the pair of you face to face you knowand you can see at the same time the excellent arrangements we have for his shall we say securityin the event of burglars come along he flung open the door oh and flashman he added carelessly smiling you will bear in mind that im not de gautet wont you youll do nothing foolish i mean you see it would be a great waste because i think i think we may be able to try out a little scheme of mine together you and i well see he bowed and waved me through after you your highness we went down to the great hall and there rudi turned into a sidepassage and down a steep flight of stone steps which spiralled into the depths of the castle there were oil lamps at intervals glistening on the nitre which crusted the bare stone and in places the steps were slippery with moss we came out into a flagged cloister with mighty squat columns supporting the low ceiling the place was in shadow but ahead of us light shone from an archway and passing through we were in a broad stone chamber where two men sat over cards at a rough table they looked up at our approach one with his hand on a pistol they were burly tall fellows in what looked like cavalry overalls and their sabres hung at their elbows but i wasnt concerned with them beyond them was a great iron grille stretching from floor to ceiling and before it stood kraftstein his huge hands on his hips like an ogre in the flickering lamplight here he is kraftstein says rudi lightly our old drinkingcompanion from schцnhausen arent you pleased now that i didnt let you shoot him in the water kraftsteins got no manners you know he added over his shoulder to me and how is our royal guest this evening kraftstein said nothing but having glowered at me he turned and drew a bolt in the grille rudi waved me through the gate as it groaned back on its hinges and with the hair prickling on my neck but spurred by curiosity i passed through the grille i saw cut off the end of the vault and we were in an enclosure perhaps forty feet deep and half as wide at the end opposite me a man lay on a low couch set against the wall there was a table with a lamp beside him and at the sound of the creaking hinge he sat up shading his eyes and peering towards us for some reason i felt a nervousness that had nothing to do with the danger of my situation i felt i was about to see something uncannyand this although i knew what it was going to be guten abend highness says ruth as we went forward heres a visitor for you the man took his hand from his face and i couldnt help letting out an exclamation for there i sat looking at memy own face puzzled wary and then in an instant blank with amazement the mouth open and eyes staring he shrank back and then suddenly he was on his feet what is this his voice was strained and hoarse who is this man as he moved there was a heavy clanking noise and with a thrill of horror i saw that there was a heavy chain on his left ankle fettering him to a great stone weight beside the bed may i have the honour to present an old acquaintance highness says rudi im sure you remember him from your mirror it was a weird experience looking at that face and hearing that voice when he spoke againperhaps a trifle deeper than my own i fancied and now that i looked at him he was a shade slimmer than i and less tall by a fraction but it was an amazing resemblance none the less what does it mean he demanded in gods name who are you until recently he was prince carl gustaf of denmark says rudi obviously enjoying himself but youd regard him as a most presumptive heir to the title im sure in fact hes an englishman your highness who has been kind enough to deputise for you during your holiday here he took it well ill say that for him after all id known for weeks that my spitten image was walking about somewhere but it was all new to him he stared at me for a long moment and i stared back tonguetied and then he said slowly youre trying to drive me mad why i dont know it is some filthy plot in gods name tell me if you have any spark of pity or decency what it means if it is money you want or ransom i have told yousay so if it is my lifewell damn you take it he tried to stride forward but the chain wrenched at his ankle and almost upset him damn you he roared again shaking his fist at us you vile cowardly villains let me loose i say and ill send that creature with my face straight to helland you too you grinning mountebank he was a fearsome sight wrestling at his chain and cursing like a smithfield porter rudi clicked his tongue royal rage says he gently your highness gently dont promise what you couldnt perform for a moment i thought carl gustaf would burst himself with rage his face was purple and then his temper subsided he strove to compose himself and he jerked back his lips in that gesture that i had spent so many weary hours trying to copy i forget myself i think he said breathing hard to what end who you are fellow i dont knowor what this means ill not entertain you by inquiring any further when you choose to tell meif you choose to tell mewell but understand and he dropped his voice in a way which i knew so well because i do it myself that you had better kill me and have done because if you do not by gods help ill take such a revenge on you all he left it there nodding at us and i had to admit that whatever our resemblance in looks he was as different from me in spirit as day from night you wouldnt have got me talking as big as that chained up in a dungeonwell ive been in that very situation and i blubbered for mercy till i was hoarse i know whats fitting but he didnt and much good his defiance was doing him oh never fear highness says rudi well certainly kill you when the time is ripe remember the royal progress we have prepared for you and he pointed off to the side of the great cell i looked and my heart gave a lurch at what i saw to that side the flags sloped down in a depression perhaps a dozen feet across and about four feet deep the sloping stones looked smooth and slippery and at the bottom of the shallow funnel which they formed there was a gaping hole circular and more than a yard wide carl gustafs face went pale as he too looked and his mouth twitched but he said nothing my skin crawled at the thought of what lay beyond the mouth of that shaft merry lads the old lords of jotunberg says rudi when they tired of you down you went suitably weightedas our royal guest is hereand hey splash its not a trip id care to take myselfbut your highness may not mind so much when i tell you that one of your friends is waiting for you in the jotunsee hansen his name was hansen erik hansen the princes hand shook what have you done to him you devil he went swimming at the wrong time of year says rudi cheerily so rashbut there young blood now your highness with your gracious permission well withdraw he made a mocking bow and waved me ahead of him towards the grille as we reached it carl gustaf suddenly shouted youyou with my face havent you a tongue in your head why dont you speak damn you i blundered out that hellish place was too much for me i could imagine all too clearly slithering down into that shaftugh and these murdering monsters would do it to me as soon as to him if it suited them young rudis laughter rang after me as i stumbled through the vault he strode up beside me clapping his hand round my shoulders and asking eagerly what i had thought of meeting my double face to facehad it made me wonder who i was had i noticed the amazement of carl gustaf and what did i suppose he was making of it all ill swear i hadnt realised how alike you were till i saw you together says he as we reached his room again its supernatural do you know it makes me wonder if otto bismarck didnt miss the true possibility of his scheme by god he stopped dead rubbing his chin then you remember a few moments ago i spoke of a plan that you and i might try together ill be frank it occurred to me the moment i saw you swimming in the lake and realised that i had both the court cards in my hand with no one but the worthy kraftstein to interfereand he doesnt count the two court cards he repeated grinning and one of them a knave have a drink playactor and listen youll have noticed that since my arrival in jotunberg i had said very littleand of course the situation was really beyond comment events in the past fortyeight hours had brought me to the point where intelligent thought let alone speech was wellnigh impossible the only conscious desire i felt was to get out of this nightmare as fast as possible by any means and yet the hectoring way in which this cocksure young upstart shoved me into a chair and commanded me to listen stirred a resentment beneath my miserable fear i was heartily sick of having people tell me to listen and ordering me about and manipulating me like a damned puppet much good it had done me to take it all meeklyit had been one horror after another and only by the luck of the devil was i still in one piece and here unless i mistook the look in starnbergs eye was going to be another brilliant proposal to put me through the mill open defiance wasnt to be thought of naturally but in that moment i felt that if i did manage to muster my craven spirits to do something on my own behalf it probably couldnt be any worse than whatever he had in mind for me look here says he how many of these damned danes know that you are really an impostor i could think of grundvig and sapten for certain their peasant followers i wasnt sure of but rudi brushed them aside as unimportant two who matter says he and on my sidebismarck bersonin and kraftsteinwe can forget detchard and that squirt of a doctor nowsuppose our captive prince goes down that excellent pipe tonight and we let down the bridge to encourage your friends to attack it would be possible to arrange a warm reception for themwarm enough to ensure that grundvig and sapten never got off that causeway alive anyhow kraftstein could easily meet with a fatal accident during the fightsomehow im sure he wouldand by the time the sons of the volsungs had fought their way in and cut up the survivors you and i could be on our way to the shore by boat then back to strackenz and the acclaim of everyone who has been wondering where their beloved prince has been oh we could invent some taleand who would there be to give you away detchard and the doctor darent your danish friends couldnt being dead and by this time bismarck and bersonin are far too busy ill be bound to worry about strackenz seeing my bewildered look he explained you havent heard the news of course berlin is alive with alarms it seems the revolutions coming my boy the student rabble and the rest will have the king of prussia off his throne in a week or two so dear otto has other fish to fry for the moment oh its not only in germany either i hear that france is up in arms and louisphillipes deposed they say its spreading like wildfire he laughed joyously dont you see man its a heavensent chance we could count on weeksnay months before anyone gave a thought to this cosy little duchyor to the identity of the duchesss consort and what use would that be to us god youre brainless to hold the reins of powerreal powerin a european state even a little one like strackenz if we couldnt squeeze some profit out of thatenough to set us up for lifebefore we took leave of em then we arent the men i think we are dyou know what the revenues of a duchy amount to youre mad i said raving mad dyou think id put my neck into that again why not whos to stop you we wouldnt last a weekwhy half the bloody peasants in strackenz probably know that there are two carl gustafs loose about the place theyll talk wont they bah wheres your spirit playactor he jeered who would listen to them and its only for a few weeksyouve done it once already man and think of the fun it would be they are rare but they do exist and you can only call them adventurers rudi was one it was the excitement the mischief that he lived for more than the reward the game not the prize mad as hatters mark you and dangerous as sharksthey are not to be judged by the standards of yellowbellies like me flashy dont want anything to do with em but he knows how their minds work because of this i was wondering furiously how to deal with him you can go back to your pretty duchess too says he dont want her says i ive had her anyway but theres a fortune in it man id rather be alive and poor thankee he stood considering you dont trust me is that it well says i now that you mention it but thats the point he clapped his hands we are the ideal partnersneither of us trusts the other an inch but we need each other its the only guarantee in any business youre as big a rascal as i am we would sell each other tomorrow but there isnt the need our financiers know all this of course but ive often thought that our diplomatists and politicians could have gone to school to professor starnberg i can see him still arms akimbo flashing eyes curly head brilliant smile and ready to set fire to an orphan asylum to light his cheroot im a dirty scoundrel but it has come to me naturally rudi made a profession out of it come on man what dyou say i caught the note of impatience in his voice careful now i thought or hell turn vicious his scheme was unthinkable but i darent tell him so what was the way out then i must pretend to go along with him for the moment would a chance of escape offer it was growing on me that the only safe way outor the least riskywas to find some way of doing what sapten had wanted how could i get the drawbridge down would i survive the assault that would follow aye but for the moment pretend could we make certain of sapten and grundvig i asked doubtfully be sure of that says he there are two little cannon below stairsornamental things but theyll work load em with chain and well sweep that causeway from end to end when the rescuers come charging home there are fifty of them remember have you enough here to man the guns and hold the place until we can get away two of us the three you saw in the cellar and another three in the tower says he then there are two on the causeway but theyll go in the first rush they neednt concern us oh he was a born leader all right but now i knew how many men he had and where they were the vital fact was that there was no one apparently guarding the drawbridge mechanism on the inside so he cried youre with me well says i doubtfully if we can be sure of holding those damned volsungs on the bridge long enough well concentrate all our force by the guns at the drawbridge arch says he why we can have all ready in half an hour then down with the bridge and let the flies come streaming towards our parlour his eyes were shining with excitement and he put out his hand and then my friend we embark on our profitable partnership suddenly it struck me that it was now or never he would move fast and somehow i had to forestall him while his small forces were still scattered about the castle and all unsuspecting i fought down my rising fear of what was to do steeling myself for a desperate effort my hand was sweating in his grasp lets drink to it cries he exultantly and turned to the table where the bottles stood oh jesus good luck to me i thought i moved up to his side and as he splashed brandy into the glasses i made a swift examination of the other bottles standing by a sturdy flask caught my eye and i made a careless show of examining it turning it by the neck to see the label he was so confident in his youth and strength and arrogance that he never thought of being caught offguard why should he worry in a castle held by his men with only the feeblespirited flashman to be watched here says he turning with a glass and i breathed a silent prayer shifted my hand on the bottle neck and swung it with all my force at his head he saw the movement but had no time to duck the flask shattered on his temple with an explosion like a pistolshot and he staggered back wine drenching his hair and tunic and hurtled full length to the floor i was beside him in a flash but he was dead to the world with a great ugly gash welling blood among his curls for a few seconds i waited listening but there was no sound from without i rose my heart pounding and strode quickly across the room pausing only to take up a sabre from a rack in the corner id done it now and was in a state of active funk but there was nothing for it but to hurry ahead and hope the door creaked abominably as i pulled it gently open and peeped out all was still the stairlamps shone dimly on the great empty hall there was no sound of footsteps i closed the door softly and tiptoed to the top of the stairs keeping close to the wall through the great arch across the hall i could see the wheel and chains of the drawbridge they looked gigantic and i wondered uneasily could i lower the bridge singlehanded and would i have the time to do it before someone came into the hall i cursed myself for not finishing starnberg off while i had the chance suppose he came to should i go back and settle him but i baulked at that and every second i lingered now increased the chance of discovery gulping down my fear i sped down the steps and across the hall taking cover in the shadows of the archway holding my breath and trying to listen above the thumping of my heart still no sound and the lighted entrance to the passage leading to the dungeons which i could see from my hidingplace remained empty i stole across to the great wheel gently laid my sabre on the flags and tried to make out how the mechanism worked there was a big handle on the wheel with room for at least two men that was how they wound it up but there must be a brake on the wheel to hold it i fumbled in the dark cluttering with fright and could find nothing that seemed to answer the case the chains were taut with strain and when i went farther into the arch i found that its outer end was closed by the raised wooden bridge itself it was at least ten feet broad and might be three times that in length for its upper end was lost in the dark above my head faint streaks of moonlight came through at either side well at least there were no doors or portcullis to worry about once the bridge was down the way was openif i could get it down and if it survived the fall the bloody thing looked as though it weighed a ton when it crashed down across the gap to the causeway there would be no need of any further signal to sapten and his boardingpartythey would hear the row in strackenz city aye that would wake the castle all right and young flash would have to light out full tilt for cover before the shooting started but i had to get the damned thing down first by god how long was it since i had left rudi suppose he was stirring in a panic i scurried back to the wheel kicked my sabre in the dark and sent it clattering across the flags making a most hellish din i grabbed at it whispering curses and at that moment came the bloodchilling sound of footsteps from the passageway across the hall i actually clapped my hand across my own mouth and dived for the shelter of the wheel burrowing in close at its foot and trying not to breathe while the steps tramped out into the hall there were two of them kraftstein and another they stopped in the middle of the hall and kraftstein glanced upwards towards the room where i had left rudi oh my god i thought please dont let them go up let the lousy bastards go away was machen sie said the second one and kraftstein grunted something in reply which i didnt catch the other one shrugged and said he was fed up with sitting in the cellar with carl gustaf for company and kraftstein remarked that at least he was better off than the guards out on the causeway they laughed at that and both looked towards the arch where i was hiding i lay still as a corpse my nerves almost snapping watching them through the spokes of the wheel and then i saw something that brought the icy sweat starting out of me the hall light casting its shaft into the mouth of my archway was glittering on the point of the sabre that lay where i had knocked it half in and half out of the shadow oh christ they couldnt help but see itit was shining like a blasted lighthouse they were standing there staring straight in my direction not a dozen paces away another few seconds and i believe id have come bolting out like a rabbit and then the second one yawned enormously and said gott ich bin mude wie viel uhr glauben sie dass es sei kraftstein shook his head ist spat gehen sie zu bette i was willing them feebly both to go to bed and at last the other one mooched off on his own kraftstein took a turn round the hall while my pulse increased to a sickening gallop and then he went back into the passage leading below i waited trembling until his footsteps had died away and then stole out and retrieved my sabre to my disordered imagination it seemed incredible that there was still no sound from rudis roomthough in fact it probably wasnt five minutes since i had left him i came back to the wheel forcing myself to inspect it calmly it must be held at some point i felt it all over both sides feeling sicker every momentand then i saw it where its rims almost touched the ground there was a bolt thrust through one of the spokes into the housing of the windlass if it was withdrawn i guessed the wheel would be released but it wasnt going to be a simple business of pulling it out it was going to have to be driven out with force well in gods name there had to be something handy to knock it clear i fumbled about in the shadows ears pricked and whimpering nonsensical instructions to myself but the best thing i could find was a heavy billet of wood among some rubbish in the corner i could only hope that it would do i was desperate by now anyway and i fairly sped round the other side of the windlass praying audibly as i went and bashed at the protruding end of the bolt with all my strength the thumping was fit to wake the dead oh jesus it wasnt moving i belaboured the molt frantically swearing at it and it moved in a fraction i hammered away and suddenly it shot out of sight there was an earsplitting clang the wheel whirred round like some huge animal springing to life and the handle shot by within an inch of braining me i flung myself out of the way my ears filled with the shrieking and clanking of the chains as they rasped over their rollers it sounded like a thousand iron demons banging on anvils in hell but the bridge was falling i saw it yawn away from the outer arch and moonlight flooded in and then with an appalling crash the great mass of wood fell outwards smashing against the stonework of the causeway leaping as if it were alive and settling oh thank godacross the gap the clap of the explosion was in my ears as i grabbed my sabre and took cover at the side of the archway my first thought was to rush out across the bridgeanywhere out of that damned castlebut an outcry from the causeway stopped me the guards i couldnt see them but they were there all right and then i saw a pinpoint of light from the far end of the causeway and the crack of a shot hard behind it saptens merry men must be getting into action there was a ragged volley from the shore and a scream and i hesitated no longer anything emerging across that bridge was going to be a prime target this was no place for harry flashman and i fled back into the hall looking for a safe corner to hide in until the forthcoming passage of arms was over by god i had done my share and no mistake not for me to try to steal all the glory which the sons of the volsungs so richly deserved someone was running and yelling in the passage from the dungeons another voice was bellowing from up aloft the hall was going to be fairly busy in a moment or two so i scampered towards a doorway hitherto unnoticed midway between the main gate and the dungeon passage it was locked i battered on it for a futile moment and then swung round to look for another bolthole but it was too late kraftstein was leaping across the hall sword drawn bawling to everyone to come and lend a hand two more were emerging from beyond the stairs i shrank back in the doorwayfortunately it was fairly deep and they hadnt seen me being intent on their yawning front door pistols roared kraftstein quickly theyre coming across heinrich back this way man come on he vanished into the archway with the other two close behind him i heard them start shooting and congratulated myself on having left them a clear field in that direction sapten wasnt going to have things all his own way by the sound of things and presently two more of the garrison came racing out of the dungeon arch and another from the stairs unless i had miscounted the whole of the jotunberg friendly society was now gathered in the main entranceall except rudi who was presumably still stretched out above stairs and bleeding to death with any luck i wondered if the last man up from below had cut carl gustafs throat and sent him down the pipe not that i cared much but the besiegers would probably feel better disposed towards me if they found him alive however he could take his chance in the meantime it seemed reasonable that i should seek out another refuge elsewhere if i made a quick bolt for it there seemed little chance that the defenders would notice methey were warmly engaged by the sound of yelling and banging from the direction of the drawbridge i peeped cautiously out the dungeon passage seemed a good place for i recollected openings off it where i ought to be able to lurk in comparative safety the hall was empty i made sure there was no one in sight at the main arch and was flitting stealthily out when a voice from the stairway stopped me dead in my tracks yelping as i did so hold on playactor the comedys not finished yet rudi was standing on the bottom step leaning against the stone balustrade he was grinning but his face was ghastly pale except down the right side where the blood had dried in a dark streak he had a sabre in his free hand and he lifted the point in my direction bad form to sneak away without saying goodbye to your host says he damned bad form didnt they teach you manners at that english school of yours i made a dart towards the dungeon passage but with a speed that astonished me considering the wound on his head he bounded off the step and was there before me slashing at me so close that i had to leap back out of harms way he laughed savagely and feinted to lunge tossing the curls out of his eyes not quick enough were we it isnt de gautet this time you know i circled away from him and he followed me with his eyes smiling grimly and making his point play about in front of me i heard a movement behind me towards the arch but before i could turn he sang out no no dont shoot you attend to the rats outside ill settle the one in here he advanced slowly his eyes flashing as the light caught them it isnt played out yet you know says he perhaps your friends will find jotunberg a tougher nut to crack than they imagined and if they dowell theyll find twin corpses to cheer em up he flicked out his point and i parried it and sprang away he laughed at that dont like cold steel do we well like it even less in a minute come on guard curse you i couldnt fly hed have had his point through my back in a twinkling so i had to fight not many foemen have seen old flashys face in battle but rudi was destined to be one of them and i couldnt have had a more deadly opponent i knew he would be as practised with a sword as he was with a knife or a pistol which put him well above my touch but there was nothing for it but to grip my hilt with a sweating hand and defend myself as long as i could i could see only one faint hope if he was so greedy for my blood that he wasnt going to let his pals intervene there was just a chance that i might hold him off long enough for sapten to overcome the defendersif i wasnt a swordsman of his brilliance i was at least as good as the masteratarms of the th hussars could make me and i was strong enough while rudi must be weakened by the smash on the head i had given him perhaps the thought showed in my face for he laughed again and took a cut at me you can have your choice of how you die jeers he a nice thrust or a good backhand cutit can take a head off very pretty as im sure you know and with that he came in foot and hand and had me fighting for my life as i fell back across the hall his blade was everywhere now darting at my face now at my chest now slashing at my left flank now at my headhow i parried those thrusts and sweeps is beyond me for he was faster than any man id ever met and his wrist was like a steel spring he drove me back to the foot of the stairs and then dropped his point laughing while he glanced towards the main gate where the pistols were cracking away and the smoke was drifting back like mist into the hall stand to em kraftstein he shouted what theyre only a pack of ploughmen fire away boys sweep em into the lake he waved his sabre in encouragement and i seized the chance to take a wild slash at his head by god i nearly had him too but his point was up in the nick of time and then he was driving in at me again snarling and thrusting with such speed that i had to duck under his blade and run for it stand and fight damn you cries he coming after me are you all whitelivered you damned british stand and fight what for i shouted so that you can show off your sabrework you foreign mountebank come and get me if youre so bloody clever come on it was the last thing id have thought of saying to anybody normally but i knew what i was doing id noticed as he turned to follow me that he had staggered a little and as he stood now poised to lunge he was swaying unsteadily from side to side he was groggy from his wound and tiring too for all his speed and skill he wasnt as strong a man as i if i could lure him away from the hall away from the chance to call in his men i might be able to exhaust him sufficiently to disable or kill him at least i might hold him in play until sapten and his damned dilatory danes came on the scene so i fell back towards the dungeon doorway calling him an austrian pimp a bedroom bravo a heidelberg whoremaster and anything else that came to mind possibly he didnt need this kind of encouragement it only seemed to amuse him but he came after me hard enough stampstampstamp with arm and sabre straight as a lance when he lunged i retreated along the passage nimbly keeping him at full stretch and got my footing on the steps after that it was easier for whoever had built the steps had known his business they spiralled down to the right so that i could fight with the wall to cover my open flank while his was exposed you cant run forever cries he cutting backhanded so they told wellington says i taking it on my hilt why didnt you learn to fence properly you operahouse buffoon sticks and stones laughs he well have room enough in a moment and see how well you can fence without a wall to burrow under he came down the stairs at a run thrusting close to the wall and i had to jump away and scramble downwards for dear life he was at my back on the instant but i won clear with a couple of swinging cuts and went headlong down the steps stumbling at the bottom and only regaining my balance just in time as he followed me into the open close thing that time playactor says he pausing to brush the hair out of his eyes he was breathing heavy but so was i if he didnt tire soon i was done for he came at me slowly circling his point warily and then sprang clashclash and i fell back before him we were in the low cloister now with plenty of pillars for me to dodge round but try as i might i found him forcing me back towards the lighted arch leading to the guardroom and carl gustafs cell he was fighting at full pitch his point leaping at me like quicksilver and it was all i could do to keep my skin intact as he drove me through into the lighted area not much farther to run now says he dye know any prayers you english coward i was labouring too hard to answer him with a taunt of my own the sweat was coming off me like water and my right wrist was aching damnably but he was almost spent too as he cut at me and missed he staggered and in desperation i tried the old flashman triple passa sudden thrust at the face a tremendous kick at his essentials and a fullblooded downward cut but where i had been to school rudi had graduated with honours he sidestepped thrust and kick and if i hadnt postponed my intended cut in favour of an original parrya blind sideways sweep accompanied by a squeal of alarmhe would have had me as it was his point raked my left forearm before i could get out of range he paused panting to jeer at me so thats the way gentlemen fight in england is it says he no wonder you win your wars you should talk you backstabbing guttersnipe i was scared sick at the narrowness of my escape and glad of the respite when did you last fight fair lets see now says he falling on guard again and trying another thrust it would be i think or i was young then but i was never as crude as yousee now and making a play at my head he suddenly spat straight at me and as i hesitated in astonishment he tried to run me through but his tiredness betrayed him and his point went wide now whos a gentleman i shouted but his only answer was a laugh and a sudden rush that drove me back almost to the grille of carl gustafs cell one backward glance i had to takegod the grille door was open and i went through it like a jack rabbit slamming it as he came rushing after he got a foot in and we heaved and cursed at each other my weight must have told but suddenly there was a shout behind me and something crashed against the bars close to my head it was a pewter potthat damned carl gustaf was not only still alive but hurling his furniture at me i must have relaxed instinctively for rudi forced the door back and i went reeling into the middle of the chamber just as the royal idiot behind me let fly with a stool which fortunately missed im on your side you crazy bastard i shouted throw them at him but he had nothing left now but his lamp and he didnt apparently fancy leaving us in the dark he stood staring while rudi rushed me slashing for all he was worth i hewed desperately back the sabres clanged hilt to hilt and we grappled kicking and tearing at each other until he broke free i caught him a cut on the left shoulder and he swore foully and sprang into the attack again youll go together then he shouted and drove me back across the cell his face and shoulder were bleeding he was all in but he laughed in my face as he closed in for the kill this way this way bawls carl gustaf to me man i couldnt have done it not for a kingdom i could feel my arm failing before starnbergs cuts one i stopped a bare inch from my face and lurched back his arm straightened for the thrustand then in a moment he stopped dead his head turning towards the grille as a shot sounded from the stairs help yelled carl gustaf quickly this way rudi swore and sprang back to the grille door there was the sound of shouting and feet clattering on the steps he waited only an instant and glanced back at me another time damn you he cried au revoir your highnesses and he swung his sabre once and let it fly at me whirling end over end it sailed over my head ringing on the stones but i had started back instinctively my feet slipped out from under me and i came crashing down on the flags christ they werent level i was sliding backwards and in a moment of paralysing horror i remembered the funnel and that ghastly pit at its base i heard carl gustafs cry of warning too late and rudis exultant yell of laughter they seemed to slide upwards out of my sight as i clawed frantically at the slippery stone i couldnt stop myself my foot caught for an instant and i slewed round sprawling helpless as a cod on a fishmongers slab now i was sliding head first i had an instants glimpse of that hellish black hole as i slithered towards it than my head was over the void my arms were flailing empty air and i shot over the lip screaming into the depths jesus down the drain went through my mind as i hurtled headlong towards certain death the pipe ran at an angle my shoulders hips and knees crashed against its sides as i rushed into the inky blackness for sheer horror i have known nothing to come near it for this without doubt was the endthe frightful unspeakable finish i was being shot into the bowels of hell beyond all hope into eternal dark down i went the ghastly wail of my own screams in my ears and ever down down and then with shattering force i was plunged into icy water plummeting through it like a stone until it gradually drew me to a halt and i felt myself rising for a moment i thought i must have shot out into the jotunsee a moment of frantic hope but before i had risen a foot my back bumped against the pipe christ i was trapped like a rat for the shaft was too narrow to turn i was head down with nothing to do but drown that i didnt go mad in that moment is still a wonder to me i honestly believe that a brave man would have lost his reason for he would have known he was beyond hope only one of my senseless unreasoning cowardice would have struggled still stretching down with frantic fingers and clawing at the pipe beneath me i had had no time to take breath before hitting the water my mouth and nose were filling as my hands clawed at the pipe and found a ledge i hauled with the strength of despair and slid a little farther down the pipe my fingers found another ledge and hauled again but then my strength went and i found myself turning on my back i was gulping water the stifling agony in my throat was spreading to my chest i beat feebly at the roof of the pipe thinking christ christ dont let me die dont let me die but i am dying i amand as i felt my senses going i was dimly aware that my face was not against the pipe but only my chest and body i cant remember thinking clearly what this meant but i know that my hands came up beside my face which had in fact come out of the pipes end and pushed punily at the stone that was imprisoning me i must have thrust outwards for i felt my body rasp slowly along the pipe as i tilted upwards there was a dreadful roaring in my ears and nothing but crimson before my eyes but i could feel myself rising rising and i know a vague thought of floating up to heaven went through what remained of my consciousness and then there was air on my facecold biting aironly for a second before the water enveloped me again but halfdead as i was my limbs must have answered to the knowledge for my head came into the air again and this time i thrashed feebly and kept it above the surface my sight cleared and there was a starry sky above me with a huge white cold moon and i was spewing and retching on the surface of the jotunsee somehow i kept afloat while the agony in my chest subsided and my senses came back enough for me to realise that the water was freezing cold and threatening to suck me down once more sobbing and belching water i paddled feebly with my hands and looked about me to my right the lake stretched away forever but there on my left looming upwards was the great rock of jotun berg with its beautiful welcoming splendid castle it was a bare twenty yards away i struggled with all my strength kicking out against the water and by the grace of god the rock when i reached it was shelving i got my head and shoulders on to it and clawed my way out and then i lay helpless as a baby with my face on that blessed cold wet stone and went into a dead faint i think i must have lain there only a few minutes perhaps the mental shock of the ghastly experience i had endured was greater than the physical one for the next thing i remember is stumbling slowly over the rocks by the waterside without knowing where or who i was i sat down and gradually it all came back like a terrible nightmare it took some moments before i could assure myself that i was alive again looking back of course i realise that from the moment i slipped into the funnel in the dungeon until i clambered ashore again on the jotunberg can hardly have been more than two minutes my initial plunge must have taken me to within a foot or two of the pipes outlet i had scrambled out by sheer panicky good luck and floated to the surface it was a miracle no doubt but a truly horrifying one if im a coward havent i cause to be only those who know what it is to die can really fear death i think and by god i knew it haunts me still any time i have a bellyful of cheese or lobster i try to stay awake all night for if i drop off sure as fate there i am again in that hellish sewer beneath jotunberg drowning upside down however at the time when i realised that i wasnt dead yet but that i would be if i sat there much longer of cold and exhaustion i took stock of the situation at the point where i had left the scene of the action so abruptly it had sounded as though help had arrived presumably kraftstein and his cronies had been overcome and with any luck rudi had met a welldeserved end into the bargain happy thought maybe they had slung him down the pipe after me i couldnt think of anyone i would rather have had it happen to anyway they were probably getting carl gustaf out of his fetters by now and all would be jollity how would they respond to my reappearance it would be a bit of a blow to them after i had appeared to die so convenientlywould they be tempted to do the job properly this time no surely notnot after all id done for them much against my will though it had been anyway it was settled for me if i stayed there any longer i would certainly freeze to death i must just go into the castle and take my chance from where i stood i could see the causeway about a hundred yards ahead and as i stumbled round the base of the island the drawbridge came into view there were figures in the castle gateway and they looked like volsungs sure enough as i came closer i saw that they were so i hallooed and scrambled up the little rocky path that ended at the bridges foot three gaping sturdy peasants they helped me up and led me through the debrisstrewn archway into the hall god what a mess it was kraftstein lay beside the wheel with his skull split and his great hands crooked like talons i remembered their grip and shuddered nearby were half a dozen other bodiessapten had kept his word then there would be no survivors of the jotunberg garrison there was a pool of blood in the very centre of the hall and lying in it was the fellow who had complained to kraftstein of boredom well ennui wouldnt trouble him any longer the smell of powder was harsh in my nostrils and a faint cloud of it still hung in the shadows overhead the peasants pushed me down on to a bench and while one helped me strip my sodden clothesthe second time that nightanother washed the stinging gash in my arm and bandaged it round the third practical fellow realising that i had to be clad in something was pulling the garments off one of the corpseshe chose one who had been neatly shot in the head and had been considerate enough not to bleed muchand i cant say that i felt any revulsion at all about wearing dead mens weeds in fact they fitted uncommon well then they presented me with a flask of schnapps and i sent half of it down my throat at once and felt the fiery warmth running back along my limbs i poured a little into my palm and rubbed it on my face and necka trick mackenzie taught me in afghanistan nothing like it for the cold if you can spare the liquor i sipped the rest slowly looking round there were several volsungs in the hall staring curiously about them and i could hear the voices of others in the upper rooms they seemed to have everything in hand of sapten and grundvig there was no sign well this was fine so far as it went i was beginning to feel excellent now that the shockno the series of hellish frightsof the evening were wearing off and i was savouring the blissful knowledge that here i was hale and whole with drink in me warm clothes and nothing more to fear with every moment as i realised what i had endured and escaped my spirits rose i could contemplate the future for the first time in months without feeling my bowels drooping down into my legs wheres major sapten then says i and they told me he was down in the dungeon still on no account they said was anyone to intrude well i knew the prohibition wouldnt include me so i brushed aside their protests with a show of princely authorityremarkable how habits stick once learnedand marched across to the passage i checked at the archway though and asked if they were sure all the defenders were dead and they beamed and chorused jah jah i took a sabre along anywaynot for protection but because i knew it would look well and went down the staircase and into the cloister through the far archway i heard the murmur of voices and as i came closer sapten was say ing hansens body in the moat i wish we had laid starnberg by the heels though thats one overdue in hell that was bad news i took a hurried look round and then cursed my nervousness wherever rudi was it wouldnt be here it all passes belief said another voice and i recognised it as carl gustafs can it be true a man who could take my place an english impostor and yet he came here alone with hansen to try to save me he didnt have much choice growls sapten it was that or a rope well damn him there was gratitude nay nay you wrong him it was grundvig now excellent chap he tried to make amends sapten no man could have done more without him do i not know it says carl gustaf i saw him fight he saved me from that scoundrel my god what a death there was a pause and then sapten says aye well give him the benefit of the doubt but i have to say it in dying he performed you a service highness for alive he might have been a confounded embarrassment well i wasnt standing for thisbesides i know a cut when i hear one i stepped softly through the archway sorry to be inconvenient major says i but embarrassment or not i am still here to serve his highness it produced a most satisfactory effect sapten spun round on his heel his pipe clattering on the floor grundvig sprang up staring in amazement the prince who had been seated at the table swore in astonishment there were two others there behind the princes chair and doubtless they were suitably stricken too well there was a fine babble and cries of wonder and inquiry i can tell you they were certainly surprised to see me even if they werent exactly overjoyed of course it was a difficult situation for them heroes are so much less of a nuisance when theyre dead there was even a hint of resentment i thought in the questions they poured at mehow had i escaped where had i come from ill swear sapten was on the brink of demanding what the devil i meant by it i answered fairly offhand describing the plumbing system of jotunberg briefly and how i had escaped from the lake grundvig and the prince agreed it was a marvel sapten recovered his pipe and stuffed it with tobacco and so says i in conclusion i came back to offer my further servicesif they are needed and i laid my sabre gently on the table and stood back this chap irving has nothing on me there was an awkward very long silence sapten puffedhe wasnt going to break it grundvig fidgeted and then the prince who had been frowning at the table looked up god he was like me sir says he slowly these gentlemen have been telling me what has happened in strackenz of late itit defies understanding mine at least it seems you have been party to the most dastardly deception the strangest plot i ever heard of yet it seems it was against your willis this not so he looked at the others and grundvig nodded and looked bewildered perhaps i am not clear in my mind the prince went on after all this and he gestured about him like a man in a fog but at least have the evidence of my eyes whoever you are whatever the reasons for what you did he broke off at a loss and then pulled himself together you saved my life tonight sir that much i know if there has been wrong on your sidewell that is for your soul but it has been cancelled out for me at least he looked at the others grundvig still nodding sapten puffing grimly and staring at his boots then carl gustaf stood up and held out his hand i took it very manly and we shook and looked each other in the eye it was not canny that resemblance and i know he felt the same eeriness as i did for his hand fell away indeed i think i am in your debt says he a little shaky if there is anything i can do i dont know well to tell the truth i hadnt been thinking of rewards but he seemed to be hinting at something however i knew the best policy was to shut up so i simply waited and another uncomfortable silence fell but this time it was sapten who broke it theres no question of debt says he deliberately mr arnold may be said to have made amends hes lucky to go off with his life but at this grundvig and the prince cried out at lease we owe him civility says the prince mr arnold you have had my thanks understand it is the thanks of strackenz and denmark also aye very fine sneers sapten but with your highnesss leave a clear passage to our frontier is the most i think that mr arnold will expect he was pretty angry all right i began to understand that if carl gustaf hadnt survived it would have been waltzing matilda for flashy if sapten had had his way i didnt think it politic to mention his promise on behalf of little goldenheaded amelia the less said about her the better at least he must be allowed to rest first says the prince and then conveyed in safety to the border we owe him that he cant stay here croaked sapten in gods name look at his face well have difficulty preventing a scandal as it is if there are two men with the princes figurehead in the state well never keep it quiet the prince bit his lip and i saw it was time for a diplomatic intervention if your highness pleases says i major sapten is right every moment i continue in strackenz is dangerous for both of us but especially for you i must go and quickly believe me it is for the best and as the major has remarked there is no debt wasnt there though i kept my face smooth but underneath i was beginning to smart with hurt and anger i hadnt asked to be embroiled in the politics of their tinpot little duchy but i had been bloody near killed more times than i could count cut and wounded and halfdrowned scared out of my witsand all i was getting at the end of it was the sneers of sapten and the handshake of his blasted highness ten minutes before i had been thankful to come out with a whole skin but suddenly now i felt full of spite and anger towards them there was a bit of mumbling and grumbling but it was all hypocrisy indeed i dont doubt that if carl gustaf had been given an hour or two longer to recover from the scare he had had and his consequent gratitude to me he would have been ready to listen to a suggestion from sapten that i should be slipped back down the pipe for a second timewith my hands tied this time after all his face was like mine so his character might be too for the moment though he had the grace to look troubled he probably thought he owed it to his princely dignity to do something for me but he managed to fight it downthey usually do and the upshot of it was that they agreed that i should ride out as quickly as possible they would stay where they were for the night so that his highness could rest and take counsel and there was a broad hint that i had better be over the frontier by morning grundvig seemed the only one who was unhappy about my sudden dismissal he was an odd one that and i gathered from what he said that he alone had come round to the view that i was more sinned against than sinning he actually seemed rather sorry for me and he was the one who eventually escorted me up from that dungeon and ordered a horse to be found and stood with me in the castle gateway while they went to the mainland for it i am a father too you see says he pacing up and down i understand what it must mean to a man when his loved ones are torn from him and used as hostages against him who knows i too might have acted as you did i trust i should have behaved as bravely when the time came silly bastard i thought thats all you know i asked him what had happened to rudi and he said he didnt know they had seen him vanish through a side door in the outer cell and had given chase but had lost him in the castle presumably he knew its boltholes and had got away i didnt care for the sound of this but it was long odds i wouldnt run into him again anyway i wasnt planning on lingeringjust long enough for the notion that was beginning to form in my mind then one of the peasants returned with a horse and a cloak for me i asked a few directions of grundvig accepted a flask and a pouch of bread and cheese and swung into the saddle just the feel of the horse moving under me was heartening i could hardly wait to be away from that beastly place and everything in it grundvig didnt shake hands but he waved solemnly and then i turned the horses head touched her with my heel and clattered away across the bridge out of the lives of carl gustaf the sons of the volsungs old uncle tom cobley and all i took the strackenz city road and never looked back at the cold pile of jotunberg i hope they all caught pneumonia you would think no doubt that after what i had gone through i would have no thought but to go out of strackenz and germany as fast as a clean pair of heels could take me looking back i wonder that i had any other notion but the truth is that i did its a queer thing while im the sorriest coward in moments of danger there is no doubt that escape produces an exhilaration in me perhaps it is simple reaction perhaps i become lightheaded perhaps it is that in my many aftermaths i have usually had the opportunity of some strong drinkas i had nowand that all three combine to produce a spirit of folly god knows it isnt courage but i wish i had a guinea for every time ive come through some hellish crisis babbling thankfully to be still aliveand then committed some idiocy which i wouldnt dare to contemplate in a rational moment and in this case i was angry too to be harried and bullied and exposed to awful dangerand then just cut adrift with hardly a thankyoudamnyoureyes from a man who but for me would have been feeding the fishesgod i found myself hating that shillyshally carl gustaf and that sourfaced old turd sapten aye and that mealy grundvig with his pious maundering id pay them out by gum would i and it would be poetic justice too in a waybismarck had promised me a grand reward well id come out of strackenz with something for my pains and of course it was really safe enough there was hardly any risk at all for i had a certain start of several hours and id know how to cover my tracks by god id show them theyd learn that a little gratitude would have been starvation cheap i could do their dirty work for them and then i could just piss off could i theyd learn to think a little more of harry flashman than that the mean bastards so i reasoned in my logical way but the main thing was i was sure there was no danger in what i intended and what is there i ask you that a man will not dare so long as he has a fast horse and a clear road out of town the night sky was just beginning to lighten when i came to strackenz city with the dawn wind rustling the trees along the landstrasse the suburbs were quiet as i cantered through my hooves ringing on the cobbles i skirted the old city to come to the ducal palace where two sleepy sentries stared openmouthed at me through the railings oeffnen says i and while one tried to present arms and dropped his musket the other made haste to swing open the gates i clattered through leaving them to marvel at the sight of their new prince whose absence must have been the talk of the duchy arriving unkempt and unshaven at this hour of the day there were more guards at the door to whom i gave sharp orders to have a strong horse saddled and ready for me within ten minutes i issued further instructions that no one was on any account to be allowed to leave the palace nor was anyone to be admitted without reference to me they saluted and stamped and fell over themselves in their hurry to obey one flung open the doors for me and i strode masterfully into the hallthis was going to be easy thinks i a sleepy majordomo or night porter came starting out of the chair where he had been dozing he cried out at the sight of me and would have roused the place but i hushed him with a word send someone to the kitchens says i get them to put together such cold foods as will go into a saddlebag and bring it here also some wine and a flask of spirits oh and some money bring a purse now go your highness is riding out again quavers he yes i snapped beeilen sie sich but highness i have instructions her highness the duchess must be informed the duchess shes here not at streihow no indeed sir she returned last night after after you were not to be found his eyes were round with fright there has been terrible concern highness orders have been issued that if word came about you her highness was to know at once i hadnt counted on this she ought to have been at strelhow still damn her it complicated mattersor did it i stood thinking quickly while the majordomo hopped from one foot to the other and made up my mind well ill tell her myself says i now my good fellow do exactly as i have told youand the less said about my return the betterunderstand i left him chattering obedience and went up the great staircase four at a time and strode along to the duchesss apartments there were the usual yellowjacketed sentries at her door stiffening to attention at the sight of me and rolling their eyes in astonishmentwouldnt have done for the th hussars ill tell you i thumped on the panels and after a moment a feminine voice called out sleepily wer klopft carl gustaf says i and to the sentries let no one pass there was a feminine squeaking from within and the door opened on the pert little redhaired ladyinwaiting whom rudi had fancied she was staring astonishment with one eye and rubbing the sleep out of the othera very pretty picture of disarray with one tit peeping out of her nightdress its as well im leaving strackenz thinks i for i wouldnt have been a faithful husband for long wheres your mistress says i and at that moment the inner door opened and irma appeared a gown pulled hastily round her shoulders what is it helga who was knock and then at the sight of me she gave a little scream swayed for a moment and then flung herself forward into my arms carl oh carl carl oh well i might have been faithful for a while anyway the feel of that warm young body against mine was like an electric shock and it was no pretence when i hugged her to me and returned the kisses that she rained on my lips and cheeks oh carl she stared up at me tears on her lovely face oh my dear what has happened to your head for a moment i didnt understand then i remembered my fine bald poll hadnt had the razor over it for two or three days now and i was sporting a fine black bristle like an old brush trust a woman to hit on the least important thing nothing my dear darling says i and smothered her lovingly alls well now that i have you again but what has happened where have you been i was mad with anxiety she gave a little scream you are wounded your arm there there sweeting says i giving her another squeeze for luck set your fears at rest its a scratch nothing more i turned her round murmuring endearments and led her into her own bedchamber away from the delighted and curious gaze of young helga i shut the door and at once her questions broke out afresh i hushed her and sat down on the edge of the bedit would have been splendid to curl up with her but there wasnt time there has been a rebelliona plot rather against the duchy your throne our lives were threatened i cut short her cry of dismay it is all overnearly over at any rate there is a little still to do but thanks to the loyalty of certain of your subjects our subjectsthe worst is passed and there is no more to fear but but i dont understand she began and then that beautiful face hardened who was it those agitatorsthose creatures of the gutter i knew it now now says i soothingly calm yourself it is all past strackenz is safeand most of all you are safe my sweet and i wrapped her up again most enjoyably she began to tremble and then to sob oh carl oh thank god you have really come back oh my dear i have been ready to die i thought i thought you were ah well you see i wasnt there there now dry your eyes my darling and listen she blinked at me dabbing at her eyelashesgod she was a beauty in her flimsy nightrailthey seemed to be wearing them very low in strackenz that winter and i was beginning to come all over of a heat what with her nearness and the scent of her hair and the troubled adoration in her lovely eyes it is quite crushed thisthis plot says i no hear me outi shall explain everything in time but for the moment you must trust me and do precisely as i say it is donefinishedsafe all but for a few details which require my attention details what details theres no time now i must be away again she cried out at this it is only for a moment darlinga few hours and i shall be with you and well never be parted againnever she started to weep again clinging to me refusing to let me go protesting that i would be going into danger and all the rest of it i tried to comfort her and then the baggage opened her mouth on mine and pushed her hand between my thighs murmuring to me to stay by gum it agitated me i wondered if i had time no by god i darenti had lost precious minutes already she was stroking away and my head was swimming with her but i just put lust second to common sense for once and forced her gently away you must stay here says i firmly with a strong guard on the palace and on your room itself oh darling believe me it is vital i would not go but i mustand you must remember that you are a duchess and the protector of your peopleand and all that now will you trust me and believe me that i do this for the safety of strackenz and my own darling these royal wenches are made of stern stuff of course tell em its for their countrys sake and they become all proudly dutiful and think theyre joan of arc i gave her some more patriotism mixed with loving slush and at last she agreed to do what she was told i swore id be back in an hour or two and hinted that we would stay in bed for a week and at this she flung herself on me again oh my darling says she wriggling against me how can i let you go just for a bit says i and thenah but i cant stop now she was getting me into a fever no i promise i shall take care i wont get hurtand if i do therell be another chap along shortlythat is no i mean i shall return my darling i gave her one last tremendous hug and left her stretching out her arms to me it was quite touching reallyshe loved me you know and if i hadnt been in such a damned hurry id have been quite sorry to leave her next door mistress helga had restored herself to decency but from the flush on her cheeks i suspected shed been listening at the door i instructed her sternly to look after her mistress and to see that she kept to her room then i stepped out into the passage the sentries were stiff as ramrods i repeated my orders that no one was to pass either way and set off for the clock tower it wasnt difficult to find up another flight of the main stairsthere were two more sentries at the top whom i sent to join irmas guardand then up a spiral stairway and along a short passage to a wroughtiron gateway just before the gate there was a little guardroom where i found an ensign and two sentries the men were playing cards and the ensign was lounging in a chair but at sight of me they were on their feet in an instant goggling and fumbling with buttons i lost no time fahnrich says i there has been an attempt at a coup detat the duchesss life has been threatened they stared at me aghast no time to tell you more i went on briskly the situation is in hand but i have to leave the palace at once in order to take charge at the scene of the outbreak you understand now then whats your name wwwessel please your highness he stammered very good fahnrich wessel now attend to me for the safety of the duchess i have already mounted a guard on her apartments you with your men here will proceed there at once and you will take command you will permit no oneno one you understandto pass into her highnesss apartment until i return is that clear whywhy yes your highness but our post herethe crown jewels there is a jewel infinitely more precious to us all to be guarded says i portentously now take your men and go quickly of course highness on the instant he hesitated but pardon highnessit is the first order of the palace guard that never shall the jewels be left unwatched these are explicit instructions fahnrich wessel says i do you wish to be a lieutenant some day or would you prefer to be a private i know the sacred value of the regalia as well as you but there are times when even jewels are unimportant so off with you i take full responsibility indeed ill do better give me the keys and i shall carry them myself that settled it he clicked his heels squeaked at his men and sent them off at the double he took the keys from his own belt and passed them to me as though they were redhot then he gathered up his sabre and cap and was off but i called him back wessel says i in a softer voice you are not married no highness but you are perhaps a lover he went pink highness i you understand i think i frowned and forced a smile togetherone of those grimaces of the strong man movedand laid a hand on his shoulder take care of her for me wont you he was one of those very young intense creatures of the kind you see addressing heaven in the background of pictures showing napoleon crossing the alps in dancing pumps he went red with emotion with my life highness says he gulping and he snatched my hand kissed it and sped away well that was ensign wessel taken care of hed cut the whole bloody german army to bits before he let anyone near irma likewise and more important he didnt doubt his prince for a minute ah the ideals of youth i thought as i sorted out the keys there were three of them one to the ironwork gate a second to the door beyond it and a third to the little cage shrouded in velvet which stood on a table in the centre of the small jewelroom it was so easy i could have cheered there was a valise in the guardroom and i laid it open beside the table and went to work god what a haul it was there were the rings the staff of sovereignty the diamondandemerald gold chain the duchesss collar and the two crownsthey didnt have to be bent after all the sword of state i left behind as too unwieldy but there were a couple of necklaces i hadnt seen before and a jewelled casket so in they went i was sweating not with exertion but excitement as i shut the valise and strapped it up it weighed about a ton and suddenly i was asking myself where was i going to fence this collection oh well time to worry about that when i was safe over the border and back in england or france thank god the only name sapten and co knew me by was thomas arnoldthey were welcome to call at his tombstone if they felt like it and ask for their money back they had no way of tracing me even if they daredfor if they ever did ferret me out what could they do that wouldnt cause an unholy international scandal but theyd never even know where to look in englandi was safe as houses ayeonce id got away time was flying it was full dawn outside by now i locked the cage arranged its velvet cover locked the door and the gate and set off down the stairs lugging my bag with me i emerged cautiously at the head of the grand staircasethanks to my sending the sentries away there wasnt a soul in sight i stole down and was tiptoeing towards the head of the last flight when i heard footsteps along the passage quickly i thrust the valise behind the base of a statue i was just in time old schwerin the chief minister still with his nightcap on and a robedechambre flapping round his ankles was hobbling along towards me with a little knot of attendants fussing in his wake he was in a tremendous taking of course i thought the old ass would have a seizure forcing myself not to panic at the delay i stilled his questions with the same recital of tommyrot that id served up to irma and the ensignwell i say i stilled them but he babbled on demanding details and explanations and eventually i only shut him up by taking a strong line insisting on the need for haste on my parti had to get back to the scene of the action at once i told him oh god groans he and sank down on a sofa oh the unhappy country what shall we do nonsense sir says i stifling a sudden desire to run for it i have told you the alarm is overall but over anyway what remains to do is to see that no disorders followto quiet our contending factions danish and german in the city itself this shall be your first concern and for some reason i asked which side are you on by the way he stopped moaning and gazed up at me like a dying retriever i am for strackenz highness says he he was no fool this one for all he was an old woman excellent i cried then summon the ministers at onceyoud better get dressed firstand send these peoplei indicated his followers to wait upon the duchess it was going to be like a galloping field day at her apartments but the more of them were out of the way the better above all says i try to communicate as little disquiet as possible now set about it if you please he gathered himself up and shooed away the crowd and yourself highness he quavered you are going into danger but you will take a strong escort with you no says i the fewer who see me go the better that was gods truth too not another word sir for the duchesss sake do as i have bidden you you will have a care highness he pleaded i beg of you for her sakeand for our countrys oh but must you go i was almost bursting with anxiety but i had to humour the senile bastard sir says i have no fear briefly as i have been in strackenz i owe a debt to this duchy already and i intend to pay it in full he drew himself upright and straightened his nightcap god bless you highness says he all moist and trembling you are in the true mould of the oldenbourgs well from what ive seen of european royalty he may well have been right i gave him my manliest smile pressed his hand and watched him totter away to guard the destiny of the duchy god help it he was going to have his work cut out as soon as he was round the corner i heaved out my valise adjusted it over my shoulder by a strap and pulled my ridingcloak over that side the swag had a tendency to clank as i walked so i paced slowly down the broad staircase and across the hall the little majordomo was waiting hopping in anxiety there was a horse at the door he pointed out and its saddlebags were packed i thanked him and walked out into the morning there were guardsmen there of course and a couple of officers all agog at the rumours that must have been flying about i instructed them to post their men at the palace railings and to let no one pass without my orderswith any luck they might blow saptens grizzled head off when he arrived then i mounted very carefully which is damned difficult to do when you have a stone or two of loot swinging under your cloak took the reins in my free hand and addressed the officers again i ride to jotunberg i cantered off down the great carriagesweep and they opened the gates at my approach i stopped at the sentry and quietly inquired which was the western road to lauenburg and he told methat would reach saptens ears for certain and should set him on the wrong track five minutes later i was clattering out of strackenz city making southeast towards brandenburg ive noticed that in novels when the hero has to move any distance at all he leaps on to a mettlesome steed which carries him at breakneck speed over incredible distanceswithout ever casting a shoe or going lame or simply running out of wind and strength on my flight from strackenz admittedly my beast bore up remarkably well despite the fact that i rode him hard until we were over the border and into prussia after that i went easier for id no wish to have him founder under me before id put some distance between myself and possible pursuit but thirty miles with my weight to carry is asking a lot of any animal and by afternoon i was looking for a place to lie up until he was fit for the road again we found one in an old barn miles from anywhere and i rubbed him down and got him some fodder before using up some of my store of cold food for myself i took a tack to the south next day for it seemed to me on reflection that the wider i could pass from berlin the better i know my lucki was going to have to go closer to schцnhausen than was comfortable and it would have been just like it if id run into dear otto on the way but i had planned out my line of march acting on the assumption that the safest route was through the heart of germany to munich where i could choose whether to go on to switzerland italy or even france i had decided to make first of all for magdeburg where i could take to the railway after that it should be plain sailing to munich but in the meantime i would ride by easy stages keeping to the country and out of sight so far as possiblemy baggage wouldnt stand examination if i ran across any of the great tribe of officials who are always swarming in germany looking for other folks business to meddle in in fact i was being more cautious than was necessary there was no telegraph in those days to overtake the fugitive and even if there had been and the strackenzians had been silly enough to use it no one in germany would have had much time for me while i was sneaking from one prussian hedge to another with my bag of loot europe was beginning to erupt in the greatest convulsion she had known since napoleon died the great revolts of which i had heard a murmur from rudi were about to burst on an astonished world they had begun in italy where the excitable spaghettis were in a ferment soon metternich would be scuttling from vienna the french had proclaimed yet another republic berlin would see the barricades up within a month and lolas old leapingpartner ludwig would shortly be bound for the knackers yard i knew nothing of all these things of course and i take some pride in the fact that while thrones were toppling and governments melting away overnight i was heading for home with a set of crown jewels theres a moral there i think if i could only work out what it was possibly it doesnt apply only to me either you will recall that while the continent was falling apart old england went her way without revolutions or disturbances beyond a few workers agitations we like to think we are above that sort of thing of course the englishman however miserably off he is supposes that hes a free man poor fool and pities the unhappy foreigners raging against their rulers and his rulers of course trade on that feeling and keep him underfoot while assuring him that britons never shall be slaves mark you our populace may be wiser than it knows for so far as i can see revolutions never benefited the ordinary folk one bit they have to work just as hard and starve just as thin as ever all the good they may get from rebellion is perhaps a bit of loot and rape at the timeand our english peasantry doesnt seem to go in for that sort of thing at home possibly because theyre mostly married men with responsibilities anyway the point im making is that ive no doubt the revolts of did england a bit of goodby keeping out of them and making money and that as youve gathered was the intention of h flashman esq also however things never go as you intend even in european revolutions my third night on the road i came down with a raging feverfiery throat belly pumping and my head throbbing like a steam engine i suppose it was sure to happen after being immersed in icy water twice in one night taking a wound and being three parts drownedto say nothing of the nervous damage i had suffered into the bargain i had just enough strength to stumble out of the copse where id been lying up and by sheer good luck came on a hut not far away i pounded on the door and the old folk let me in and all i remember is their scared faces and myself staggering to a truckle bed kicking my precious valise underneath and then collapsing i was there for the best part of a week so near as i know and if they were brave enough to peep into my bag while i was unconsciouswhich i doubtthey were too frightened to do anything about it they were simple decent peasants and as i discovered when i was well enough to sit up went in some awe of me of course they could guess from my cut that i wasnt any common hobbledehoy they hovered round me and i suppose the old woman did a fair job of nursing me and all told i counted myself lucky to have come upon them they fed me as well as they could which was damned badly but the old chap managed to look after my horse so that eventually i was able to take the road again in some sort of order though still a trifle shaky i gave them a nicelycalculated payment for their troubletoo little or too much might have had them gossipingand set out southward again i was within a days ride of magdeburg but having lost so much time by my sickness i was in a nervous sweat in case a hue and cry should have run ahead of me however no one paid me any heed on the road and i came to magdeburg safely abandoned my horse and took a train southward there was a shock for me at the station though magdeburg had been one of the earliest cities in germany to have the railway but even so the sum of thalers they took for my fare left me barely enough to keep myself in food during the journey i cursed myself for not trying to realise something on my horse but it was too late now so i was carried south with a fortune in jewels in my valise and hardly the price of a shave in my pocket needless to say this shortage of blunt worried me a good deal i could get to munich but how the devil was i to travel on from there every moment i was in germany increased the chances of my coming adrift somehow i wasnt worried about being in bavaria for i was persuaded that rudis threats of criminal charges in munich had been all trumpedup stuff to frighten me and there was no danger on that score and i was a long way from strackenz in the last place that saptenor bismarck would have looked for me but that damned valise full of booty was an infernal anxiety if anyone got a whiff of its contents i was scuppered so i gnawed my nails the whole waygod knows i was hungry enoughand finally reached munich in a rare state of jumps my belly as hollow as a coffin and my problem still unsolved as soon as i stepped from the station clutching my bag and huddling in my cloak i felt the hairs rising on my neck there was something in the air and ive sensed it too often to be mistaken i had felt it in kabul the night before the residency fell i was to know it again at lucknow and half a dozen other placesthe hushed quiet that hangs over a place that is waiting for a blow to fall you sense it in a siege or before the approach of a conquering army folk hurry by with soft footsteps and talk in low voices and there is an emptiness about the streets the life and bustle die and the whole world seems to be listening but no one knows what for munich was expectant and fearful waiting for the whirlwind that was to rise within itself it was a dim chilly evening with only a little wind but shops and houses were shuttered as against an impending storm i found a little beer shop and spent the last of my coppers on a stein and a piece of sausage as i munched and drank i glanced over a newspaper that someone had left on the table there had been student rioting apparently over the closure of the university and troops had been called out there had been some sharp clashes several people had been wounded property had been destroyed and the houses of prominent people had been virtually besieged the paper as i recall didnt think much of all this but it seemed to be on the students side which was odd there were a few hints of criticism of king ludwig which was odder still journalists being what they are and knowing which side their bread is butteredat all events they didnt see a quick end to the general discontent unless the authorities heeded the voice of popular alarm and purged the state of those poisons which had for all too long eaten into the very heart of the nationwhatever that meant all in all it looked as though munich was going to be a warm town and no place for me and i was just finishing my sausage and speculating on how the devil to get away when a tremendous commotion broke out down the street there was a crash of breaking glass and the voice of popular alarm was raised with a vengeance everyone in the shop jumped to his feet and the little landlord began roaring for his assistants to get the shutters up and bar the door there was a rising chorus of cheering out in the dark the thunder of a rushing crowd the shop window was shattered and almost before i had time to get under the table with my bag there was a battle royal in progress in the street amidst the din of shouts and cheers and cracking timber to say nothing of the babble in the shop itself i grabbed my bag and was making for the back entrance but a stout old chap with grey whiskers seized hold of me bellowing to make himself heard dont go out he roared here we are safe they will cut you to pieces out there well he knew what he was talking about as i realised when the sound of the struggle had passed by and we took a cautious peep out the street looked as though a storm had swept through it there wasnt a whole window or shutter left half a dozen bodies dead or unconscious were lying on the road and the pavement was a litter of brickbats clubs and broken glass a hundred yards down the street a handcart was being thrown on to an improvised bonfire there were perhaps a score of fellows dancing round it and then suddenly there were cries of alarm and they broke and ran round the corner behind came a solid mob of youths rushing in pursuit with their vanguard carrying a banner and howling their heads off some carried torches and i had a glimpse of red caps as they bore down chanting allemania allemania more than that i didnt see for we all ducked back inside again and then they had stormed past like a charge of heavy cavalry the sound of their chanting dying into the distance and the occasional smashing of glass and crash of missiles grew fainter and fainter the old chap with whiskers was swearing fearfully beside me allemania scum young hounds of hell why dont the soldiers sabre them down why are they not crushed without mercy i remarked that crushing them was probably easier said than done from what id seen and asked who they were he turned popeyes on me where have you been sir the allemania i thought everyone knew they were the hired mob of that shedevil montez who is sent to trouble the world and munich in particular and he called her several unpleasant names ah she wont trouble it much longer though says another one a thin cove in a stovepipe hat and mittens her time is almost run god be thanked for it cries the old chap the air of munich will be sweeter without her and her filthy bordello perfumes and he and the thin cove fell to miscalling her with a will now as you can guess i pricked up my ears at this for it sounded like excellent news if the good muncheners were kicking lola out at last they would get three cheers and a tiger from me she had been in my mind of course ever since id decided to make for munich although id determined to keep well clear of her and the barerstrasse but if she had fallen from favour i was agog to hear all about it i couldnt think of anything id rather listen to i pressed the stout old fellow for details and he supplied them the king has given way at last says he he has thrown her outthe one good thing to come out of all this civil unrest that is sweeping the country herr gott the times we live in he looked me up and down but you then are a stranger to munich sir i said i was and he advised me to continue to be one this is no place for honest folk these days says he continue your journey i say and thank god that wherever you come from has not been ruined by the rule of a dotard and his slut unless says the thin chap grinning you care to linger for an hour or two and watch munich exorcising its demon they stoned her house last night and the night before i hear the crowds are in the barerstrasse this evening again perhaps theyll sack the place well this was splendid altogether lola who had dragged me into the horror of schцnhausen and jotunberg at bismarcks prompting was being hounded out of munich by the mob while i the poor dupe and puppet would be strolling out with my pockets lined with tin she was losing everythingand i was gaining a fortune it isnt often justice is so poetic true i still had to solve my immediate problem of getting out of munich without funds i darent try to pop any of my swag and short of waylaying someone in an alleyand i hadnt the game for thati could see no immediate way of raising the wind but it was a great consolation to know that lolas troubles were infinitely more pressingby the sound of it shed be lucky to get through the night alive would they sack her palace the thought of being on hand to gloat from a safe distance was a famous oneif it was safe of course what about her allemania i asked wont they defend her not they says the thin man sneering youll find few of them near the barerstrasse tonightthey riot down here where they conceive themselves safe but theyll risk no encounter with the folk who are crying pereat lola at her gates no says he rubbing his mittens our queen of harlots will find she has few friends left when the mob flush her out well that settled it i wasnt going to miss the chance of seeing the deceitful trollop ridden out of town on a railsupposing the germans had picked up that fine old yankee custom i could spare and hour or two for that so off we set the thin chap and i for the barerstrasse a mob is a frightening thing even when it is a fairly orderly german one and you happen to be part of it as we came to the barerstrasse across the karolinen platz we found ourselves part of a general movement in ones and twos and in bigger groups folk were moving towards the street where lolas bijou palace stood long before we reached it we heard the rising murmur of thousands of voices swelling into a sullen roar as we came close to the fringes of the mob itself the barerstrasse was packed by an enormous crowd the front ranks pressing up against the railings i lost the thin chap somewhere in the press but being tall and finding a step on the opposite side to stand on i could look out across the sea of heads to the line of cuirassiers drawn up inside the palace railingsshe still had her guard apparentlyand see the lighted windows towards which the crowd were directing a steady stream of catcalls and their favourite chant of pereat lola pereat lola splendid stuff i wondered if she was quite such a proud and haughty madame now with this pack baying for her blood there wasnt much sign that they would do anything but chant however i didnt know then that they were mostly there in the expectation of seeing her go for apparently the word had gone round that she was leaving munich that night i was to be privileged to see that remarkable sightand to share in it i would have been better crawling out of munich on my hands and knees and all the way to the frontier but i wasnt to know that either i had been there about half an hour i suppose and was getting weary of it and starting to worry again about my valise which i was gripping tightly under my coat it didnt look as though they were going to break in and drag her out anyway which was what id have liked and i was wondering where to go next when a great roar went up and everyone began craning to see what was happening a carriage had come from the back of the palace and was drawn up at the front door you could feel the excitement rising up from the mob like steam as they jostled for a better look i could see over their heads beyond the line of guardsmen to the front door there were figures moving round the coach and then a tremendous yell went up as the door opened a few figures emerged and then one alone even at that distance it was obviously a woman and the crowd began to hoot and roar all the louder pereat lola pereat lola it was her all right as she came forward into the light that shone from the big lanterns on either side of the doorway i could recognise her quite easily she was dressed as for travelling with a fur beaver perched on her head and her hands in a muff before her she stood looking out and the jeers and abuse swelled up to a continuous tumult the line of guardsmen gave back ever so slightly as the folk in front shook their fists and menaced her through the railings there was a moments pause and some consultation among the group round her on the steps then there were cries of surprise from the street as the coach whipped up and wheeled down towards the gates for lola was still standing in the doorway shes not going someone sang out and there was consternation as the gates opened and the coach rolled slowly forward the crowd gave back before it and it was able to move through the lane they made the coachee was looking pretty scared and keeping his whip to himself but the mob werent interested in him he drove a little way and then stopped not twenty yards from where i was the crowd murmuring in bewilderment couldnt make out what it was all about there was a man in the coach but no one seemed to know who he was lola was still standing on the steps of the house but now she came down them and began to walk towards the gate and in that moment the roar of the mob died away there was a mutter of astonishment and then that died too and in an almost eery silence she was walking steadily past the line of cuirassiers towards the crowd waiting in the street for a minute i wondered if she was mad she was making straight for the crowd who had been roaring threats and curses at her only a moment before theyll kill her i thought and felt the hairs prickling on the nape of my neck there was something awful in the sight of that small graceful figure the hat perched jauntily on her black hair the muff swinging in one hand walking quite alone down to the open gates there she stopped and looked slowly along the ranks of the mob from side to side they were still silent there was a cough a stifled laugh an isolated voice here and there but the mass of them made never a sound watching her and wondering she stood there a full halfminute and then walked straight into the front rank they opened up before her people jostling and treading on each other and cursing to move out of her way she never faltered but made straight ahead and the lane to her coach opened up again the people falling back on both sides to let her through as she drew closer i could see her lovely face under the fur hat she was smiling a little but not looking to either side as unconcerned as though she had been the hostess at a vicarage garden party moving among her guests and for all their hostile eyes and grim faces not one manjack made a move against her or breathed a word as she went by years later i heard a man who had been in that crowdan embassy chap i think he wasdescribing the scene to some others in a london club it was the bravest thing by gad i ever saw in my life there she was this slip of a girl walking like a queenmy stars what a beauty she was too straight into that mob she went that had been howling for her life and would have torn her limb from limb if one of them had given the lead she hardly noticed them dammit just smiled serenely with her head high she was quite unguarded too but on she walked quite the thing while those cabbageeating swabs growled and glaredand did nothing oh she had the measure of those fellows all right but to see her so small and defenceless and brave i tell you i never was so proud to be an englishman as in that moment i wanted to rush forward to her side to show her there was a countryman to walk with her through that damned muttering pack of foreigners yes by gad i would have been happyproud and happyto come to her assistance to be at her side why didnt you then i asked him why not sir because the crowd was too thick damme how could i have done no doubt he was damned glad of the excuse too i wouldnt have been at her side for twice the contents of my valise the risk she ran was appalling for it would probably have taken only one spark to set them rushing in on herthe way they had been baying for her only a few minutes before would have frozen any ordinary persons blood but not lola there was no cowing her she was showing them deliberately putting herself at their mercy daring them to attack herand she knew them better than they knew themselves and they let her pass without a murmur it was pure idiot pride on her part of course typically montezand of a piece with what she had done i heard in the previous nights disturbance when they were throwing brickbats at her windows and the crazy bitch came out on her balcony dressed in her finest ball gown and littered with gems and toasted them in champagne the plain truth about her was that she didnt care a damnand they went in awe of her for it she reached the coach and the chap inside hopped out and handed her in but the coachee couldnt whip up until the crowd began to disperse they went quietly almost hangdog it was the queerest thing you ever saw and then the coach began to go forward at a walk and the coachee still didnt whip up even when the way was quite clear i tagged along a little way in the rear marvelling at all this and not a little piqued to see her get off scotfree why the brutes hadnt even given her a rotten egg to remember them by but that is like the germans let anyone stand up to em and they shuffle and look at each other and touch their forelocks to him an english crowd nowtheyd either have murdered her or carried her shoulderhigh cheering but these squareheads didnt have the bottom to do either the coach went slowly across the karolinen platz where there was hardly any crowd at all and into the street at the far side i was still following on to see if something was going to happen but nothing did no one seemed to be paying any attention to it now as it rolled slowly up the streetand in that moment i was suddenly struck by a wonderful idea i had to get out of munichsuppose i caught up with the coach and begged her to take me with her she couldnt still be holding a grudge against me surelynot after what id suffered through her contrivance shed paid off any score she owed me over lord ranelagh a dozen times overif she didnt know that i could damned soon tell her and she was no longer in any position to have me arrested or locked up dammit anyway we had been lovers once surely she wouldnt cast me adrift if id had a moment to think i dare say i wouldnt have done it but it was decision taken on the edge of an instant here was a chance to get out of munich and germany too probably before the traps got after meand in a moment i was running after the coach gripping my valise and calling out to it to stop possibly it was just my natural instinct when in danger get behind a womans skirts the coachee heard me and of course at once whipped up thinking i suppose that some particularly bloodthirsty hooligan in the mob had changed his mind and was bent on mischief the coach rumbled forward and i ran roaring in its wake cursing at the driver to rein in and trying to make him understand halt dammit i shouted lola its meharry flashman hold on cant you but he just went faster than ever and i had to run like billyo splashing through the puddles and bellowing luckily he couldnt go too fast over the cobbles and i hove alongside just about blown and swung myself onto the side step lola i roared lookits me and she called out to the coachee to pull up i opened the door and tumbled in the chap with her her little servant was ready to leap at me but i pushed him off she was staring at me as though i were a ghost in heavens name she exclaimed youwhat are you doing here and what the devil have you done to your head oh my god lola says i ive had the very deuce of a time lola you must help me ive no money dyou see and that damned otto bismarck is after me lookyou ask about my head he and his ruffians tried to murder me they didseveral times look here and i showed her the bandage sticking out of my left cuff where have you been she demanded and i looked in vain for that womanly concern in her splendid eyes where have you come from up in the north says i strackenzmy god ive had a terrible time im desperate lolano money not a damned farthing and i must get out of germany you see its life or death for me ive been at my wits end and i was coming to you because i knew youd help you were were you says she and i saw you back there with those villains menacing youmy god you were magnificent my darling ive never seen such splendid spirit and ive been in some tight spots as you know lolaplease dear lola ive been through helland it was partly because of you you wont fail me now will you oh my darling say you wont i must say it was pretty good on the spur of the moment the distraught pleading line seemed the best to follow and i must have looked pretty wildand yet harmless she looked at me stonyfaced and my spirits sank get out of my coach says she very cold why should i help you whyafter what ive suffered look they slashed me with sabres those damned friends of yoursbismarck and that swine rudi ive escaped by a miracle and theyre still after metheyll kill me if they find me dont you understand youre raving says she sitting there cold and beautiful i dont know what youre talking about it has nothing to do with me you cant be so heartless says i please lola all i ask is to be allowed to leave munich with youor if youll lend me some money ill go alone but you cant refuse me nowim punished for whatever you had against me arent i good god i wouldnt cast you adriftyou know that were both english my darling after all i have an idea that i went down on my kneesits all the harder to tip a grovelling creature out of a coach after all and she bit her lip and swore and looked both ways in distraction her little servant settled it for the time being let him stay madame it is not wise to linger here we should hurry on to herr laibingers house without delay she still hesitated but he was insistent and i raised the roof with my entreaties so eventually she snapped to the coachee to drive on i was loud in my gratitude and would have described the events leading up to my present situation at some length but she shut me up pretty sharp i have some concerns of my own to occupy me says she where you have been or what devilment youve been doing you may keep to yourself but lolaif i could only explain the devil take your explanation snaps she and her irish was as thick as paddys head ive no wish to hear it so i sat back meekly with my valise between my feet and she sat there opposite me thoughtful and angry i recognised the moodit was one step short of her pisspot flinging tantrum perhaps that mad walk through the crowd had shaken her after all or she was simply fretting about tomorrow i tried one placatory remark im most awfully sorry lolaabout what has happened i mean they seem to have treated you shamefully but she paid no attention though so i shut up it came back to me all of a sudden how it was in a coach i had first met her years agoand i had been a fugitive then and she had rescued me if necessary i might remind her of it but not now but thinking of it i made comparisons yes even in my present desperation i could appreciate that she was as lovely now as she had been thenif i made up to her carefully who knew but she might relent her present coldness she might even let me accompany her all the way out of germanythe prospect of another tumble or two presented themselves to my everready imagination and very delightful thoughts they were stop leering like that she shot at me suddenly i beg your pardon lola i if i help youand i say ifyoull behave yourself with suitable humility she considered me where do you want to go anywhere darling out of munichout of germany if possible oh lola darling ill take you out of munich then tomorrow after that you can fend for yourselfand its more than you deserve well that was something im still even now at a loss to know why she was so hard on me that nighti do believe it was not so much dislike of me as that she was distraught at falling from power and having to leave bavaria in disgrace and yet it may have been that she had still not forgiven me for having her hooted off the london stage at any rate it seemed that her kindness to me when i first came to munich had been all a sham to lull me into easy prey for rudi oh well let her dislike me as long as she gave me a lift it was better here than tramping round munich starting at every shadow we stayed that night at a house in the suburbs and i was graciously permitted to share a garret with her servant papon who snored like a horse and had fleas at least i got fleas so they must have been his in the morning word came that the station was closed as a result of the recent disorders and we had to wait a day while lola fretted and i sat in my attic and nursed my valise next day the trains were still uncertain and lola vowed she wouldnt stay another night in munich which pleased me considerably the sooner we were off the better so she decided that we should drive out of town a days journey and catch a train at some village station or otherive forgotten the name now all these arrangements of course were made without any reference to me lola determined everything with the people of the house while poor old flashy lurked humbly in the background out of sight and expecting to be asked to clean the masters boots at any minute however in the wasted day that we spent waiting lola did speak to me and was even civil she didnt inquire about what had happened to me in the time since she had helped to have me shanghaied out of munich by rudi and when i took advantage of the thaw in her manner to try to tell her she wouldnt have it there is no profit in harking back says she whatever has happened we shall let bygones by bygones i was quite bucked up at this and tried to tell her how grateful i was and how deeply i realised how unworthy i was of her kindness etc and she did give me a rather quizzical smile and said we would not talk about it but we got no warmer than that however when it came to set out on the day after i found she had gone to the trouble of getting me a clean shirt from the master of the house and she was quite charming as we got into the coach and even called me harry come thinks i this is better and better at this rate ill be mounting her again in no time so i set myself to be as pleasant as i know and we talked away quite the thing it got better still during the morning she began to laugh again and even to rally me in her old irish styleand when lola did that turning on you the full glory of those brilliant eyeswell unless you were blind or made of wood you were curling round her little finger in no time at all i must say i was a little puzzled by this change of mood towards me at firstbut after all i said to myself she was always an unpredictable piecemelting one minute raging the next cold and proud or gay and captivating a queen and a little girl all in one i must also say again that she had uncanny powers of charming men far beyond the simple spell of her beauty and by afternoon we were back on our old best terms again and her big eyes were taking on that wanton languorous look that had used to set me twitching and thinking lewdly of beds and sofas altogether by afternoon it was understood that she would not part company with me as she had intended we would catch the train together with papon of course and travel on south she had still not decided where to go but she talked gaily of plans for what she might do in italy or france or whatever place might take her fancy wherever it was she would rebuild her fortune and perhaps even find another kingdom to play with who cares a snap for germany says she why we have the whole world before usthe courts the cities the theatres the fun she was infectious in her gaiety and papon and i grinned like idiots i want to live before i die she said that more than once another of her mottoes i suppose so we talked and joked as the coach rattled along and she sang little spanish songsgay catchy dittiesand coaxed me to sing too i gave them garryowen which she liked being irish and the british grenadiers at which she and papon laughed immoderately i was in good spirits it was gradually dawning on me at last that i was going to get away high wide and handsome jewels and all and i was warm at the thought that all the time the brilliant lovely lola never suspected what she was helping me to escape with at our village we discovered there was a train south next day so we put up at the local inn a decent little place called der senfbuschthe mustardpoti remember lola laughing over the name we had a capital dinner and i must have drunk a fair quantity for i have only vague memories of the evening and of going to bed with lola in a great creaking fourposter which swayed and squealed when we got down to businessshe giggled so much at the row we made that i was almost put off my stroke then we had a nightcap and my last memory of her before she blew out the candle is of those great eyes and smiling red lips and the black hair tumbling down over my face as she kissed me your poor head says she stroking my bristling skull i do hope it grows curly againand those lovely whiskers too youll wear them again for me wont you harry then we went to sleep and when i woke i was alone in the bed with the sun streaming bright in at the window and a most devilish headache to keep me company i ploughed out but there was no sign of her i called for papon but no reply the landlord must have heard me for he came up the stairs to see what i wanted madamewhere is she says i rubbing my eyes madame he seemed puzzled whyshe has gone sir with her servant they went to the station above three hours ago i gaped at him dumbfounded what the devil dye meangone we were travelling together manshe cant have gone without me i assure you sir she has gone he fumbled beneath his apron she left this for your excellency to be given to you when you woke and the lout held out a letter smirking i took it from him sure enough there was lolas hand on the cover and then an awful thought struck mei sped back into my room blundering over a chair and tearing open the cupboard door with a mounting fear in my throat sure enoughmy valise was gone i couldnt believe it for a moment i hunted under the bed behind the curtains everywhere in the room but of course it was not to be seen i was shaking with rage mouthing filthy curses to myself and then i flung down on the bed beating at it with my fists the thieving slut had robbed megod and after what i had been through for that swag i called her every foul name i could think of futile helpless cursesfor it didnt take an instants thought to see that there was nothing i could do i couldnt lay an accusation of theft for stuff i had lifted myself i couldnt pursue because i hadnt the means i had lost iteverything to a lovely loving tender harlot who had charmed me into carelessnessaye and drugged me too by the state of my tongue and stomach and left me stranded while she went off with my fortune i sat there raging and then i remembered the letter crumpled in my fist and tore it open god it even had her coatofarms on the sheet i cleared my eyes and read my dear harry my need is greater than thine i cannot begin to guess where you came by such a treasure trove but i know it must have been dishonestly so i do not shrink from removing it after all you have a rich wife and family to keep you and i am alone in the world you will find a little money in your coat pocket it should get you out of germany if you are careful try not to think too hardly of me after all you would have played me false when it suited you i trust we shall not meet againand yet i say it with some regret dear worthless handsome harry you may not believe it but there will always be a place for you in the heart of rosanna ps courage and shuffle the cards i sat there speechless goggling at it so help me god if i could have come at her in that moment i would have snapped her neck in cold blood for a lying canting thieving seducing hypocritical smoothtongued twofaced slut to think that only yesterday i had been laughing up my sleeve about how she was helping me on my way home with a fortune unsuspected while she was going to have to go back to regular whoring to earn a living and now she was away beyond hope of recovery and my britches arse was hanging out again and she would live in the lap of luxury somewhere on my hardgotten booty when i thought of the torture and risk i had gone through for that priceless haul i raved aloud well it was no wonder i was put out then now after so many years it doesnt seem to matter much i have that letter still it is old and worn and yellowlike me she never became like that she died as lovely as she had always been far away in america having lived before she died i suppose im maudlin but i dont think particularly hard of her nowshe was in the game for the same things as the rest of usshe got more of them thats all id rather think of her as the finest romp that ever pressed a pillow the most beautiful i ever knew anyway and i still wear my whiskers one doesnt forget lola montez ever conniving bitch of course when youre old and fairly well pickled in drink you can forgive most things past and reserve your spite for the neighbours who keep you awake at night and children who get under your feet in youth its different and my fury that morning was frightful i rampaged about that room and hurled the furniture about and when the landlord came to protest i knocked him down and kicked him there was a tremendous outcry then the constable was summoned and it was a damned near thing that i wasnt hauled before a magistrate and jailed in the end there was nothing for it but to pack up what little i had and make back for munich i had a little cash now thanks to lolagod that was the crowning insultso that at long last i was able to make for home weary and angry and full of venom i left germany poorer than i came inalthough of course there was still ј of lolas money in the bank at home i had two sabre cuts and a gash on my arm a decent grasp of the german language and several white hairs i imagine after what id been through oh that was another thing of coursei had a scalp that looked like a hogs back for bristles although it grew right in time and to make my temper even worse by the time i reached the channel i heard news that lola was in switzerland fornicating with viscount peel the old prime ministers sonno doubt he was well peeled too by the time she had finished with him ive only once been back to germany indeed i dont include it even among the garrulous reminiscences that have made me the curse of half the clubs in londonthose thatll have me only once did i tell the tale and that was privately some years ago to young hawkins the lawyeri must have been well foxed or he was damned persuasiveand he has used it for the stuff of one of his romances which sells very well im told he made it into a heroic tale of course but whether he believed it or not when i told it ive no idea probably not its a good deal stranger than fiction and yet not so strange because such resemblances as mine and carl gustafs do happen why i can think of another case connected with this very story and i saw it when the duchess irma came to london in the old queens diamond yearthey were related as ive said its the only time ive seen irma sincei kept well in the background of course but i had a good look at her and even at seventy she was a damned handsome piece and set me itching back over the years she was a widow then carl gustaf having died of a chill on the lungs back in the s but she had her son with her he was a chap in his forties i should say and the point is that he was the living spit of rudi von starnbergwell that can only have been coincidence of course it gave me quite a turn though and for a moment i was glancing nervously round for a quick retreat rudi i last heard of with the germans when they marched on paris there was a rumour of his death so hes probably been stoking lucifers fires these thirty years and good luck to him unlike mr rassendyll i did not exercise myself daily in arms in expectation of trying another round with him one was enough to convince me that with fellows like young rudi the best weapon you can have is a long pair of legs and a good start bismarckwell all the world knows about him i suppose he was one of the greatest statesmen of the age a shaper of destiny and all the rest of it he got to his feet for me though when i looked down my nose at himi like to think back on that and it is queer to consider that but for me the course of history in europe might have been very differentthough whos to know bismarck lola rudi irma and ithe threads come together and then run very wide and are all gathered together again and go into the dark in the end you see i can be philosophicalim still here i wasnt feeling so philosophical though when i journeyed back from munich to london and arrived home at last soaked and shivering with weariness and our damned march weather i seem to have come home to that front door so many timescovered with glory once or twice and other times limping along with my boots letting in this was one of the unhappier homecomings and it wasnt improved by the fact that when i was let into the hall my dear fatherinlaw old morrison was just coming downstairs that was almost the last strawmy bloody scotch relatives were still on the premises when i had hoped that they might have gone back to their gloomy sewer in renfrew the only bright spot i had been able to see was that i would be able to celebrate my return in bed with elspeth and here was this curmudgeon welcoming me in true celtic style huh says he its you youre hame and he muttered something about another mouth to feed i gripped my temper as i gave my coat to oswald bade him good afternoon and asked if elspeth was at home oh aye says he looking me over sourly shell be glad tae see ye nae doot yere thinner he added with some satisfaction i take it germany didnae agree wi yeif thats where yeve been yes its where ive been says i wheres elspeth oh in the drawinroomtakin tea wi her friends i suppose we have all the fashionable habits in this hooseincludin your ain faithers intemperance hes well again i asked and oswald informed me that he was upstairs lying down his accustomed position says old morrison weel yed better go up sir and be reunited wi the wife yell have been yearning for if ye make haste yell be in time for tea from her fine new silver serviceaye a the luxuries o the saltmarket and to the sound of his whining i ran upstairs and into the drawingrooni feeling that tightness in my chest that i always felt when i was coming back again to elspeth she gave a little cry at the sight of me and rose smiling from behind the tray from which she had been dispensing tea to the females who were sitting about all bonnets and gentility she looked radiantly stupid as ever with her blonde hair done a different way in ringlets that framed her cheeks oh harry she came forward and stopped whyharry whatever have you done to your head i should have expected that of course and kept my hat on or worn a wig or anything to prevent the repetition of that damfool question oh well i was home again and in one piece and elspeth was holding out her hands and smiling and asking what did you bring me from germany harry appendix i the prisoner of zenda whether flashmans reallife experiences in germany provided anthony hope with the basis of his famous romance the prisoner of zenda is a matter which readers must decide for themselves flashman is quite definite in the text in two placesespecially where he refers to hawkins which was hopes real name there is certainly some similarity in events and names like lauengram kraftstein detchard de gautet bersonin and tarlenheim are common to both stories flashmans major sapten is literary twin brother to hopes colonel sapt and no amateur of romantic fiction will fail to identify ruth von starnberg with the count of hentzau appendix ii lola montez although several of the notes following this appendix refer to lola montez she deserves fuller mention than can be conveniently included there she was after all one of the most remarkable adventuresses in history with an intellect and personality to match her looks for these gifts rather than her capacity for scandalous behaviour she is worth remembering her real name was marie dolores eliza rosanna gilbert and she was born in limerick in the daughter of a british army officer he was probably scottish her mother was partspanish and lola was brought up in india in scotland and on the continent when she was she ran off with a captain james and after living in india returned to england in she seems to have begun on her long succession of lovers while still in her teens and james divorced her in her career as a spanish dancer followed and after a series of continental appearances lovers and scandals she became the mistress of ludwig of bavaria it has been suggested that his interest in her was purely intellectual that is a matter of opinion what is not to be doubted is that she was the ruler of bavariaand there have been worse governors of nationsuntil the revolution of forced her to leave the country she later went to america where she lectured on such subjects as beauty and fashion and died in new york in when she was only apart from captain james she had two other husbands a young officer named heald who died and a san francisco editor patrick hall who divorced her this is the briefest outline of her short life there is no room to include all the lovers real and reputed or the endless catalogue of scandals scenes escapes and triumphs these can be found in her biographies of which the magnificent montez by horace wyndham is particularly recommended flashmans account of lolas behaviour and his assessment of her character seem both authentic and fair his enthusiasm for her looks and personality were generally shared there is ample evidence of her promiscuity her optimistic cheerfulness her sudden furious rages and her tendency to physical violencethe men she horsewhipped included a berlin policeman the boots of a munich hotel and the editor of the ballarat times australia but none of her contemporaries has left such an intimate portrait of her as flashman has or come closer to explaining the magnetism she exerted and in spite of his conduct towards her he obviously respected her deeply notes the minor st james club may have been new to flashman in but it was notorious to fashionable london its proprietor a mr bond was successfully sued in that year by a disgruntled punter who received ј in respect of his losses mr wilsons performances were a great success all over england especially with exiled scots like mrs flashman his repertoire included a nicht wi burns and a lecture on the rebellion as well as popular songs he died during a tour of the united states horsedrawn omnibuses had been running in london since flashman was a small boy possibly he is referring to a new service their con ductors or cads had a reputation for violence and obscenity which lingers in the word to this day raiding of gamblinghells was common after the police act of which permitted forced entry flashmans observations on the proprietors precautions and their right to sue the police are accurate hughes passing reference to speedicut certainly brackets him with flashman and can therefore be taken to be highly uncomplimentary flashman shows him in a new light which prompts the thought that speedicut may have been one of the anonymous companions in tom brown who spared the fags in the blankettossing episode and was later in favour of only partially roasting tom before the fire the barbed wire comparison must have occurred to flashman at some later date it was not in common use before the s nick ward claimed the championship of england after beating deaf james burke in september and ben caunt in february he lost a return bout with caunt three months later the second marquis of conyngham was among the victims fleeced at mr bonds minor club he lost at least ј on two occasions in flashmans description of bismarck evokes a different picture from the popular impression of the iron chancellor but it tallies with those details of his early life which biographers seldom dwell on at length bismarcks taste for playful violence his boorish conduct in public places his whoring carousing and riotous behaviour and his duels in his first term at gцttingen all testify to a nature not invariably statesmanlike he appears in fact to have been an unpleasant young man brilliant beyond his years but given to cynicism and arrogance he was as tall strong and handsome as flashman remembers him with blondred hair and an aristocratic bearing as to his presence in london in he did indeed travel extensively in britain that year and was rebuked for whistling in the streets of leith on a sunday he is said to have liked the british his affection encompassed at least one beautiful english girl laura russell with whom he had been infatuated some years earlier but who had broken their engagement to marry an older man possibly this prejudiced him in later life peels introduction in of an income tax of d in the pound on all incomes above ј was regarded as iniquitous lord brougham argued that such a tax ought on no account to form a part of the ordinary revenue but should cease with the necessity which alone could justify its imposition bismarck was accounted something of a wit and like most wits he seems to have had a habit of repeating himself his remark that a gift for languages was a fine talent for a headwaiter is also recorded in prince von bсlows memoirs where it is suggested that bismarck was in the habit of using it on linguisticallygifted young diplomats john gully mp was one of the most popular and respected champions of the bareknuckle ring the son of a bath butcher he conducted his fathers business so unsuccessfully that he was imprisoned for debt but while in the kings bench in he was visited by an acquaintance henry game chicken pearce then champion of england in a friendly spar with the champion in the jail gully was so impressive that sporting patrons paid his debts and he met pearce for the title at hailsham sussex a fortnight before trafalgar before a huge crowd which included beau brummel and the duke of clarence pearce narrowly beat gully over rounds it has since been suggested that gully outfought the champion but was reluctant to knock out his benefactor this seems unlikely however gully won the title two years later with decisive victories over bob gregson the lancashire giant and then retired aged only he made a fortune on the turf where he owned several classic winners and by investments in coal and land he was mp for pontefract from to was twice married and had children flashmans portrait of gully accords with other contemporary accounts of the gentle quiet sixfooter who when roused was one of the most savage and scientific fighters of boxings golden age at heart says nat fleischer his ambition was to belong to the gentry he had little use for the professional ring and its shady followers fleischer is probably right when he suggests that but for chance gully would never have become a pugilist at all flashmans reference to a horse called running reins is most interesting in may a year and a half after the party at percevals place the derby was won by a horse entered as running rein it proved upon inquiry to be a fouryearold named maccabeus and was disqualified but not before the scandal had developed into a court case and become the talk of the sporting world the principal villain in the case abraham levi goodman fled the country the horse maccabeus disappeared but there certainly was a genuine running rein whose performances in the season had given rise to suspicion flashmans mention seems to suggest that running rein had a reputation earlier still although not an unsavoury one turf records of the day contain no mention of running ribbons however so spottswood was probably doing gully no great favour in offering to sell him john l sullivan won the first recognised world heavyweight title when he knocked out paddy ryan in nine rounds at mississippi city on feb it is reported that the spectators included henry ward beecher the rev t de witt talmage and jesse james gents and mooners in the s the term gent was most particularly applied to the young middleclass idler who aped his superiors and dressed extravagantly the mooner was rather older and spent his time mooning at shop windows and ambling gently about the town flashman would consider both species to be well beneath him despite flashmans enthusiastic notice it seems probable that lola montez was not a particularly good artiste although the historian veit valentin observes that she had the tigerish vivacity that inspires the andalusian dance the account of lolas disastrous appearance at her majestys theatre is splendidly accurate not only in its description of lord ranelaghs denunciation but even in such details as the composition of the audience and the programme notes this is a good verifiable example of flashmans ability as a straight reporter and encourages confidence in those other parts of his story where corroboration is lacking and checking of the facts is impossible lola had a passionate affair with liszt in the year following her departure from london after their first rapture she appears to have had much the same effect on the famous pianist as she did on flash man he tired of her and did indeed abandon her in a hotel whereupon she spent several hours smashing the furniture typically lola bore no grudge in her high days in munich she wrote to liszt offering him bavarian honours the coatofarms of the countess of landsfeld is accurately described the fat whale was a silver dolphin stielers portrait of lola in ludwigs gallery is a model of victorian respectability a more characteristic montez is to be seen in dartiguenaves lithograph he has caught not only her striking beauty but her imperious spirit ee mr barbosas rendering of stielers portrait of lola on the left side of the front cover of this eclitionl lola was always vain of her bosom she was indeed if the story of her first meeting with ludwig is to be believed he is supposed to have expressed doubts about the reality of her figure her indignant reply was to tear open the top of her dress there is no supporting evidence that wagner visited lola in munich at this time but it is not impossible they met for the first time in when liszt took her to a special performance of rienzi at dresden and wagners impression was of a painted and jewelled woman with bold bad eyes he also described her as demonic and heartless curiously the great composer gained as much favour from ludwig ii as lola had done from ludwig iso much so that the wits nicknamed him lolotte the american may have been c g leland a student at munich university and a friend of lolas he claimed that he was the only one of her intimates at whom she had never thrown a plate or a book or attacked with a dagger poker broom or other deadly weapon schцnhausen flashmans view of the castles medieval ghastliness was echoed by bisinarck himself he described it to a friend as an old haunted castle with pointed arches and wails four feet thick thirty rooms of which two are furnished he also complained about its rats and the wind in the chimneys flashmans summary of the schleswigholstein question is accurate so far as it goes enthusiasts in diplomatic history who wish greater detail are referred to dr david thomsons europe since napoleon pp and german and danish versions of the problem should not be read in isolation the schlager play of the german students whereby they could receive superficial head and face wounds which left permanent scars for public admiration was a unique form of the duel the equipment is as flashman describes it the schlager itself was threeandahalf feet long with an unusually large guard the practice of leaving the wounds open to form the largest possible scar is curiously paralleled by the custom of certain primitive african tribes in the duel itself thrusting was strictly forbidden except at the university of jena where there were many theological students these young men would have found facial scars an embarrassment in their careers so instead of cutting at the head jena students were allowed to run each other through the body thus satisfying honour without causing visible disfigurement bismarck liked to picture himself eventually becoming a rustic landowner his remark about stettin wool market occurs again in his recorded conversation when he spoke of his ambition to raise a family and ruin the morals of my peasants with brandy bandobast organisation in germany suffered its second successive failure of the potato crop in the northern areas wheat had doubled its price in a few years the emblem of holstein was in fact a nettleleaf shape a plumed helmet а la tinbellies flashman is here almost certainly referring to the new regulation helmet which had been announced for the british heavy dragoons in the previous autumn its ridiculously extravagant plumagepopularly supposed to be an inspiration of prince albertshad been the talk of fashionable london in the weeks shortly before flashmans departure for munich libby prison in richmond va was notorious in the us civil war federal officers were confined there by the confederates often in conditions of dreadful overcrowding it was the scene of a mass escape by tunnel in and two subsequent federal cavalry raids to rescue prisoners flashmans reference seems to suggest that he was confined there himself no doubt examination of those packets of his papers as yet unopened will confirm this kibrothhattaavahthere they buried the people that lusted seems to have been a popular subject for sermons at public schools dr rowlands preached on this text in eric or little by little by dean farrar it is just possible that the orator was karl marx the strackenzian coronation must have taken place before his recorded return to germany from brussels where he had conceived the communist manifesto but it is not inconceivable that he visited strackenz beforehand the coronation certainly offered a tempting target at a time when european politics generally were in a precarious state against the fact that there is no evidence of his ever having visited the duchy must be balanced flashmans description of the orator which is marx to the life eider danes a faction who wished to make schleswig danish as far as the river eider von starnbergs concern about prodanish militant organisations in strackenz is understandable as is his anxiety over hansens unexpected appearance at the wedding what struck the editor as curious was that none of bismarcks conspirators seem ever to have been alarmed at the prospect of danish royalty attending the ceremony that surely would have led to flashmans exposure but obviously none did attend and this can only be explained by the fact that king christian of denmark died on january shortly before the wedding took placeand that this kept the danish court at home in mourning a rare stroke of luck for the conspiracy one does not like to think it was anything else punch stayed neutral in the checkedorstriped trousers controversy one of its cartoons suggested that checks are uncommon superior but stripes is most nobby but it was a middle rather than an upperclass debate flashman believes he sang the old nursery rhyme in english yet it is interesting to note that it appeared in german apparently for the first time in that language in the year in which he and the duchess irma were married possibly she had noticed after all domenico angelo tremamondo known as angelo founded a
