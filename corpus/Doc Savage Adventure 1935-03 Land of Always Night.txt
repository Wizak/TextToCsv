 chapter the butterfly death it is somewhat ridiculous to say that a human hand can resemble a butterfly yet this particular hand did attain that similarity probably it was the way it moved hovered moved again with something about it that was remindful of a slowmotion picture being shown on a screen the color had something to do with the impression the hand was white unnatural it might have been fashioned of motherofpearl there was something serpentine hideous about the way it strayed and hovered yet was never still it made one think of a venomous white moth it made beery hosner think of death only the expression on beery hosmers face told that for be was not saying anything but he was trying to his lips shaped word syllables and the muscle strings in his scrawny throat jerked but no sounds came out the horrible white hand floated up toward beery hosmers face the side street was gloomy deserted except for beery hosner and the man with the uncanny hand the hand stood out in the murk almost as if it were a thing of white paper with a light inside beery hosner went through a convulsion of fright beery was a rather unusual fellow he was a crook who looked the part at best he was rather a sickening specimen and now his aspect was doubly unwholesome he managed to pump words out naw naw dont he choked i dunno where it is so help me i dont the other man made no answer his fantastic white hand the other one never moved as if it were dead was not his only unusual characteristic his eyes were unnaturally huge and so very pale as to be almost the color of water and he had a thin face a thin body when occasional distant automobile headlights caused him to cast a shadow the shadow was skeletonthin beery hosmer broke out in gibberish i dont know he gulped i wouldnt kid you i dont know anything about it the other mans white hand kept moving where is it he asked his voice was utterly flat it held the mechanical quality found in the speech of persons so deaf that they can hardly hear themselves talk beery hosmer tried to back away he was already pressed against the darkened window of a candy store wouldnt i tell you if i knew he whimpered lookit ool the hand of the man called ool seemed to move a little slower you have it he said tonelessly you were on your way to endeavor to sell it to this man doc savage it is in the money belt which you carry around your waist beery made choking sounds he was almost sobbing take it easy he blubbered we can fix this tip gimme time lemme think you said ool will have all infinity in which to think the white hand darted there was no slowmotion effect this time no onlooker could have told whether or not the hand actually touched beery hosner all of the pentup terror of the last few moments burst from beery hosmers slack lips in one animal scream he wrenched violently backward head shoulders and elbows rammed into the plate glass of the candy store the window collapsed glass crashed to the cement walk with a jangle beery seemed to be trying to get a gun out of an armpit holster but he thrashed about like one suddenly stricken mad he kicked trays of chocolates and mints out on the sidewalk great shudders began to course over his scrawny body but did not persist for long because he gave a vast wheezing sigh and slumped over becoming as inert as the chocolate creams crushed beneath him ool leaned into the window his left hand remained at his side as if lifeless his right hand drifted to beery hosmers shirt wrenched two buttons flew and clicked far out in the street then chamois of a money belt tore with a rotten sound the object which ool brought into view resembled a pair of goggles more than anything else but as goggles they were peculiar for the lenses were as large as small condensed milk cans and their glass the stuff did not look like true glass was almost jet black one thing was striking the workmanship was exquisite ool put the goggles on and they contrasted grotesquely with his chalky face then he made a disgusted sound took them off hurriedly and pocketed them a psychologist would have called the little incident strange it was as if the donning of the goggles had been an instinctive action there was nothing hurried about the mans movements he reached down picked up a chocolate tasted it and smacked lips then he took off his hat and scooped chocolates into it until it was nearly full walking away he ate the candy avidly as if it were some exquisite delicacy with which he had just become acquainted at the corner ool passed under a streetlight and a peculiarity about his hair became apparent it was lttle more than a golden down like the fine fur on a mouse one man saw ool go under the streetlight the man was a janitor in a nearby building it was inevitable that the breaking glass should have attracted attention and within a few moments a uniformed policeman came running he stood looking at the candy strewn over the walk at first not noticing the human form in the window then he saw it swore and leaned in to make an examination when he backed away he looked puzzled guy mustve had a fit fell in the window and died he muttered that was the story the next editions of the newspapers carried after a medical examiner had expressed the tentative opinion that death was due to natural causes moreover there had been over a thousand dollars in the chamois money belt and since this was intact it did not seem that the motive was robbery it was some hours before the police got a different slant on the story it required that long for the janitor who had seen ool go under the streetlight to make up his mind the janitor was a timid soul his story created quite a furor when he decided to talk the janitor had seen the whole thing chapter plans earl maurice watches bowen stood in his modernistic park avenue apartment and poured eightyyearold napoleon brandy into a fragile glass tested its bouquet long and pleasurably then took a sip and blotted his lips with a silk handkerchief he was a big man with some surplus around the waist his dress was immaculate his manner suave he did not look the part of one of the smoothest crooks in the big time watches bowen leaned back in the exquisitely moulded chair and absently fingered the thin yellow gold chain which connected the two lower pockets of his vest there was a watch on either end of the chain there was a jeweled timepiece on each of his slightly thick wrists watches bowen had two loves one was his watches of which he always carried four or more and kept them perfectly in time the other love was his napoleon brandy it was possible also that he might be considered to have a third affection his liking for other peoples money watches said and so beery hosner is dead ool sat a dozen feet away on another delicately modernistic chair his hat held on his knees from time to time his pearlcolored right hand drifted into the hat and transferred a chocolate cream to his forbidding slit of a mouth the hat was almost empty but he still ate avidly ool swallowed nodded that is what i came here to tell you unfortunate very unfortunate watches said dryly what happened to the damned fool ool removed a chocolate from the hat and eyed it lovingly these are delicious he said what do you call them candy said watches chocolate creams what about beery ool ate the chocolate with much smacking of lips no one will trace me here he said i am sure of that watches looked acted as if he had been slapped he had idly detached one of the watches from the gold chain and it all but slipped from his fingers his mouth sagged roundly open you he exploded you got beery these chocolate creams as you call them i must have more of them ool said tonelessly yes i killed beery watches bowen sagged back reached for the brandy and did something which was very rare for him he drank a slug without sampling its bouquet whew he muttered and you sit there gobbling down candy oh i know youre only about half human but my people had a civilization greater than yours some thousands of years ago ool said for the first time there was some slight feeling in his voice all right all right watches spread his hands we wont go into that would you mind telling me why particularly you decided to scratch beery off he knew our plans ool said watches scowled now look here if youre gonna start bumping beery hosner knew our plans and he was greedy ool stated interrupting he thought he saw a way to gather unto himself much money this begins to make sense watches grunted what was beery up to the device which you call my goggles ool paused yeah beery stole them said ool the hell watches polished the back of the timepiece he was holding but how in the devil did he plan to make a buck from that he knew how things stack up he knew he knew there was one man in your united states who might make use of the goggles ool interposed watches shook his head slowly i dont get this who was beery going to ool evidently knew something of dramatic effects he allowed just the proper pause before answering doc savage he said what had some one shot him unexpectedly watches might have been more surprised but only slightly more so he whipped to his feet he did something he had not done in years he dropped one of his watches the one he was fingering at the moment and after his one blasting exclamation he tried to speak and the words stuck somewhere down in his chest ool ate chocolate peacefully electric lights were on in the apartment and under their glow several points about the man were noticeable which would have escaped casual ob servation his white skin was given the motherofpearl appearance by an interlacing of fine blue veins it somehow had the aspect of a tropical flower doomed to live its life among venomous insects and more venomous serpents cut off from the sun in the depths of some swamp with a perceptibly shaking hand watches poured himself a hooker of the napoleon brandy downed it once more without sampling its aroma and flavor the rare liquor seemed to open a channel for his words did beery get to doc savage he asked hoarsely no said ool watches let out a gusty sigh of relief thats a break for us he said fervently im telling you that id rather fight the united states army than this doc savage a guy can at least run from the army this doc savage must be a remarkable individual ool said his dead voice making it seem that he had no interest in the matter remarkable is putting it mild watches snorted that bird savage is a wizard they say he knows all about electricity and chemistry and psychology and engineering and them things they say hes a mental marvel on top of that hes supposed to be able to bend horseshoes in his hands and things like that dangerous ool murmured you mean to guys like us countered watches exactly poison watches said vehemently doc savage makes a profession of mixing up in unusual things hes what the newspapers call a bigtime adventurer hes supposed to travel around over the world helping people out of trouble and punishing wrongdoers that hardly applies to us said ool oh yeah watches grinned wryly from what ive heard this thing is right up doc savages alley ool said nothing he took the last chocolate out of his hat ate it licked his fingers shook a few chocolate crumbs out in his hand ate them then stood up you will get me more of those chocolate creams he said watches scowled as if he resented being given an order then said hastily sure sure ool went to one of the large windows and looked out upon the amazing display of lights which is new york city after nightfall watches bowen asked curiously how did you kill beery i merely looked at him said ool and he dropped dead k watches growled if thats the way you feel about it ool was looking steadily through the window his head back as if he were eying the sky rather than the lights how are our plans progressing he asked rotten said watches what do you mean ool asked not turning ive canvassed all of the big airplane factories watches explained they can build us a true gyroplane sure this true gyro will rise straight up and hover it can be controlled fairly well but heres the rub the damn things wont carry more than two men and they wont lift hardly any fuel at all the things are still in the experimental stage then you think we are doomed to failure ool asked he was still peering steadily at the sky were stumped watches said he looked at the other curiously say whatre you looking at come here ool lifted an arm look watches bowen came over and stared out of the window not at the lights but at the black abyss of the sky a moment later he saw that which ool was indicatinga short string of lights suspended in the heavens he watched these and they came closer and it became apparent that the lights were strings of luminous letters it was an advertisement a flexible electric sign pulled behind a small dirigible watches snorted the thing was a common sight over new york city what the hell he sniffed an idea that i have ool said mechanically idea which may enable us to quickly consummate our plans ool said we will make use of this doc savage watches wet his lips shuddered dont crack wise you think i am joking ool asked either that or youre crazy ool turned away from the window i know a great deal of this doc savage i have studied him i know his characteristics and the characteristics of the five men who aid him i even know that each of those five men is a specialist in some line one is a chemist one an electrical engineer one a lawyer another a civil engineer and the fifth a geologist and archaeologist i know what mechanical equipment doc savage uses i know watches gulped a minute ago you acted as if you didnt know much about the guy i wanted to see if you were afraid of him ool said i am afraid of him watches snapped im not ashamed of it either no man in his right sense will buck doc savage nevertheless ool murmured emotionlessly we are going to use him watches all but yelled dont i tell you that doc savage and his five helpers are poison we can find some way without mixing with them but ool wheeled and stalked out of the apartment half an hour later ool was on the hudson river in a small rowboat he had the oarlocks muffled with rags and the only sound penetrating the darkness was the occasional slap of a wave against the side of his boat these small noises did not matter being lost in the rhythmic lappings of waves among the pilings of the piers along the nearby water front ool peered intently into the darkness it was very black yet the man with the strange motherofpearl complexion seemed to have some slight ability to see in the darkness for he soon pulled in toward one particular pier this pier was roofed over and it bulked large in the darkness across the outer end after the fashion of piers a name was lettered hidalgo trading company most of the building was smokestained oldlooking but there was a part a higher addition to one side which was obviously quite new the end of this was closed with enormous doors ool pulled his rowboat close to the pier warehouse and made the painter fast to a piling for an instant he stood looking up out of his flat watercolored eyes at the blackly looming hulk of the structure then he grasped the nearest piling he did not look like a strong man yet he shinned up the smooth timber with squirrel agility and reaching the top of the piling he continued his ascent up the warehouse wall employing a steel girder a number of which formed the outer structure of the wall a moment later he squirmed over the top of the hangar he listened for a time there was no sound except small water noises ool crept forward making for a large ventilator he rounded this then things happened a squat bulky form hurtled from behind the ventilator tremendous arms enwrapped ool in a grip that forced air from his lung with a sharp roar the stocky attacker wedged a head under ools chin and ools stringy neck was bent until it creaked ool tried desperately to bring his right hand into play but it was pinned to his side he lifted his feet in an attempt to overbalance his assailant the apish attacker did not upset ools motherofpearl face began to take on a purplish hue he was entirely helpless chapter the man who was not human a flashlight spiked a white beam out of the darkness and another man came from behind the ventilator you do have your moments eh monk he asked frisk im ham grunted the apish man who had seized ool see if hes got a gun the newcomer ham placed his flashlight on the roof then stepped forward to search ool this put him in the flash glow he was lean of about average height and attired in remarkably dapper fashion he carried a slender black cane ool stared at him brigadier general theodore marley brooks he said emotionlessly ham did not look surprised courtroom training had taught him that for ham was one of the most astute lawyers ever to be matriculated from harvard he was also by way of being the male fashion plate for new york city his other and major claim to distinction was that he was a member of doc savages group of five remarkable aides ham tucked the cane under an arm and began searching ool hurry up you overdressed shyster monk grunted monk had a small childlike voice ool tried to move his right arm monk put on pressure a faint strangely piteous cry came from ools lips and he subsided monks strength was fabulous monk had other abilities too although a stranger would not have dreamed it after one look at his bullet of a head there did not seem to be room for even an ample spoonful of brains above monks eyebrow line yet as lieutenant colonel andrew blodgett mayfair he was among the half dozen greatest living chemists monk was also a member of doc savages group of five aides ool revived slightly and spoke his voice weaker but still retaining its mechanical quality how did you discover me he asked monk grinned the grin had the effect of making his incredibly homely face very pleasant to look at a bird cant light on this building without us knowing it he said boy you should see our alarm system i see ool said i should have thought of photoelectric eyes and magnetic fields ham conducting his search leisurely said the man seems to know something of electricity will you hurry up you fashion plate monk requested ool lifted his left foot and stamped with all of his might on monks toes and instep monk bellowed he liked to yell at the top of his voice when he was getting hurt he released ool suddenly ool so unexpectedly released staggered monk swung a fist ool had no time to dodge the fist hit him and he slammed down on the roof almost instantly he sat up but did not try to get to his feet blazes monk grunted hes tough when i hit a guy like that he generally sleeps ham studied ools face ham had withdrawn a pace and tugged his black cane apart near the handle disclosing that it was in reality a sword cane with a long thin blade he is a strange one ham said wonderingly look at those eyes and that mousefur hair on his head and the color of his skin say hes almost as funnylooking as you monk scowled at ham ool chose that instant to lunge and his right hand drifted out with a moccasin speed monk jumped only his agility fabulous for one of such bulk saved him watch it ham yelled hes got something in that right hand youre telling me monk circled warily ool was up on all fours now he scuttled backward spider fashion ham circling swiftly menaced the pale man with the tip of his sword cane ool staring at the cane saw that the tip was coated for some inches with a stickylooking substance poison he asked his voice was still utterly flat ham startled by the calmness of the question started to say something then reconsidered and was silent shut up he snapped show us the inside of that hand ool hesitated then he turned the hand over and both monk and ham bent over to examine it there was nothing in ools hand you search him ham told monk if he gets funny again ill tickle his ribs in a way he wont like while ham threatened with the sword cane monk went through ools pockets nothing monk said disgustedly no gun no knife wait a minute whats this he pulled the strange goggles out of ools pocket and held them up to get better light on them ool stared blankly but his right hand held high above his head started wavering like a butterflys feeble fluttering when it feels the first warm rays of the morning sun on its wings monk pressed the goggles to his eyes cant see through em he growled then addressed ool what are these things ool did not answer his right hand kept up its weird shifting monk pocketed the goggles what did you come here for he asked ool ool said nothing but his right hand continued its butterfly fluttering ham watched the motion frowned then pressed the point of his sword against ools ribs the chalkfaced assassin quieted his hand and kept it motionless well take him to doc ham said in the center of new york city the skyscrapers jut up like silver pines each seemingly striving to overshadow the other but there is one building taller and finer than all the rest an astounding mass of polished granite and stainless steel towering nearly a hundred stories into the sky a structure that is possibly mans proudest building triumph the entire eightysixth floor of this building was occupied by the man whose name was lettered in modest bronze on a door clark savage jr monk and ham took their captive to doc savages headquarters by way of docs private speed elevator a lift especially designed by doc one which swooped the eightysix stories in about the time it took an ordinary express elevator to rise half a dozen floors almost invariably a man riding in the speed elevator for the first time was forced to his knees by the shock of starting monk and ham watched ool amusedly when the elevator started but ools knees gave slightly and that was all at no time was he in danger of losing his balance i told you he was tough monk grinned and funnylooking ham reminded funnier looking than you monk ceased grinning listen shyster one of these days im gonna make you put on a swordswallowing act with that trick cane the pair glared at each other the rest of the way up a stranger from their manner would have thought they were on the point of coming to blows when as a matter of truth they were the best of friends they stepped out on the eightysixth floor crossed the corridor and passed into a large room plentifully furnished with huge comfortable chairs a deeppiled oriental rug lay underfoot between the two great windows stood a solidlooking table inlaid with ivory of exquisite workmanship a shortwave radio receiving set squatted inconspicuously at the back of the table and a voice was droning from the loudspeaker as the men entered with their captive it was a police broadcast all cars will be on the lookout for dimiter daikoff the radio droned daikoff is a very large man with black hair and dark eyes officers will use care since daikoff is reported to be dangerous daikoff recently escaped from a chicago jail and is reported to have been seen in new york monk raised his voice over the drone of the radio doc he yelled we found a guy on top of the waterfront plane hangar thought youd want to talk to him he mustve been up to something doc savage came through a door into the room perhaps the reaction of ool to the appearance of doc savage was the thing which best indicated what a remarkable physical specimen the bronze man presented ool who had murdered a man that evening without showing the slightest excitement stared and let his jaw down slightly his watercolored eyes became quite wide doc savage was a giant of bronze as he came through the door his stature was tremendous but when he was beyond the door and there was nothing by which to compare his size he seemed to grow smaller in stature that was because of the symmetry of his development his corded muscles meshed under his skin in a manner which made their tremendous size scarcely noticeable except for the tendons on his hands which were like cables but the compelling thing about the bronze man was his eyes strange eyes they were like pools of flakegold hypnotically compelling in their power stirred continuously with a weird life doc savage was quietly dressed the bronze of his hair was but little darker than the bronze of his skin whats this he asked the bronze man had a voice of remarkable modulation and his tone while not loud carried to the corners of the room monk explained what had happened the photoelectric alarms on the roof gave the guy away he said then he went on to tell of the capture of the weird way in which ool moved his handthe hand in which they had found nothing he finished up by producing the goggles with the black lenses as thick as condensed milk cans the bronze man eyed the goggles closely there came into existence an eerie trilling sound it welled up and pervaded the room tuneful yet tuneless mellow and so soft that it might have been the whispering note of an evening wind seeping through palm fronds or the distant murmur of glacial ice on its ponderous way to the sea monk and ham watched curiously they knew that sound it was part of doc savage although they could not see his lips move as he made it the note was a small unconscious thing which he did in moments of stress or when surprised or puzzled doc savage asked ool what are these ool replied promptly tonelessly just a toy he said they are of no value no importance there was nothing in his voice to show that be had killed beery hosner earlier in the night because beery had taken the strange goggles with the intention of selling them to this same remarkable bronze man doc savage watched ool intently why were you prowling over our waterfront hangar he asked ool smiled it was the smile of a man not accustomed to showing emotion in that manner the smile was slightly horrible i went to the hangar for the purpose of contacting you ool said why did you not come to me here the bronze man asked you are a busy mani know your reputationi despaired of being granted an interview ool spoke by spurts the interview was an urgent matter tremendously urgent so you went prowling about the hangar knowing it would be guarded knowing you would be captured and brought to me precisely monk blurted bunk this lug was up to something doc turned the curious goggles over slowly in his cabled hands again came his low trilling sound more felt than heard flooding the room with its tremulous quality police broadcast continued to issue from the shortwave set flooding the room with droning calling all cars calling all cars then the announcement concerning the chicago criminal came through again dimiter daikoff wanted for murder a big man walks with a limp black hair small dark eyes a scar that starts from the lobe of his right ear and slants across his neck doc savages compelling voice broke in upon the radio droning who are you he questioned ool gray forestay is my name ool said promptly in mongolia my name as nearly as can be translated was lleigh foor saath doc savages features remained undecipherable but the flakegold which seemed always alive in his eyes swirled a bit faster monk muttered the yahoo is lying doc ool kept his flateyed stare centered upon doc i am not lying he said you are judging from my appearance that i am not a pure mongol you are correct i am only part chinese he paused my unnatural appearance is not entirely the result of a mixture of bloods it is the result of hardships more grueling than you would believe a man could endure and live go on doc said ool spoke monotonously i hesitate to speak lest i be disbelieved and yet i know you to be a man of such mature intellect as to realize that there are strange things in the world things so strange as to be utterly discredited by the conventional mind ool paused again after fully half a minute he continued you have heard of the lenderthorn expedition lost in the pack ice north of canada i gray forestay was the only member of the expedition to escape in recent months as perhaps you have read in the news i headed a rescue expedition to search for the lost men we found that airships were utterly impractical in that region we could not effect a landing upon the rough ice but where an airship has failed a dirigible would succeed so you have a dirigible that is one reason why i have come to you there is also another reason and this other reason doc queried you control so i understand what is perhaps the most superior aggregation of brains and brawn in the world i need your help monk squinted at doc is this dope about a lenderthorn expedition straight stuff it is doc nodded slowly it was in the newspapers but not prominently so lenderthorn was not a famous man ool spoke suddenly dramatically the lenderthorn expedition was not lost through natural causes as was reported ool stared with his flat watercolored eyes while he let an interval of silence pass we encountered what i can only call mysterious things he went on these came in the night and i know only that they were black shapeless and utterly horrible and that they carried off members of our expedition one at a time until only i escaped chapter the moccasin death ool paused after making his unusual proclamation and eyed doc savage and his two aides as if endeavoring to learn how they took it monk and ham registered an admixture of doubt and surprise doc savages regular bronze features portrayed no emotion at all on the inlaid table the radio droned on and on the police announcer reciting descriptions of stolen cars of lost persons of petty crimes and emergency calls emergency call to all cars the loudspeaker droned unexpectedly pickup order for a tall slender man with very pale skin man wanted for the murder of beery hosner a man with a police record killers most pronounced characteristic is his short very fine hair which looks from a distance somewhat like the fur on a mole man was wearing dark suit and dark hat and monk watching ool intently breathed blazes in soft comprehension ool began to sidle toward the door doc savage ripped out a few words in a softly musical but unintelligible jargona language known only to himself and his aides it was the language of ancient maya the speech of a civilization which had supposedly vanished from the earth centuries ago doc and his men used the tongue to communicate orders monk and ham reacting to the order in mayan rushed on ool things happened quickly one moment ool was under their finger tips it seemed impossible that they could miss seizing him but the next instant ool eluded them his speed blinding and monk and ham found themselves clutching each other you dumb fashion plate monk choked ape ham retorted jerking around docs aides charged ool again carefully this time with grim purpose doc was barring the door that guy is greased lightning monk muttered ool made a snarling sound and advanced on them his right hand was weaving about in its peculiar weird fashion look out doc called sharply get back monk and ham retreated but in uncanny fashion ool was within striking distance of them his weird right hand floated out there was no dilatory butterfly flutter about the motion this time straight at ham the hand drove the hand was bent at the wrist the bony fingers extended then suddenly ool was off his feet falling to the floor doc savage had whipped out a foot to kick hard against the side of ools leg ool should have been stunned by the shock as he struck the floor but the whitefaced murderer bounced up immediately his moccasinlike hand drifted out viciously monk get clear doc savages voice was a crack of authority monk hurled his simian bulk to one side ools hand went short the hand jerked back it was like a snakes head recoiling it struck again at ham ham doc savage rapped dont let him touch you ham dropping to the floor evaded the hand he rolled to one side got his feet under him whipped upright ool glared at them the goggles he said flatly throw me the black goggles or i will kill you all doc savage spoke in mayan his hands went into his pocket came out and were clasped behind him he took a single step backward after that he stood still a surprising thing happened the long skeletal frame of ool went down like a bag of bones collapsing his fiat eyes blinked shut the gaunt head flopped forward on its stringy neck the legs bent at the knees and be lay as still as if in death doc turned walked over and hoisted a window for a space of about forty seconds neither he nor his aides said anything but simply stood and regarded each other monk went over and with a foot reached out exploringly and stirred a few fine particles of glass on the floor where doc savage had been standing when ool went down there were crystal glinting particles such as might have been made by the shattering of a very small electric light bulb doc said all right he as well as monk and ham breathed deeply it became apparent that from the time doc had uttered the words in mayan they had all three been holding their breath as a matter of fact docs words had been a warning to monk and ham that he was going to break a tiny glass anaesthetic bomb on the floor the anaesthetic was one developed by monk disseminating almost instantaneously into the air and powerful enough to produce unconsciousness at the first whiff the gas became ineffective after mixing with fresh air but the effect upon one who had already breathed it would not wear off for some time well thats that ham said he adjusted his necktie and brushed his trousers which had collected dust when he rolled on the floor to elude ools weird right hand monk pawed his own jaw the guy sure wanted that black goggle doodad he had a chance to get away but he wouldnt leave without em doc walked across and stood looking down at ools prostrate form monk and ham pressed close at his side ham remarked in a voice heavy with disbelief yes sir hes even uglier than you are monk i dont know how its possible but he is you clothesrack monk growled you dont know masculine beauty when you see some i exude virility i do im an example of the dominant male as doc leaned over ool that apparently senseless individual became charged with appalling vigor ools knees doubled under him and he sprang furiously to his feet at the same splitsecond his deadly right hand moccasined out toward doc it was something absolutely new to the experience of doc savage and his aides never had a man who had gone down under the spell of the anaesthetic bombs risen so soon a bronze flash doc backed to avoid the mysterious touch of ools motherofpearl fingers he succeeded in hurtling clear and in doing so his corded arms sweeping out thrust monk and ham behind him to temporary safety get in the other room doc ordered monk and ham his flakegold eyes remaining fixed on the crouching ool aw doc monk started a protest get in there and shut the door doc repeated and when his aides did not move fast enough he lunged using both mighty arms to shove them through into the next room he tossed ools strange goggles in after them then he slammed the door behind them inside the other room cut off from doc ham and monk reared to their feet and tried the door the force of their combined bodyjolts shuddered but did not open the chromiumribbed door in its steel frame hes locked us in here monk bellowed hey doc he banged his gnarled fists against the unyielding door hes in there alone ham shouted that whiteskinned mousehaired guy aint human monk roared the anaesthetic gas never even fazed him from the outer room ools flat voice came clearly one man already tonight i have killed for these goggles he intoned now i kill another ham and monk quit pounding numbed momentarily by a fleshcrawling dread followingools pronuncement muffled sounds came under the door feet padded a body thudded a chair overturned then there was a chilling sound unnamable a dry clacking more than anything else ham clutched monk by the arm that sound its that that ghoul laughing yeah monk said thickly yeah the eerie clacking laugh faded away feet pattered the patterings grew quickly fainter the hall door slammed ham and monk commenced furious fistbatterings against their own door doc their voices crashed together doc are you there the only sound now was the interminable police broadcast coming in over the shortwave set the announcer was repeating an earlier broadcast dimiter daikoff murderer escaped from chicago jail believed to be in hiding in manhattan his description a big man walks with a limp a sear slanting downward across his neck from the lobe of his right ear the radio voice crackled on and on while monk and ham endeavored to get out of the room chapter the mysterious murderer sixth avenue by day is a working mans street the children who scamper there between the wheels of automobile traffic the men and women who swarm over its grimy sidewalks give it a degree of friendly warmth but late at night denuded of its human adornments the avenue lies stark and ugly occasional rats haunt its sidewalk garbage cans and another breed of rodent more vicious comes to life in curtaindrawn back rooms ool was the only human figure in sight on the dim street a lean cat dirtyfurred clawscarred and with most of one ear missing leaped down to the sidewalk from a sour smelling garbage can and slunk into shadows at ools approach the cat was hardly more sinister thin ool as the whitefaced assassin moved along through the night with his characteristic animal prowl gaunt head hunched far forward spidery arms dangling he slowed his pace as he came to a spot where a sickly glow of light seeped over the sidewalk from the half curtained windows of a barroom dingy yellow lettering on the window glass proclaimed the place to be bill noonans tavern ool paused long enough at the door to flash covert glances in both directions then entered scuffed through gray sawdust covering the floor and approached the bar a fat negro his head seemingly a hall perched on his multiplicity of chins dozed on a stool near the cash register he opened one redrimmed eye as approached are you hamhock piney ool questioned the negro betrayed no surprise at ools appearance or voice dats right boss he said hamhock piney dats me i want to see watches bowen ool stated the negro yawned cavernously said nothing did you understand me ool snapped couse i understan the negro grinned what you want me to do about itput a fly in your beer ool expressed quick anger as though propelled without volition his right hand started drifting about the negro laughed sleepily said softly all right ah see yo knows de pass sign yo can go on up take dat door in de back go up de only steps yoll see a minute later facing watches bowen in the mobsters topfloor hideout ool said you had better give your watchdogs more explicit instructions concerning me hamhock watches laughed and his thick hand hovered near the gold watch chain which sprawled across his vest hes all right slicker than youd think a man hunched in a nearby chair rattled the pages of a racing form which draped across his lap he was a mouse of a man small he seemed intent on doping out a possible track winner when in reality his ferret eyes never left ool concealed by the form sheet his right hand gripped a flat automatic at an oilclothcovered table on the opposite side of the room three men killed time with cards occasionally they flashed curious glances at ool and watches these men were all young sleek barbershop groomed each smoked and there was a hard calmness in their manner watches jerked his head at ool lets talk private he said the suave mobster moved to the far corner of the room ool following closely ool questioned blankly are you not afraid he might miss me at this distance who the little man in the chair watches bleak eyes slitted and his hand swerved instinctively back to his watch chain you dont miss much do you he grunted not much ool said you do not trust me its not that watches said we were afraid a cop might tag you in i dont take chances who is the man with the racing form and the gun ool asked honey hamilton watches said proudly he can shoot fly specks off a hundredwatt bulb that is an exaggeration a little maybe watches grinned whatve you been up to i have said ool suffered a misfortune didnt i tell you not to monkey with doc savage watches unclipped a timepiece and fumbled it just how had is the situation ool began to speak his voice was like the intonation of a phonograph which possessed no qualities of tone whatever his words were so flat that at times they were hardly understandable he told of his going to the waterfront warehousehanger of his capture of exactly what had happened thereafter this doc savage locked his two men in an inner room in his headquarters he finished the bronze man and i fought for a time he evaded my right hand he pursued me down to the street his speed is almost unbelievable you sure youd have to be good to shake those men who work with savage from the hall behind the closed door sounded the scrape of numerous feet a single fist pounded heavily on the door open up a voice bawled honey hamilton had been stationed at a cleverly concealed loophole in the wall the loophole looked out upon the hallway and was of a size to permit insertion of a gun snout the mouselike little man cupped his hand to his mouth and hissed back to watches its coppers john laws watches mumbled incredulously then wheeled upon ool this is your doing theyve got you tagged for the beery hosner job you let them see you come in here ool shrugged that is impossible then some stool tipped them watches shook his head violently nix no pigeons get a line on me im careful about that how in the devil did they know youre here the pounding on the door continued the hollow metallic quality of the sounds was an indication that the door was in reality an armored panel lets blow honey hamilton suggested uneasily watches nodded and leaped to a side door this gave into a narrow hall which in turn led to a flight of steps angling downward they started to descend these steps shure and you can come rright down said a strong irish voice from below but itd be healthiest if youd throw your guns down first damn watches gritted theyve got the back way blocked now we are in a jam the men retreated to the room and closed both doors honey hamilton pried up a cleverly hinged floor board and lifted out a submachine gun he posted himself at the loophole watches ran over to the window and looked out there was another building some thirty feet distant there were windows in the wall but no man could jump that distance then watches snapped back hastily he had glimpsed a uniformed policeman in the court below the officer was looking up balancing a heavy service revolver suggestively in one hand you birds had better get wise to yourselves the cop called weve got you surrounded watches looked at ool speculatively then i touched him and he staggered back and collapsed i came here watches swallowed twice doc savage is dead he is ooi said emphatically watches seemed to be thinking deeply his breathing was heavy he polished the watches on both ends of the chain then compared their time with that shown by his two wrist watches found one of the wrist watches a few seconds off and made a correction what was the idea of the song and dance about the lenderthorn expedition he asked ool shrugged it is part of my plan watches put out a disgusted jaw your plan say dont i rate on this you go ahead with a scheme thats as wild as hell and you dont give me a gander at it i dont like it whos running this anyway you said ool and i watches put the timepieces back in his pockets and began to curse he swore in a low voice but venomously and without repeating himself what a sweet mess he finished doc savage has those goggles ool began i have a plan somewhere in the room a buzzer whizzed twice loudly and jarringly watches stiffened the three men playing cards pushed back from the table with such quick violence that the stacked chips washed over the oilcloth and spilled on the floor even mouselike honey hamilton snapped from his tilted chair forgetting to keep his gun concealed beneath the form sheet ool alone showed no perturbation what is it he asked that buzzers never been rung before watches clipped its an emergency worked from a button behind the bar where hamhock can reach it with his toe maybe ool ventu red hamhock went to sleep and kicked it accidentally not a chance that fat devil is never sleepy and not as harmless as he looks then color faded out of watches florid face what is the matter ool asked you look sick listen watches bowen demanded hoarsely did you go dumb and leave doc savages men trail you down here i did not i was careful to come in a roundabout way ool seemed to read his mind you can turn me over to the police he said slowly no doubt they will then hold you on no charge more serious than that of possessing weapons watches shook his head im not that kind of a guy anyhow think i wanta lose my cut in a few millions ool shrugged it seems there is nothing for us to do but fight honey hamilton said nervously theyre gonna use torches on that door watches watches yelled well are you gonna stand there and let them honey hamilton spread a benign look over his face as he shoved the submachine gun snout through the loophole and his finger sought the trigger but he never discharged bullets there was an earsplitting crack steel splinters flew like shrapnel over the room a screaming fragment crashed a bottle of whisky went entirely through the tabletop and sank into the floor another ripped watches coat sleeve from wrist to elbow honey hamilton tumbled backward off his chair blood began to well from gashes on his face and shoulders he lay prone pawing at his bloody face watches squawled at him what happened they cut loose at the loophole from outside honey gulped a bullet must have walked into the muzzle of my typewriter jammed in the barrel blew the breech all to hell he slumped down on the floor watches let him lie and glared wildly at the loophole then he scuttled to one side one of the policemen in the hall had thrust a gun barrel through the loophole from the outside he could not fire and do any damage because the angle was not right but the loophole was effectively plugged watches pulled helplessly at his gold vest chain what a lulu were in he groaned they stood there nervetaut anxious outside in the hall a soft roaring began and grew louder and after a bit the inside of the door started smoking the police were using a cutting torch on the armor plate panel watches groaned we aint got a chance to fight hey there called an entirely new voice for a moment they could not locate the voice then they spun and after that they stared unbelievingly across the thirtyfoot space between the two buildings a window was open a man leaned from that window he was a darkskinned man very big smoothshaven with very dark eyes black hair and a scar which started at the lobe of his right ear and slanted down across his neck his appearance was utterly villainous in his hands the man held a coil of fire hose of the type often affixed to reels inside office buildings watches ran to the window looked out and down cautiously he could see the policeman in the alley below the bluecoat was sprawled out motionless on the grimy concrete get a move on you birds snapped the big scarred man across the alley or are you interested hell yes watches exploded toss us the end of that hose the big man hurled the hose missed the first time but on the second try watches seized it drew it inside and knotted it to a radiator hand over hand the men started coming across they were not interrupted the policeman below in the alley did not stir the large dark man with the scar voiced only a single word hurry he said and led the flight the swarthy fellow had a pronounced limp like rats deserting a sinking ship watches bowens gang swung gingerly across the hose span and through the window honey hamilton the last to attempt the crossing suddenly discovered that due to his wounds he was incapable of making it go on he growled ill keep the cops entertained dont be a fool snapped the big dark man he swung out over the span grunting and straining with the effort and got his legs around honey hamilton then began the return journey it was a remarkable feat for the dark man held honey gripped in his legs suspended in the air above the alley the hose sagged and groaned as hand over hand the dark man pitted his gigantic strength against the swaying but slowly like a cable car over a quarry he finally made the other side with his wounded burden honey hamilton weak with relief now that the trip was over made a wry grin thanks guy remind me if i should happen to forget that sometime an hour or more later watches bowen was relaxing in another of his numerous hangoutsa fiftyfoot cabin cruiser tied up at a city island dock a bottle of watches eightyyearold napoleon brandy contributed substantially to his relaxing by the time he had drained a third glass he had recovered much of his old suave manner slumped near watches on an overstuffed berth the three sleek hard young gunmen were engaged with a fresh deck of cards in the same room the big dark stranger who had come so mysteriously to their rescue was doing an excellent job of bandaging honey hamiltons wounds ool sat on another berth as motionless as if he were dead except for an occasional twitch from his weird right hand from forward in another cabin came the soft drone of a shortwave radio loudspeaker it was giving police broadcasts repeating pickup order number one naught naught seven two said the radio dimiter daikoff who escaped two days ago from a chicago jail and is believed to be in new york daikoff is a large man with a limp has dark skin and eyes and a scar on his neck on the right side reported to be dangerous watches bowen in the act of drinking more brandy made an explosive sound and shot a fine spray of the stuff through his teeth he choked and coughed so thats who you are he gulped eying the dark bulky man who had saved them from the police trap the stranger looked up from his bandaging right he said quietly then the man stood up he held his head proudly his black eyes flashed with an almost fanatical glitter the light from the overhead electric bulb glowed on the smooth skin covering his high cheek bones like many of his race this mans cheek bones were so prominent that his cheeks looked hollow they were thrown into shadow i am no murderer he proclaimed tragically i simply liquidate one who was traitor to our party i dimiter daikoff am no criminal in my country i would be honored receive a medal but here they hunt me like animal watches shrugged tolerantly thats all right by me brother one turn rates another you can hang around if you want to thank you the big man bent again to his task of mercy i am no killer i am a patriot one thing id like to know though watches continued is how in the hell did you happen to show up just when we needed you dimiter daikoff smiled gravely that is simple i was hiding next door when i heard the shots i thought it was myself that the police were after i struck unconscious the officer who was on guard in the alley then i saw it was you that they sought i do not like policemen they do not know the difference between a patriot who came here to the united states and eliminated one who had been a thieving government official of his own countrythe police do not know such a patriot from a common murderer i hate them for it so i help you watches stretched luxuriantly and grinned what a swell thing hate can be sometimes he said during the course of the next several hours the men loitered aboard the boat dimiter daikoff fitted into the situation as naturally as a big house dog he came and went about the boat administering to honey hamilton and preparing drinks and sandwiches eventually watches and ool went into a huddle in the forecastle honey and the two younger gunmen were sleeping and dimiter daikoff the selfclaimed patriot was washing dishes in the galley so there did not seem to be reason for undue secrecy but watches and ool nevertheless kept their voices lowered several times the name of doc savage and the phrase black goggles was audible however it would have been apparent to any one interested that they were carefully planning a move against doc savages men believing doc to be dead when they finished their conference they awakened the others and departed honey hamilton could walk you can stay here and play admiral until we get back watches told daikoff the instant the gunmen were out of sight daikoff strode to the forecastle where watches and ool had held their whispered conversation and from the ventilator removed a small compact dictograph device which had been lowered there then be proceeded to wind up a length of fine wire attached to the dictograph wire as fine as hair and hence practically unnoticeable it ran back to where daikoff had been dishwashing in the galley watches and ool might have been worried certainly they would have been surprised if they had known that their whisperd plotting against doc savages men had been overheard by the big man stowing the dictaphone device away in his pocket dimiter daikoff hurriedly left the boat chapter the scared explorer five men stood in the early morning sun which streamed through the health glass windows of doc savages eightysixth floor headquarters two of the five were monk and ham and for once in their lives the hairy chemist and the dapper lawyer were finding themselves aligned on the same side of the argument the men on the other side of the argument were doc savages other three aides familiarly known as johnny long tom and renny holy cow renny roared you mean to stand there and tell us doc may be dead renny or colonel john renwick as his engineering associates knew him had a long puritanical face he was inches over six feet tall and weighed in the neighborhood of two hundred and fifty pounds his great frame gave the appearance of being composed mostly of bone but the really remarkable thing about him were his fists each was composed of fully a quart of bone and gristle locked in a room while doc went up against this guy with the funny white hand were you renny boomed why didnt you bust out he swung one of his huge fists as if by way of demonstration it was rennys boast that no wooden door was made with a panel so strong that he could not shatter it with one blow of those fists monk and ham squirmed blast it we did monk groaned it took time when we got out both doc and this guy were gone a mildly scholastic voice put in not an empyrean collocation of circumstances the speaker was johnny or william harper littlejohn a man who never used a small word when he had time to think of a large one and also a man who was one of the greatest living archaeologists and geologists johnny was very tall and thin as old man death himself and he carried on a ribbon a monocle which was in actuality a powerful magnifier the fifth of doc savages aides was a thin man with a skin the color of a mushroom he looked about as unhealthy as a man could look as a matter of fact he had never been ill in his life and could if occasion called for it whip nine out of every ten men he chanced to meet on a street he was major thomas j roberts electrical wizard extraordinary he was more often known simply as long torn a name he had annexed long ago after a disastrous experience in trying to make use of a rusted long tom cannon of buccaneer vintage long tom shook his head this strange whiteskinned man you caught at the warehousehanger he claimed to be gray forestay a member of the lenderthom exploration party exactly monk agreed he gave no logical explanation of why he was prowling around the hangar long tom persisted he said he knew hed get caught and brought to doc if you call that logical monk snorted that man long toni pointed out answers the description of a fellow who murdered a gangster named beery hosner last night he is supposed to have waved his right hand at beery hosner an the man dropped dead he was great at waving that right hand monk agreed gloomily i dunno just what kind of devilment was connected with the way he did it suddenly from somewhere outside the reception room door came a burst of scuffling then a long drawn screech of terror reached them there was something about the screech which put a strange feeling around the roots of their hair ill he guperamalgamated exploded bigworded johnny holy cow echoed renny each had used his pet exclamation for moments of great excitement all lunged for the door ham with his sword cane was first outside with bigfisted renny and the others crowding him close the corridor was empty all elevator doors were closed and the indicators showed that no cages were on that floor they ran for the stairs halfway down at the turn of the flight they encountered a man who was scuttling upward help the man screeched help the fleeing man had no hat his thick gray hair flopped over his forehead he had a closecropped gray mustache and was wearing smoked glasses to all appearances panicstricken he flung himself upon ham who was still leading the man was larger than ham but he cringed close to tile lawyer like a whipped dog whos after you renny swung his huge fists he did not have long to wait for an answer men charged around the corner of the stair landing coming from below with such speed that they piled up the first few steps before they noticed docs aides the speed with which they stopped was ludicrous evidently they had expected to find one fearcrazed man now they were confronted by five men not at all scared wheeling back without warning those in front collided with those who pushed close from behind three of the men fell sprawling in fantastic fashion keep them away the fleeing man pleaded theyll kill me renny bellowed and pitched his two hundred and fifty pounds of brawn down the steps his fists flailed one man went back under his piledriver blows his sheer hurtling weight downed another renny bored on a man on his back drove a vicious kick at the inside of rennys knee renny fell heavily adding his own thrashing limbs to the writhing tangle already on the floor docs other four aides lunging after renny smacked blows in all directions they did not however do all the battering they took terrific jolts from fists the foes knew how to fight but they had been taken at a disadvantage they were forced back along the corridor all except one benteared man who was rolling on the floor locked in a gorillagrip with renny when the fighting reached the region of the elevator shaft one of the men swerved jammed a thumb against the button which brought doc savages speed elevator up back of me men he yelled lemme take em the other men quit fighting leaped back the man who had pressed the buzzer wrenched a revolver out of his pocket and leveled down at his crowding enemies his fellows were out of the way backed tip against the elevator door so the gun could cover docs aides stand back the gunman yelled or ill blast the pack of you docs aides stood tense and glaring there was nothing they could do any move might draw bullets from that menacing revolver it would be hard for the gunman to miss a soft click announced the arrival of the elevator the doors fanned open inside the man with the gun ordered his men but the men did not get inside a bronze cyclone seemed to boil out of the elevator the man nearest the door was engulfed yanked shoulderhigh he was hurled shrieking upon his companions he crashed into the gun wielder knocked him down the bronze cyclone moved on there was blurred motion men went down like shingles windwhipped from a barn doc savage who had been riding the elevator up waded through them with his cablecorded fists sprawled on the floor the guntoter jerked up his revolver an instant before the bronze man crashed through to reach him the gun belched thunder the slug creased an ugly red furrow along docs musclerippled neck slammed on to his over monks rusty nubbin of a head and spanged into the corridor wall doc froze in his tracks all right he said quietly dont shoot again you win docs selfpossessed manner seemed to have a miraculously quieting effect on the gunman he held his fire and threw an order to his men in the elevator quickly he saw them all inside while he held doc and his five aides off with the gun with a last menacing flourish of the weapon he leaped inside himself the door slid shut the elevator sucked swishing downward monk leaped to ring the buzzer for one of the regular elevators well ride this down he roared doc waved him away let them go monk docs aides stared completely mystified it had baffled them enough when doc quit fighting and now for him to calmly allow the assail ants to get away was renny cracked his huge fists together holy cow he boomed whats the idea where you been doc we thought you were dead the bronze man answered with a question what started this a fellow let out a bellow and came charging up the steps monk explained where is he now hiding in your office doc long tom volunteered we will talk to him doc said ham you stay behind here and tell a straightsounding story to any office workers who might investigate the shots that shyster monk grunted can talk fast enough to make any one believe them shots was just a stenographer popping her chewing gum ham flourished his sword cane and glared at monk the bronze man and his four aides filed into the eightysixth floor headquarters they looked around carefully calculated training had rendered doc savage capable of concealing all emotion he showed no emotion now that was not true of the others they showed a vast surprise well ill be superamalgamated johnny gasped where is your stranger doc questioned monk blinked small eyes he was here he must be here johnny put in the only time johnny used little words was when he was excited doc strode across the deeppiled oriental rug and threw open the door to the adjoining room it was spacious lined from floor to ceiling with crammed bookshelves it was doc savages scientific library a collection of tomes almost without equal beyond was another room larger a room of fantastically shaped glass flasks and beakers banked test tubes brightly colored chemicals in bottles massive electric furnaces testing machines and chemical apparatus crowded the floor space it was the bronze mans workshoplaboratory doc and his men entered quietly their feet on the acidresisting composition floor gave off no sound this fact enabled them to make a discovery beside an opened glass case his broad back toward them stood the man who had fled from the thugs he was bent over examining something find something interesting doc questioned in a quiet tone the man whirled so quickly that a shock of his gray hair cascaded down over the smoked glasses which he wore his left hand went behind him doc savage strode forward he did not seem to walk with undue speed yet so perfectly did his huge muscles coordinate that he reached the mans side with startling suddenness the grayhaired man was heavily built but doc brushed him aside with one movement of his hand the stranger was holding at his back the goggles which ham and monk had taken from ool the skeletonthin prowler on the hangar roof the night before doc held the goggles loosely were you interested in these he asked yes no the man stammered you will notice that they are unusual doc went on the lenses are fully two inches in thickness and black so black that no light penetrates them i i picked them up by mistake the man said a little hoarsely my own smoked glasses fell off i dont see well without them the light hurts my eyes snow blindness i picked these of yours up by mistake for a minute i thought they were mine doc turned the blacklensed goggles over in his great sensitive hand this flexible material in which the lenses are imbedded can you identify it he asked the stranger i dont know anything about them the man declared i picked them up by mistake the material seems to be fish skin doc said it somewhat resembles the skin of a species of deepsea fish with a habitat in the arctic ocean im not interested in the goggles the man reiterated earnestly im only interested in my life i came here to get away from men who would have killed me he peered intently through his own smoked glasses at the faces of docs men are they gone now those men in the hall are they gone they decamped renny boomed sourly your perambulations are imperspicuous said bigworded johnny he means said monk who could seldom resist interpreting johnnys verbiage that we want to know what you were snooping around in here for please dont mistake my intentions gentlemen the man said earnestly he steadied his nervous gaze on doc i confess i was terrorstricken when i ran in here my only idea was to get as far as possible from those thugs when they attacked me i was on my way to see doc savage you are doc savage right doc said he replaced the black goggles on the shelf and closed the glass door the stranger cast one brief glance at the goggles his thick hand waved out toward them if theyre so valuable he said i should think youd put them in a safe place doc shrugged they do not look valuable who would want them they are safe here come on through the impressive laboratory through the library with its smell of paper doc led the way the stranger settled back in a comfortable chair in the outer office you may have heard of me he suggested i am an explorer gray forestay gray forestay long tom ejaculated now dont tell us monk cut in sarcastically that you are the sole survivor of an attack by black things the grayhaired stranger stared blankly now how did you know that he exploded now that the man had control of himself his voice was longer hoarse hut softly resonant smooth doc explained last night a man came here who represented himself as gray forestay only surviving member of the lenderthorn expedition he stated that his party on the pack ice north of canada had been set upon by weird shapeless thingsblack things but i am gray forestay the other wailed i accompanied the lenderthorn expedition and that is precisely what happened black things and all monk demanded skeptically a shudder coursed over the mans sturdy bulk the mysterious black assailants i assure you gentlemen are very real and no joking matter you saw them yourself monk demanded i saw them the man gripped the arms of his chair his tone was rather desperately defiant what did they look like the man seemed to be searching for words he spoke finally they wereshapeless black like ghosts there is no other way to say it there is nothing to compare them with they are not real and yet they are real i saw them they came from nowhere from nowhere monk scoffed they just appeared they stayed only for a moment then they disappeared maybe i went out of my head i dont know the first thing i realized was my comrades were gone all of them gone and no trace the man reached up to clutch fiercely at his thick mop of gray hair his pudgy fingers brushed over his gray mustache i am not old only thirtysix i got like this all in a single dayin a single hour a tense silence followed the impassioned account even monk was impressed the man reached in his inside coat pocket there was a crinkling sound as he drew out a sheaf of papers he got up walked across and handed the papers to doc savage here are some letters documents he said they establish my identity the bronze man examined the papers his expression remained enigmatic but his decision was apparent when he looked up and said forestay do you know who it was that came here last night representing himself to be you the man shook his head i havent an idea in the world who it could have been who were your attackers in the hallway the man turned up the palms of his hands in an instinctive gesture of helplessness i havent an idea in the world about that either the attack came as a complete surprise somebody obviously who sought to keep you from seeing me obviously but who i do not know they attacked me first in the lobby of the building i got away and ducked into an elevator they took another elevator i got out two flights below this floor thinking to elude them they got out after me i finally escaped them again when your men came to my rescue doc asked you can add nothing more that might be of help nothing except now that i have collected my wits i do not believe they meant to kill me the man said slowly not then at any rate they had chances to kill me but they seemed to be trying to take me alive a kidnaping so it would appear doc savage fixed his gaze upon the man and you came to see me mr forestay why to get your aid in a search for my comrades of the vanished lenderthorn expedition the man said to solve the mystery of the black assailants in the arctic whatever they were with your dirigible it would be possible to land on the ice pack and make an extended search you know i have a dirigible doc asked it was in the newspapers the other replied it is a new and quite remarkable ship only recently delivered to you doc was silent a moment you think your fellows on the expedition still live i am not sure the other said soberly but there is a chance something happened to them i do not know what a search should be made i owe them that i see doc said slowly the grayhaired man became very earnest i am only doing what any other man would do he said levelly if such a thing as i have described happened to your own comrades you would leave nothing undone to find out what occurred and to help them if possible is that not true it is doc admitted will you help me the other asked bluntly we will help you doc said just as promptly the man rushed across to seize doc savages hand thank you he exploded fervently thank you he wrung the bronze mans hand my men and i the six of us doc stated are having lunch this morning at eleven oclock in the cafe oriental downstairs we would be glad to have you join us we can go over the details the man bowed respectfully i appreciate the honor i regret i cannot be there later if you change your mind doc said youll find us at a table near the door after the man had gone monk blurted hey doc whats the idea you know i dont like chopsuey i doubt that we will do much eating doc told him watches bowen and his men had returned to the cruiser moored at a city island wharf they went into a huddle watches included them all ool honey hamilton the three sleek hard young men the obese negro hamhock piney and several newcomers members of the organization the tragicfaced dark giant dimiter daikoff was back aboard watches when he came in greeted daikoff with loud good humor an indication that things had gone well youre good luck for me my patriotic friend watches said and gave daikoff a friendly slap on the back daikoffs tragic black eyes rolled their gratefulness for this comradely consideration in the manner of a dog delightedly fetching its masters slippers he eased swiftly around the place repeatedly filling glasses for everybody from watches supply of napoleon brandy this conference was not quite so secretive as that held earlier in the night snatches of conversation had to deal with doc savage black goggles laboratory glass case dimiter daikoff easing around unobtrusively filling glasses emptying ash trays heard much chapter blue lightning two hours following the boat conference a hardlipped ferreteyed young man stood on a busy new york street corner in front of the cafe oriental he casually stretched his arms and allowed the five fingers of one hand to stand out widespread the other hand he kept closed except for a single finger it was a cautious signal a black sedan which was rolling along through the traffic angled to the curb the man next the driver was a husky negro whose chunk of a head seemed perched atop his numerous chins the sedan driver said ok hamhock piney muttered softly dat doc savage and all five o his outfit must be in de eatin house swell elegant ah calls it hamhock got out three other men piled out of the rear the driver wheeled hack into the traffic stream the overdressed young man who had stood in front of the restaurant joined them as they walked briskly along the pavement and turned into the impressive skyscraper of gleaming metal and granite which towered nearly a hundred stories into the air and which housed doc savages headquarters they entered the express elevator eightysix hamhock said doc savages floor the elevator operator queried by way of verification dats right at the eightysixth floor stop one of the men shoved an automatic in the operators ribs and said we stay here and wait you and me with the elevator hamhock led the other men across the corridor they stopped in front of the door to doc savages office there was a note pinched in the door it read lunching downstairs in the cafe oriental docs visitors stared at each other hamhock shrugged ponderously come on they opened the door and pushed inside hamhock led the way over the deep carpet to the library door he pushed experimentally on the chromesteel panels heres where trouble starts he grunted ease that soup and soap out your pocket squirrel and well get busy squirrel dorgan socalled because of his long pointed frontal teethtook a phial of nitroglycerine and a piece of yellow laundry soap out of his pocket he went to work expertly preparing to blow the door just before he was ready to pour the nitroglycerine he tried the doorknob with more force the door swung open squirrel stared stupidly one of the others cursed softly hamhock thoughtfully massaged his many chins hell looks like a plant squirrel dorgan breathed somethin fishy about it another agreed this doc savage aint sap enough to go way and leave a setup like this open to the public squirrel dorgan peered inside the library the utter silence of the place the thousands of solidly shelved books seemed to oppress him his pointed teeth nipped his slack lips im for blowin he said nervously hamhock growled we come heah to get dem black goggles an we gwine get em come on he heaved his fat bulk through the doorway across the ominously silent library they trailed moving wanly guns out fingers close to triggers hamhock himself turned the knob of the door which led on into the laboratory this panel opened as readily as the others the negro stared inside the array of fantastically shaped glass tubes and retorts the chemical and scientific devices invested the place with an air more sinister than that of the library how ah figures it hamhock muttered as though to convince himself by the sound of his own words is dat dis doc savage hem a big shot cant imagine anybody am gwine come triflin round dats why he dont bothah bout lockin no doahs one of the hardfaced young men blinked furtive eyes well lets get this thing over yeah another rasped the things ive heard about this guy savage squirrel dorgans teeth chattered brother what i could do with a bottle of the chiefs brandy youall shut up hamhock grunted come on through the doorway he eased his fat frame the others followed single file down the long aisle they trailed between ceilinghigh scientific equipment which mushroomed weirdly from the floor and which seemed to exude a ghostly aura of unreality right ahead theah hamhock whispered and indicated by pointing his gun muzzle at a tall glass case look squirrel dorgan gulped when they had approached a few steps closer theres the goggles this aint gonna be tough after alt they stopped in front of the case hamhock with a gloating in his eyes sent a sepia paw toward the goggles which lay unprotected on a glass shelf his hand passed through the goggles through them as though they were air his clawing finger nails scraped the glass of the shelf hamhock jerked his hand back as if it had touched flame his hand had not been able to grasp the goggles yet he could see them clearly still lying on the shelf an uneasy rumbling sounded from deep within his throat his chins shook as he tried to swallow what in hells the matter one of the hardeyed young men asked in a voice suddenly gone shaky how de hell does ah know hamhock gulped his hand snatched out again toward the black goggles so plainly visible on the shelf as before he could not clutch them he could not even feel them his fingers seemed to pass through them as easily as they would pass through thin air his nails scraped grating on the glass of the shelf hamhocks whitish eyes rolled his breath came faster sweat oozed from the creases of his many chins what the hell hamhock squirrel dorgan gritted have you got butter fingers squirrel shoved forward and snatched out his own hand for the goggles he had no more success than had hamhock his hand seemed to pass through the goggles as though they were of no substance his finger nails scraped futilely on the glass shelf his face blanched his rodent teeth started chattering theyre there he grated but they aint there hell ive got enough of this place he wheeled to start for the door cursing clutching their guns tightly the others turned also they stopped as suddenly as they had turned then cringed back in slacklipped terror directly in front of them beside the door and barring their path to it a weird blue flame pencilthin had leaped from a shiny plate embedded in one wall across the door opening to another plate the flame remained suspended a lance of crackling hissing blue it rippled up and down other blue lances zigzagged like chain lightning until there was a whole pattern of blue flame leaping and rattling barring an exit from the door we all goin be electrocuted hamhock bawled fearfully he recoiled swerved started to run in the opposite direction the others shaking off the paralysis which held them turned with him only to stop again so fearstruck that one of them dropped his gun grimly barring their way down the narrow aisle in that direction stood doc savage and his five men they held strangelooking weapons which in appearance resembled overgrown automatics hamhock was the first to recover his wits dont shoot he croaked raising his voice to make it sound above the crackling roar of the blue lightning which continued to feed out of the machine behind them in token of submission he allowed his gun to sag until it pointed at the floor one of the hard young men at hamhocks elbow went haywire and tried to level his automatic doc savages finger tightened on the trigger of his weapon the gun emitted a single earsplitting hoot it was a machine pistol with a tremendously fast rate of fire the hard young mans automatic dropped from his hand he pitched forward and lay huddled on the floor don shoot no moah hamhock pleaded take their guns monk doc directed monk went forward and relieved the prisoners of weapons long tom turn off the highfrequency current doc directed the thin electrical wizard pressed a button on a near wall board the blue electrical display subsided now doc said talk is in order his flakegold eyes bored into the faces of the prisoners the first question he said slowly why are you here none of the captives answered they were trying hard to look ugly you can imagine the effect doc said dryly if you were to be tied to a chair which happened to stand between those door plates that highfrequency current would do some remarkable things to you squirrel dorgans pointed teeth had sunk into his lip drawing a little scarlet but he remained silent with the others monk a great grin on his simian features suggested they all gotta be electrocuted anyway judging by their looks whatcha say we save the state some money weve got an electric furnace over there big enough to cremate their bodies and we can scatter the ashes out of a window monk looked utterly earnest as he made this callous suggestion no one watching him would have dreamed but that he meant it unless they had known monk in which case they would have recognized the bluff the captives took it in various fashions hamhock piney remained rigidly silent too scared to even tremble as lustily as he would have liked the matter of the goggles which he had reached for repeatedly had upset his superstitious soul and the display of highfrequency electricity had finished the demoralization doc gestured at squirrel dorgan put him in a chair in the door monk squirrel dorgan was not without nerve he bit holes in his lips with his long teeth as they seized him and tied him in a chair but he did not talk monk positioned the chair in the door wanta talk the homely chemist demanded go to hell dorgan gritted after you my friend monk said his small voice utterly unconcerned he reached up and turned on the current there was a terrific burst of blue flame a sheeting blinding mass of itahead of squirrel dorgan it did not quite touch him but it ripped horribly in front of his face just a slight error monk said cheerfully ill slide the chair up a little he moved the chair stood back studied its position then moved it again then he leered at the swordcanecarrying ham ill bet you five bucks that his hair bursts into flame when the sparks touch him he offered nothing doing ham refused i know how that current works monk shrugged and ambled for the switch squirrel dorgan broke down whatcha wanna know he screamed shut up you yellow fool one of the hard young men grated dorgan snarled at him if you think this bronze guy is kidding youre nuts ive beard of guys who went up against him and were never heard from again hamhock piney bawled out i tell youall dis place am got a hoodoo ah could see dem goggles but dey wasnt dar who sent you here doc asked squirrel dorgan watches bowen squirrel snarled what did he want the goggles dorgan mumbled why dorgan blew scarlet off his lips i dont know that highfrequency current monk suggested all i know squirrel said shrilly is that the black goggles have something to do with black things in the arctic that sounds goofy but its all i know what are the black things the bronze man queried i dont know dorgan insisted i beard watches and and ool mention them theyre supposed to be somewhere in the arctic thats all i know thats all any of us know watches and ool didnt spill their plans to us who is this ool doc questioned squirrels teeth started chattering he aint quite human what do you mean he can kill you without even touching you i aint makin this up its the truth the bronze man frowned this ool is very tall and very thin and he has a skin which somewhat resembles motherofpearl is that right thats the guy dorgan agreed monk grunted loudly in comprehension thats the egg we caught on top of the hangar the bird who claimed to be gray forestay survivor of that lenderthorn arctic expedition doc savage asked squirrel dorgan where did this ool come from he showed up one day with watches bowen thats all i know is he the one who brought the news of the blackthings i guess so dorgan mumbled they didnt tell us much is watches bowen planning a trip with ool to the arctic dorgan squirmed yeah where doc demanded name the exact spot cant dorgan shook his head watches dont talk to us i tell you how soon is he leaving just as soon as he did not finish spill it guy monk rumbled as soon as he he makes arrangements about using your dirigible squirrel wailed fearfully and hell croak me for spillin that doc savage said dryly he intends to arrange i presume in the same raggedly individualistic manner in which he went about securing the goggles squirrel ran the tip of his tongue along his sharp teeth i i wouldnt know about that think carefully and do not lie doc said who was the second gray forestay squirrel fidgeted but did not answer you know who he was doc persisted squirrel was silent the bronze man leaned forward and his eyes gold pools seemed alive possessed of a weird power who was the second gray forestay he asked squirrel dorgan suddenly gave in watches bowen himself he wailed monk started and exploded blazes ham flourished his sword cane we want a description of that watches bowen he snapped was he wearing a disguise when he played the part of forestay he grayed his hair and put on a pair of smoked spectacles and a trick mustache dorgan mumbled doc savage had shown no perceptible surprise at the revelation his bronze features seemed incapable of showing emotion what was watches bowens purpose in pretending to be a man named forestay he asked ool tried it first dorgan muttered then watches gave it a whirl they wanted to trick you into taking them north in that airship of yours but the attack here in the corridor ham put in was that genuine i mean when the men attacked this watches bowen while he was pretending to be forestay a play put on by some of watches boys to make it look good dorgan said doc savage said i am to gather that you men do not know more than you have told me because your chief failed to take you into his confidence thats it dorgan gasped at this point big fat hamhock piney spoke up he had been staring at the case which held the goggles dem black specs he mumbled eyes rolling why couldnt i pick em up dats what ah wants to know doc did not answer monk snorted mirthfully a series of mirrors had been employed to cast a lifelike reflection of the goggles a trick magicians sometimes use to make an article seem where it is not but hamhock piney remained in the dark about the phenomena which had so baffled him the victim of the machinepistol blast suddenly got to his feet the slugs which the weapon discharged were socalled mercy bullets pellets which were merely composition shells filled with a chemical concoction which produced almost instant unconsciousness the period of insensibility thus induced would last only a short time what are we gonna do with these birds monk asked the usual thing doc said that statement to monk was explanation sufficient for it concerned the strange institution which doc maintained in upstate new york grinning widely monk went forward to take his victims in charge hamhock piney who had been standing in stupefied silence spun suddenly and lunged to get past the plates from which the sparks had jumped the other criminals seizing that bare chance and moved more by animal instinct than anything else leaped after him theyre getting away renny yelled hamhock and the others were charging wildly across the laboratory they were in such a mental state that only physical violence sufficient to incapacitate would stop them doc savage strangely enough was making no move to halt the exodus as the frenziedly fleeting men lurched through the doorway into the library ham clipped we can go down on the speed lift beat them to the bottom let them go doc savage said that stunned monk his large mouth hung open bigworded johnny was the first to find speech the lack of big words indicated how surprised he was you let them escape he murmured but why yeah monk gulped explain that doc savage said it is a rather long story and unfortunately there is not time for it right now chapter death in a telephone after scuttling breathlessly out of the skyscraper which housed doc savages headquarters hamhock piney squirrel dorgan and the others walked more slowly down the street they would have preferred to run but that would have attracted attention within a block they sighted their sedan it was circling the block to pick them up the driver pulled into the curb near the corner and waited for them watches bowen and ool were now in the machine hamhock piney eyed squirrel dorgan ah sho hates to think what de boss am gonna do when he finds out what yo done tell dat doc savage he muttered squirrel dorgan stopped lookit you guys he said grimly we know how watches cuts up when something goes wrong hes liable to throw sonic lead into somebody wed better oil this up a little what yoall mean hamhock questioned tell watches we didnt get in and got chased out dorgan suggested let it go at that what he dont know wont hurt him ah favors dat idea said hamhock the hard young men nodded we got trouble enough without watches ridin us one of them said their story agreed upon they advanced and entered the sedan watches bowen extended a hand the goggles he requested ool awaiting the answer fixed his watercolored eyes on hamhock the fat negro was stilt wheezing from the exertions of his escape sweat had flooded his banked chins and now ools appraisal threw him into a fresh perspiration we didnt get the goggles squirrel dorgan told watches bowen what the hell watches snarled we was lucky to get out of there alive dorgan continued say i thought you had things fixed we walk into that place and there was doc savage watches bowen scowled blackly you are crazy he snapped doc savage is in that restaurant right now and has been for the past thirty minutes squirrel ddrgan gaped the hard young men looked surprised hamhock piney breathed noisily and watched ool as if he were looking at a spiketailed devil watches bowen snapped a command and the car swerved back and passed the cafe oriental they all peered into the restaurant plainly visible inside six men sat around a table dining in leisurely fashion doc savage and his five aides dorgan exploded but bell it cant be them guys in the restaurant must be actors that bird savage fixed up hamhock rolled his eyes ah tells yo dat bronze man am moren half spook he declared squirrel dorgan was obviously doing some fast thinking in an effort to make their defeat seem logical doc savage knew that bird forestay was you in disguise he told watches bowen bowen yelled what that probably explains it squirrel said with the air of a mastermind doc savage told you when he was gonna be out of his place in the restaurant figuring you would take a whirl at getting the goggles then he arranged some actors or somebody down there eating to look like himself and his men bowen swore fervently and fumbled with the two watches on the gold chain maybe that explains it he admitted ah still claims dat savage man is worse dan voodoo proclaimed hamhock piney arriving at their yacht alongside the city island dock the gang trooped aboard in surly silence dimiter daikoff came out of the galley to meet them bringing coffee and some of watches bowens favorite brandy his ministrations were not received kindly watches gave him a round cursing on general principles and the big dark scarred man who claimed he was a patriot instead of a murderer retired to a corner of the cabin and sat with his arms folded a look of utter tragedy on his swarthy face watches bowen kept pulling one timepiece after another out of his pockets and juggling them in his hand weve got to rub this doc savage out he growled it is true ool agreed and we must have that dirigible we must get those goggles also watches nodded its a job i hate to tackle but its got to be done it is more dangerous trying to trick that man than to kill him ool said we will kill him ah aint cravin no prominent part in the killin hamhock put in ools cold glance fixed upon hamhock the fat negros temerity oozed dat is he qualified weakly ah hopes us can dope out some shoahfire scheme watches restored his timepieces to his pockets and his thick hand slid up and down the gold vest chain ive got an idea he purred turning he walked to the far corner of the room nodding for ool to accompany him the two talked together earnestly for several minutes they were careful to keep their voices lowered no word reached other ears than their own dimiter daikoff remained glowering in the opposite corner of the room entirely out of earshot dimiter daikoff was not out of eyeshot however and both watches bowen and ool would have been vastly sur prised had they known that the big man whose dark eyes watched them so intently was making those eyes serve as ears dimiter daikoff was reading lips as bowen and ool talked some three hours later in doc savages fabulous library of scientific tomes monk was pacing as restlessly as a newly caged ape ham sat watching him an overdone expression of pity on his handsome face he made clucking noises of pity with his tongue no imagination he said he just dont know what to do with himself monk snorted seemed to try to think of a suitable retort gave it up and turned to watch doc savage who stood before a large globe of the world doc was studying the arctic regions and drawing a line with a colored pencil near by was a stack of newspapers dating some months back they carried stories of the lost lenderthorn expedition the mark on the globe indicated the route of the lenderthorn expedition as given by the newspaper accounts doc monk said the bronze man looked up yes where were you the past couple of hours getting those papers monk asked doc nodded that and otherwise trying to find out what this is all about you got any idea what those goggles are monk asked the lenses are very peculiar the bronze giant stated they seem to be composed of a material similar to quartz yet this quartz and i am not quite sure it is quartz is not of natural formation the crystalline structure indicates an artificial source monk scratched the bristles atop his bullet of a head at least we know theyre after our dirigible he said even if we dont know why those goggles are so valuable and what is behind alt this phenagling doc turned back to the globe monk grinned as he watched the bronze man concentrate on the arctic longitudes the apish chemist pulled his coat collar tight about his chin and executed an elaborate shiver i feel in my bones he said that were due to shove off for the land of the midnight sun a buzzer sounded faintly it was one which warned of approaching visitors a contact was closed automatically when an elevator stopped at the eightysixth floor level the bronze man pressed a button electrical mechanism whirred and on one wall of the room an inset television scanning panel of frosted glass was suddenly flooded with light a picture appeared of the corridor outside a uniformed policeman was stepping from an elevator now what muttered monk have we got the police after us too i hope this isnt another gray forestay pale long tom put in the door buzzer rang ill let him in monk said the policeman whom monk ushered into the room removed his cap when doc savage nodded in greeting the officer seemed to have an instinctive feeling that the giant bronze man was entitled to special respect it was not an unnatural feeling shared by every one who met doc savage im lieutenant omalley the uniformed man said i am on detached service working out of the chiefs office im here to interview doc savage this is doc savage monk said nodding in the direction of the worldrenowned man i know omalleys eyes showed open admiration as they rested upon the bronze giant brother he said hesitating as if doubtful of the propriety of the term of address but unable to resist its honest expression id sure feel safe with a man like you walking a beat with me doc savage turned the conversation away from himself what can we do for you he questioned its a routine matter the policeman said the office is checking up on the murder of a watches bowen mobster beery hosmer the suspected murderer seems to be a sideshow freak if the descriptions that have come in are any good whitefaced watercolored eyes gold mustache and a fine fuzz on his head thats the way the description and why are you interviewing me doc interposed this man was reported seen around your office the officer said doc nodded such a man did come to see me when late last night what did he want omalley asked excitedly there is more to this than shows on the surface doc said you make an appointment with your chief and well go over the matter together omalleys face clouded plainly he disliked the idea but the bronze mans words had held a note of quiet finality omalley shrugged k he said he turned started for the door then stopped and looked back say he grinned mind if i use your telephone to call my wife shes got corned beef and cabbage cooking tonight it looks like im going to be late i want her to keep it hot doc waved at the desk phone help yourself omalley spun the dial and got a number he talked briefly regarding the conservation of corned beef and cabbage after he had spoken he listened he listened a much longer time than he had spoken the sound of a highpitched querulous voice could be heard from the receiver omalley squirmed looked sheepish his free hand went into his side pants pocket and out again finally he banged the receiver in a show of temper the receiver missed the prongs struck the phone rocked it on the desk top his right hand reached out to steady the instrument with the right hand gripping the inside of the mouthpiece he hooked the receiver on the fork and stepped back theres a woman for you he muttered flushed she says if i dont get home on time i can eat it cold after the policeman had left doc said monk follow him tail that cop monk asked surprised right report all he does by riding docs speed elevator down monk reached the lobby before the policeman arrived on a slower cage monk trailed omalley down the crowded avenue omalley walked fast almost ran he vent only half a block then turned into a cigar store and walked to the hack where phone booths were arrayed be paused in front of one of the booths a man came out of the booth omalley crowded in monk started violently when he saw the man who had come out the man was watches bowen monk recognized him although he had seen watches only in the characterization of gray forestay monks hand dipped into his pocket came out with small change he dropped a coin on the news counter and grabbed a newspaper jerked it open held it before his face and advanced on the phone booths in the manner of a man absorbed in the days news he stopped at the phone booth adjacent to the one the policeman had entered but the booth was occupied he caught a glimpse of the occupant through the glass window it was the strangely whiteskinned man who carried death in his right handool it had been monks intention to ease into the booth and listen in on omalleys telephone conversation occupied as the booth was monk pushed ahead to the booth on the other side of the policemans he had to pass so close to watches bowen that he almost scraped elbows with the gangster monk grimaced as he saw his plan of overhearing the policemans conversation going to smash the booth on the opposite side was occupied also monk got a quick look at the occupant the man was small inoffensive appearing mouselike in fact a wide bandage swathing his head made him look more harmless than ever it was honey hamilton although monk had no way of knowing that monk started on intending to enter one of the other booths and put a call through to doc savage for reenforeements but he never made the call a sudden sharp pressure came against the small of his back a voice purred take it easy you sure have pushed yourself into bad company monk stood unmoving saying nothing a policy he considered excellent when the muzzle of an automatic was gouging into his back so you tailed our fake copper here watches bowen purred you boys are very very bright arent you monk said nothing watches bowen laughed with an oily softness and said all right you wanted to know things get your ear against that booth monk retreated the muzzle of the gun barrel making steady pressure against his back watches laughed unnaturally this is too good to keep he said im going to let you in our fake copper is going to call savage and when savage answers his phone itll be his last minute on earth huh monk grunted startled by the cold confidence of watches tone were you in savages office when officer omalley was fumbling around with the telephone sure monk growled watches grinned officer omalleys thumb smeared poison in the telephone mouthpiece in doc savages office huh monk said again a very unusual poison watches elaborated one which vaporized when moistened by the breath the gas kills hey listen monk growled suddenly alarmed the gun barrel jabbed into his back you listen ape thats all youre just in time monk listened suffering all the tortures of the damned a whirring and clicking could he heard from within the booth as the fake policeman dialed doc savages number doc monk knew would be called to the telephone in case he did not answer himself there could hardly be a slipup there was an interval of silence inside the booth then the fake policeman spoke hello doc savage monk he homely loyal monk did a magnificent thing it ws not his fault that it was a useless thing it has been long accepted that greater love hath no man monk did the best he could to lay down his life for his brother there was only one way he could have managed it with that automatic nosed into his hack he could only yell warn doc savage of the poison danger by the roar of his great voice and by the roar of the gangsters gun as it blared its lead through flesh and bone monk opened his cavernous mouth to yell it was not his fault that no sound came before he could utter so much as a murmur the barrel of a submachine gun crashed against his temple and felled him to the floor honey hamilton anticipating the hairy chemists intention of shouting a warning had stepped out of the door of his telephone booth and struck the blow the mouselike fellow eased hack inside the folding doors of the booth like a snail writhing into its shell he pretended to be talking into the phone monks collapsing bulk could not help hut attract attention several men raced hack from the cigar counter watches thrust his flat automatic into a coat pocket and bent over monk with an appearance of solicitude help me with him will you he asked the first clerk who came up the man bent to help watches lift monk whats the matter he wanted to know fainted watches said briskly he gets these spells look at the blood the clerk gasped hes hit his head afraid so watches made a tsktsk sound and looked concerned we better get a doctor i watches said in a suavely authoritative voice am his doctor help me with him some of you fellows well put him in my car they carried monk outside to the car watches drove away with him at the telephone booth inside the cigar store the fake policemans conversation with doc savage had proceeded according to plan im omalley he had said i recognize your voice doc savage had replied over the wire will you speak a little closer to the mouthpiece please the gangster requested this connection is not good doc savage raised his voice i still cant hear you the gangster lied maybe if youd talk a little closer still how is this doc savages words were blurred as if his lips were against the mouthpiece thats better said the fake officer now about this beery hosmer killing there is a point or two that i forgot he talked on making conversation concerning the murder of hosmer going over some of the points which he had already discussed with doc savage he heard a crash it was loud brittle such a sound as the telephone at the other end might have made if dropped the man in the blue uniform broke up his monologue and called sharply doc savage there was no answer doc savage the man repeated silence replied then there were excited shouts coming over the wire the noise of men moving about rapidly in doc savages office finally there was a cry hoarse and filled with horror hes dead a voice shrieked doc savage is dead the fake policeman hung up hastily and left the booth ool came out of the adjacent booth did it succeed ool asked it did the other grinned chapter frosted death within the hour watches bowen transporting the unconscious monk was back at the boat at the city island dock he looked around irritably for dimiter daikoff where is the patriot he asked of hamhock piney the fat negro shrugged ponderous shoulders i donno chief the big dark scarred man came in a few minutes later where were you watches snarled out for some air daikoff said gloomily well see if you can start some air circulating in this watches indicated the still unconscious figure of monk the big dark man scowled ferociously when he did this the scar on his neck tightened like something alive he said violence i do not like except to traitors and political foes watches regarded him bleakly you might call this guy a political foe of ours you did a good repair job on honey hamilton see if you can fix this one up too daikoff clicked his heels bowed then commenced expert ministrations to monk watches produced his eightyyearold brandy and poured his own drinks ool and honey hamilton and the fake policeman omalley came in a few minutes later ools face was as dispassionate as usual but honey hamiltons cherubic features were beaming whats the dope watches asked did it work you tell it oolhloney sighed doc savage ool announced is dead you sure watches frowned i know my poisons ool said flatly this one in my land is known as sslytomng that name means the poison that can not fail hes dead all right said omalley i heard his men howling that he had croaked watches breathed heavily and reached for the brandy so savage is out of the way maybe that aint a load off my chest ool youre smart enough to be president of these united states ool nodded i have thought of that perhaps i shall be watches stared well for what ool questioned is to prevent me sure watches muttered a strange gleam coming into his bleak eyes you took me off my feet for a minute by being so casual it is not too much to hope for ool said sure why sure watches said slowly if we put this deal across hell anything is possible watches gulped his drink and his hand trembled on his glass your hand ool said is not steady watches cursed softly youd shake too if you were half human when i think about what we can do if this goes through he reached for another drink now that doc savage is out of the way ool said we have only to appropriate his dirigible and the goggles and leave right he made a gesture indicating simplicity with his pale hands there was a series of five sharp raps at the door they were insistent thats squirrels signal watches said sounds as if something is on him let him in hamhock the corpulent negro waddled over and opened the door and squirrel landed inside like one of his furry namesakes tumbling out of a tree watches he jabbered i seen doc savage and when watches cut since that poison was supposed to have got him where the crook leaders word was a crash i been shadowin his place like you told me he come out and i followed him he turns in at a cable office and sends some radiograms radiograms yeah who to how would i know squirrel asked in an injured tone i couldnt walk in and look watches jerked savagely at his watch chain get me a copy of those radiograms stick up the place or blow the safe or anything but get em ools right hand floated out in squirrels direction in a loathsome moccasin motion his flat voice said ominously if you do not manage better with the radiograms than you did with the goggles he left it unfinished for effect squirrel dorgan shuddered mumbled aw i done my best then he went out hastily watches turned frowning on ool the poison which never fails he began with biting sarcasm ool silenced him with a fluttering of his right hand it was not the poison which failed he said it is your stupid men the fake policeman omalley protested desperately i smeared that poison in the telephone mouthpiece watches rasped there was a slip somewhere hamhock rolled his whitish eyes yassuh an de way things turned out when we all went foah dem goggles ah done mah best to pick em up but dey just wahnt dere even ifn ah could see em ools voice crashed flatly there is another poison from my land a sister poison to this one which has failed we call these poisons the twin sisters the one which has failed is volatized by moisture the other one is turned into a deadly gas by the application of heat i shall prepare the heat poison the goldenfuzzed assassin paused i suggest you watches yourself arrange that doc savage meet the other of the twin sisters we do not want another failure watches glowered ill arrange the introduction all right watches absentmindedly pulled a timepiece from his coat sleeve there was evidently a special pocket in the sleeve the watch was very large of silver and looked ancient watches looked at it appeared to see it for the first time seemed startled and hastily returned it to its concealed sleeve pouch a deep and melancholy voice at ools elbow asked what is the time please mr bowen watches looked around startled he had not heard big dimiter daikoff approach damn it he snapped thats a good way to get yourself a lead vaccination slipping up behind me like that what is the time daikoff asked again unperturbed that watch doesnt tell time the mob chief growled some of my watches tell time some of em i carry for other reasons he held out his wrist where daikoff could see the minute and hour that one keeps time thank you daikoff said he turned and started away even bent over and limping as he did he looked enormous there was an aura of quiet power about him hows the patient watches called after him daikoff paused you mean the man who resembles a huge monkey the one who seems to have been hit over the head sure watches nodded is he gonna croak it is too soon to tell daikoffs deep voice boomed he must remain quiet for a while early that evening squirrel dorgan returned to the moored yacht and put copies of four radiograms in watches hands theyre the ones doc savage sent he said i just walked into the cable office showed a clerk the noisy end of my gun and he coughed up watches scanned the radiograms quickly then cursed with soft deadliness and called ool ools hand after he had read the radiograms crept out instinctively in a butterfly movement but all he said was we have no time to lose well finish him tonight watches rasped thats no pipedream either one of the radiograms was addressed to the royal canadian mounted police detachment at aklavik at the head of the mackenzie river on the arctic coast the other three were addressed to united states government authorities in settlements on the mainland of alaska and on the aleutian islands the text of all four radiograms was the same please send available information regarding gray forestay expedition or any other expedition operating through your territory within last six months stop have you any record of shrunkenfaced abnormally whiteskinned man fine golden hair tall bony remarkably strong flat unnatural voice when speaking english known perhaps as ool stop this information of utmost urgency clark savage jr yeah watches growled after reading the messages again weve got to nail him before he gets a line on you ool shortly before ten oclock that night doc savage and his four aides were gathered in the reception room of the bronze mans eightysixth floor headquarters talking little they were waiting with some impatienceexcept for bigfisted renny who frowned at the telephone from time to time howd you ever get wise to that trick poison doc he boomed the stuff was colorless and it didnt look wet like a liquid did you watch that fake policeman omalley when he was here doc asked renny nodded sure he was not very clever in fumbling the telephone the bronze man said dryly that made me suspicious there was only about one thing he could have been doing so immediately after the man who called himself omalley had departed i disconnected that instrument and substituted another johnny the bigworded archaeologist and geologist fumbled his monocle and murmured i wonder if your chicane histrionics were consummative he means that he wonders if that was a successful act that you put on over the telephone when you had one of us yell that you were dead renny rumbled doc evidently intended to answer but there was an interruption the telephone rang the bronze man got up and swung toward the instrument holy cow renny thumped uneasily watch it maybe theres been some more poison smeared in that mouthpiece it was noticeable that the bronze man stood well away from the instrument as he answered it a shrill whining voice came from the receiver listen guy it said i know who im talkin to see i know your voice that aint all i know either interesting doc said without emotion beery hosmer was my pal the voice whined he got it dirty see he didnt have it comin so im layin a finger on the guy that done it all right doc savage said sharply who are you and what do you know the voice quickened over the telephone think im a sap it demanded all kinds of troubles have a way of lightin on guys like me so i aint tellin no names but you go to that warehouse thing owned by the hidalgo tradin company down on the hudson river water front look for a green coupe see how did you get this information doc asked the other hung up it was half past ten that night when doc savage and his four aides approached the great warehouse hangar the car in which they rode eased along with the silence of an electric lift the bronze man was at the wheel tam renny long tom and johnny were all a little glum because of the absence of monk the fact that doc did not appear worried did not cheer them much because the bronze man rarely showed the emotions which he felt ham tried to cheer himself after all monk dont often get into a spot that he cant get out of yeah renny said monkll come through all right what im worried about is this call from the party who claims to he a friend of beery hosmer right long tom concurred its got some of the earmarks of a phony the car rolled silently a perfectly balanced motor virtually eliminating vibration expert filling of the heavy body and chassis parts assuring no creakings one of the individual features of the car was the fenders of chrome construction able to withstand a terrific collision long toms voice cracked theres a green coupe the green coupe a large one was a block distant and under a streetlight a man leaned out looked behind then turned swiftly and seemed to be giving directions to the driver its that whiteskinned scamp ool long tom barked well pull alongside renny began and no we wont the green coupe with a throaty snarl from its exhaust leaped from the curb gathered speed within a very few seconds it was breaking speed limits doc fed more gas his own car eased silently up to keep pace with the other it began to close the gap between the two machines the green coupe began to rocket through night traffic the car needed no warning siren to secure a rightofway its exhaust roar was ample it cannoned the night with a pounding thunder which would have drowned out a fire siren taxis scurried to the curb pedestrians flattened back against shop windows holding close behind the roaring green coupe docs low sedan was still almost silent renny flourished his supermachine pistol shall i let em have a dose doc shook his head traveling too fast doc fed more gas and more his car drew up alongside the other his intention was obviously to get around the green coupe cut in front and force the machine to the curb but the other car also had speed the driver circumvented docs maneuver by putting on a burst of speed as great as the bronze man had managed white lights green lights red lights streaked past blurred doc commented they have quite a motor under that hood wait until we get on an open road clipped johnny reverting to few syllable words in the excitement of the pursuit in anticipation of violent action he took his monocle from his pocket wrapped it in his handkerchief to protect it from breakage and thrust it back in his pocket the monocle was not an affectation with him in the past before doc savage had exercised his surgical skill to restore complete sight to the wiry geologists left eye injured in the world war johnny had worn eyeglasses the left eyepiece carrying the magnifying glass needing eyeglasses no longer he insisted that he needed the magnifier in his work so he still carried it in the monocle suddenly the air in front of doc savages hurtling car was choked with smoke beams from the powerful lamps were absorbed as completely as the suns rays behind storm clouds the driver of the green coupe was spreading a smoke screen from his exhaust in the fashion devised long ago by ingenious criminals docs car was coursing blindly at nearly a hundred miles an hour the bronze man drove a hand under the instrument panel and touched one of an array of switches concealed there then he wrenched out large somewhat clumsy eyepieces he peered through one of these a fantastic change was wrought a weird light seemed to have suffused the pall of black smoke to a layman it would have smacked of black magic but an electrical engineer would not have been more than surprised at the efficiency of the apparatus for projecting invisible infrared light rays which have the faculty of penetrating smoke and fog to a great degree the eyepieces highly ingenious for making the infralight visible would have been even more interesting to an electrical expert watch out renny shouted suddenly directly ahead crosswise of the street loomed an abandoned truck some one working in collusion with the driver of the green coupe had driven the truck out of a side street and left it anticipating that doc would crash into it head on in the smoke tires squalled on pavement as doc swerved the sedan in an attempt to clear the obstruction no ordinary car could have made it there was a sickening skid they vaulted the curb metal crashed rasped they had glanced off a wall brick dust cascaded the machine rocked nearly went over then it jarred back on the street beyond the truck holy cow renny gasped longwinded johnny blinked his eyes i vouchsafe a kindred articulation the speeding ears were beyond the region of traffic lights now and streaking on open boulevards docs sedan crawled up immediately behind the other ear at their terrific speed telephone poles were almost like pickets in a fence the green coupe lurched a good deal but docs scientifically weighted ear held the road smoothly docs cabled bronze hands eased the wheel over the ear swung around the green coupe came up abreast plainly doc meant to wedge the other car in force it to stop a submachine gun nosed out of the green coupe and a burst of bullets flattened harmlessly against the steel plating and bulletproofed glass of docs vehicle with the speeding cars side by side doc and his men could get a look at their adversaries in the coupe hey thats not ool long tom said tersely theyve chalked somebodys face up to make him look like ool ool would hardly risk his neck with a driver like that one doc said well then what long tom never finished his sentence there was a bump a terrifying swerve a crash a crazy swordslashing of lights in the night as the two cars collided and one of them turned up end for end and rolled like a barrel off the road over a ditch through a hedge of trees and far into a plowed field the insanely reckless driver of the green coupe had tried to shove the other car off the road the trick backfired the other driver had not calculated on docs reinforced fenders it was his own ear which went over docs machine held the road it weaved but not dangerously doc eased down on the brakes cut the lights and brought the car to an abrupt stop what he did then was a surprise slide over here in the drivers seat ham he directed take the ear hack to town you will hear from me at the office he opened the door swung out glided across the road and disappeared in the shadow of a high hedge ham hesitated then drove away carrying with him a puzzled and disgusted long tomn johnny and renny at the scene of the disaster doc savage ascertained that both the driver and gunner were dead killed instantly he was examining the bodies when a peculiar rhythmic drone of a sound assailed his ears doc looked up clearly against the starlit sky he could see a huge shape poised against the night resembling at first a bird with grotesquely whirling wings even as he looked the object settled lower it was a plane an autogyro doc exploded in a burst of furious energy and barely reached the shadows of a grove of trees as a sharp clatter sounded from above and machine gun bullets rapped the ground doc was not carrying one of the machine pistols so much relied upon by his men he preferred to depend for defense on ingenuity and various scientific devices carried in pockets of specially constructed vest since the autogyro was not flying low enough for him to take any effective measures against it he contented himself with outguessing the machine gun bursts repeatedly bullets snarled through the massed leaves tracing patterns of death but the bronze man kept clear after a few minutes of ineffectual firing the autogyro lifted and skimmed away to the west still flying low not more than two minutes later doc saw it poise then drop lazily to the earth in almost vertical decent leaving his evergreen shelter doc ran for the spot where the autogyro had landed the distance was not great and eventually he located the windmill plane the craft had settled in a farm lot in a shallow valley not far off the road there was a house close by doc approached cautiously the moon added to the brilliance of the stars he heard a man curse then heard his own name spoken doc savage in evident alarm a window went black in the farmhouse a man ran out and was joined by another outside the two started racing across the farm lot in the direction of the autogyro then one of them stopped caught the other by the arm and pulled him in the opposite direction nix the armpullers words wafted clearly to doc we cant land in the gyro where we wanta go the hell with it well take the car the men ran stumbling to the road doc following them heard the whine of a starter then the silencewrecking roar of a motor and a clashing of gears as a car got under way the headlights switched on doc was able to recognize the two men ool and watches bowen the car droned away blurring into black distance after satisfying himself that he was alone doc savage ran toward the autogyro he examined it carefully he devoted particular attention to the controls he found a bomb attached to the starter in such a way that it would have exploded at the first revolution the bomb explained the act which watches bowen and ool had put on in the farm lot the performance had been calculated to decoy the bronze man into following the fleeing car with the autogyro it was just one more murder attempt doc savage entered the house and began a searching examination of the rooms it seemed to be a small tenant farmers house deserted now used judging from the litter about as an occasional hideout by watches bowen the white beam of his flashlight poked everywhere in the room where he had seen the light go out papers on the floor and more papers on a timescarred desk made it look as if the criminals in their haste to clear out had been forced to leave documents behind doc picked one of the papers from the floor light from the hand flash washed over it revealing a maze of handwriting and figures apparently some of watches bowens calculations doc gathered all papers on the floor and carried them to the desk there was a lamp on the desk with an electric bulb in it evidently there was an electric plant on the farm for greater convenience doc laid down his flash and turned on the electric light it was a dim bulb heavily frosted doc bent close to the light while sorting over the papers so intent was he upon the documents that he did not see the faint vapor which crept out from the frosted bulb as it warmed he did notice it finally his arm slashed out he smashed the bulb in his bare hand but the vapor was already in the air the bronze man took two staggering steps then keeled over to lie inert on the floor chapter the patriot unmasked ool and watches bowen did not drive into town when they fled the farmhouse but turned into a nearby side road from where after parking their machine they circled back to the farmhouse on foot arriving in time to watch from a distance as doc savage turned on the lamp at the desk when they heard the solid thump of his body as it struck the floor they came charging in they stared triumphantly at the bronze mans prostrate form the second of the twin sisters got him ool spoke tonelessly watches voice had a rasp in it after this ool i vote for you and your fancy poisons every time when that fool coupe driver got himself wrecked i was ready to quit watches collected his personal papers which had formed the fire then he approached the body of doc savage lets lug it out to the car he suggested tot ether the two bent over docs heavy frame what happened next neither ool nor watches could have correctly detailed there was a nightmare sensation as though the roof had fallen on them and a tornado had funneled its way into the room vaguely of course they knew that doc savage was not dead the corded muscles of the bronze man which had been slacked in apparent helplessness as he lay upon the floor had suddenly become galvanized with uncalculable force both ool and watches bowen were strong men but they were helpless the instant a metallic hand closed over the throat of each their blood seemed to turn to water their muscles got limp as rags their eyes bulged in purpling faces their tongues ran out doc with an unexpected movement cracked their heads together they lost consciousness searching the pair doc relieved them of weapons then he devoted much timeto an examination of ools right hand the hand which the thin strangely whiteskinned man seemed never to keep still he found nothing peculiar about the hand the bronze man dragged the two senseless forms to the autogyro and calmly detached the bomb from the starting mechanism he flew his two captives back to the city landing in a vacant lot conveniently near his own waterfront warehouse hangar he took a closed car from the big building and loaded the captives aboard in the skyscraper headquarters ham johnny long tom and renny stared as doc issued from his private elevator with his two prisoners in tow doc slumped the pair of limp forms on the floor long tom the electrical wizard was first to speak you sure did a heavy nights work doc he said let us hope it is all over but the questioning doc said bigfisted renny handed over a sheaf of radiograms these came in answer to the radiograms you sent up north he told the bronze man they give us something to go on when we start questioning these two the messages were all very long and all alike in one respect they all conveyed the information that no expedition other than the lenderthorn party had left the arcticamerican coast in recent months one message carried a surprise it described the members of the lenderthorn party the descriptions were unmistakable lenderthorn the explorer had been no other person than watches bowen himself assisting him had been a lieutenant who resembled ool to perfection the expedition had taken off by plane and had not been heard from since the message stated one radiogram from point barrow on the north alaskan coast contained additional information regarding ool the weirdly whiteskinned man so the radiogram informed had arrived myseriously into the settlement some months ago ool had carried a strange pair of black goggles he had been acting strangely seeming to have not the slightest idea of what modern life was like and being unable to speak any intelligible language but during the short time he had remained there he had learned language and customs with amazing rapidity he had refused to divulge much information about himself except to infer vaguely that he had come from off the arctic ice pack which obviously was a lie it being regarded as an impossibility he had disappeared from the settlement as mysteriously as he had come several strange deaths among the eskimo population had been credited by them to ool but this was thought to be superstitious fancy on their part since no direct evidence of ools guilt could be obtained and fatalities in each case having been attended by severe local inflammation and swelling and no autopsies having been performed death had been credited by settlement authorities to pernicious infection or simple blood poisoning renny jarred his huge fists together restlessly what say we take a trip doc over over the arctic ice pack long tom supplied we can use the new dirigible ham added for the specific purposes johnny finished grandly of investigating the mysterious origin of one malicious malefactor having golden hirsute adornment not to mention delving into the mystery of a certain pair of goggles and alleged mysterious things ham jump docs voice was a crash of sound ham jumped suddenly without question the dapper lawyer leaped a yard in the air ool clutched his ankle at about the halfyard level ham fell violently sprawling his full length on the floor his sword cane clattering out of his hand he kicked but he could not shake ools relentless grip from his ankle hold it ham doc rasped do not move ham lay still ool spoke you have done well to order him to lie still he droned now listen to me you have witnessed my strength i did not stay long unconscious like this other one he indicated watches bowens limp form i could give you he continued speaking with his sepulchral lack of tone a more deadly exhibition of my powers if i had reached for your man with my right hand instead of my left he would now be dead so try no tricks on me bronze man you could kill meyes but not before i could kill this man of yours what do you want doc asked quietly first the goggles without further argument doc went into the laboratory and returned with the goggles he tossed them to ool you have discrimination ool said flatly i could wish i had you for a partner instead of watches bowen what else do you want escape that is all ool spoke like an inefficient phonograph i am not greedy i might bargain with you for your dirigible but that would incur complications i prefer to consolidate my gains and strike another time you propose to do what now doc asked i am going to move back and enter your elevator ool said i shall drag watches bowen and i shall drag your man also my right hand is death understand but you have my word that it will function only if you interfere with my escape what do you intend doing with ham doc demanded i do not want him nor do i wish to encourage reprisals from you by killing him if you do not interfere with my escape i shall leave him at the bottom of the elevator shaft unhurt is it agreed above everything else doc savage was solicitous about the safety of his aides it is agreed he said without further words ool backed out of the door with his human burdens entered an elevator and sank the eightysix stories to the ground eventually the elevator came back to the eightysixth floor ham was in it lashed with his back to the handrail lets go after that scut renny roared crowding into the elevator doc vetoed the proposal not now i have other plans you men wait the bronze man got them out then went down alone in the cage docs aides crowded about ham firing queries that whilefaced deathfingered fellow isnt human ham shuddered aboard watches bowens moored yacht dimiter daikoff the big dark scarred patriot moved swiftly to bring out more eightyyearold brandy as watches bowen and ool tramped aboard and shoved noisily through the door watches was in a savage mood his neck was swelling from doc savages choking and his head felt like a thousand steel mallets were knocking on it he gulped the brandy greedily some stuff them twin sisters of yours he snarled at ool there is no known poison in your world more deadly than the twin sisters ool replied then how conic savage snapped out of it so quick watches demanded he did not come out of it what do you mean he never was under the influence of it no man can embrace either of the twin sisters and live you mean he faked it pretended to be knocked out in order to get us in there and nab us obviously then somethings gone screwy as hell watches snarled theres a leak somewhere savage has been tipped off to every plan weve made the mob leaders hand clawed at the front of his vest jerked fiercely at his gold watch chain dimiter daikoff came forward silently proffering cigarettes but watches knocked the package out of his hand youre beginning to get under my skin he rasped hold onto your nerves ool cautioned he produced the goggles from his pocket we have these that is one important thing watches continued to stare malevolently at dimiter daikoff at the scar on his neck the tragicallyglowing dark eyes the high cheek bones hollow cheeks the superb muscular power that even the swarthy mans illfitting suit could not hide shortly afterward dimiter daikoff found occasion to leave the cabin watches bowen jerked a thumb after him savage knows too much he evidently finds out our plans he said i wonder if the leak could be that damned patriot ool showed no emotion but asked need we take chances hell no watches growled will shake hands with him when he returns ool said emotionlessly i will use my right hand dimiter daikoff came back after a time and ool stood up i wish to compliment you on the excellent serving of the brandy he said shake hands with me if you will dimiter daikoff was standing very close he reached out readily to take ools proffered hand but at the last instant the big patriots forwardreaching hand swerved but down toward the goggles in ools left hand his flashing grab was accurately directed he got the goggles all in the same motion it seemed he lunged to one side and his other hand clawed out and caught watches by the throat he jerked the thickwaisted gangster clear of the floor for the second time that evening watches bowen thought a tornado had funneled into the room and was stirring splintered timbers about his head the big dark mans throat grip tightened until the room was a red blur in watches bulging eyes then ool sliced toward dimiter daikoff with his right hand fluttering watches felt himself lifted hurled he crashed against ool knocked him down watches worked his jaw spasmodically trying to talk when he wrenched words out they came in a hoarse rasp its doc savage he choked yes came the tragicvoiced patriots affirmation it is doc savage upon hearing the struggle monk came charging in from the other cabin where he had been lying on a bed in pretended convalescence grab a chair monk doc called out hold it in front of you ools touch is death ool scrambled to his feet ahead of watches crouching he sidled in toward doc with his right hand weaving like the head of a coiled moccasin doc did not wait for an attack he hurled forward avoided the moccasin thrust of the assassin and thudded bronze knuckles on ools jaw ool reeled back collapsed against the wall but he sprang up catquick and sidled in again had doc been able to throw more weight into the jaw punch doc unnaturally strong though he was would have caved in then as ool slunk in for a second attack doc drew out one of the small glass bulbs which were his anesthetic bombs he snapped it to the floor it shattered doc held his breath hold your breath ool yelled at watches bowen doc had half expected this recalling that in his office ool had survived one of the bombs in similar fashion doc made a pass at ool dodged the assassins finger thrust as before and planted a clean blow to the face an ordinary man would have been knocked out ool was only flung back against the wall badly shaken his endurance was tremendous at the same instant monk with his chair rushed watches the gangster had gained his feet and was whirling the watch which had been in the secret pocket up his sleeve since escaping with ool from doc savages office watches had not rearmed himself with an automatic he did not appear to be concerned about it his lips writhed in a killers snarl as he opened his hand and let the watch fly the watch was one of bowens pet weapons the mechanism had been removed from the case and a quantity of molten lead inserted bowen could hurl the watch as accurately as he could aim a revolver the leaded watch plummeted toward monk with the speed of a projectile monk ducked as the missile struck his chair the watch splintered entirely through the thin wicker of the boat chair and struck monk lightly on the chest monk bellowed came in with the chair as a batteringram the gangster lurched to one side the chair scraped his shoulder and went into the wall with such force that the legs splintered the cabin sheathing the gangsters hand dipped to his wide coat pocket it whipped out clutching another leaded watch there was a chain attached it was the gangsters habit to use the weighted timepiece as a substitute for a blackjack he swung the unique weapon at monks head jerking the chair around monk sideswiped the clumsy weapon in a vicious swing at the gangster the chair knocked the leaded timepiece from watches bowens fist and went on to thud heavily against his shoulder the gangster reeled back there was a jangle of breaking glass as his heavy bulk crashed into a porthole at the same moment doc savage eluding ools fourth successive moccasin jab sent the tall pale man crashing to the wall ool struggled up again but now noticeably weakened watches bowens voice roared in savage desperation the hell with the goggles ool lets get out of here the gang chief hurled his heavy bulk backward out the broken oversize porthole jangling the rest of the glass pane to the floor ool made a gangling lunge to the door outside they tumbled headfirst into a speedboat which was moored under the stern give her the gun watches yelled frantically there was a sudden roar as the speedboat engine came to life a machine gun stuttered out it must have been lying in the boat the rain of slugs drove doc and monk fiat on the deck the speedboat running without lights roared swiftly away with water piling up in its wake doc and monk stood on the deck and stared after it before monks admiring eyes doc savage obliterated the dimiter daikoff disguise he gouged from his mouth the wadding which had produced the effect of high cheek bones a deft movement of his thumb and finger removed a pair of dark glass cuplike lenses which had fitted snugly over his eyeballs a chemical paste cleared the last trace of blackness from his bronze hair he peeled off the collodionmanufactured scar which slanted from the lobe of his ear down across his neck monk grinned the patriot unmasked he said i didnt know you myself at first as dimiter daikoff say was there sure enough a dimiter daikoff the police radio calls were legitimate doc supplied i merely took advantage of them to gain watches bowens confidence an hour later from an obscure long island airport there sounded the multiple drone of airplane engines as a big ship massive of hull and with a wide wing spread barely cleared the twinkling line of lights marking the edge of the landing field under its heavy weight of men and fuel the ship rose sluggishly circling the field and gaining altitude then it put on speed and throbbed away into the northwest for passengers the ship carried watches bowen ool hamhock piney honey hamilton squirrel dorgan and four other men nine of them and a pilot as vicious an assortment of criminals as had ever disgraced a good plane it was some hours before johnny checking the airports and railway stations at docs suggestion learned of the planes departure chapter ii arctic procession like a moonbeam caught up congealed and set adrift again a cruising dirigible a silver sliver against the bleak subarctic sky droned over the canadian northwest at a rate of speed highly unusual for such ships the speed of the dirigible almost two hundred miles an hour was achieved through improved propulsion power and lessened wind resistance doc savage had personally developed the alloy motors and doc with help from monk had succeeded in synthesizing an inflating gas noninflammable with substantially greater lifting power than helium or hydrogen at the settlement of resolution on great slave lake the silver dirigible nosed down for refueling doc and his five inquiring aides learned there that a twomotored transport plane carrying ten men had touched for gas and oil two hours before them ool and watches bowen monk muttered deduction corroborated johnny agreed in the air again boring into the northwest the slender dirigible was like a bright needle threading together a thousandmile line of tall spruces and black monzonite ridges hour after hour the craft drilled over the great lonely land rising higher as it approached the alaskan border in order to clear the yukon rockies in the cabin enclosed in the hull doc and his aides were comfortable ham was at the controls long tom in charge of radio communications kept in regular contact with ground stations for the purpose of determining weather conditions over their intended line of flight there was no great need for this however since the streamlined bag cut down wind resistance greatly over conventional designs rendering the craft easily manageable in any wind less than a hurricane appointed by doc as navigator for the trip renny spent much time looking over charts monk did nothing more creative than to recline in his bunk and tickle the ear of his pet pig with his toe the pig habeas corpus by name had missed the hostilities in new york the reason was unusual a certain famous psychologist amazed at the intelligence which the porker seemed to possess had requested in all seriousness permission to seclude the pig for study not less than fifty times monk had told all who would listen of the learned mans findings the guy said habeas was a wizard of a hog monk repeated he said that habeas ham snarled will you shut up about that porky freak you missing link monk only grinned habeas corpus was a remarkable sight to behold he was a runty razorback with the snout of a possum legs of a stag and great flapping ears that took the wind when he ran and looked like they were going to fly away with him habeas corpus reacting contentedly to monks foot massaging emitted soft grunts whenever monk went on a trip he took habeas habeas corpus was an intelligent porker monk had trained him until he could perform things which amazed those whose acquaintance with porkers had been limited to a slab of bacon monk shifted his administrations from habeas corpuss left ear to the right then asked doc have you any idea where were gonna run into that gang yes doc answered i have huh monk squirmed after we leave point barrow i thought we were going to run blind we will cruise over the ice pack using our radio direction finder in an attempt to locate specific static disturbances doc said where in blazes did you get onto that hunch the information doc supplied was contained on some papers of watches bowens which i examined while playing the part of dimiter daikoff it was not a clear clue exactly the paper was a bill for such a direction finder that had been built for watches bowen maybe its a phony maybe the bronze man made a slight gesture we have no better clue learn anything else monk asked very little as applies to this case you didnt find out what the goggles were for regrettably no habeas corpus made insistent gruntings monk resumed his lazy rubbing of the porkers ear id give the curl out of habeass tail the homely chemist declaimed to know what those goggles are good for bigfisted renny looked up from his charts listen doc he said have you the slightest idea of what is behind all of this the bronze man shook his head slowly that is not yet clear be said at point barrow on the north alaskan coast the silver dirigible settled down for its last refueling as in resolution doc learned here that watches bowens plane had preceded him by a short time and since it was from point barrow that the radiogram had been transmitted to doc concerning the original appearance into civilization of ool doc made further inquiries in particular he contacted an old scotch fur trader who had harbored ool for a time in his cabin and who knew the north alaskan coast as few men did i understand doc said that it is considered an impossibility for ool to have come off the ice pack as he claimed aye tis that the rosychecked old scot replied pleased to have the famous bronze man coming to him for information why on account of nae mon could wihstand the exposure explained the trader doc nodded i know no food no fuel chunkedup ice to make hard traveling open leads where a man might slip into the water a wind like rawhide it would be beyond human endurance for a man to make the trip you think aye tis selfevident mon the arctic pack lies unexplored tae this day a dead white space on the map doc nodded again what is your idea about it where do you think ool came from the old scot shrugged gnarled shoulders in my life i ha seen strange things but ool be the strangest doc held up the goggles have you seen these the old scots face lighted with recognition ool had such things the sun he said hurt his eyes he lay in my cabin for a solid week not venturing out that was when first he came off the ice pack but i thought you said it was impossible for him to have come off the pack aye the old scot replied imperturbably but where else could he ha come from doc looking intently at the man said nothing the trader met docs goldflecked eyes without flinching he said i know not certain tis there be more of the devil to ool than of mon or the heavenly speerit at first this ool were not like a human being what do you mean doc asked there were such things like this fire ool tried to catch it in his hand as though it were a bird when he got sos he could talk a bit he said he had never before seen fire such things as that why did he leave you the old scots face grimaced i drove him out at the end my shotgun why i was afeered a him one day i picked up his goggles hem curious worthless things they be you canna see through them but he came at me wi sech a unholy look in his flat eyes and his handthe right hand i mind twasreachin out for me somehow like a snake it gave me the shudders i tossed him the goggles and drove him out taking the air again doc headed his silver dirigible out over the sea at point barrow in a northerly direction after a few hours above the desolate arctic pack which looked from their great height like a sink full of chipped ice he turned on his radio direction finder a hodgepodge of noises conventional static disturbances came through the loudspeaker there were buzzes and burrs and whines and crackles but they could have been duplicated at almost any point on the earth suddenly the dirigible filled with a soft low note which throbbed and ran high up the musical scale and back again the sound was not new static disturbance but doc savages trilling that weird sound so unconsciously a part of him which he made in moments of surprise or puzzlement the bronze mans inordinately sensitive ears conditioned by intensive training to catch sounds above and below the usual range considered possible for human reception had identified a peculiar static sound coming from the finder to docs aides the finder continued to pour out the usual din of static but doc turning the loop device gave steering directions to johnny at the controls johnny swung the dirigible in a more westerly direction within an hour the eerie static disturbance which at first only doc had heard was audible to all it came over the loudspeaker in a high rhythmic thrumming each note being throttled off in an entirely unearthly manner only to swell again in a fashion even more unearthly as johnny drove the dirigible toward the sound the noise grew louder filling the gondola with its strange pulsing clamor it grew so insistent that doc cut down the loudspeaker volume control to almost the absolute minimum there came a moment when monk let out an excited bellow standing in the rear of the gondola looking out behind the pleasantly ugly chemist had been experimenting with the strange goggles trying them on his eyes squinting ogling attempting in every way possible to see through the thick lenses of obsidianlike blackness whats eating you ham clipped startled at monks show of excitement down here everybody look monk clamored without turning around look where renny complained i dont see anything are you blind monk blared right below us youre crazy long tom put in theres nothing there but ice dont kid me at a time like this monk howled see that pillar of fire it must be a hundred feet high what is it fire fire on the ice yeah comin out of the ice its kind of weaving not like regular flame more like liquid fire ham laughed derisively a column of liquid fire a hundred feet high coming out of the ice nuts theres nothing there at all only ice and some fog monk turned around angrily to face lam in the gondola he could not see ham he became conscious then that he was wearing the black goggles he pawed off the goggles and pointed downward right down there look he stared himself his jaw fell blazes he ejaculated gone now docs compelling voice broke in let me have those goggles monk monk handed them over doc adjusted them quickly to his eyes looked down his weird trilling note throbbed through the gondola one after another the bronze man had his aides look down through the goggles expressions of confused surprise and awe came from each well ill be a pork chop off monks pig ham exclaimed each man when he looked through the goggles saw precisely what monk had seen a tall writhing column of what was apparently liquid fire issuing from the ice when the goggles were removed from the eyes the column of fire disappeared what is it monk gasped i do not know doc said flatly it certainly is not a gas flame he continued studying the phenomenon through the black goggles nose the dirigible down johnny slack speed and float in as close as you can it looks like this clears up the mystery of the black goggles renny said excitedly ool needed them to locate this place i think there is more to it than that renny doc answered at closer range the thing which seemed to be fire took on more detail there seemed to be a living liquid whitehot core swelling out smoothly in a golden blush tinged with flashes of opalescenceglazed yellows purples reds greens and blues the predominating tone however was golden not so much the gold of solid flame but as of a thick fog in which every separate particle of moisture was a floating globule of gold at about the hundredfoot level the writhing pillar in a thinning golden haze blurred into nothingness johnny had nosed down to a hundred feet and drifted in as close as he dared from the low height it was apparent that the pillar whatever it was issued from a rock crevice a long black rent in the dismal welter of pack ice was clearly identifiable as rock work the dirigible in closer doc directed he adjusted the black goggles to johnnys eyes to make the mysterious flame visible to him yeah but doc well burn johnny objected in quick dismay but he did as doc suggested closer and closer the silver dirigible floated until in johnnys eyes it was very close to the weirdly writhing flame with motors idling and the dirigibles silver sides bathed in the living golden glow doc pointed to the sensitized thermometer visible on the outside of the gondola wall heat monk squalled then it is a fire it is only up to room temperature doc corrected there is no flame as we know it enough to give a guy the jitters monk grunted a flame a hundred feet high making no noise giving off no more heat than a hotair register and not even visible unless youre looking at it through black goggles johnny lost his trepidation and sent the dirigible directly into the mysterious light which was visible only through the goggles nothing happened they flew down lower seeking to examine the cleft in the ice from which the thing came this it developed was larger than had at first appeared it was many feet wide more than a half a mile long so interested were the occupants of the dirigible in examining the source of the fiery plume that the new development all but took them by surprise here doc savage said sharply and lunged for the controls let me have them whats wrong johnny demanded doc pointed look the bigworded geologist stared ill be superamalgamated he exploded a plane was hurtling toward them it was a gray machine hard to distinguish against the leaden sky it came on swiftly details became distinguishable watches bowen doc decided it answers the description of the craft in which he came from new york holy cow renny exploded its gonna be tough if theyre carrying much artillery they will be careful not to cripple the dirigible doc said positively remember they have wanted this ship from the first and the only way they can get it gaunt long tom said is to cripple us renny bounced his big fists together thats a job they wont find easy doc settled the dirigible downward hey johnny gulped youre going down into the crack that flame is comin out of but to all except johnny the landing process appeared to be merely an expert maneuvering job in clear air to the electrical wizard wearing the black goggles the silver sliver carrying its freight of human lives was nesting down in a bath of fire as softly as a leaf falling through a golden autumn haze the dirigible came to rest on the crevice floor chapter the golden goddess the crevice made a snug shelter for the dirigible they tied down the bag doc with long toms assistance removed a few delicate parts from the silver crafts ignition system parts necessary for the operation of the dirigible since there were no other similar motors in the world the removal of these key parts rendered the dirigible positively theftproof overhead watches bowens plane wheeled slowly like a huge buzzard hung between the pale glaze of the sky and the leaden gray of the farstretching ice pack they must be waiting for us to move away from the dirigible monk decided johnny had been busy studying the rock formation with his monocle magnifier the wiry geologist was an expert field man as well as a theoretician his geological experience now bore fruit the configuration of this rock cleft indicates a substantial cavern opening may be expected at about that point his lean hand indicated doc agreed we seem to be on an uncharted island or rocky reef thrust up through the ice pack the steady current of warm air along this crevice is of sufficient volume to indicate the presence of an underground labyrinth docs goldflecked eyes squinted up at watches bowens circling craft now and again the plane wheeling above was momentarily obscured doc eyed his men you have your emergency packs they nodded monk said ill put habeas corpus under my coat the next time their plane is out of sight doc warned we will make a break we might as well look this place over while we are here they watched tensely the plane drifted out of sight doc said all right they made their dash the plane sliced into view before doc and his aides quite reached their objective they were sighted by the flying crooks machine guns from above with a macabre cackle gun sound pummeled against the sides of the rocky crevasse rock chips mingled with spattering lead as doc and his men lunged for the safety of a great overhang they made it safely but at the last instant a flying rock chip struck sharply against monks coat habeas corpus was on that side the ungainly shoat squealed in pain flounced and fell out landing heavily he roiled about squealing under the leaden hail monk from his position of safety within the cavern entrance called frantically and when the animal dazed did pot respond monk leaped out like an anthropoid ape springing from a tree bullets slashed around him one went through his coat he paid no heed with the ease of an anthropoid picking up a coconut the homely chemist swept up the pig and lunged back for the cavern mouth he made it ham groaned in pretended disappointment for a minute he said thought we were going to have pork chops for supper monk glared breathing heavily some day you twobit shyster youll make one crack too many against this hog above them the noisy airplane motors cut out the sudden stillness seemed to press down like something tangible alive the arctic hush which lay interminable over the desert of ice was broken only by the soft complaining whine of wind in struts and wires as the huge plane dipped down and leveled off theyre going to crash ham exclaimed yeah monk growled but theyre comin down in the cleft there was a cracking as the undercarriage of watches bowens plane was wrenched from the fuselage by contact with uprearing ice cakes frozen into position as solidly as though they were cement the plane nosed half over poised like an offbalanced bird then flopped back tilting on one crumpled wing the door in the side of the cabin burst open the mobsters spilled out half leaping half falling all carried submachine guns its dog eat dog now renny rumbled and his long puritanical face grew more mournful than ever in anticipation of the fight yeah monk agreed notice where they landed we gotta smear em to get back to our ship they would not have risked landing if we had not come down first doc said they probably have been aware that we were trailing them across canada long tom nodded their radio receiving set could have picked up our communications with ground stations doc whipped out his flashlight and turned it on the darker recess below the ledge hey renny boomed that looks like that cavern johnny was predicting that watches bowen had not acted without forethought soon became evident one of the men was carrying a wooden ease he opened this and produced a weapon resembling a shotgun he charged the barrel with a slender rod to which was attached a cylinder resembling that on a skyrocket he aimed at the ledge and fired the results were cataclysmic for the man had shot a rifle grenade there was a tremendous concussion rock fell frozen ice and some snow clouded up holy cow renny boomed wed better get back inside theyve got us in a spot well see how far back this goes doc agreed but wait well insure that they dont entomb us in here in a loud voice the bronze man now yelled at watches bowen and his followers conveying the information that important parts had been removed from the dirigible they wont blast the roof down on us now for fear of damaging the parts he said they moved back into the cavern it was small at first and gave indications of playing out i sure hate to leave that dirigible ham said anxiously it is perfectly safe doc assured since they expect to be the ones to ride back in it they will be careful not to cripple it doc monk said lets stay here and fight it out nothing would be gained by making a stand doc pointed out they would use those grenades if they could do so without burying us k doc monk said resignedly but im craving heavy action you may get it ham reminded if we run into a pack of the black things back in here ham spoke half jokingly with no inkling that the time was close when he was to take the black things in anything but a joking way the relatively narrow granite cleft which they had entered led into a limestone labyrinth they produced flashlights the caverns progressed down at a sharp angle and widened out into rooms of aweinspiring proportions it was suddenly not at all cold stalactites and stalagmites looked like massive ivory columns there were whole domes of crystalline formation which glittered like massed diamonds under the prying glare of the flashlight beams some of the rooms were cathedral arched and so high that the white pencil paths of light from the hand flashes could not delineate them monk craned his hull neck ill rapt admiration king solomons temple must of been like this he said and turned to call to habeus corpus who was lagging behind yeah he continued soulfully this sure would be a swell setup for a harem you would think of that ham said dryly aware of monks weakness for women singly or in numbers echoes bounded back and forth between the cavern walls in a bewildering and oftentimes frightening manner foot scufflings and voices going out into the air and being wafted back in distorted sound splashes doc in a low voice called a halt nobody talk he ordered no one did talk and no one moved yet disturbingly the echoes of foot scufflings and garbled conversation did not cease in fact as they waited there listening the echoes grew alarmingly they welled to a veritable clamor i thought so doc said guardedly the echoes are not all our own from the sound of them long tom whispered watches bowen and his gang must have stumbled onto a shortcut they sound close they are close doc affirmed the bronze man conferred for a moment under his breath with johnny on a question of geology although doc as a result of his exhaustive studies his selfimposed mental physical and emotional discipline had accumulated a store of knowledge greater in every case than that of his five aides he nevertheless consulted frequently with them on questions involving their specialty he did this because he was a thorough man who preferred to check his reasonings on the present geological question doc and johnny came to quick agreement come on doc called out and whipped his light ahead as he led off into a cavern which narrowed rapidly as they hurried along renny casting backward glances in the darkness caught a glimpse of a flashlight carried by one of the pursuing gangsters they are close he rapped look behind the others looked they were not quick enough to see the white beam of the flashlight but were quick enough to see the saffron flare which coughed from the muzzle of an automatic pursued by roaring echoes the bullet slammed down the narrow entry past the heads of doc and his aides making musical sounds against hanging stalactites down on the floor doc ordered douse the lights more saffron flashes bloomed at gun tips and more bullets slammed with echoing thunder down the narrow stone corridor back up doc called to his men around the bend here find cover before you open with your superfirers as they felt around in the dark and flopped behind protecting rocks the saffron blobs which marked the exploding pistols of their enemies became obscured by slow angry streaks of red as the gangsters opened up with their machine guns lead and flying rock chips sprayed the rock tunnel echoes resembled close thunder loud above everything else sounded the bullfiddle bellow of docs supermachine pistols as his aides returned the fire pale greenishgold flares fanned out from the heavy snouts of the strange mercy weapons the efficient superfirers manned expertly by docs men were having an effect back at the crooks end of the rock corridor watches bowen cursed savagely and gave his men word to hold up their fire until they could determine the extent of their injuries his words were plainly audible docs men quit firing also slamming echoes settled down like thunder rolling away the attackers counted up their losses three men knocked out by their damned mercy bullets watches bowen grated find better cover you birds no wait his voice stabbed with soft intensity speech echoes of doc and his men were wafting clearly to the attackers from down the tunnel they were echoes of alarm long tom was talking ive been back a few rods with doc he barked we examined the rock walls and this is a deadend tunnel you mean it dont lead nowhere monk demanded loudly right long tom agreed the only way we can get out is the way we came in and that gang has that opening blocked with machine guns ham clipped holy cow rennys huge voice roared aint there no way out back here at all even docs cautioning voice was picked up by the malicious echoes and carried back clearly to watches avidly listening mob do not speak so loud doc warned they will hear us we will have to keep them from knowing the jam we are in back at the open end of the tunnel watches bowen became galvanized in action this is our chance watches purred hamhock youre carrying that grenade gun well blow this opening shut the fat negros appreciative voice echoed back lock dem in dar foah a hundred yeahs huh lock em in hell watches whispered well close it up then give em a day or two to think it over theyll be ready to say uncle when we blast it open again watches selected a crack rupture of which would cave in the entry hamhock took careful aim careful though watches and his men had been to speak in undertones the cavern echoes had carried their voices monks reckless voice sounded lets charge em doc i aint cravin to be locked in here do not be a fool monk echoed docs chastising voice we could never get through in the face of half a dozen machine guns we could clip some of em with our superfirers monk pleaded desperately what good would that do doc reasoned logically in the end theyd wipe us all out what are we gonna do then renny bawled do nothing we will stay here and take our chances with the explosion it is the only thing we can do watches bowens malignant voice crashed loud in the tunnel he was not speaking to his men this time he was speaking to doc this is the payoff he yelled savage you can come out or stay there take your choice doc made no reply a thundering detonation came as hamhock used the grenade gun there was a blaze of flame tunnel ceiling came down the walls heaved all the way to the far back end of the tunnel the rock crashed down choking the passage so completely that an object so small as a rat could not have escaped crushing destruction the cataclysm was far greater than watches bowen had expected watches bowen and his men were thrown off their feet by the terrific forces of the explosion sound throbs assailed their ears with a force almost strong enough to crack their eardrums white limestone dust billowed the sound salvos wafted away finally dust settled the crooks flashlights streamed over the piled rock wreckage choked from floor to roof watches shrieked those dirigible parts theyre buried ool spoke up quietly we are dumb fools if given sufficient time we cannot fashion new parts but it would be much better if we had the black goggles well get by watches muttered lets get away from this dust we might as well go in it ool yes ool said we will go in now guided by ool watches and his men carrying the three men made temporarily unconscious by the mercy slugs turned into another of the caverns and stumbled hastily along the rockstrewn floor their flashlights cut fantastic white swaths in the stygian gloom ool was following certain trail marks vague scratches a pile of rocks here and there his manner his sureness indicated he himself had placed the guiding marks the labyrinthian chambers were empty dead devoid of all life or living matter everywhere under the flashlight glare the walls floor and roof showed coldly with a kind of leaden glaze dis heah place give a man creeps hamhock piney asserted rolling his eyes uneasily dats accordin to any mans figurin these particular caverns ool said enigmatically are known as the land of the lost no man penetrates them far and comes out alive but yoall done dat very ting hamhock insinuated plaintively i did ool agreed i was the first to do so the crook party continued onward for hours suddenly ool paused in mid stride he stood looking down watches bowen coming close behind bumped into him before he could stop whats the matter the crook leader asked ools long arm pointed to the floor watches looked then cursed nervously the others crowded about staring clearly defined in white rock dust on the floor were footprints small footprints delicately formed the maker of the prints had apparently been wearing skintight moccasins the indentations showed a firmly modeled heel high arch and five toes as uncramped and rounded as a childs but the mature spacing of the footprints as they led off into one of the side chambers revealed clearly they were not the prints of a child what could sona be doing here the whitefaced mans flat voice actually carried a modicum of emotion sona watches questioned ool indicated barely discernible webbed markings in the footprints it is sona he stated positively she and she only is privileged to wear footgear with the imperial design in the weaving who in the hell is sona watches wanted to know ool flashing his light in the direction of the disappearing footprints did not answer instead he said she passed a few minutes ago his arm waved out to call attention ahead to a fine haze of rock dust which hung in the air with a crystalline glitter yes she was here very recently come we will get her he turned in the direction taken by the footprints he loped along in an ungainly manner the others followed closely it was a mere matter of minutes before they sighted their quarrya girl she ran at their approach she had long flowing hair gold in hue and she was clothed in some sort of gossamery stuff which clung close moulding lithesome curves as she ran she wore goggles with enormously thick lenses at watches direction honey hamilton chopped a few machine gun bullet over the girls head the caverns had narrowed down at this place the gun thunder was terrific the girl did not stop and it was evident that bullets and gun thunder were something strange in her experience outrun her watches rapped eventually they did that they seized her held her ool approached with his deadly right hand fluttering in butterflylike motion the girl recoiled it was evident that the butterfly gesture was not new to her ool said something to the girl in an unintelligible gibberish the goggles which she wore were similar to the ones which ool had possessed their grotesqueness contrasted oddly with the softly exquisite curve of her cheeks with her natural blond complexion ool snatched the goggles from her eyes with such ferocity that he left a red scratch on her smooth cheek then turned to watches to have run across her is such luck as i could never have hoped for he said its as clear as manhattan mud to me watches growled who the hell is she she is sona ool said in your socalled civilization she would be called princess sona the gang chiefs mind began to work along his conventionally lawless pattern say he exploded somebody oughta exactly ool interrupted we will hold her hostage to guarantee our own safety and to bargain for that which we want sure watches emphasized tugging at the gold chain which sprawled across his vest that which may make you boss of the u s a in a manner of speakin ool turned to sona with a harsh order then suddenly a vast roaring filled the tunnel with so terrific a noise as to make past sounds seem in comparison a feeble murmur watches cursed an attack from some of your blasted countrymen ool he rasped but hamhock piney had another idea dats doc savages spooks ashootin he wailed chapter flashlight terror hamhock piney was correct but only partially so the bludgeoning sound echoes could be identified as they crashed closer they were the hooting sounds of doc savages superma chine pistols dat doc savage dead screamed hamhock dey got to be his ghosts firing dem hoot guns as the crooks doused their lights and scattered leveling automatics and machine guns in confused haste one of them dropped his gun and crumpled to the ground a victim of one of the machine pistol mercy slugs hamhock stooped and dragged the unconscious man around a right angle turn into a blindend tunnel the other crooks made a desperate stand their thundering guns stabbed wild flame spurts the attack coming unexpectedly and from such an unexplainable source had disorganized them and they did not even realize for several moments that their guns were the only ones roaring that after the first bullfiddle fusillade the superfirers of doc savage and his men had stopped firing then swooping from out of the darkness a giant of bronze by this time a familiar phenomenon to watches bowen invaded the cavern docs aides were close behind frenzied yells mixed with gunfire fist blows thudded the last flashlight went out darkness was intense dont shoot watches screamed to his men youll kill each other the gang chiefs hand wielding his leaded watch by the end of its stout chain chopped down swinging the deadly weapon against a human bulk which thrust up close against him in the dark hey dont do dat to me bleated hamhocks aggrieved voice ool throughout the fighting had remained silent holding onto sona with one hand and with the other trying to adjust her goggles to his eyes suddenly a flashlight blazed not six inches from his face before his right arm could moccasin out the light disappeared and a metallic fist crashed into his face knocking him down he lurched to his feet again and pawed frenziedly for the girl sona she was gone doc savage had developed a faculty of judging distance almost to the inch as the last of the flashlights had blacked out doc had fixed ools position in his mind flattened close against the side wall of the tunnel the bronze man had worked forward then he battered his way through watches men when he flashed his light he was close upon ool his fist blow had followed at the same instant his other arm streaked out to catch the girl around the waist holding her firmly doc leaped to one side in the dark and deposited the girl in a position of safety behind a pile of rock fragments which in some past age had fallen from the roof by giving a sibilant signal in the mayan tongue doc indicated to his men that the girl was safe his aides respond ed by unleashing new blasts from their superfirers this new attack demoralized watches bowens crew completely they broke and ran slamming against each other in the dark they got around the rightangle turn into the blindend tunnel here watches and ool screaming orders managed to rally them doc directed a cessation of fire quiet settled down except for the wrangling of watches bowe ns mobsters as the gang chief verbally beat them into line a horrified silence followed then a new voice sounded it was monks hoarse bellow so long bowen he taunted ill tell em you died brave we got you right where we want you now desperate as was their situation hamhock piney could not throttle a natural curiosity how yoall done come to life be shouted we done dynamite a million tons of rock on yoall you never dynamited any rock on us monk bellowed down the entry we did so the negro yelled back monks laughter rolled down the black passageway that wasnt a deadend passage you blew down he advised we went out through the back of that tunnel all our talk took place a block away you cant tell about voices in this place all right monk doc called tolerantly lets get stationed we have these plotters bottled up our next job is to smoke them out doc flashed on his light and wandered the white beam quickly about seeking good vantage points for his men to crouch behind in a supermachine pistol bombardment of the deadend tunnel there was no danger of the light attracting enemy bullets since watches bowens men were around an angle docs aides added to the single searching beam by switching their own lights on monk curiously turned his beam on doc what monk saw in the glare caused him to drop habeas corpus from under his arms and stare he sighed i ask you he said at large aint it perfect he was referring to the picture which the bronze giant made standing beside the goldenhaired girl sona she whom ool had called princess the girl clung to doc with the instinctive trust of a child do you doc asked want to get us shot at the homely chemist grinned and removed the light from them doc stepped to one side to examine the tunnel opening who is she monk called after him she has not offered that information doc replied she responds to none of the languages i have spoken with her nor can i understand a word of hers monk suggested as soon as you find how to talk to her put in a good word for me will you from somewhere in the darkness ham snorted loudly monk said angrily whatd you mean by that hoot the two growled at each other warming up for a battle which never extended beyond the verbal stage no matter what the provocation monk came over and thrust this face close to hams then suddenly monks flashlight was knocked from his hand the knocking was done with deftness it went out from the impact you lowlife monk gritted at ham pick up my flashlight pick it up yourself ham retorted you dropped it youre a liar monk bellowed you knocked it out of my hand whos a liar you hairy ham broke off as his own flashlight was knocked to the ground and extinguished you bushape he began again with new vehemence pick up my flashlight pick it up yourself monk blustered you dropped it dropped it nothing you knocked it out of my hand hey one of us is nuts monk said both were silent hams grip tightened spasmodically on his sword cane monk clawed absently at his bristling red hair then the cavern resounded with rennys great bellow something got my flashlight he howled the cavern was now absolutely dark doc had felt the goldenhaired girl sona leave his side she went suddenly as if torn away by a terrific force doc reached out for her in the blackness his metallic hands closed only on air he leaped to one side then the other groping furiously he found no trace of the girl he paused to pull out an emergency flashlight but it was smashed from his hand by a terrific blow its mechanism was shattered doc called a sharp warning to his men hold onto your machine pistols he rapped do not shoot until we get light you might hit each other its the things ham yelled shrilly what in the devil are they wed better get together doc advised come over here all of you the bronze mans aides never reached him there in the cavern of unknown horror something soft and slimy enveloped them an odious material at which they tore helplessly accomplishing nothing by their most desperate efforts they could not use the machine pistols the material whatever it was pressed closer and closer to their faces with a softly insidious force which burned their eyes seared their throats and imparted weakness to their limbs one by one they fell to the floor of the cavern tumbling down and squirming grotesquely to grow weaker and weaker and eventually became slack doc savage himself did not escape the fantastic terror although the bronze man did last longer than the others he held his breath for minutes in an attempt to escape the noxious substance which he believed exerted its effect by suffocation and during those minutes he rammed about straining his cabled muscles to their utmost capacity seeking to free himself from the slimy encompass but the material molded about him hemming in his movements and in the end utterly restraining them he had to breathe finally and when he did he crumpled to the floor as completely overcome as the others chapter black tidings doc savage and his five aides reviving found themselves lying on a smooth hard floor in utter darkness doc first to recover called the roll of his men finding them all to be with him with no one seriously damaged ugh gasped the fastidious ham when i think of that slimy stuff save it monk growled we know all about it boy id trade habeass left ear for some good daylight where do you figure we are doc ham questioned judging from the pressure against my drums and from the change in the temperature we are a great deal farther down in the earth than when we were captured were not even tied long tom remarked hope in his voice that is not necessarily a good sign doc reminded why not it probably means that whoever or whatever is responsible for bringing us here considers escape so impossible that binding us would be a needless precaution they frisked our clothes renny rumbled my pockets are as bare as the arctic ice pack and our machine pistols are gone renny clipped did they get the goggles too doc ham asked yes doc said thoughtfully i wonder what happened to watches bowen renny rumbled hey monk howled suddenly where you suppose my pig is he pursed his lips and whistled then called habeas habeas there was a squeal and a pattering rush in the darkness and the pet pig answering monks call rammed against his legs monk was sitting up on the floor the pig climbed over him like an excited terrier then the pig romped in the darkness his sensitive snout feeling out the others of the party stay away from me hog ham warned in a positive manner the only way id welcome you is on a platter with an apple in your mouth and brown gravy over you and maybe mashed potatoes doc had been feeling over the floor now be stood up groped out contacted a wall and started feeling along it we are in an artificially constructed room he decided aloud the floor and walls are tiled and not a bad job the surface is very level ham feeling a light jar against his back as if habeas corpus had touched him struck out behind him he hit nothing but there was a squealing sound ham you hurting my pig monk yelled ominously no but i will if i get hold of him ham promised enthusiastically ham sitting in the dark next felt a cold wet contact against the back of his neck the kind of touch that the pigs inquisitive snout might have made ham struck out again felt nothing but as before the quick action of his hand evoked from out of the darkness a strange small squeal monk the fastidious lawyer rapped angrily get your hog away from me nuts monk called inelegantly habeas is over here something tweaked monks ear he slapped at what be thought to be hams offending fingers his slapping hand sliced empty air then suddenly habeas was lifted away monk reached for his pet his hand encountered nothing but he could hear the pigs frantic squealing monk pushed his simian bulk up from the floor and lunged forward in the darkness groping the pigs squeals sounded apparently at his finger tips as though some one held the animal shoulderhigh ham monk grated dang your soul put that pig down stumbling about monk fell over ham who barked wrathfully at him gimme my pig monk thundered in hams ear ham jerked away i havent got your pig i dont want your pig i hate your pig can you get that through your dumb skull yeah monk said in a voice suddenly gone very small i think i get it ham you other guys he did not finish elucidate specifically johnny began then dropped his big words which one of you just now grabbed my monocle i call that carrying a joke too far johnny monk questioned in a voice ominously calm how could anybody see to take it ill be superamalgamated johnny exploded its the things some distance away in the jet blackness habeas corpus commenced squealing again they took my pig monk bellowed his voice welling up something tried to yank a ring off my finger ham shouted there was the sound of his furious groping i cant get hold of anything suddenly bedlam broke out among docs men from all sides their clothing was plucked as though by tiny pinchers and tiny hammerlike blows rained on their faces and bodies new sounds broke through the blackness strange unintelligible sounds squeaks hushed whistlings harsh clackings docs men fought shouting groping and clawing each time they collided or got their hands on a moving object it turned out to be one of their own number if i could only hit something bigfisted renny boomed monk hearing renewed squealing clearly recognizable as coming from habeas corpus appointed himself a oneman rescue party and plunged forward with his second step he rammed solidly against the wall a shock sent him back to the floor stunned doc he called he was over here the last i knew long tom jerked out ouch the thin electrical genius had been probed sharply by an invisible bedeviler take it easy the bronze mans voice was a welcome sound theyre like air renny roared you cant hit em you can poke your fist clear through em and you cant even feel em utterly denuded of tangibility johnny concurred i doubt it doc answered more likely they are creatures with strong muscle reflexes they can quickly dodge out of our way but how can they see ham demanded this darkness is absolute it is a puzzle doc said from out of the terrortaut darkness the protesting squeal of monks pig sounded again theyre devilin habeas monk raved maybe ham said sarcastically theyre human after all ive had the same itch for a long time docs voice issuing crisp orders over here with me everybody there is a corner here it marks one end of a long narrow room docs aides came jostling toward him in the darkness string out the bronze man directed you will be close enough together that you can touch hands on either side they lined up at the end of the room with their backs against the wall all right now forward slowly doc commanded i will keep talking keep pace with my voice and with each other bend low keep sweeping your fists to each side do not let anything get behind you under docs guidance they started grimly forward a human broom that started at one end of the dark room and swept forward just as it is the function of a broom to keep all debris in front of it so this human broom strove to push ahead of it the mysterious inhabitants of the darkness forward they moved slowly fists swinging fast nothing opposed their progress it was as if the weird bedevilers were falling silently back before them impressed by the cooperative attack but suddenly there was a thup of a fist against some substance theyre real renny boomed i hit one good doc said pick up whatever you hit and keep moving ahead theres nothing to pick up renny complained but i sure slugged something thup thup johnny and long tom connected simultaneously with solid objects grab hold of anything you can doc directed then his own metallic fist hit a soft yielding object he grasped with lightning speed but found nothing to pick up they are fast he said grimly try to catch one concentrate on forcing them back hams sweeping fist was the next to find a target hey he called excitedly i got hold of this one stand in your places doc ordered do not let anything pass us can you handle it alone ham i think so ouch it bites there were brief and furious struggle sounds then came taut silence hams disgusted voice said its that damn pig then they were assailed with a furious battering from out of the dark high and low the blows drove all in the advancing line were subjected to the same violent treatment hold your positions docs voice called sternly keep driving we are nearly at the end of the room they fought stubbornly on pummeling kicking sometimes butting with their heads not once did their fingers clutch on an assailant but all at once the darkness emptied before them they bumped heavily against a wall there was a loud grating sound a door doc rapped here they got out and are trying to close it wonder where they got wood down here for a door renny muttered doors being one of the heavyfisted engineers interests in life since it was his boast that one did not exist that he could not break down with his fists it is not wood doc informed it is some unfamiliar substance apparently of artificial composition they managed to force the door open and get through once outside the room they were not for a time molested they felt their way forward carefully in the darkness and their feet found wellformed steps while exploring hands located walls which were intricately ornamented in places and perforated by mansize openings shaped in accurate geometric designs they found other geometric objects which rested solidly on the floorevidently articles of furniture and all in the shape of circles oblongs squares and triangles the articles were strongly made but out of extremely light materials monk lumbering around knocked over one object that seemed as big as a piano it did not break and he righted it with one hand what a life he groaned doc savage said one peculiar feature is that everything seems to be constructed of the same unfamiliar substance as that door if these people or things have learned the art of synthesizing building materials we are pitted against no mean intellects what have they got down here to make anything out of ham wondered doc pushed at a triangularshaped panel which he encountered it was a ponderous door but it opened readily a dank nearsuffocating smell came through engulfing them doc slammed the door he hesitated then he opened the door again stepped through and called his aides use your hands he told them i think you will find answers to several puzzles they explored and their hands came in contact with a satiny objectsmooth curved cool to the touch and soft now do you recognize the odor doc questioned mushrooms monk exploded cultivated fungi of a gigantic and unknown variety johnny seconded ill be superamalgamated i guess this must be what the the things eat long tom commented doc said the fungi may be the basis for the lightweight composition material out of which everything here seems to be constructed as they turned to go back to the door something slapped their faces wetly and they recoiled then their heads were enveloped in a soft slimy grip throw it off before it gets a firm hold doc shouted and hold your breaths i think this is the same thing which got the best of us the other time doc rammed forward to the door the door was closed all the bronze mans prodigious strength could not bulge it renny came lunging alongside in the dark but the combined battering of their four fists evoked only sodden echoes the insidious stuff which wrapped their heads pressed softly tighter they tore at it frenziedly then from all sides doc and his aides were assailed by battering blows clawing at the unseen enemy they could find nothing to seize except the slimy horror their enemies were as elusive as they had been in the long prison room reacting to a sharp blow against his face doc finally grabbed something his great hand clutched a moving object his cabled fingers closed down with the precision of a steel trap his fingers got it a small hard article of peculiar shape docs inordinately developed sense of touch made him instantly aware of what he had snatched from the dark a pair of goggles with amazingly thick lenses backing up pawing at the mysterious substance which sought to envelop his head doc fitted the goggles to his eyes instantly to his gaze the air became filled with a weird golden yellow haze the blackness vanished in its place there was the fantastic golden aura shot through and through with a faint opalescence after the first moment or two doc began to identify objects in the uncanny light he saw the ghoststuff which his aides were fighting he recognized it for what it was a gigantic species of the fungus growth which dangles like soft moss from decaying overhead timbers in coal mines this fungus doc knew thrives on a total absence of light this particular growth revealed to doc through the black goggles had obviously been cultivated in the exotic cavern and had attained gigantic proportions reaching tensile strength docs aides were dimly revealed to him through the golden haze they were black forms seen through the goggles they were engaged in a terrific grapple with the enveloping fungus doc leaped to aid them but from all sides shapeless forms converged toward him in the uncanny yellow light the figures stood out in vague black the black things the black creatures were about the height of men some of them clutched long poles with which they were jabbing the noxious fungus into the faces of docs men others moved as free agents rushing doc they pummeled him from all sides the bronze mans scientific paraphenalia had been taken from him at the time of his first capture he had no means of defense now except his superb fists and these he used with all the effect possible causing the black assailants to fall in rows under the flailing of his fists but always new rows took their places from front back and from the sides they hurled upon him and in the end the bronze man fell the fantastic attackers piled over his prone body like ants onto a stricken beetle chapter golden blackness the sound of a compelling voice of pleasing musical quality caused the black assailants to stop their attack the voice sounded again apparently issuing an order and the foes withdrew from doc standing back around him in a thick ring then at another order from the haunting voice the cotton fungus was removed docs five men each felt deft fingers about their eyes when the fingers were removed they discovered they had each been equipped with strange goggles they were slower than doc had been in accustoming their eyes to the weird golden light but gradually through the allpervading golden shimmer they were able to make out hazy outlines in black you see what i see monk gasped doc savages voice sounded focus your eyes steadily on the object they will soon take on detail they did this and the black monsters stood out as individuals theyre men renny boomed keep looking doc advised youll develop a color sense sure long tom gasped im getting it i can see the mushrooms they look pinkish look behind you doc requested they turned their goggled eyes there standing a pace in advance of the black monsters was the girl the princess sona she stood there like a fairybook figure seen through a golden autumn haze the curves of her youthful body were alluring revealed by a clinging robe her golden hair silken heaps of it hung down to her waist and seemed a part of her diaphanous garb her lips were perfect her features exquisitely chiseled her appearance was marred only by the presence of a pair of the grotesque goggles in pardonable feminine vanity she removed the goggles for a moment while she flicked imaginary dust from their thick lenses the effect to the battery of admiring masculine eyes was annihilating holy cow renny breathed ill be superamalgamated johnny intoned im in love monk advised doc savages calmly analytical words brought them back to earth you are witnessing an amazing phenomenon he expounded you are seeing where there is no light as we know light air particles have apparently been treated in a way to make them luminous when viewed through the blackleased spectacles objects which first appeared black to our unadjusted vision now stand out in something near natural colors tempered slightly by the effect of the golden haze monk said dreamily its like when the sun is slanting rays over the earth in the autumn you know just before twilight how it is with the suns rays filtering through the trees in a kind of soft golden blush what are you doing ham cut in sourly waxing poetical nuts to you you shyster monk suggested doc savage was not unaffected by the charms of the girl but the bronze man in his inflexible resolve to spend his life helping those who needed help punishing those who deserved punishing had made bitter enemies unscrupulous foes who would stop at nothing to end his career the bronze man was able to care for himself but if adversaries struck at him through some one he loved his hands would be tied and hence he had steeled himself against thought of attachment with one of the opposite sex can you talk to them doc renny asked ill try doc said as a linguist the bronze man was probably unsurpassed he now spoke rapidly using different languages but to every tongue he articulated the girl only stared smiling and replied in soft tremulous tones as stirring to the senses as violin music and as analytically unintelligible she came forward finally and took the bronze man by the hand indicating that he and his aides were to accompany her she then led the way through the ponderous triangular doorand her followers now revealed clearly as goggled men closed in behind immediately outside the door two goggled men apparently guards made gestures their right hands drifted up from their sides with an eerie movement like the flutterings of crippled butterflies at a sharp word from sona the hands subsided get that johnny said excitedly ool had that habit ham gasped monk came close to the two whose hands moved so peculiarly these even look like ool he decided aloud not so shriveled up and flateyed maybe he scanned the faces of the other male members of the escort these others dont look so bad this seems to solve the identity mystery of ool doc said he came from this underground world but why he returned and brought watches bowen with him is still something we do not know long tom took a deep breath which expanded his deceptively hollow chest to an amazing extent im sure glad to get out of that mushroom house and get some fresh air judging from the way the place is guarded doc offered we were probably correct in assuming that the mushrooms are of vast importance to both the economic and physical life of these people i wonder what they eat monk pondered we can try to find out the bronze man said in the spacious outer room doc made motions indicating hunger to which the girl sona gave understanding smiles and nods and clapped her hands sharply then she motioned doc and his aides to be seated they reclined on geometricshaped padded divans not uncomfortable they discovered with a yielding fiber remindful of sponge rubber monks small eyes popped when he saw the array of dishes set before him an amazing assortment artistically prepared the food was as tasty as attractive all ate lustily but monk in particular gorged himself i dont know what im eating he said but i can take more of the same for supper doc waited until monk had finished then he said you were eating only one thing monk yeah what mushrooms holy cow renny grunted they have devised ways of disguising appearance and flavor in order to avoid monotony i presume johnny commented but how can you live on mushrooms alone monk demanded undoubtedly these people have had to build up a unique economy doc suggested probably they have plants other than mushrooms but of a kindred nature chemicals from these and from natural deposits perhaps furnish fertilizer for their specialized culture since these people are living and with rather astonishing vitality it is safe to assume they are able to extract from their surroundings all the elements necessary to sustain life this air smells funny renny added i think we will find out they manufacture or at least purify their air too possibly out of oxygen extracted from water monk blinked these birds are not dumb they seem to take things which we can accomplish only as laboratory experiments and employ them in everyday use the girl sona had waited patiently but now she came close plucked at docs sleeve and led the way out of that cavernous room outside docs men stood and stared doc himself gazed intently on all sides bathed in the soft golden haze smooth walls towered they were white and shimmered in the golden atmosphere just as inside the room they had left everything was laid out in strict geometrical conformity here straight lines and broad sweeping curves were beautiful in their gaunt simplicity it its plenty modernistic monk stammered the most striking example of functional architecture i have ever seen renny the civil engineer said in admiration doc said they had to build within the limited confines of this underground cavern also being cramped as to quantity of building materials they have abandoned all frills and false fronts in every instance they have used the least amount of material possible for the purpose as they stood there they became aware of a faint steady clicking sound it was very regular whats that noise i keep hearing long tom questioned monk looked around puzzled yeah i been noticing that it sounds like a big clock ticking the kind of a noise you wouldnt notice after you got used to it renny offered they were quiet for a time listening to the sound which tremored in the golden haze with a muffled cadence like the beating of a slow pulse then between smoothlyrearing walk along a lane spotless and clean sona guided them they began to see the living apartments of the weird metropolis these towered through the golden air to the dome of the arched cavern each separate apartment set back from the one below in the fashion of skyscrapers the quarters looked as efficient as an electrical switchboard in a dynamo room monk pointed out a manywindowed structure obviously a manufacturing plant of some type built over a rushing stream whats that he asked looks like a modernistic fish design over the door it is doc said dryly here probably they process fish taken from the river they evidently have something besides mushrooms long tom also pointed that building over there with what appear to be modernistic mushrooms on it must be the fungus processing plant some factories renny boomed in appreciation no smoke no dust no smell there is no waste anywhere apparently doc commented factories as efficient and scientific as a technocrats dream they moved on and their group was joined by more goggled figures who dribbled in from all sides attracted by the amazing spectacle of men from another world women too dressed in robes only slightly less lustrous and diaphanous than sonas joined the throng long tom called attention to a set of structures built in a large open court these he inferred to be government buildings the structures were as rigidly functional in design as the others the most spacious structure of all was one in the heart of the metropolis and which seemed to contain scientific laboratories and possibly housed machinery for processing air for breathing and illuminating purposes at least the air was fresher brighter near here it was a high circular building topped with a complicated array of weirdly curved pipes and conduits this was called in the local language they learned later the equivalent of central mechanical plant hey monk called out that pulse beat that keeps ringing in our ears doesnt it sound louder here yes doc answered that is undoubtedly the source of the noise they stood listening like the muffled beatings of a giant heart the sound permeated the golden air doc decided the noise must be in some way incidental to the manufacture of the luminous air the sound might truly be called the heart beat of the metropolis without warning yells ripped out a loud malignant clatter burst on the air echoes rebounded fearfully under the vast cavern dome hey monk shouted that aint no heart beat machine guns ham ejaculated sona recoiled close to doc savage in quick dread of the unaccustomed noise her escort their strange loose garments fluttering commenced milling about in panic sounds like an attack on the central mechanical plant doc said quickly gently and firmly doc removed himself from sonas vicinity then made signs to the milling underground men that they should surround her with a protective guard come on he called to his five aides chapter cold light at the central mechanical plant machine gun bullets mauled the smooth rounded surface of the walls making a flat drumming noise the gunners were bunched and working toward the structure endeavored to get to the big doors the latter had closed at the first outburst of firing the doors were enormous clumsy appearing but they had operated smoothly doc savage caught sight of the gunners watches bowen and his gang he said grimly in front of the central mechanical plant perhaps half a down limp bodies were sprawled cavern men who had no doubt discovered watches bowen and his gang approaching the plant and had given an alarm that had cost them their lives these slain cavern men were without their goggles doc savage veered to one side toward what was apparently a storehouse for a type of pressed fibre tile the tiles were in squares measuring some six inches across and an inch thick the bronze man picked up several of these and tossed them to his aides hold them as you would guns he ordered this yellow light is tricky we may fool them into thinking we have our machine pistols the ruse was more successful than they had expected watches bowen and his men already unnerved by the failure of what must have been intended as a surprise attack saw doc and his five approaching dey got dem hoot guns hamhock piney bawled yelling loudly watches ordered a retreat into one of the nearby tall habitation buildings there was much uproar and more shooting inside but soon watches and his gang appeared on top of the structure from the roof they could direct an uninterrupted stream of machine gun slugs at the central mechanical plant and at the same time be immune to attack from above machine gun lead drove doc and his party to shelter more bullets hammered at the walls of the mechanical plant making a patter like the insistent chatter of hall the slugs dont seem to be penetrating the plant walls long tom shouted as they ran along keeping under cover and heading for the circular plant itself they were running alone the inhabitants of the vast underground domain of weird yellow light having sought cover because of the uproar there were it was later ascertained strong buried chambers to which the populace fled on the rare occasions when there were roof caveins although the latter had become rare througјh the last few centuries due to the strengthening by scientific means of the populated portions of the subterranean labyrinth what is their idea of the attack on that mechanical plant monk pondered aloud some scheme of watches bowen renny rumbled guess they mustve got goggles through ool they were fired at by the machine gunners the distance was too great for effective shooting a few moments later doc savage in the fantastic golden light issued orders well try this he said quietly you five men endeavor to gain entrance through the rear door of the mechanical plant and organize those inside into an emergency defense unit monk exploded but we cant talk their lingo make signs doc said they are adept at understanding gestures what you gonna do doc doc said grimly i will see what i can do about stopping the machine guns doc glided away and before his aides could protest had disappeared among the modernistic maze of unusual buildings watches bowen has nine men with machine guns long tom muttered doubtfully doc is unarmed he may have some trouble dont sweat about that monk snorted my bet is that hell stop em at the door of the central mechanical plant on the opposite side of the bombardment docs aides pounded for admittance a blackcaped observer from a position in a pillbox turret on top of the plant had obviously noted their approach and had seen that they came from the princess sonas party he evidently thought they must be all right for he signaled that the door be opened for them silently the door opened wide enough for them to squeeze in and one by one they crowded through ham being the last to enter as the door was closing upon the heels of the dapper lawyer a blackcaped figure charged frantically to the plant building shouting something in flatvoiced gibberish unintelligible to docs aides but not however meaningless to the cavern men controlling the door to the mechanical plant the door slid shut with a silent fury that caught the always impeccably dressed ham and ripped off the entire rear of his coat the one who had raced up was left outside remarkably enough ham was not in the least concerned about his wrecked appearance just before the door closed a backward glance had disclosed something which concerned him infinitely more ool he barked that was ool who just came running up he was dressed in the garb of these cavern people bet they didnt recognize him figures began to close in on doc savages men their attitude was anything but friendly now whats eatin these birds monk muttered uneasily it must have been what ool shouted ham said the dapper lawyers fears were justified for inside the gleaming plant harsh orders were shouted in the same unfamiliar language ool had used unexcited orders they seemed like ool all these other cavern people seemed to have achieved a high state of emotional control betcha monk barked ool told these boys we were in with watches bowen renny knocked his big fists together yeah he probably told em we were trying to bluff our way in here and take the place the next instant the cavern men had stalked forward and surrounded docs aides iii a tight ring they made a grim appearing circle with their dark capes black goggles and white emotionless faces that because of the motherofpearl texture did not seem quite human now what long tom grunted his answer came soon the right hands of the cavern men began drifting out from their sides in a vague butterflylike fluttering blazes renny gasped i wish doc was here to help out after doc savage dispatched his men toward the central mechanical plant he himself hurried through a maze of modernistic passageways and circled to reach the rear of the fantastic homecell house on top of which watches bowen and his men were ensconced with their machine guns he looked up through the shimmering golden haze the bronze man could catch glimpses of the mobster men as they chopped bullets in the direction of the central mechanical plant the homecell house which watches bowen had chosen as his machine gun nest was high pressing its roof close to the arching dome of the gigantic cavern there were no fire escapes on the building such as a dweller in american cities might have expected for the reason that the construction was probably absolutely fireproof due to the lack of fire escapes watches bowen and his men seemingly believed themselves secure from a rear attack and therefore concentrated all their attention on firing at the central mechanical plant a professional human fly accustomed to scanning the walls would no doubt have eyed the sheer surface lifting upward story after story to the cavern dome and would not have attempted the climb according to the discussions which took place later not even the cavern people for all their strength and agility thought it possible of accomplishment but doc savage ascended the first hundred feet in a flat two minutes after that his pace was considerably slowed the structural indentations which marked the lower part of the building became less pronounced as the height became greater but although the bronze mans pace was slowed it was not stopped up and up he climbed depending entirely on precarious fingerholds that at times seemed nonexistent the windows were not closed by glass since there was no rain or cold to keep out of the building there were only shutters for privacy hinged in the window frames the bronze man might have made better time if he had used the window ledges for extra purchase but not wishing to attract attention to himself he scrupulously avoided the windows as things turned out he might as well have used them a cavern dweller looking out sighted the bronze man the observer was a woman a housewifely sort of person who looked as if her life might be devoted to the care of her man and her children the spectacle of the great bronze man mounting the side of the building unnerved her and she clutched her children closely and screamed shrilly and repeatedly this occurred only a few stories from the top of the building one of watches bowens crew attracted by the screams looked over the edge he wore goggles he sighted doc yelled hamhock also wearing goggles dived swiftly to the mobsters side the latter pointed dats ol bad luck hisself the big negro stuttered he seemed too paralyzed to swing down his submachine gun the other man leaned over with his and bore down grimly on the trigger a leaden thread of death streamed downward then a startling thing occurred the golden haze went out of the air utter blackness clamped down on the cavern metropolis mah goggles done gone bad on me hamhock shouted hell rasped the other somethings happened the man did not let the darkness interfere with his job at hand he hosed machine gun lead along the side of the building where last he had seen doc using an entire drum of ammunition to make a thorough job out of it hes gone now the gunner shouted loudly in the darkness sure he doan swing himself in trough a window hamhock mumbled there wasnt a window in thirty feet of him good work you two watches bowen called thats a load off my chest and i dont mean maybe you wont be havin no use now for that special gold watch chief the special gold watch hamhock referred to was a new addition to the mob chiefs collection one especially reserved for the annihilation of doc savage bowen had even indulged in a whim and had engraved doc savages name on the case he had not revealed wherein lay the deadly nature of the watch boasting only that this watch would finish savage off if the proper chance came she sho am dahk hamhock mumbled ah done think my trick specks done gone wrong only ah guess dey aint dat yaller light done just plumb gone outn de sky aint it watches bowens curse rasped through the pitch blackness this wasnt on the program ools bungled down below or this couldnt have happened theyve done something at the central mechanical plant thats where their cold light comes from ah don lak dis place hamhock grumbled dis heah dahk it dont seem like regular dahk dis dahk it sorta jams down on yo if yo know what ah mean came a sharp chattering noise in the blackness near by watches cursed squirrel he snarled keep them teeth still or ill knock em down your throat a certain quaver in the mob chiefs voice showed he was more than a little jittery himself i aint scared squirrel dorgan insisted in a false voice its just a habit break the habit or ill break your neck watches promised in spite of watches warning squirrels teeth kept chattering then suddenly they quit chattering there was something unnatural about the way they stopped squirrel watches bowen called sharply there was no answer the darkness seemed to press closer so blackly intense that it appeared thick enough to handle watches cursed nervously and called again when there was no answer his hands pawed out feeling in the darkness they found squirrel dorgan found him slumped over the rooftop railing dead watches bowen cursed savagely and hamhock mumbled some vague incantation to his personal mistress of luck this being the way each had of keeping his courage up the other mobsters crowded close together it mustve been heart failure one of them growled squirrel always had a chicken heart his voice broke off sharply and there was a soft thump in the darkness as of a body striking the rooftop watches and his men hurriedly groped and encountered a silently huddled body dis am joe hamhock wailed naming a member of the joe never had a weak heart watches rasped say what the hells goin on there was taut silence graveyard silence while the gangsters huddled closer together as though in the darkness an unseen menace was tightening an invisible noose about them i found something honey hamiltons mild voice stated what is it watches exploded where sticking in joes neck it pulls out hard feels like a little weighted ball with a kind of webbed thorn stuck through it drop it honey the mob leaders voice slashed dont scratch yourself on it whatever it is it must be poisoned to kill joe like it did there was a noise in the darkness behind watches a sound not unlike a load of rock unloaded suddenly and heavily the gang chief whirled hamhock he yelled has it got you there was no answer hamhock this time there was an answer ah ahin all right chief the big negro stuttered the words out butbut ah wouldnt ub been if it had come any closer if what had come closer watches demanded one uh dern things lak what honey pulled outa joes neck ah reckons said the negro ah could feel it come past mab face in de dahk why in the hell didnt you say so watches snapped unreasonably there was a faint hiss in the air above watches head he ducked instinctively cursed and followed hamhock to the floor to get the protection afforded by the low parapet flatten out he ordered theyre filling the air with poison darts shootin em up with air guns or sling shots or something i guess flat on their stomachs on the roof the men listened in nearpanic as the air above them was filled with the whirring of the death missiles many of which struck with sharp clicks against the protecting parapet hamhock piney howled dolefully what ah wants to know is why we done mess wit dat meckanickel plant foah anyhow it was ools idea watches snapped if we get that plant we can take over this place its the heart of their existence down here the roof above is reenforced so it cannot come down its the strongest place in the cavern ah wishes we had nevah come up heah hamhock stated well what could we do watches yelled angrily doc savage men cut us off say you rascal are you criticizing my way of running this no suh hamhock denied ah thinks things am goin jes fine through it all the heart beat of the processing machine at the central mechanical plant had been throbbing through the blackness a slow muffled cadence which impinged on their ear drums with ominous insistence hamhock breathed heavily taking three quick inhalations in succession then he gasped don it seem like dat tickin am slowin down watches listened yeah it is he agreed and theyre not shooting up so many of those darts they probably figure theyve rubbed us out waitl they turn on their screwy yellow light again well fog somebody plenty with lead hamhocks ponderous wheezes were getting so loud now that they even drowned out the insistent clicking emanating from the air machine in the central mechanical plant nor was the fat negro the only one who was breathing hard all were wheezing it began to sound like a contest honey hamiltons mild voice inquired between gaspings doesnt it seem to anybody else like its getting hard to breathe honey got an emphatic agreement from everything on the roof hamhock gasped could dis have somethin to do with dat clocktick business dem ticks am soundin mighty slow now watches bowen ripped out short volleys of profanity he seemed to lack the breath for as extended profanity as he would have liked you hit it hamhock he gasped that clocktick controls the air down here what theyre doing is thinning it out on us high up here under the dome where we are its worse than below he gagged made awful hacking noises takin de bref right out our mouths hambocks frightened voice sounded what kind people is these les get outn heah they pulled off their black goggles they had taken them from the cavern men they had shot down near the mechanical plant and used their flashlights access to the lower level of the great housecell was by a moving stairway similar to an escalator and riding down on this they kept their flashlight beams playing and several times shot at inquisitive heads reaching the floor level of the cavern they set off swiftly using their guns freely hamhock piney more courageous now fired the grenade rifle several times the air was better down here watches bowen seemed to have a very definite idea of where he was going he veered sharply to the right and came to a very steep wall he stopped and called upward lower away he shouted and dont show a light an answer wafted from above k watches moved about groped got his fingers on the rung of a rope ladder which had been lowered he tried his weight on it then swung on and started climbing up come on he hurled back to the others dont forget to bring joes and squirrels machine guns twenty feet up watches squirmed through a narrow rock opening in the cavern he stood by at the aperture while the others climbed one after the other up the twisting dangling ladder he counted the men as they arrived at the top and scraped past him in the darkness puffing and blowing what the hell he exploded i counted one too many he ordered the ladder hauled up then he flashed his light slithering the white beam around in the low limestone passage wheres ool he asked not back yet said the man who lowered the ladder say what went wrong everything watches snarled this natural passageway led around some distance in an indirect connection with that labyrinth of tunnels the socalled land of the lost which straggled underground for miles to the surface cleft where the dirigible was moored this passage was fed by the same sluggish current of air as circulated through the land of the lostin a sense exhaust air from the city in the domed cavern watches flashlight revealed the faces of his men ml were here except ool and the two who had been killed on the roof top the nervously poking light revealed no one else my mistake watches muttered id have sworn i counted one too many but watches bowens first hunch was right for he had counted one too many men in his outfit the third to mount the ladder behind the mob chief had been the extra man it was doc savage doc had not been shot off the side of the building by machine gun fire when darkness clamped over the cavern and the bullets sliced toward him in a leaden stream he had let go his finger hold leaped twenty feet down and ten feet to one side and landed on a thick conduit pipe which entered the building from another across the way out of the tail of his eye he had photographed the position of that aerial conduit in the last glimmer of the failing golden light his leap was gauged precisely in utter darkness be caught the conduit against his steelthewed thighs breaking his fall sufficiently for his cabled arms to wrap around and drag up his dangling legs in silence he had recommenced his climb up the side of the building and eased over the parapet in the darkness he had been present lurking below the roof opening when watches two men were killed by the poisonous darts hurled up by the outraged cavern inhabitants he had followed the gang chief to the dangling rope ladder and he was present now in the passageway crouched behind a pile of broken rock fragments just outside the range of fiashlight beams chapter rendezvous trap utterly unaware of the crouching presence of doc savage in the passageway watches bowen brought out a flask of the eightyyear old napoleon brandy which he had brought along he killed half the flask in two greedy swigs then passed the rest to his men the slow fire of the liquor did little to sweeten the mob chiefs temper his pudgy hand tugged continually at his watch chain and he prowled about cursing everything in sight and many things not in sight most particularly he cursed ool honey hamilton put up a mild defense of the maligned assassin it wasnt ools fault that we bumped into them men near the central mechanical plant chief he pointed out yeah i know watches growled but he mightve stuck around and helped us out one of the mobsters a man with small overly bright eyes scowled and muttered theres a lotta screwy things about this place honey hamilton cleared his throat gently watches the boys been wantin me to ask somethin for em he said yeah watches growled shoot whos stopping you its only that this is working up into a plenty bloody business honey hamilton said apologetically thats all right we aint backin out but we figure its time we know exactly what were takin the risks for didnt i tell you we come after a treasure that will set the richest guy in the country way over the other side the tracks watches demanded yeah you told us that the other agreed but it dont mean a hell of a lot to us watches laughed harshly so you want details thats right honey said in his mouselike voice watches shrugged all right we came after light there was a stir among the men light hell some one snorted watches continued the yellow light thats in this air down here to be more specific dis golden stuff what we see with dem goggles hamhock questioned yo wouldnt fool us boss man go on watches honey hamilton urged youre still way ahead of us where does that stuff make us a buck you dope the mob chief retorted dont you see that the formula for this golden air is worth more than all the heavy gold that ever came out of the ground no honeys gentle voice stated damned if i do the way i get it from ool watches continued his ancestors came underground here thousands of years ago to get away from the cold it used to be hot country up here a few hundred thousand years ago or so then everything started freezing up like it is now it didnt happen overnight took thousands of years i guess anyhow the ancestors of these people developed ways of takin care of themselves watches continued they had to make their light to see by but by the time the ice closed in for good they were all set they had learned to make their air too ool says theyve got tanks of liquid air at the central mechanical plant that would refrigerate all of new york city what do they do with it honey questioned ive read about that stuff itll freeze a rubber ball so bad that itll break like glass watches said they use it to make breathing air out of something like we do in submarines i guess yassuh hamhock interrupted dey put me in one of dem submarine things in de war ah know about submarines shut up watches growled the yellow or golden color in the air down here is nothing more than a kind of phosphorescence its caused by treating the air somehow then turning a form of x ray or something on it in other words these cavern dwellers have realized a dream of modern ў science they have perfected a method of getting socalled cold light on a practical basis at their central mechanical plant they treat the air particles in a way to make them luminous when seen through specially devised goggles thats the long and short of it one of the men stirred restlessly its a nice history lesson but where does the treasure come in you mug watches rasped you havent got the imagination to dodge a bullet dont you see what it would do hack in america in europe everywhere if we showed up with a formula for making cold light it would put every electric light company in the world out of business wed make them power pirates pay plenty i mean plenty honey hamiltons awed voice sounded insistently ool according to the way i been hearing him talk has got even bigger ideas than that he said nothing the matter with ools imagination the mob chief chuckled he pulled a watch out of his pocket by the end of the chain and started swinging it around unconsciously theres nothing the matter with my imagination either he said im stringing along with ool well go just as far as money will take us and thats plenty far yo sho nuff goin have a knob on somebodys head too hamhock protested ifn yo don quit swinging dat watch so wild watches quit spinning the watch his thick fingers shoved it back in his pocket youre right hamhock were a little ahead of ourselves weve got to make a successful raid on the central mechanical plant first honey hamilton lost in a mental consideration of what he had just heard had wandered off to one side humming to himself he was not sure that they could hold up the electric power companies either in selling them the secret or by getting them to pay to keep it from being used and thus damaging great utilities investments but watches must be right watches had a business head watches turned a fiashlight on one of his timepieces then honey hamilton stopped dreaming he kept humming however and continued on a few steps farther then turned and walked slowly back to the group he said something to watches bowen out of the corner of his mouth barely opening his lips but watches heard him the crook chiefs face went plasterwhite but there was no illumination on his face so no one noticed he did not answer honey but kept on talking to hamhock he paused looked at his wrist watch for the time im supposed to meet ool in an hour and a quarter down the passage here in that little room off to the right he said im going to sit down and rest he sat down the others sat down also at his order they crowded together in a close circle with their flashlights ready and machine guns across their knees you never know when somebody may come snooping around watches growled in explanation hamhocks mountainous bulk shivered do way dem fellers move them hands of theirn makes dis baby tink of dem ol cottonmouth snakes dot used to go fo mah bare feet when ah was a boy down in gawgia ah wonder how ool kills by touchin you id give plenty to know that myself watches admitted sourly he never has explained it they talked on then honey hamilton at a nudge from watches got up and wandered a short distance away he was humming to himself again as he retraced the course he had taken before he came back and said in a voice audible to all this time k whats k hamhock demanded what yoall talkin about watches bowen turned on the fat negro viciously not you hamhock you told me youd bumped savage didnt you ah sho did not dat was joe de boy dat got hisself killed doc savage was right here listening to everything we said watches grated honey saw him a little while ago when one of the flashes went on he came back and whispered the dope to me nobody said anything their tongues were frozen for they held the bronze man in greater dread than they did the dart killers of the coldlight cavern watches laughed grimly take it easy he purred that appointment i claimed i had with ool was faked lawsy me hamhock moaned savage doesnt know its faked watches went on he thinks hes got straight dope hes on his way now to trip up ool but ool will be here soon well fix it for ool to get savage and no guesswork about it this time one of them said sullenly watches i dont want no part in it this bronze guy is a jinx for us hell weve tried to kill him twenty times going canary watches sneered yeah when it comes to him i am and i aint ashamed to admit it me neither another sullenly defiant voice agreed watches bowen did not get angry he did not even swear he surprised everybody by laughing quietly thats all right boys he said i know how you feel we wont any of us take any more chances with this baby well leave all the dirty work to ool and any of these cavern guys he can get to take a risk he paused you see ool has some friends down here he said in the small rendezvous room doc savage waited watches bowens act had been convincing the bronze man held no suspicion of the trap which had been set he stood silently in a mansized niche in the rockcluttered cavity he did not have long to wait for the little room soon caught up the shuffle of approaching feet on the rocky tunnel floor the sound came closer and doc flexed great muscles and waited he tried his goggles found them ineffective still and pushed them up on his forehead no doubt the ray device which caused the air to become luminous was still shut off as the steps came closer a sudden aura of light danced on the roof a stones throw distant such a display on the pitted roof as might have been the work of a flashlight beam the person who approached had rounded one of the final curves in the crooked passage the next instant the flash beam was spurting into the rendezvous room itself the one who carried the light approached within a few feet of doc stopped shook the flash pounded it with a hand as though he thought a jolting would make it function better and finally turned the white rays toward his face while he examined the reflector it was ools face that was revealed in the flashlight glare doc sprang with the precision of a leaping puma the bronze mans hurtling weight landed immediately behind ool his hands clamped ools arms just below the shoulder joints his thumbs dug into the flesh ool became helpless the whole maneuver having taken the bronze man only splitseconds adjusting the flashlight in a wall niche doc savage examined ools hands particularly the right one he found nothing ool spoke and in spite of the pain he must be suffering his tone had changed little from its normal expressionlessness my right hand interests you does it not bronze man he asked doc savage did not answer you are due for a surprise ool said quietly you were interested in capturing tile so interested that you did not hear my men come close doc savage became slightly tense the other felt the stiffening there are at present a vaex of men surrounding you ool said in your language that number is equal to the total of all the toes and lingers which a normal man has twenty the bronze man suddenly picked up his light and streamed it about cutting a white path in the closepressing blackness it was true the mouth of the room was literally packed with whitefaced darkcaped figures these newcomers moved forward slowly purposefully closing in on doc and his prisoner and as they approached closer their right hands drifted up from their sides in vague butterfly gestures which seemed as natural as nature itself you had best not resist ool warned you are not at this time to be killed there was a cold certainty about ools actions which said he was not bluffing and doc savage did the only thing left to do he allowed himself to be taken ool stood clear and worked his arms experimentally in his long black cape he looked very grotesque he gibbered an order to the cavern men and they moved down the passage conducting doc savage in their midst until they came to a smooth wall completely blocking the passage here one of the men gave signal knocks on the wall and a wide door slid slowly open doc and his captors passed through the door closed softly behind them that he might walk more easily the bronze man was given gogglesfor the cold light was working again and donning them found himself once more in the metropolis of fantastic buildings the throbbing which was the heart beat of this city under the dome permeated the cold light realm more strongly and the place seemed to have settled back to its accustomed routine many of the populace came to stare at the bronze man they did not seem friendly doc was conducted to a chamber in one of the government buildings a room that was obviously a prison cell he was left alone with the door locked behind him and was allowed to keep the black goggles the room was large with a walllike partition at the opposite end beyond the partition he discovered other prisonershis five aides and habeas corpus monk muttered after the first excited greetings were over they put him in their dang jail too the meeting of doc savage and his men would have been considerably dampened in spirit could they have listened to another meeting which was taking place in the executive palace there ool faced the dictator anos anos father of the girl sona wore a red cape as mark of high position the girl sona had acquired her name by a simple reversal of the letters of the male parents name a custom in all fatheranddaughter relationships in the cavern metropolis anos the dictator occupied a low thronelike affair which stood near a design on the throneroom floor a mammoth fourteenpointed star inlaid with an opalescent substance around the points of the star were arrayed the chairs of the government council the nonverid the members of which wore slightly less gaudy capes ool stood in the middle of the star and faced the dictator my repentance is great he said that is fitting the dictator replied slowly you have been noted in the past for your greed and treachery and for your insane thirst to take over the government here it was for attempting to take over the government that you were banished to the stor the working squadrons when you tried to lead the star in revolt you were sent to the land of the lost ool spoke contritely i have repented he said and i have proved it by bringing you the giant man and the other five and the strange insect with fur upon it which they call a hog you say these five are allied with the others who attacked us with their carryingrods which roar and kill the dictator asked they are ool lied solemnly i saw them together in the land of the lost i joined them and learned their language which is simple and for days i tried to keep them lost in the desert caverns but finally they no longer heeded my counsel and found this place at that point the girl sona spoke up vehemently those are not true words she said this man ool who has always caused trouble is one of the leaders of the men with the carryingrods that make noise and death the six whom we now have prisoners the big man with the strange skin and the other five are not our enemies but foes of ool and the others ooi said in an injured manner it is true that i was with these men when you were seized in the outer caverns and acted as one of them but have i not told you that i was deceiving them anos the dictator said we will deliberate over the matter of the truth of your statements ool threw his head far back and became rigid for a moment eyes upcast this seemed to be the local method of kowtowing i wish a boon a favor for my services he said the dictator did not seem very enthusiastic what is it he asked the formula for the cold light which only your scientific men know ool said you could not understand it anos pointed out you were not trained in that branch of science in fact i recall you as a very stupid unruly youth who learned little ool made a faint scowl under tile rebuke what about doing me the honor of giving me the formula why do you wish it the other countered i thirst for knowledge was the best excuse ool could offer it is a strange thirst considering your record he was told your request is denied we suspect a trick to speak without falseness ool did not have much success masking his disappointment he bowed i have another boon to ask he said what is this one the giant bronze man and his five companions ool said they are dangerous for the common good of my people i ask that they be put to death that is the boon i ask anos the dictator considered it is a matter for the nonverid to deliberate and pass judgment upon he said ooi had brought one bad habit back with him from the outer world he swore a good muleskinner oath one he must have picked up among watches bowens men then anos the dictator added something which made ool feel much better it would appear that this giant of a man and his five companions are our enemies anos said it is equally probable that the nonverid will decree their death ool to hide his delight put back his head in the strange kowtow for his deadpan features were showing more emotion than usual how will death be decreed he asked in the traditional manner said anos it is well ool said and walked backward from the audience chamber with his head bent stiffly eyes upturned chapter terror in gold back again in the desert labyrinth of the land of the lost ool conferred with watches bowen and his gang we will have to fight ool said watches objected but you said their whatchacallit nouverid could be persuaded that old fool anos put his foot down ool said they will not give up the formula without a fight watches bowen jerked nervously at his watch chain our guns didnt do much good last time we will plan more carefully ool stated we will capture the central mechanical plant with the help of the stor stor watches grunted whats that workers ool explained ah didnt see nobody workin much hamhock piney put in most of em was jus restin around ah would like a job like deyall got the stor are not great in number but bitter vicious ool explained we will use them it is what i had in mind just who are these birds in the stor watches persisted in your country they would be called criminals ool told him when do we start this watches bowen questioned savage is to be sentenced to death by the nonverid i hope ool said bluntly that will make it simple we will wait until savage has been disposed of i hope it aint long watches offered it will not be said ool it is probable that the bronze man is being sentenced now in the prison cell where doc savage and his five aides were confined gloom was thick both physically and spiritually the gaunt johnny paced steadily as monk had expressed it a moment before like somebodys lost skeleton the fact that they were listening to a dire pronouncement did not deter him for he could understand no word anos the dictator was speaking and so our ruling council the nouverid has deliberated fairly and found you to be enemies of ours he was saying it is further considered that you were responsible in whole or in part for the deaths of certain of our population and that as is customary only in cases of murderers you shall receive the death penalty wielded in public for all to witness and be warned with that he turned and walked out anos had spoken the local language of which doc savage and his aides understood nothing the bronze man usually able to acquire a smattering of strange tongues within a short time had found this one especially obtuse but he hazarded a guess it was something serious he said the mans expression showed that monk said that pretty girl we helped out the one they call sona or some thing youd think maybe shed help us out i think she took a fancy to doc i guess theres nothing she can do about it ham said shortly there was a ventilating opening to one side of the room a large square closed by a stout lattice of pressed fibre doc and the others now cooperated in trying to break the lattice down but with no perceptible success they were straining at it when as though wafted in on the soft aureate air the girl sona appeared noiselessly on the other side of the lattice then went to the door am i a prophet monk grinned the girls voice made music as she spoke in low tones to the guard who answered in brief gutturals occasionally shaking his head vigorously but finally nodding mumbling under his breath he opened the door the girl entered she went directly to doc hesitated then rested a hand on his arm her exquisite face was serious she took the bronze mans right hand and made motions as though she were attaching something to the hand she went through the same motions with each of docs aides it feels swell when she holds my hand monk chuckled but what in the devil is she trying to show us the girl now seized docs right hand and moved it in the butterfly manner characteristic of ool holy cow renny boomed without a word the girl left their cell doc savage stood up suddenly i think the girl was trying to tell is how we would be killed he said but that suggests an idea he drew his men together they whispered doc savage approached the lattice he made gestures for the guard to come close the latter did so having no idea of how far doc could leap when the bronze mans left hand streaked through the grating to pin the guards arm the guards eyes bulged with fear when doc made a butterfly motion with his right hand the guards capitulation was sudden complete he opened the lattice doc and his aides swarming out were sighted almost immediately by cavern men down the shimmering golden corridor these rushed forward to cut off escape but doc and his men pushing the mysterious power of the righthand phenomena to its utmost made horrible grimaces as they hurtled forward their right hands they held out in a manner dreadfully familiar to the coldlight people these gave way back in the prison building a penetrating gong started clanging apparently an emergency signal audible far out in the fantastic cavern people began filling the streets we cant make it into the outer caverns doc said suddenly well try for the central mechanical plant they made it nearly all of the way to the central mechanical plant without their progress being seriously threatened but were sighted by many persons occasional poisonous darts of the type which had brought death to two of watches bowens mobsters were sent against them the lethal bolts being fired from peculiar compressed air tubes nearing the central mechanical plant docs aides fell in on each side of him to form a flying wedge on they hurtled with monk slightly behind the others carrying his pet pig those in the plant apparently considered it impossible that six men could make it to the doors and they had not closed the panels before they awakened to the possibilities doc was almost in tile aperture he lunged drove a fist out and knocked a foe away if monk had been satisfied with docs blow the thing which happened next might never have occurred the homely chemist fired with fighting fever expressed himself by shoving the stunned victim out of the way this occupied a fractional moment long enough to allow another enemy to lunge in with one of the deadly darts held knifefashion monk swerved toward the open door the dart raked along his arm barely missed it it did not miss habeas corpus gripped securely under monks arm before monks horrified gaze the poisonous dart sank deep into the pigs neck habeas corpus emitted a shrill squeal almost instantly the porker became limp doc dragged the raging monk inside then got the door closed with his right hand he kept a grip on monk the few cavern men inside the plant offered only shouts by way of resistance they mounted steps monk still carried the limp pig they came to large rooms which seemed to be laboratories lookit renny boomed through the welter of strange scientific apparatus renny had sighted various articles of equipment which they had brought along from the dirigible obviously the equipment had been brought here by the cavern men for analyzing and study some of the things no doubt being as strange as implements from another world gathering their duffel gripping their recovered supermachine pistols they left the laboratory doc rested a hand on monks shoulder better leave habeas he advised youll need both hands for fighting leave habeas for these heathens to dissect monk snorted nix doc said no more about that get set he told his aides he opened the door a crack looking out into the corridor which led to another part of the plant instantly a sizzling jet of something streamed inside doc slammed the door leaping far back inside the laboratory and dragging the others with him the air seemed to be filled with a sudden bitter cold gray stains appeared on the fiber door and spread outward over the surface brrr renny exploded whats happened to the heat ill be superamalgamated johnny barked liquid air huh renny ejaculated air compressed to a liquefied state johnny said seriously permitted to vaporize it has the effect of producing terrific cold long tom looked toward monk bad he questioned liquid air is cold enough to freeze dang near anything monk muttered they probably use it in their airconditioning system and have pipes close to this door doc savages strange flakegold eyes roved the room the door was the only exit the windows gave on a sheer surface that even the bronze man himself could not climb this wall was not like that of the homecell structure being of infinitely finer workmanship ham went over to monk who still clutched the form of the pet pig monk was hit harder by what had befallen habeas than by any misfortune he had encountered in a long time ham dropped a hand on monks arm monk he said slowly im damned sorry guess i never really meant all i said about that hog sure monk muttered i know ham reached out a hand and ruffled the stiff bristles on habeass back and then an unexpected thing happened a shudder coursed over the body of habeas corpus his big ears flapped feebly from his long snout came a faint grunt doc and the others crowded about monks eyes were staring in disbelief habeas corpus shook his head commenced to kick ungainly legs hes comin to life monk said hoarsely within a few minutes habeas corpus was able to stand alone on the floor his little eyes in their fat pockets sighted ham he grunted a friendly recognition and trotted toward him the dapper lawyer glared monk keep that strip of bacon away from me you said you liked habeas monk snorted when did i ever say that ham questioned belligerently keep this flea garage away from me doc savage had been keenly observant of habeas corpuss revival and now he commented on the phenomenon break out your chemical pack monk he suggested lets do some experimenting while the others stood guard at the doors and windows doc and monk worked over habeas corpus they worked for a long time surrounded by an array of tiny test tubes and extremely small phials of chemicals which had come from monks chemical pack which was in itself a marvelously compact and remarkably complete analytical laboratory there was much angry shouting from the cavern people and this kept up steadily but nothing drastic was done doc savage worked steadily needing certain chemicals he surveyed the big laboratory noting the multiplicity of apparatus in view the purpose of many of the devices he recognized although they differed greatly in appearance from those for instance to be found in docs new york city headquarters laboratory their functional process was similar other devices baffled him in the brief moments he devoted to examination and carried conviction that in many respects these strange cavern people were far ahead scientifically of the socalled civilizations on the outside of the globe the cavern people apparently had no system of writing or if they had did not use it for there were great filing bins to one side and these held spools of stiff thin bright wire while nearby were apparatus resembling phonographs the bronze man recognized this as mechanism for recording speech magnetically on wire as time passed the cavern men became more impatient the violence of their assaults increased they drilled holes in the walls and although doc and his men fired mercy bullets through some of the apertures the cavern men eventually managed to insert nozzles which began spraying liquid air vaporizing the stuff condensed the moisture in the air causing clouds of steam most of the liquefied air was forced in through holes in the ceiling sonic of it fell on a large wad of soft cottonlike fibre which doc had used in his ministrations to habeas corpus the fibre was knocked off the table struck the floor with a sharp rap and frozen incredibly solid broke into a myriad of particles ill say thats potent stuff ham said grimly doc tried the doors these were locked from the outside now it developed brrr monk shivered surrendering means theyll probably croak us docs face was bleak and be continued to pound on the door signifying their readiness to surrender we cannot stay here he pointed out the bronze man produced a bottle of fair size and banded it about ordering each of his men to drink they did so making faces over the vile green contents then doc drank some himself the men did not ask questions they knew that the bottle was filled with some substance which the bronze man had mixed in the laboratory it was awful stuff to the taste the door was opened shortly but only wide enough to let them out one at a time arid they were seized by a number of cavern men which made resistance futile they were disarmed searched thoroughly their captors spent much time examining their right hands and seemed puzzled when they found nothing they really thought we could kill people by waving our right hands like that bird ool monk muttered ham said what worries me is what theyll do with us now there was a great multitude in the streets a throng which was ominously uneasy and it spread around doc savage and his aides in waves as they were conducted toward the executive buildings they did not enter the buildings but circled to a vast amphitheater in the rear the center of which held a platform of considerable areas this was raised just sufficiently to be in view of the throng holy cow renny rumbled kinda looks like theyre gonna make a public example of us chapter execution the ceremonies following were unpleasantly meaningful unbound but ludicrously helpless simply because they were held and led by leashlike cords attached to their necks wrists and ankles doc savage and his five men were hauled ignominiously to the rostrum and boosted upon it as they were thus put within view of every one an insistent drone went up to the high roof of the weird cavern the multitude calling out in their unintelligible tongue and judging from the insistent tone demanding the events be hurried the babble of talk drowned out completely the throbbing of the processing machine from the central mechanical plant which ticked so interminably through the golden haze but as the time for the climax came close the hubbub of talk quieted although for another few seconds echoes haunted the luminous cavern then these too sank into nothingness so that silence settled broken only by the throbbing from the central mechanical plant which was now audible and accentuated the grisly quiet six cavern men stalwart half a head taller than the average of the coldlight people stepped out one beside doc savage and one beside each of the bronze mans five aides attired in hooded capes and with their blackgoggled white faces grimly emotionless they looked the very personification of death itself each of these six gripped a flat fibre case in one hand anos the dictator came on the scene at the head of a procession which included his own daughter sona the members of the nonverid or governing council and various minor functionaries these took up a position on the rostrum damn it monk growled if we could only talk to these people the dictator attired in a bloodred cape stood facing the prisoners the nonverid flanking him on either side and the girl sona standing directly behind the father the young woman seemed to be arguing she had been arguing as they entered her speech was vehement but to it the dictator returned only a gesture which seemed to be the local equivalent of a handshake this was a quick convulsing of the shoulders then the girl tried to move forward to doc and the five others crying out loudly angrily she was grasped and drawn back good kid renny rumbled shes doing her bit anos the dictator shouted out and the six large men grasping the fibre cases stepped even closer opened the cases and took out slender shining objects these were poison darts ill be superamalgamated gulped johnny the executioners anos cried out again the executioners leaped suddenly doc and his men were taken in a way by surprise they had expected more preliminaries they struggled struck wrenched about but several men were on each leash and they were spreadeagled in a trice helpless the darts were plunged into their flesh the results which followed were much like those that had accompanied the death of beery hosmer long ago in front of the candy store in new york doc and his men flounced about struggling feebly and their movements became weaker less violent so that finally when the leashes which held them were slackened they did not move at all anos the dictator said in his native tongue justice is done the girl sona wailed shrilly on the outskirts of the multitude a man detached himself and scuttled away so great was the interest in the execution that his action was not noticed the man who had departed so furtively went by devious ways to a spot where he encountered ool watches bowen and his men who were gathered with a considerable number of viciouslooking members of the stor or forced labor squadrons the giant man and his five are dead advised the messenger addressing ool it is good said ool then ool spoke his stilted english to watches bowen the bronze man has been executed he said we will rush the central mechanical plant now once we reach it members of the stor who are working with us will admit us the plant is strong we can hold it and by cutting off the warmth from the air and the cold light as you call it we can make our own terms lets go said watches they advanced showing no scruples no human feeling they cut down the first cavern man to discover them using a blast from a submachine gun at the terrifying roar of the gun bedlam broke loose in the multitude gathered to witness the execution anos the dictator kept his head and dispatched squadrons of men to take up positions in various buildings commanding approaches to the central mechanical plant these were equipped with the little air tubes launching the poisoned darts watches bowen defeated the menace of the darts by a simple device he and his men according to a prearranged plan rushed a certain building and got large sheets of the compressed building fibre this material was light and the darts would not penetrate it they served as shields the advance on the central mechanical plant began complications developed to aid them complications which they had planned members of the stor who were at work not having been permitted to witness the executionbegan revolting somehow they had gotten darts and the air guns and they proceeded to wreak destruction of their own from the fabrication plants they ran along ramps toward the homecells or habitation structures on top of one of these honey hamilton had established a machine gun nest the cavern men released repeated barrages of poisoned darts but these had little effect since the ramps were protected by waisthigh walls and honey hamilton was sheltered by a parapet closer and closer the raiders came to the central mechanical plant honey hamilton shooting expertly kept down the worst of the opposition those of the stor in the central mechanical plant having overcome their guards got the doors open and stood in the apertures howling a welcome as well as advice it seemed that watches bowen and ills crew would soon enter but there was an interruption anos the dictator had himself taken charge of a picked squad in a desperate effort to stem the raid he had bunched his men and they rushed in a body striving by superior force to beat down watches bowen and his shielded party honey hamilton that he might not be cut off on top of the homecell had descended and with his guard was rushing along the street fortune brought him in directly behind the dictators squad the next instant they were embroiled in a handtohand fight yelling honey hamilton managed to fight clear of the fray he jacked a fresh ammo drum into his machine gun and in order that its recoil would not get the instrument away from his control he snapped it to a large belt which encircled his middle the bit of delay was his undoing anos the dictator himself rushed honey hamilton anos gripped one of the darts and was endeavoring to get it into a pneumatic tube he gave that up as being too slow and hurled it spear fashion at the mouselike killer honey hamilton dodged but just a little too late for the dart caught him in the face and clung there flipping up and down as he jumped about but he did not jump for long his eyes lost their glitter for a fleeting instant they held a bewildered expression as if the brain behind them were groping for something then the eyes blinked shut the machine gun fell and hung by the belt fastenings honey hamilton upset on the smooth stone anos the dictator lunged and tried to pick up the machine gun but the belt fastenings being unfamiliar baffled him and instead he lifted the dead thug up bodily using the lifeless form as a shield anos had some luck then or perhaps it was not luck for he had observed closely the position of the hands when the gun wrought its havoc he found the trigger the weapons bawl wrought havoc on friend and foe alike shrieks arose men went down misdirected slugs streamed up to the roof flattened and came back like slow leaden rain cries from both sides pierced the uproar the effect of having one of the guns turned on them was unnerving to the rebelling stor members they wavered milled then they began to retreat hold it watches squawled forgetting his command could not be understood ool put the same orders into the cavern dialect but without perceptible results the stor men fell back the matter of personal safety dictated that watches ool and the others keep in their midst for men of the stor were being used as human shields to a degree the dictators seized machine gun stuttered to emptiness that changed the situation watches bowen roared and rushed forward he had his peculiar watch out whirling it on the end of its stout chain with hoarse cries the stor lunged to help him the end came quickly for the darts were no match for the machine guns anos the dictator was taken prisoner and along with him various members of the ruling nonverid who had been with him this had the effect of breaking the backbone of the entire defense these cavern people were not a fighting race and with their leadership shattered were virtually helpless the raiders went on and took the central mechanical plant twenty minutes later in a latticed chamber of the executive building anos the dictator his daughter sona the entire membership of the nouverid and certain other dignitaries stood prisoners they must be executed said ool that will insure us having no more trouble members of the stor who packed the room roared their approval of that suggestion sure said watches bowen its jake by me ool translated and the roars of fierce approval from the stor echoed to the cavern roof i got an idea watches said get the bodies of doc savage and his men and bring em here well bury the whole crowd together ool agreed and dispatched men to bring the bodies we will hold off the execution for a time he said why watches wanted to know the secret of the cold light may not be on the voice wires in the laboratory file bins ool explained we can get the secret by studying the machinery of course but that will take much time we may find it convenient to make some of these prisoners tell us that we may be saved the labor of a search the men sent to bring the bodies of doc savage and his five aides returned unexpectedly soon they were excited and stuttered out excitedly to ool ool swore one of the oaths he had picked up in association with watches bowen whats wrong watches demanded the bodies have disappeared ool explained gloomily chapter cold fate the failure to find the bodies of doc savage and his aides worried watches bowen and the others but they did not let it interfere with their desires they left the prisoners under guard and headed for the central mechanical plant and its laboratories to search the voice wires in the file bins in an endeavor to locate the formula for the making of the cold light the absence of the bodies means nothing watches snorted somebody took em away thats all ah done feel bettah if ah see dat bronze man put in de ground wit mah own eyes hamhock piney advised he shook his knob of a head on its many chins ah don know if ah would feel plumb safe even den nuts said watches hamhock moistened thick lips watches yoall nevah did get to give dat doc savage man de special watch what yoall been carryin foah him ill bury it with him watches said the mechanism of the central mechanical plant was throbbing steadily monotonously as they approached the wide doors although the excitement was seemingly over watches and his party had brought along a group of the stor in the center of whom they walked in order to be safe from an unexpected attack they had sought to gather up the poison darts and the pneumatic tubes used to discharge them but many of the darts they knew were still at large when they were very close to the mechanical plant entrance things happened there was a sudden hooting roar a tremendous sound that blasted up a million echoes watches and his men had heard it before ol bronze bad luck agin hamhock piney wailed ah knowed he wasnt dead the outer fringe of stor was collapsing mowed down by mercy bullets from the rapidfirers back watches roared get under cover in the uproar it was impossible that many could have heard but hearing was not necessary shrinking instinctively before the devastating hail of chemicalcharged lead slugs the men poured backward around the nearest corner not all made it fully a score of the stor had gone down while ool was getting some sort of organization hamhock muttered to watches ah reckons yoal goin have a chance to use dat special watch huh watches could only moan but i thought he was dead they retreated on around to the other side of the building a homecell habitation structure and took up positions behind a low ramp where they could not be reached by the supermachine pistols ool and watches conferred earnestly then ool who knew the metropolis well pointed out a route whereby they could gain the nearest door of the central mechanical plant watches ordered fresh drums in the submachine guns he planted himself and his men in the midst of the remaining stor and the charge started they reached the door of the mechanical plant with no losses in watches group and with only a loss of about a third of the stor allies this was because the hooting of the supermachine pistols ceased when it was evident watches and his party could not be kept out of the plant the reason for that interruption in firing was soon evident doc savage and his men had retreated and also entered the central mechanical plant but by another door shots began to crash in the confines of the great plant over and over hamhock piney muttered dat bronze boy jes aint human actual explanation of how doc savage had maneuvered the escape from the dart death would probably have been incomprehensible to hamhock for it entailed the use of numerous chemicalsthe concocting in short of an antidote the fact that habeas corpus had not perished from the dart venom had indicated it was not necessarily as fatal as they had at first thought the survival of habeas was simple hogs are frequently immune to snake bites due possibly to their fatty structure docs work in the laboratory while besieged had been for the purpose of concocting the antidote which he had persuaded his men to drink just before their capture as a matter of fact the inoculation had not been as effective as was hoped doc and his aides all having lost consciousness at the execution but the serum had prevented death and they had revived after a time the confusion during the thick of the fighting had covered their escape ah wishes ah was back home hamhock piney was wailing somewhere bigfisted renny rumbled hell wish it even more if i can get hold of him the watches bowen party were below behind a fabulous tier of pipes which seemed to be heavily insulated and very strong we will try to get above them doc said grimly there was a series of rungs hardly a stairway but intended as such to the right it worked up through more tubes past tanks the ticking of the plant was a sound of enormous volume here they reached a spot where they could look down in a machine room and there they saw the source of the ticking it was a huge compressor which worked with rhythmatic strokes actuating tremendous pistons they went on twice watches bowens party saw them bullets rained doc got a bad scratch over one leg then watches bowen and ool whipped their stor allies into a compact group and forced them to charge forward up the stairs the stor men came realizing they were being used simply as shields but more afraid of the raging threats behind than the possible death in front holy cow renny stuttered theyre liable to head us off the crash of shots inside the plant was terrific in various spots cavern men not engaged in the fighting were yelling out some seemed to be battling scattered members of the stor doc savage and his men reached a narrow ledge which had a parapet that offered some shelter they crouched behind it unlimbered their machine pistols the hooting blasts brought watches bowens gang up sharp the stor shields were more reluctant now they milled about hung back watches cursed them hamhock piney was too seared to be of much aid ool was making fierce darting gestures with his mysterious right hand menacing the stor men watches bowen fell to glaring at the ledge where doc savage and his men lay below the ledge was a sheer drop of fully fifty feet and then moving machinery heres where i deliver that special watch bowen gritted he dived a hand into a pocket the timepiece which watches bowen brought out was the one which he had repeatedly assured members of his gang was a special gift destined for doc savage the watch was unusually large bowen drew back an arm to throw it doc savage saw the move dont his remarkable voice was a crash of sound sure watches yelled ill do that with a quick twist of thumb and forefinger the mob chief turned the stem of the watch as if he were winding it there started a faintly audible whir his arm arched back and he prepared to throw it was doubtful if watches bowen ever fully comprehended what happened next ool apparently sensing watches intention clawed out desperately to stop the throw their arms collided the watch flew forward and upward and landed in a maze of pipes almost over their heads watches screamed damn you what fool ool said the pipes are carrying what you call liquid air whooom the watch was a small violent grenade and it let go steel fragments rained from above there was a shrill roar not of powder unleashed but of something else something gray and smoking that boiled down in great sheets from rent pipes the liquid air ool screamed run his words were in the cavern language watches and the other thugs did not understand at first and when they did it was too late for the liquid air was spilling upon them and vaporizing causing unearthly cold it engulfed ool and watches bowen and seemed to congeal them where they stood for the insidious stuff came down in tremendous quantities by hundreds of gallons ool having brief advance knowledge of what was going to happen leaped and gained a little distance but he fell down trying to wedge between pipes and he lay there his right arm outstretched through the pipes so that it was visible to doc savage and his men where they stood on the balcony doc had a pistol which he had seized intending to shoot down the watch grenade in the air were it thrown a trick he could have accomplished having done so on other occasions ools hideous right hand weaved twisted for a time then became still for he was in the path of the flood of liquid air vapor like steam was coming from the flood of liquid air in tremendous quantities filling all of the mechanical plant doc savage and his men able to see nothing retreated taking up positions at the doors lest watches bowen or some of the others come out none came something like ten hours saw the end of the stor revolt which watches bowen and ool had fostered the men of the stor did not stand up for long against the machine pistols of doc savage and his aides anos the dictator sona his daughter and members of the council were released unharmed since sufficient time had elapsed for the liquid air to vaporize in the central mechanical plant doc savage and his party entered to examine the remains of watches bowen ool and the others the sight was not pleasant the incredibly low temperatures of the liquid air had done strange things to the bodies one apparently freezing while sprawled over a pipe had later upset and being brittle had broken as if it were glass it was monk who first made an examination of ools right hand which had not been affected greatly by the liquid air projecting as it did through the pipes the light dawns he exploded lookit the secret of ools handwaving death was a bit complicated but simply understood it was a tiny pneumatic cylinder discharging a dart and this being of a color almost identical with his hands would escape ordinary eyes it was held in place by a particularly strong adhesive which did not harden and thus being quickly detachable could be removed and hidden quickly that last it was evident accounted for doc savage not finding it on the occasions when he had searched ool ools particular dart was very small and driven with such force that it entered bulletlike entirely under the skin leaving a wound that was perceptible to no ordinary examination although doc savage and his men had not been equipped with the minute hand darts when they escaped from the latticedwindowed jail it was evident that the guard after seeing docs hand wave in butterfly fashion had surmised the girl sona had given doc one of the small hand darts it was this ruse which had caused his fright and allowed doc and his aides to escape the final fight in the central mechanical plant marked the end of doc savages trouble with the cavern people it being demonstrated that he was a friend learning their language so that he could speak it even passably required the expenditure of nearly a month not the entire time was spent learning the speech however there were other things experiments with the strange cold light for instance those were not so encouraging it developed that the manner of illuminating the cavern air was not efficient where there was any considerable amount of moisture in suspension that made it virtually useless for the outer world the cavern air was fully as dry as that over the sahara and even it was a bit damp for efficiency at times it works nicely here long tom expressed it but its no good outside monk snorted too bad we didnt know that watches bowen and ool could have had it the question of the population of the cavern came up doc offered them transportation to the outer world it was feasible using the dirigible the cavern people asked many questions about the outer world doc told them they learned of blizzards of summer heat tornadoes snowstorms of modern transportation then they talked it over we stay here anos the dictator advised doc savage yours does not sound like such an attractive world but we do have one boon to ask what is it doc questioned keep the existence of this place secret said the other revealing its existence can accomplish naught but trouble for us doc savage agreed it was not the only fantastic secret he was keeping fantastic things had a way of coming in his direction he reflected it was not true that the departure of doc savage from the cavern land was unmarked by regret the remarkable bronze man had made an impression especially among the members of the scientific groups who found his knowledge surprising the girl sona was reluctant to see him go that was evident and out of that there grew a parting complication as doc savage and his aides having been guided to the outer cleft where their dirigible still rested and having gotten it ready for the air prepared to take off habeas corpus could not be found there was an uproar departure was delayed while monk charged about hunting his porker eventually he appeared with habeas wheres ham he howled ill wring that shysters neck ham was prudently not in sight the princess wanted a souvenir of our visit monk roared angrily what did this ham do i ask you the shyster up and gave her habeas the homely chemist grinned now if she had wanted me for a souvenir i might have stayed he chuckled but leave this hog nix the end
