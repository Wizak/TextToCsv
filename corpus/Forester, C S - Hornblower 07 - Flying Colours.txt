flying colours c s forester chapter one captain hornblower was walking up and down along the sector of the ramparts of rosas delimited by two sentries with loaded muskets which the commandant had granted him for exercise overhead shone the bright autumn sun of the mediterranean hanging in a blue mediterranean sky and shining on the mediterranean blue of rosas bay the blue water fringed with white where the little waves broke against the shore of golden sand and greygreen cliff black against the sun above his head there flapped the tricolour flag of france proclaiming to the world that rosas was in the hands of the french that captain hornblower was a prisoner not half a mile from where he walked lay the dismasted wreck of his ship the sutherland beached to prevent her from sinking and in line beyond her there swung at their anchors the four ships of the line which had fought her hornblower narrowing his eyes and with a twinge of regret for his lost telescope could see even at that distance that they were not ready for sea again nor were likely to be even the twodecker which had emerged from the fight with all her masts intact still had her pumps at work every two hours to keep her afloat and the other three had not yet succeeded in setting up masts to replace the ones lost in the battle the french were a lubberly lot of noseamen as might be expected after seventeen years of defeat at sea and six of continuous blockade they had been all honey to him in their french fashion praising him for his glorious defence after his bold initiative in dashing in with his ship to interpose between their four and their refuge at rosas they had expressed the liveliest pleasure at discovering that he had miraculously emerged unhurt from a battle which had left twothirds of his men killed and wounded but they had plundered in the fashion which had made the armed forces of the empire hated throughout europe they had searched the pockets even of the wounded who had cumbered the sutherlands decks in moaning heaps their admiral on his first encounter with hornblower had expressed surprise that the latter was not wearing the sword which the admiral had sent back to him in recognition of his gallantry and on hornblowers denial that he had ever seen the weapon again after giving it up had instituted a search which discovered the sword cast aside somewhere in his flagship the glorious inscription still engraved upon the blade but with the gold stripped from hilt and guard and scabbard and the admiral had merely laughed at that and had not dreamed of instituting a search for the thief the patriotic funds gift still hung at hornblowers side the tang of the blade protruding nakedly from the scabbard without the gold and ivory and seed pearls which had adorned it the french soldiers and sailors which had swarmed over the captured ship had torn away even the brasswork in the same fashion they had gorged upon the unappetizing provisions in a way which proved how miserable were the rations provided for the men who fought for the empire but it was only a few who had swilled themselves into insensibility from the rum casks in face of similar temptation british seamen would have drunk until ninetenths of them were incapable or fighting mad the french officers had made the usual appeal to their prisoners to join the french ranks making the usual tempting offers of good treatment and regular pay to anyone who cared to enlist either in the army or the navy hornblower was proud that no single man had succumbed to the temptation as a consequence the few sound men now languished in strict confinement in one of the empty storerooms of the fortress deprived of the tobacco and rum and fresh air which for most of them represented the difference between heaven and hell the wounded the hundred and fortyfive wounded were rotting in a dank casemate where gangrene and fever would soon make an end of them to the logical french mind the povertystricken army of catalonia which could do little even for its own wounded would be mad to expend any of its resources on attention to wounded who would be intolerable nuisances should they survive a little moan escaped hornblowers lips as he paced the ramparts he had a room of his own a servant to wait on him fresh air and sunshine while the poor devils he had commanded were suffering all the miseries of confinement even the three or four other unwounded officers were lodged in the town gaol true he suspected that he was being reserved for another fate during those glorious days when in command of the sutherland he had won for himself unknowing the nickname of the terror of the mediterranean he had managed to storm the battery at llanza by bringing his ship up close to it flying the tricolour flag that had been a legitimate ruse de guerre for which historical precedents without number could be quoted but the french government had apparently deemed it a violation of the laws of war the next convoy to france or barcelona would bear him with it as a prisoner to be tried by a military commission bonaparte was quite capable of shooting him both from personal rancour and as a proof of the most convincing sort to europe of british duplicity and wickedness and during the last day or two hornblower thought he had read as much in the eyes of his gaolers just enough time had elapsed for the news of the sutherlands capture to have reached paris and for bonapartes subsequent orders to have been transmitted to rosas the moniteur universel would have blazed out in a paean of triumph declaring to the continent that this loss of a ship of the line was clear proof that england was tottering to her fall like ancient carthage in a month or twos time presumably there would be another announcement to the effect that a traitorous servant of perfidious albion had met his just deserts against a wall in vincennes or montjuich hornblower cleared his throat nervously as he walked he expected to feel afraid and was surprised that he did not the thought of an abrupt and inevitable end of that sort did not alarm him as much as did his shapeless imaginings when he was going into action on his quarterdeck in fact he could almost view it with relief as putting an end to his worries about his wife maria whom he had left pregnant and to his jealous torments of longing for lady barbara who had married his admiral in the eyes of england he would be regarded as a martyr whose widow deserved a pension it would be an honourable end then which a man ought to welcome especially a man like hornblower whose persistent and unfounded disbelief in his own capacity left him continually frightened of professional disgrace and ruin and it would be an end of captivity too hornblower had been a prisoner once before for two heartbreaking years in ferrol but with the passing of time he had forgotten the misery of it until his new experience in those days too he had never known the freedom of his own quarterdeck and had never tasted the unbounded liberty the widest freedom on earth of being a captain of a ship it was torture now to be a prisoner even with the liberty to look upon the sky and the sea a caged lion must fret behind his bars in the same way as hornblower fretted against his confinement he felt suddenly sick and ill through restraint he clenched his fists and only by an effort prevented himself from raising them above his head in a gesture of despair then he took hold of himself again with an inward sneer at his childish weakness to distract himself he looked out again to the blue sea which he loved the row of black cormorants silhouetted against the grey cliff the gulls wheeling against the blue sky five miles out he could see the topsails of his majestys frigate cassandra keeping sleepless watch over the four french ships huddled for shelter under the guns of rosas and beyond them he could see the royals of the pluto and the caligula admiral leighton the unworthy husband of his beloved lady barbara was flying his flag in the pluto but he refused to let that thought worry him where they awaited an accession of strength from the mediterranean fleet before coming in to destroy the ships which had captured him he could rely upon the british to avenge his defeat martin the viceadmiral with the toulon blockading squadron would see to it that leighton did not make a hash of this attack powerful as might be the guns of rosas he looked along the ramparts at the massive twentyfourpounders mounted there the bastions at the angles carried fortytwopounders colossal pieces he leaned over the parapet and looked down it was a sheer drop from there of twentyfive feet to the bottom of the ditch and along the bottom of the ditch itself ran a line of stout palisades which no besieging army could damage until he had sapped right up to the lip of the ditch no hurried extemporized attack could carry the citadel of rosas a score of sentries paced the ramparts even as did he in the opposite face he could see the massive gates with the portcullis down where a hundred men of the grand guard were always ready to beat back any surprise attack which might elude the vigilance of the twenty sentinels down there in the body of the place a company of infantry was being put through its drill the shrill words of command were clearly audible to him up here it was italian which was being spoken bonaparte had attempted his conquest of catalonia mainly with the foreign auxiliaries of his empire italians neapolitans germans swiss poles the uniforms of the infantry down there were as ragged as the lines they were forming the men were in tatters and even the tatters were not homogeneous the men wore white or blue or grey or brown according to the resources of the depots which had originally sent them out they were half starved poor devils as well of the five or six thousand men based on rosas the ones he could see were all that could be spared for military duty the others were all out scouring the countryside for food bonaparte never dreamed of trying to feed the men whom he compelled to serve him just as he only paid them as an afterthought a year or two in arrears it was amazing that his ramshackle empire had endured so long that was the clearest proof of the incompetence of the various kingdoms who had pitted their strength against it over on the other side of the peninsula the french empire was at this very minute putting out all its strength against a man of real ability and an army which knew what discipline was on the issue of that struggle depended the fate of europe hornblower was convinced that the redcoats with wellington to lead them would be successful he would have been just as certain even if wellington were not his beloved lady barbaras brother then he shrugged his shoulders not even wellington would destroy the french empire quickly enough to save him from trial and execution moreover the time allowed him for his days exercise was over now the next items in his monotonous programme would be to visit the sick in the casemate and then the prisoners in the storeroom by the courtesy of the commandant he was allowed ten minutes for each before being shut up again in his room drearily to attempt to reread the halfdozen books which were all that the garrison of rosas possessed or to pace up and down three steps each way or to lie huddled on his bed wondering about maria and the child that was to be born in the new year and torturing himself with thoughts of lady barbara chapter two hornblower awoke that night with a start wondering what it was that had awakened him a moment later he knew when the sound was repeated it was the dull thud of a gun fired on the ramparts above his head he leaped from his bed with his heart pounding and before his feet touched the floor the whole fortress was in a turmoil overhead there were guns firing somewhere else outside the body of the fortress there were hundreds of guns firing through the barred windows of his room came a faint flickering as the flashes were reflected down from the sky immediately outside his door drums were beating and bugles were pealing as the garrison was called to arms the courtyard was full of the sounds of nailed boots clashing on the cobbles that tremendous pulsation of artillery which he could hear could mean only one thing the fleet must have come gliding into the bay in the darkness and now he could hear the rolling of its broadsides as it battered the anchored ships there was a great naval battle in progress within half a mile of him and he could see nothing of it it was utterly maddening he tried to light his candle but his trembling fingers could do nothing with his flint and steel he dashed the tinderbox to the floor and fumbling in the darkness he dragged on his coat and trousers and shoes and then beat upon the door madly with his fists the sentry outside was italian he knew and he spoke no italian only fluent spanish and bad french officier officier he shouted and then he heard the sentry call for the sergeant of the guard and the measured step of the sergeant as he came up the clatter of the garrisons falling in under arms had already died away what do you want asked the sergeants voice at least so hornblower fancied for he could not understand what was said officier officier roared hornblower beating still on the heavy door the artillery was still rolling terrifically outside hornblower went on pounding on the door even until he heard the key in the lock the door swung open and he blinked at the light of a torch which shone into his eyes a young subaltern in a neat white uniform stood there between the sergeant and the sentry questceque monsieur dsire he asked he at least understood french even if he spoke it badly hornblower fumbled to express himself in an unfamiliar tongue i want to see he stammered i want to see the battle let me go on to the walls the young officer shook his head reluctantly like the other officers of the garrison he felt a kindly feeling towards the english captain who so rumour said was so shortly to be conducted to paris and shot it is forbidden he said i will not escape said hornblower desperate excitement was loosening his tongue now word of honour i swear it come with me but let me see i want to see the officer hesitated i cannot leave my post here he said then let me go alone i swear i will stay on the walls i will not try to escape word of honour asked the subaltern word of honour thank you sir the subaltern stood aside and hornblower dashed out of his room down the short corridor to the courtyard and up the ramp which led to the seaward bastion as he reached it the fortytwopounder mounted there went off with a deafening roar and the long tongue of orange flame nearly blinded him in the darkness the bitter powder smoke engulfed him nobody in the groups bending over the guns noticed him and he ran down the steep staircase to the curtain wall where away from the guns he could see without being blinded rosas bay was all asparkle with gun flashes then five times in regular succession came the brilliant red glow of a broadside and each glow lit up a stately ship gliding in rigid line ahead past the anchored french ships the pluto was there hornblower saw her three decks her ensign at the peak her admirals flag at the mizzen her topsails set and her other canvas furled leighton would be there walking his quarterdeck thinking of barbara perhaps and that next astern was the caligula bolton would be stumping about her deck revelling in the crash of her broadsides she was firing rapidly and well bolton was a good captain although a badly educated man the words oderint dum metuant the caesar caligulas maxim picked out in letters of gold across the caligulas stern had meant nothing to bolton until hornblower translated and explained them to him at this very moment perhaps those letters were being defaced and battered by the french shot but the french squadron was firing back badly and irregularly there was no sudden glow of broadsides where they lay anchored but only an irregular and intermittent sparkle as the guns were loosed off anyhow in a night action like this and after a sudden surprise hornblower would not have trusted even an english seaman with independent fire he doubted if as many as onetenth of the french guns were being properly served and pointed as for the heavy guns pealing away beside him from the fortress he was quite certain they were doing no good to the french cause and possibly some harm firing at half a mile in the darkness even from a steady platform and with large calibre guns they were as likely to hit friend as foe it had well repaid admiral martin to send in leighton and his ships in the moonless hours of the night risking all the navigational perils of the bay hornblower choked with emotion and excitement as his imagination called up the details of what would be going on in the english ships the leadsman chanting the soundings with disciplined steadiness the heave of the ship to the deafening crash of the broadside the battle lanterns glowing dimly in the smoke of the lower decks the squeal and rattle of the gun trucks as the guns were run up again the steady orders of the officers in charge of sections of guns the quiet voice of the captain addressing the helmsmen he leaned far over the parapet in the darkness peering down into the bay a whiff of wood smoke came to his nostrils sharply distinct from the acrid powder smoke which was drifting by from the guns they had lit the furnaces for heating shot but the commandant would be a fool if he allowed his guns to fire redhot shot in these conditions french ships were as inflammable as english ones and just as likely to be hit in a close battle like this then his grip tightened on the stonework of the parapet and he stared and stared again with aching eyes towards what had attracted his notice it was the tiniest most subdued little red glow in the distance the english had brought in fire ships in the wake of their fighting squadron a squadron at anchor like this was the best possible target for a fire ship and martin had planned his attack well in sending in his ships of the line first to clear away guard boats and beat down the french fire and occupy the attention of the crews the red glow suddenly increased grew brighter and brighter still revealing the hull and masts and rigging of a small brig still brighter it grew as the few daring spirits who remained on board flung open hatches and gunports to increase the draught the tongues of flame which soared up were visible even to hornblower on the ramparts and they revealed to him too the form of the turenne alongside her the one french ship which had emerged from the previous battle with all her masts whoever the young officer in command of the fire ship might be he was a man with a cool head and determined will thus to select the most profitable target of all hornblower saw points of fire begin to ascend the rigging of the turenne until she was outlined in red like some setpiece in a firework display sudden jets of flame showed where powder charges on her deck were taking fire and then the whole setpiece suddenly swung round and began to drift before the gentle wind as the burnt cables gave way a mast fell in an upward torrent of sparks strangely reflected in the black water all round at once the sparkle of gunfire in the other french ships began to die away as the crews were called from their guns to deal with the drifting menace and a slow movement of the shadowy forms lit by the flames revealed that their cables had been cut by officers terrified of death by fire then suddenly hornblowers attention was distracted to a point closer in to shore where the abandoned wreck of the sutherland lay beached there too a red glow could be seen growing and spreading momentarily some daring party from the british squadron had boarded her and set her on fire too determined not to leave even so poor a trophy in the hands of the french farther out in the bay three red dots of light were soaring upwards slowly and hornblower gulped in sudden nervousness lest an english ship should have caught fire as well but he realized next moment that it was only a signal three vertical red lanterns which was apparently the prearranged recall for with their appearance the firing abruptly ceased the blazing wrecks lit up now the whole of this corner of the bay with a lurid red in whose light could be distinctly seen the other french ships drifting without masts or anchors towards the shore next came a blinding flash and a stunning explosion as the magazine of the turenne took fire for several seconds after the twenty tons of gunpowder had exploded hornblowers eyes could not see nor his mind think the blast of it had shaken him like a child in the hands of an angry nurse even where he stood he became aware that daylight was creeping into the bay revealing the ramparts of rosas in hard outlines and dulling the flames from the wreck of the sutherland far out in the bay already beyond gunshot of the fortress the five british ships of the line were standing out to sea in their rigid lineahead there was something strange about the appearance of the pluto it was only at his second glance that hornblower realized that she had lost her main topmast clear proof that one french shot at least had done damage the other ships revealed no sign of having received any injury during one of the best managed affairs in the long history of the british navy hornblower tore his gaze from his vanishing friends to study the field of battle of the turenne and the fire ship there was no sign at all of the sutherland there only remained a few blackened timbers emerging from the water with a wisp of smoke suspended above them two ships of the line were on the rocks to the westward of the fortress and french seamanship would never make them seaworthy again only the threedecker was left battered and mastless swinging to the anchor which had checked her on the very edge of the surf the next easterly gale would see her too flung ashore and useless the british mediterranean fleet would in the future have to dissipate none of its energies in a blockade of rosas here came general vidal the governor of the fortress making his rounds with his staff at his heels and just in time to save hornblower from falling into a passion of despair at watching the english squadron disappear over the horizon what are you doing here demanded the general checking at the sight of him under the sternness of his expression could be read the kindly pity which hornblower had noticed in the faces of all his enemies when they began to suspect that a firing party awaited him the officer of the grand guard allowed me to come up here explained hornblower in his halting french i gave him my parole of honour not to try to escape i will withdraw it again now if you please he had no business to accept it in any case snapped the general but with that fateful kindliness still apparent you wanted to see the battle i suppose yes general a fine piece of work your companions have done the general shook his head sadly it will not make the government in paris feel any better disposed towards you i fear captain hornblower shrugged his shoulders he had already caught the infection of that gesture during his few days sojourn among frenchmen he noted with a lack of personal interest which seemed odd to him even then that this was the first time that the governor had hinted openly at danger threatening him from paris i have done nothing to make me afraid he said no no of course not said the governor hastily and out of countenance like a parent denying to a child that a prospective dose of medicine would be unpleasant he looked round for some way of changing the subject and fortunate chance brought one from far below in the bowels of the fortress came a muffled sound of cheering english cheers not italian screeches that must be those men of yours captain said the general smiling again i fancy the new prisoner must have told them by now the story of last nights affair the new prisoner demanded hornblower yes indeed a man who fell overboard from the admirals ship the pluto is it not and had to swim ashore ah i suspected you would be interested captain yes off you go and talk to him here dupont take charge of the captain and escort him to the prison hornblower could hardly spare the time in which to thank his captor so eager was he to interview the new arrival and hear what he had to say two weeks as a prisoner had already had their effect in giving him a thirst for news he ran down the ramp dupont puffing beside him across the cobbled court in through the door which a sentry opened for him at a gesture from his escort down the dark stairway to the ironstudded door where stood two sentries on duty with a great clattering of keys the doors were opened for him and he walked into the room it was a wide low room a disused storeroom in fact lit and ventilated only by a few heavily barred apertures opening into the fortress ditch it stank of closely confined humanity and it was at present filled with a babel of sound as what was left of the crew of the sutherland plied questions at someone hidden in the middle of the crowd at hornblowers entrance the crowd fell apart and the new prisoner came forward he was naked save for his duck trousers and a long pigtail hung down his back who are you demanded hornblower phillips sir maintopman in the pluto his honest blue eyes met hornblowers gaze without a sign of flinching hornblower could guess that he was neither a deserter nor a spy he had borne both possibilities in mind how did you come here we was settin sail sir to beat out o the bay wed just seen the old sutherland take fire an capn elliott he says to us he says sir nows the time my lads topsls and togarns so up we went aloft sir an id just taken the earring o the main togarn when down came the mast sir an i was pitched off into the water so was a lot o my mates sir but just then the frenchy which was burnin blew up an i think the wreckage killed a lot of em sir cos i found i was alone an pluto was gone away an so i swum for the shore an there was a lot of frenchies what i think had swum from the burning frenchy an they took me to some sojers an the sojers brought me here sir there was a orficer what arst me questions itd a made you laugh sir to hear him trying to speak english but i wasnt sayin nothin sir an when they see that they puts me in here along with the others sir i was just telling em about the fight sir there was the old pluto an caligula sir an yes i saw it said hornblower shortly i saw that pluto had lost her main topmast was she knocked about much lor bless you sir no sir we hadnt had half a dozen shot come aboard an they didnt do no damage barrin the one that wounded the admiral the admiral hornblower reeled a little as he stood as though he had been struck admiral leighton dyou mean admiral leighton sir was was he badly hurt i dunno sir i didnt see it meself o course sir seein as how i was on the main deck at the time sailmakers mate he told me sir that the admiral had been hit by a splinter coopers mate told him sir what helped to carry him below hornblower could say no more for the present he could only stare at the kindly stupid face of the sailor before him yet even in that moment he could take note of the fact that the sailor was not in the least moved by the wounding of his admiral nelsons death had put the whole fleet into mourning and he knew of half a dozen other flag officers whose death or whose wounding would have brought tears into the eyes of the men serving under him if it had been one of those the man would have told of the accident to him before mentioning his own misadventures hornblower had known before that leighton was not beloved by his officers and here was a clear proof that he was not beloved by his men either but perhaps barbara had loved him she had at least married him hornblower forced himself to speak to bear himself naturally that will do he said curtly and then looked round to catch his coxswains eye anything to report brown no sir all well sir hornblower rapped on the door behind him to be let out of prison to be conducted by his guard back to his room again where he could walk up and down three steps each way his brain seething like a pot on a fire he only knew enough to unsettle him to make him anxious leighton had been wounded but that did not mean that he would die a splinter wound that might mean much or little yet he had been carried below no admiral would have allowed that if he had been able to resist not in the heat of a fight at any rate his face might be lacerated or his belly torn open hornblower shuddering shook his mind free from the memories of all the horrible wounds he had seen received on ship board during twenty years service but coldbloodedly it was an even chance that leighton would die hornblower had signed too many casualty lists to be unaware of the chances of a wounded mans recovery if leighton were to die barbara would be free again but what had that to do with him a married man a married man whose wife was pregnant she would be no nearer to him not while maria lived and yet it assuaged his jealousy to think of her as a widow but then perhaps she would marry again and he would have to go once more through all the torment he had endured when he had first heard of her marriage to leighton in that case he would rather leighton lived a cripple perhaps mutilated or impotent the implications of that train of thought drove him into a paroxysm of toorapid thinking from which he only emerged after a desperate struggle for sanity in the cold reaction which followed he sneered at himself for a fool he was the prisoner of a man whose empire extended from the baltic to gibraltar he told himself he would be an old man that his child and marias would be grown up before he regained his liberty and then with a sudden shock he remembered that he might soon be dead shot for violation of the laws of war strange how he could forget that possibility sneering he told himself that he had a cowards mind which could leave the imminence of death out of its calculations because the possibility was too monstrous to bear contemplation there was something else he had not reckoned upon lately too if bonaparte did not have him shot if he regained his freedom even then he still had to run the gauntlet of a court martial for the loss of the sutherland a court martial might decree for him death or disgrace or ruin the british public would not hear lightly of a british ship of the line surrendering however great the odds against her he would have liked to ask phillips the seaman from the pluto about what had been said in the fleet regarding the sutherlands action whether the general verdict had been one of approval or not but of course it would be impossible to ask no captain could ask a seaman what the fleet thought of him even if there was a chance of hearing the truth which too was doubtful he was compassed about with uncertainties the uncertainties of his imprisonment of the possibility of his trial by the french of his future court martial of leightons wound there was even an uncertainty regarding maria she was pregnant would the child be a girl or a boy would he ever see it would anyone raise a finger to help her would she be able to educate the child properly without his supervision once more the misery of imprisonment was borne in upon him he grew sick with longing for his liberty for his freedom for barbara and for maria chapter three hornblower was walking next day upon the ramparts again the sentries with their loaded muskets stood one each end of the sector allotted to him and the subaltern allotted to guard him sat discreetly against the parapet so as not to break in upon the thoughts which preoccupied him but he was too tired to think much now all day and nearly all night yesterday he had paced his room three paces up and three paces back with his mind in a turmoil exhaustion was saving him now he could think no more he welcomed as a distraction a bustle at the main gate the turning out of the guard the opening of the gate and the jingling entrance of a coach drawn by six fine horses he stood and watched the proceedings with all the interest of a captive there was an escort of fifty mounted men in the cocked hats and blueandred uniforms of bonapartes gendarmerie coachmen and servants on the box an officer dismounting hurriedly to open the door clearly the new arrival must be a man of importance hornblower experienced a faint feeling of disappointment when there climbed out of the coach not a marshal with plumes and feathers but just another officer of gendarmerie a youngish man with a bullet black head which he revealed as he held his cocked hat in his hand while stooping to descend the star of the legion of honour on his breast high black boots with spurs hornblower wondered idly why a colonel of gendarmerie who was obviously not crippled should arrive in a coach instead of on horseback he watched him go clinking across the courtyard to the governors headquarters hornblowers walk was nearly finished when one of the young french aidesdecamp of the governor approached him on the ramparts and saluted his excellency sends you his compliments sir and he would be glad if you could spare him a few minutes of your time as soon as it is convenient to you addressed to a prisoner as hornblower told himself bitterly these words might as well have been come at once i will come now with the greatest of pleasure said hornblower maintaining the solemn farce down in the governors office the colonel of gendarmerie was standing conversing alone with his excellency the governors expression was sad i have the honour of presenting to you captain he said turning colonel jeanbaptiste caillard grand eagle of the legion of honour and one of his imperial majestys personal aidesdecamp colonel this is captain horatio hornblower of his britannic majestys navy the governor was dearly worried and upset his hands were fluttering and he stammered a little as he spoke and he made a pitiful muddle of his attempt on the aspirates of hornblowers name hornblower bowed but as the colonel remained unbending he stiffened to attention he could recognize that type of man at once the servant of a tyrant and in close personal association with him modelling his conduct not on the tyrants but on what he fancied should be the correct behaviour of a tyrant far outheroding herod in arbitrariness and cruelty it might be merely a pose the man might be a kind husband and the loving father of a family but it was a pose which might have unpleasant results for anyone in his power his victims would suffer in his attempt to prove to himself as well as to others that he could be more stern more unrelenting and therefore naturally more able than the man who employed him caillard ran a cold eye over hornblowers appearance what is he doing with that sword at his side he asked of the governor the admiral returned it to him on the day of the battle explained the governor hastily he said it doesnt matter what he said interrupted caillard no criminal as guilty as he can be allowed a weapon and a sword is the emblem of a gentleman of honour which he most decidedly is not take off that sword sir hornblower stood appalled hardly believing he had understood caillards face wore a fixed mirthless smile which showed white teeth below the black moustache which lay like a gash across his olive face take off that sword repeated caillard and then as hornblower made no movement if your excellency will permit me to call in one of my gendarmes i will have the sword removed at the threat hornblower unbuckled his belt and allowed the weapon to fall to the ground the clatter rang loud in the silence the sword of honour which the patriotic fund had awarded him ten years ago for his heading of the boarding party which took the castilla lay on the floor jerked half out of its scabbard the hiltless tang and the battered places on the sheath where the gold had been torn off bore mute witness to the lust for gold of the empires servants good said caillard now will your excellency have the goodness to warn this man of his approaching departure colonel caillard said the governor has come to take you and your first lieutenant mistaire mistaire bush to paris bush blazed out hornblower moved as not even the loss of his sword could move him bush that is impossible lieutenant bush is seriously wounded it might easily be fatal to take him on a long journey at present the journey will be fatal to him in any case said caillard still with the mirthless smile and the gleam of white teeth the governor wrung his hands you cannot say that colonel these gentlemen have still to be tried the military commission has yet to give its verdict these gentlemen as you call them your excellency stand condemned out of their own mouths hornblower remembered that he had made no attempt to deny while the admiral was questioning him and preparing his report that he had been in command of the sutherland the day she wore french colours and her landing party stormed the battery at llanza he had known the ruse to be legitimate enough but he had not reckoned on a french emperor determined upon convincing european opinion of the perfidy of england and cunning enough to know that a couple of resounding executions might well be considered evidence of guilt the colonel said the governor to hornblower has brought his coach you may rely upon it that mistaire bush will have every possible comfort please tell me which of your men you would like to accompany you as your servant and if there is anything which i can provide which will make the journey more comfortable i will do so with the greatest pleasure hornblower debated internally the question of the servant polwheal who had served him for years was among the wounded in the casemate nor he fancied would he have selected him in any case polwheal was not the man for an emergency and it was just possible that there might be an emergency latude had escaped from the bastille was not there a faint chance that he might escape from vincennes hornblower thought of browns bulging muscles and cheerful devotion i would like to take my coxswain brown if you please he said certainly i will send for him and have your present servant pack your things with him and with regard to your needs for the journey i need nothing said hornblower at the same time as he spoke he cursed himself for his pride if he were ever to save himself and bush from the firing party in the ditch at vincennes he would need gold oh i cannot allow you to say that protested the governor there may be some few comforts you would like to buy when you are in france besides you cannot deprive me of the pleasure of being of assistance to a brave man please do me the favour of accepting my purse i beg you to sir hornblower fought down his pride and took the proffered wallet it was of surprising weight and gave out a musical chink as he took it i must thank you for your kindness he said and for all your courtesy while i have been your prisoner it has been a pleasure to me as i said replied the governor i want to wish you the the very best of luck on your arrival in paris enough of this said caillard my orders from his majesty call for the utmost expedition is the wounded man in the courtyard the governor led the way out and the gendarmes closed up round hornblower as they walked towards the coach bush was lying there on a stretcher strangely pale and strangely wasted out there in the bright light he was feebly trying to shield his eyes from the sun hornblower ran and knelt beside him theyre going to take us to paris bush he said what you and me sir yes its a place ive often wanted to see the italian surgeon who had amputated bushs foot was plucking at hornblowers sleeve and fluttering some sheets of paper these were instructions he explained in faulty italian french for the further treatment of the stump any surgeon in france would understand them as soon as the ligatures came away the wound would heal at once he had put a parcel of dressings into the coach for use on the journey hornblower tried to thank him but was interrupted when the surgeon turned away to supervise the lifting of bush stretcher and all into the coach it was an immensely long vehicle and the stretcher just fitted in across one door its ends on the two seats brown was there now with hornblowers valise in his hand the coachman showed him how to put it into the boot then a gendarme opened the other door and stood waiting for hornblower to enter hornblower looked up at the ramparts towering above him no more than half an hour ago he had been walking there worn out with doubt at least one doubt was settled now in a fortnights time perhaps they would all be settled after he had faced the firing party at vincennes a spurt of fear welled up within him at the thought destroying the first momentary feeling almost of pleasure he did not want to be taken to paris to be shot he wanted to resist then he realized that resistance would be both vain and undignified and he forced himself to climb into the coach hoping that no one had noticed his slight hesitation a gesture from the sergeant of gendarmerie brought brown to the door as well and he came climbing in to sit apologetically with his officers caillard was mounting a big black horse a spirited restless creature which champed at its bit and passaged feverishly about when he had settled himself in the saddle the word was given and the horses were led round the courtyard the coach jolting and heaving over the cobbles out through the gate and down to the road which wound under the guns of the fortress the mounted gendarmerie closed up round the coach a whip cracked and they were off at a slow trot to the jingling of the harness and the clattering of the hoofs and the creaking of the leatherwork hornblower would have liked to have looked out of the windows at the houses of rosas village going by after three weeks captivity the change of scene allured him but first he had to attend to his wounded lieutenant how is it going bush he asked bending over him very well thank you sir said bush there was sunlight streaming in through the coach windows now and here a succession of tall trees by the roadside threw flickering shadows over bushs face fever and loss of blood had made bushs face less craggy and gnarled drawing the flesh tight over the bones so that he looked unnaturally younger and he was pale instead of being the mahogany brown to which hornblower was accustomed hornblower thought he saw a twinge of pain cross bushs expression as the coach lurched on the abominable road is there anything i can do he asked trying hard to keep the helplessness out of his voice nothing thank you sir whispered bush try and sleep said hornblower bushs hand which lay outside the blanket twitched and stirred and moved towards him he took it and he felt a gentle pressure for a few brief seconds bushs hand stroked his feebly caressing it as though it was a womans there was a glimmer of a smile on bushs drawn face with its closed eyes during all the years they had served together it was the first sign of affection either had shown for the other bushs head turned on the pillow and he lay quite still while hornblower sat not daring to move for fear of disturbing him the coach had slowed to a walk it must be breasting the long climb which carried the road across the roots of the peninsula of cape creux yet even at that speed the coach lurched and rolled horribly the surface of the road must be utterly uncared for the sharp ringing of the hoofs of the escorts horses told that they were travelling over rock and the irregularity of the sound was a clear indication of the way the horses were picking their way among the holes framed in the windows hornblower could see the gendarmes in their blue uniforms and cocked hats jerking and swaying about with the rolling of the coach the presence of fifty gendarmes as an escort was not a real indication of the political importance of himself and bush but only a proof that even here only twenty miles from france the road was unsafe for small parties a little band of spanish guerilleros was to be found on every inaccessible hilltop but there was always a chance that claros or rovira with their catalan miqueletes a thousand strong might come swooping down on the road from their pyrenean fastnesses hornblower felt hope surging up within him at the thought that at any moment in that case he might find himself a free man again his pulse beat faster and he crossed and uncrossed his knees restlessly with the utmost caution so as not to disturb bush he did not want to be taken to paris to face a mockery of a trial he did not want to die he was beginning to fret himself into a fever when common sense came to his rescue and he compelled himself to sink into a stolid indifference brown was sitting opposite him primly upright with his arms folded hornblower almost grinned sympathetically at sight of him brown was actually selfconscious he had never in his life before presumably had to be at such close quarters with a couple of officers certainly he must be feeling awkward at having to sit in the presence of two such lofty individuals as a captain and a first lieutenant for that matter it was at least a thousand to one that brown had never been inside a coach before had never sat on leather upholstery with a carpet under his feet nor had he had any experience in gentlemens service his duties as captains coxswain being mainly disciplinary and executive there was something comic about seeing brown with the proverbial adaptability of the british seaman aping what he thought should be the manners of the gentlemans gentleman and sitting there as if butter would not melt in his mouth the coach lurched again quickening its pace and the horses broke from a walk into a trot they must be at the top of the long hill now with a long descent before them which would bring them back to the seashore somewhere near llanza where he had stormed the battery under protection of the tricolour flag it was an exploit he had been proud of still was for that matter he had never dreamed for one moment that it would lead him to paris and a firing party through the window on bushs side he could see the rounded brown slopes of the pyrenees soaring upwards on the other side as the coach swung sickeningly round a bend he caught a glimpse of the sea far below sparkling in the rays of the afternoon sun he craned his neck to look at it the sea which had played him so many scurvy tricks and which he loved he thought with a little catch in his throat that this would be the last day on which he would ever see it tonight they would cross the frontier tomorrow they would plunge into france and in ten days a fortnight he would be rotting in his grave at vincennes it would be hard to leave this life even with all its doubts and uncertainties to lose the sea with its whims and its treacheries maria and the child lady barbara those were white cottages drifting past the windows and on the side towards the sea perched on the grassy cliff was the battery of llanza he could see a sentry dressed in blue and white stooping and looking upwards he could see the french flag at the top of the flagstaff bush here had hauled it down not so many weeks ago he heard the coachmans whip crack and the horses quickened their pace it was still eight miles or so to the frontier and caillard must be anxious to cross before dark the mountains bristling here with pines were hemming the road in close between them and the sea why did not claros or rovira come to save him at every turn of the road there was an ideal site for an ambush soon they would be in france and it would be too late he had to struggle again to remain passive the prospect of crossing into france seemed to make his fate far more certain and imminent it was growing dark fast they could not be far now from the frontier hornblower tried to visualize the charts he had often handled so as to remember the name of the french frontier town but his mind was not sufficiently under control to allow it the coach was coming to a standstill he heard footsteps outside heard caillards metallic voice saying in the name of the emperor and an unknown voice say passez passez monsieur the coach lurched and accelerated again they were in france now now the horses hoofs were ringing on cobblestones there were houses one or two lights to be seen outside the houses there were men in all kinds of uniforms and a few women picking their way among them dressed in pretty costumes with caps on their heads he could hear laughter and joking then abruptly the coach swerved to the right and drew up in the courtyard of an inn lights were appearing in plenty in the fading twilight someone opened the door of the coach and drew down the steps for him to descend chapter four hornblower looked round the room to which the innkeeper and the sergeant of gendarmerie had jointly conducted them he was glad to see a fire burning there for he was stiff and chilled with his long inactivity in the coach there was a truckle bed against one wall a table with a white cloth already spread a gendarme appeared at the door stepping slowly and heavily he was the first of the two who were carrying the stretcher he looked round to see where to lay it down turned too abruptly and jarred it against the jamb of the wall careful with that stretcher snapped hornblower and then remembering he had to speak french attention mettez le brancard l doucement brown came and knelt over the stretcher what is the name of this place asked hornblower of the innkeeper cerbre htel ina monsieur answered the innkeeper fingering his leather apron monsieur is allowed no speech with anyone whatever interposed the sergeant he will be served but he must address no speech to the inn servants if he has any wishes he will speak to the sentry outside his door there will be another sentry outside his window a gesture of his hand called attention to the cocked hat and the musket barrel of a gendarme darkly visible through the glass you are too amiable monsieur said hornblower i have my orders supper will be served in half an hour i would be obliged if colonel caillard would give orders for a surgeon to attend lieutenant bushs wounds at once i will ask him sir said the sergeant escorting the innkeeper from the room bush when hornblower bent over him seemed somehow a little better than in the morning there was a little colour in his cheeks and more strength in his movements is there anything i can do bush asked hornblower yes bush explained the needs of sickroom nursing hornblower looked up at brown a little helplessly i am afraid itll call for two of you sir because im a heavy man said bush apologetically it was the apology in his tone which brought hornblower to the point of action of course he said with all the cheerfulness he could bring into his voice come on brown lift him from the other side after the business was finished with no more than a single halfstifled groan from bush brown displayed more of the astonishing versatility of the british seaman ill wash you sir shall i an you havent had your shave today have you sir hornblower sat and watched in helpless admiration the deft movements of the burly sailor as he washed and shaved his first lieutenant the towels were so well arranged that no single drop of water fell on the bedding thank ee brown thank ee said bush sinking back on his pillow the door opened to admit a little bearded man in a semimilitary uniform carrying a leather case good evening gentlemen he said sounding all his consonants in the manner which hornblower was yet to discover was characteristic of the midi i am the surgeon if you please and this is the wounded officer and these are the hospital notes of my confrre at rosas excellent yes exactly and how are you feeling sir hornblower had to translate limpingly the surgeons question to bush and the latters replies bush put out his tongue and submitted to having his pulse felt and his temperature gauged by a hand thrust into his shirt so said the surgeon and now let us see the stump will you hold the candle for me here if you please sir he turned back the blankets from the foot of the stretcher revealing the little basket which guarded the stump laid the basket on the floor and began to remove the dressings would you tell him sir asked bush that my foot which isnt there tickles most abominably and i dont know how to scratch it the translation taxed hornblowers french to the utmost but the surgeon listened sympathetically that is not at all unusual he said and the itchings will come to a natural end in course of time ah now here is the stump a beautiful stump a lovely stump hornblower compelling himself to look was vaguely reminded of the knuckle end of a roast leg of mutton the irregular folds of flesh were caught in by halfhealed scars but out of the scars hung two ends of black thread when monsieur le lieutenant begins to walk again explained the surgeon he will be glad of an ample pad of flesh at the end of the stump the end of the bone will not chafe yes exactly said hornblower fighting down his squeamishness a very beautiful piece of work said the surgeon as long as it heals properly and gangrene does not set in at this stage the surgeon has to depend on his nose for his diagnosis suiting the action to the word the surgeon sniffed at the dressings and at the raw stump smell monsieur he said holding the dressings to hornblowers face hornblower was conscious of the faintest whiff of corruption beautiful is it not said the surgeon a fine healthy wound and yet every evidence that the ligatures will soon free themselves hornblower realized that the two threads hanging out of the scars were attached to the ends of the two main arteries when corruption inside was complete the threads could be drawn out and the wounds allowed to heal it was a race between the rotting of the arteries and the onset of gangrene i will see if the ligatures are free now warn your friend that i shall hurt him a little hornblower looked towards bush to convey the message and was shocked to see that bushs face was distorted with apprehension i know said bush i know what hes going to do sir only as an afterthought did he say that sir which was the clearest proof of his mental preoccupation he grasped the bedclothes in his two fists his jaw set and his eyes shut im ready he said through his clenched teeth the surgeon drew firmly on one of the threads and bush writhed a little he drew on the other aah gasped bush with sweat on his face nearly free commented the surgeon i could tell by the feeling of the threads your friend will soon be well now let us replace the dressings so and so his dexterous plump fingers rebandaged the stump replaced the wicker basket and drew down the bed coverings thank you gentlemen said the surgeon rising to his feet and brushing his hands one against the other i will return in the morning hadnt you better sit down sir came browns voice to hornblowers ears as though from a million miles away after the surgeon had withdrawn the room was veiled in grey mist which gradually cleared away as he sat to reveal bush lying back on his pillow and trying to smile and browns homely honest face wearing an expression of acute concern rare bad you looked for a minute sir you must be hungry i expect sir not having eaten nothing since breakfast like it was tactful of brown to attribute this faintness to hunger to which all flesh might be subject without shame and not merely to weakness in face of wounds and suffering that sounds like supper coming now croaked bush from the stretcher as though one of a conspiracy to ignore their captains feebleness the sergeant of gendarmerie came clanking in two women behind him bearing trays the women set the table deftly and quickly their eyes downcast and withdrew without looking up although one of them smiled at the corner of her mouth in response to a meaning cough from brown which drew a gesture of irritation from the sergeant the latter cast one searching glance round the room before shutting and locking the door with a clashing of keys soup said hornblower peering into the tureen which steamed deliciously and i fancy this is stewed veal the discovery confirmed him in his notion that frenchmen lived exclusively on soup and stewed veal he put no faith in the more vulgar notions regarding frogs and snails you will have some of this broth i suppose bush he continued he was talking desperately hard now to conceal the feeling of depression and unhappiness which was overwhelming him and a glass of this wine it has no label lets hope for the best some of their rotgut claret i suppose grunted bush eighteen years of war with france had given most englishmen the notion that the only wines fit for men to drink were port and sherry and madeira and that frenchmen only drank thin claret which gave the unaccustomed drinker the bellyache well see said hornblower as cheerfully as he could lets get you propped up first with his hand behind bushs shoulders he heaved him up a little as he looked round helplessly brown came to his rescue with pillows taken from the bed and between them they settled bush with his head raised and his arms free and a napkin under his chin hornblower brought him a plate of soup and a piece of bread mm said bush tasting might be worse please sir dont let yours get cold brown brought a chair for his captain to sit at the table and stood in an attitude of attention beside it there was another place laid but his action proclaimed as loudly as words how far it was from his mind to sit with his captain hornblower ate at first with a distaste and then with increasing appetite some more of that soup brown said bush and my glass of wine if you please the stewed veal was extraordinarily good even to a man who was accustomed to meat he could set his teeth in dash my wig said bush from the bed do you think i could have some of that stewed veal sir this travelling has given me an appetite hornblower had to think about that a man in a fever should be kept on a low diet but bush could not be said to be in a fever now and he had lost a great deal of blood which he had to make up the yearning look on bushs face decided him a little will do you no harm he said take this plate to mr bush brown good food and good wine the fare in the sutherland had been repulsive and at rosas scanty tended to loosen their tongues and make them more cheerful yet it was hard to unbend beyond a certain unstated limit the awful majesty surrounding a captain of a ship of the line lingered even after the ship had been destroyed more than that the memory of the very strict reserve which hornblower had maintained during his command acted as a constraint and to brown a first lieutenant was in a position nearly as astronomically lofty as a captain it was awesome to be in the same room as the two of them even with the help of makingbelieve to be their old servant hornblower had finished his cheese by now and the moment which brown had been dreading had arrived here brown he said rising sit down and eat your supper while its still hot brown now at the age of twentyeight had served his majesty in his majestys ships from the age of eleven and during that time he had never made use at table of other instruments than his sheath knife and his fingers he had never eaten off china nor had he drunk from a wineglass he experienced a nightmare sensation as if his officers were watching him with four eyes as large as footballs the while he nervously picked up a spoon and addressed himself to this unaccustomed task hornblower realized his embarrassment in a clairvoyant flash brown had thews and sinews which hornblower had often envied he had a stolid courage in action which hornblower could never hope to rival he could knot and splice hand reef and steer cast the lead or pull an oar all of them far better than his captain he could go aloft on a black night in a howling storm without thinking twice about it but the sight of a knife and fork made his hands tremble hornblower thought about how gibbon would have pointed the moral epigrammatically in two vivid antithetical sentences humiliation and nervousness never did any good to a man hornblower knew that if anyone ever did he took a chair unobtrusively over beside bushs stretcher and sat down with his back almost turned to the table and plunged desperately into conversation with his first lieutenant while the crockery clattered behind him would you like to be moved into the bed he asked saying the first thing which came into his head no thank you sir said bush two weeks now ive slept in the stretcher im comfortable enough sir and itd be painful to move me even if if words failed bush to describe his utter determination not to sleep in the only bed and leave his captain without one what are we going to paris for sir asked bush god knows said hornblower but i have a notion that boney himself wants to ask us questions that was the answer he had decided upon hours before in readiness for this inevitable question it would not help bushs convalescence to know the fate awaiting him much good will our answers do him said bush grimly perhaps well drink a dish of tea in the tuileries with maria louisa maybe answered hornblower and maybe he wants lessons in navigation from you ive heard hes weak at mathematics that brought a smile bush notoriously was no good with figures and suffered agonies when confronted with a simple problem in spherical trigonometry hornblowers acute ears heard browns chair scrape a little presumably his meal had progressed satisfactorily help yourself to the wine brown he said without turning round aye aye sir said brown cheerfully there was a whole bottle of wine left as well as some in the other this would be a good moment for ascertaining if brown could be trusted with liquor hornblower kept his back turned to him and struggled on with his conversation with bush five minutes later browns chair scraped again more definitely and hornblower looked round had enough brown aye aye sir a right good supper the soup tureen and the dish of stew were both empty the bread had disappeared all save the heel of the loaf there was only a morsel of cheese left but one bottle of wine was still twothirds full brown had contented himself with a half bottle at most and the fact that he had drunk that much and no more was the dearest proof that he was safe as regards alcohol pull the bellrope then the distant jangling brought in time the rattling of keys to the door and in came the sergeant and the two maids the latter set about clearing the tables under the formers eye i must get something for you to sleep on brown said hornblower i can sleep on the floor sir no you cant hornblower had decided opinions about that there had been occasions as a young officer when he had slept on the bare planks of a ships deck and he knew their unbending discomfort i want a bed for my servant he said to the sergeant he can sleep on the floor i will not allow anything of the kind you must find a mattress for him hornblower was surprised to find how quickly he was acquiring the ability to talk french the quickness of his mind enabled him to make the best use of his limited vocabulary and his retentive memory had stored up all sorts of words once heard and was ready to produce them from the subconscious part of his mind as soon as the stimulus of necessity was applied the sergeant had shrugged his shoulders and rudely turned his back i shall report your insolence to colonel caillard tomorrow morning said hornblower hotly find a mattress immediately it was not so much the threat that carried the day as longingrained habits of discipline even a sergeant of french gendarmerie was accustomed to yielding deference to gold lace and epaulettes and an authoritative manner possibly the obvious indignation of the maids at the suggestion that so fine a man should be left to sleep on the floor may have weighed with him too he called to the sentry at the door and told him to bring a mattress from the stables where the escort were billeted it was only a palliasse of straw when it came but it was something infinitely more comfortable than bare and draughty boards all the same brown looked his gratitude to hornblower as the mattress was spread out in the corner of the room time to turn in said hornblower ignoring it as the door was locked behind the sergeant lets make you comfortable first bush it was some obscure selfconscious motive which made hornblower select from his valise the embroidered nightshirt over which marias busy fingers had laboured lovingly the nightshirt which he had brought with him from england for use should it happen that he should dine and sleep at a governors or on board the flagship all the years he had been a captain he had never shared a room with anyone save maria and it was a novel experience for him to prepare for bed in sight of bush and brown and he was ridiculously selfconscious about it regardless of the fact that bush white and exhausted was already lying back on his pillow with drooping eyelids while brown modestly stripped off his trousers with downcast eyes wrapped himself in the cloak which hornblower insisted on his using and curled himself up on his palliasse without a glance at his superior hornblower got into bed ready he asked and blew out the candle the fire had died down to embers which gave only the faintest red glow in the room it was the beginning of one of those wakeful nights which hornblower had grown by now able to recognize in advance the moment he blew out the candle and settled his head on the pillow he knew he would not be able to sleep until just before dawn in his ship he would have gone up on deck or walked his stern gallery here he could only lie grimly immobile sometimes a subdued crackling told how brown was turning over on his straw mattress once or twice bush moaned a little in his feverish sleep today was wednesday only sixteen days ago and hornblower had been captain of a seventyfour and absolute master of the happiness of five hundred seamen his least word directed the operations of a gigantic engine of war the blows it had dealt had caused an imperial throne to totter he thought regretfully of nighttime aboard his ship the creaking of the timbers and the singing of the rigging the impassive quartermaster at the wheel in the faint light of the binnacle and the officer of the watch pacing the quarterdeck now he was a nobody where once he had minutely regulated five hundred mens lives he was reduced to chaffering for a single mattress for the only seaman left to him police sergeants could insult him with impunity he had to come and to go at the bidding of someone he despised worse than that hornblower felt the hot blood running under his skin as the full realization broke upon him again he was being taken to paris as a criminal very soon indeed in some cold dawn he would be led out into the ditch at vincennes to face a firing party then he would be dead hornblowers vivid imagination pictured the impact of the musket bullets upon his breast and he wondered how long the pain would last before oblivion came upon him it was not the oblivion that he feared he told himself indeed in his present misery he almost looked forward to it perhaps it was the finality of death the irrevocableness of it no that was only a minor factor mostly it was instinctive fear of a sudden and drastic change to something completely unknown he remembered the night he had spent as a child in the inn at andover when he was going to join his ship next day and enter upon the unknown life of the navy that was the nearest comparison he had been frightened then he remembered so frightened he had been unable to sleep and yet frightened was too strong a word to describe the state of mind of someone who was quite prepared to face the future and could not be readily blamed for this sudden acceleration of heartbeat and prickling of sweat a moaning sigh from bush loud in the stillness of the room distracted him from his analysis of his fear they were going to shoot bush too presumably they would lash him to a stake to have a fair shot at him curious how while it was easy to order a party to shoot an upright figure however helpless every instinct revolted against shooting a helpless man prostrate on a stretcher it would be a monstrous crime to shoot bush who even supposing his captain were guilty could have done nothing except obey orders but bonaparte would do it the necessity of rallying europe round him in his struggle against england was growing ever more pressing the blockade was strangling the empire of the french as antaeus had been strangled by hercules bonapartes unwilling allies all europe that was to say save portugal and sicily were growing restive and thinking about defection the french people themselves hornblower shrewdly guessed were by now none too enamoured of this king stork whom they had imposed on themselves it would not be sufficient for bonaparte merely to say that the british fleet was the criminal instrument of a perfidious tyranny he had said that for a dozen years the mere announcement that british naval officers had violated the laws of war would carry small enough weight too but to try a couple of officers and shoot them would be a convincing gesture and the perverted statement of facts issued from paris might help to sustain french public opinion european public opinion as well for another year or two in its opposition to england but it was bad luck that the victims should be bush and he bonaparte had had a dozen british naval captains in his hands during the last few years and he could have trumped up charges against half of them presumably it was destiny which had selected hornblower and bush to suffer hornblower told himself that for twenty years he had been aware of a premonition of sudden death it was certain and inevitable now he hoped he would meet it bravely go down with colours flying but he mistrusted his own weak body he feared that his cheeks would be pale and his teeth would chatter or worse still that his heart would weaken so that he would faint before the firing party had done their work that would be a fine opportunity for a mordant couple of lines in the momteur universel fine reading for lady barbara and maria if he had been alone in the room he would have groaned aloud in his misery and turned over restlessly but as it was he lay grimly rigid and silent if his subordinates were awake they would never be allowed to guess that he was awake too to divert his mind from his approaching execution he cast round in search of something else to think about and new subjects presented themselves in swarms whether admiral leighton were alive or dead and whether if the latter were the case lady barbara leighton would think more often or less often about hornblower her lover how marias pregnancy was progressing what was the state of british public opinion regarding the loss of the sutherland and more especially what lady barbara thought about his surrendering there were endless things to think and worry about there was endless flotsam bobbing about in the racing torrent of his mind and the horses stampeded in the stable and every two hours he heard the sentries being changed outside window and door chapter five dawn was not fully come the room was only faintly illuminated by the grey light when a clash of keys and a stamping of booted feet outside the door heralded the entrance of the sergeant of gendarmerie the coach will leave in an hours time he announced the surgeon will be here in half an hour you gentlemen will please be ready bush was obviously feverish hornblower could see that at his first glance as he bent over him still in his embroidered silk nightshirt but bush stoutly affirmed that he was not ill im well enough thank you sir he said but his face was flushed and yet apprehensive and his hands gripped his bedclothes hornblower suspected that the mere vibration of the floor as he and brown walked about the room was causing pain to the unhealed stump of his leg im ready to do anything you want done said hornblower no thank you sir lets wait till the doctor comes if you dont mind sir hornblower washed and shaved in the cold water in the washhand stand jug during the time which had elapsed since he had left the sutherland he had never been allowed hot but he yearned for the cold shower bath he had been accustomed to take under the jet of the washdeck pump his skin seemed to creep when he stopped to consider it and it was a ghoulish business to make shift with washing glove and soap wetting a few inches at a time brown dressed himself unobtrusively in his own corner of the room scurrying out like a mouse to wash when his captain had finished the doctor arrived with his leather satchel and how is he this morning he asked briskly hornblower saw a shade of concern pass over his face as he observed bushs evident fever he knelt down and exposed the stump hornblower beside him the limb jerked nervously as it was grasped with firm fingers the doctor took hornblowers hand and laid it on the skin above the wound a little warm said the doctor it was hot to hornblowers touch that may be a good sign we shall know now he took hold of one of the ligatures and pulled at it the thing came gliding out of the wound like a snake good said the doctor excellent he peered closely at the debris entangled in the knot and then bent to examine the trickle of pus which had followed the ligature out of the wound excellent repeated the doctor hornblower went back in his mind through the numerous reports which surgeons had made to him regarding wounded men and the verbal comments with which they had amplified them the words laudable pus came up in his mind it was important to distinguish between the drainage from a wound struggling to heal itself and the stinking ooze of a poisoned limb this was clearly laudable pus judging by the doctors comments now for the other one said the doctor he pulled at the remaining ligature but all he got was a cry of pain from bush which seemed to go clean through hornblowers heart and a convulsive writhing of bushs tortured body not quite ready said the doctor i should judge that it will only be a matter of hours though is your friend proposing to continue his journey today he is under orders to continue it said hornblower in his limping french you would consider such a course unwise most unwise said the doctor it will cause him a great deal of pain and may imperil the healing of the wound he felt bushs pulse and rested his hand on his forehead most unwise he repeated the door opened behind him to reveal the gendarmerie sergeant the carriage is ready it must wait until i have bandaged this wound get outside said the doctor testily i will go and speak to the colonel said hornblower he brushed past the sergeant who tried too late to intercept him into the main corridor of the inn and out into the courtyard where stood the coach the horses were being harnessed up and a group of gendarmes were saddling their mounts on the farther side chance dictated that colonel caillard should be crossing the courtyard too in his blue and red uniform and his gleaming high boots the star of the legion of honour dancing on his breast sir said hornblower what is it now demanded caillard lieutenant bush must not be moved he is very badly wounded and a crisis approaches the broken french came tumbling disjointedly from hornblowers lips i can do nothing in contravention of my orders said caillard his eyes were cold and his mouth hard you were not ordered to kill him protested hornblower i was ordered to bring you and him to paris with the utmost dispatch we shall start in five minutes but sir cannot you wait even today even as a pirate you must be aware of the impossibility of disobeying orders said caillard i protest against those orders in the name of humanity that was a melodramatic speech but it was a melodramatic moment and in his ignorance of french hornblower could not pick and choose his words a sympathetic murmur in his ear attracted his notice and looking round he saw the two aproned maids and a fat woman and the innkeeper all listening to the conversation with obvious disapproval of caillards point of view they shut themselves away behind the kitchen door as caillard turned a terrible eye upon them but they had granted hornblower a first momentary insight into the personal unpopularity which imperial harshness was causing to develop in france sergeant said caillard abruptly put the prisoners into the coach there was no hope of resistance the gendarmes carried bushs stretcher into the courtyard and perched it up on the seats with brown and hornblower running round it to protect it from unnecessary jerks the surgeon was scribbling notes hurriedly at the foot of the sheaf of notes regarding bushs case which hornblower had brought from rosas one of the maids came clattering across the courtyard with a steaming tray which she passed in to hornblower through the open window there was a platter of bread and three bowls of a black liquid which hornblower was later to come to recognize as coffee what blockaded france had come to call coffee it was no pleasanter than the infusion of burnt crusts which hornblower had sometimes drunk on shipboard during a long cruise without the opportunity of renewing cabin stores but it was warm and stimulating at that time in the morning we have no sugar sir said the maid apologetically it doesnt matter answered hornblower sipping thirstily it is a pity the poor wounded officer has to travel she went on these wars are terrible she had a snub nose and a wide mouth and big black eyes no one could call her attractive but the sympathy in her voice was grateful to a man who was a prisoner brown was propping up bushs shoulders and holding a bowl to his lips he took two or three sips and turned his head away the coach rocked as two men scrambled up on to the box stand away there roared the sergeant the coach lurched and rolled and wheeled round out of the gates the horses hoofs clattering loud on the cobbles and the last hornblower saw of the maid was the slight look of consternation on her face as she realized that she had lost the breakfast tray for good the road was bad judging by the way the coach lurched hornblower heard a sharp intake of breath from bush at one jerk he remembered what the swollen and inflamed stump of bushs leg looked like every jar must be causing him agony he moved up the seat to the stretcher and caught bushs hand dont you worry yourself sir said bush im all right even while he spoke hornblower felt him grip tighter as another jolt caught him unexpectedly im sorry bush was all he could say it was hard for the captain to speak at length to the lieutenant on such personal matters as his regret and unhappiness we cant help it sir said bush forcing his peaked features into a smile that was the main trouble their complete helplessness hornblower realized that there was nothing he could say nothing he could do the leatherscented stuffiness of the coach was already oppressing him and he realized with horror that they would have to endure this jolting prison of theirs for another twenty days perhaps before they should reach paris he was restless and fidgety at the thought of it and perhaps his restlessness communicated itself by contact to bush who gently withdrew his hand and turned his head to one side leaving his captain free to fidget within the narrow confines of the coach still there were glimpses of the sea to be caught on one side and of the pyrenees on the other putting his head out of the window hornblower ascertained that their escort was diminished today only two troopers rode ahead of the coach and four clattered behind at the heels of caillards horse presumably their entry into france made any possibility of a rescue far less likely standing thus his head awkwardly protruding through the window was less irksome than sitting in the stuffiness of the carriage there were the vineyards and the stubble field to be seen and the swelling heights of the pyrenees receding into the blue distance there were people too nearly all women hornblower noted who hardly looked up from their hoeing to watch the coach and its escort bowling along the road now they were passing a party of uniformed soldiers recruits and convalescents hornblower guessed on their way to their units in catalonia shambling along the road more like sheep than soldiers the young officer at their head saluted the glitter of the star on caillards chest and eyed the coach curiously at the same time strange prisoners had passed along that road before him alvarez the heroic defender of gerona who died on a wheelbarrow the only bed granted him in a dungeon on his way to trial and toussaint ouverture the negro hero of hayti kidnapped from his sunny island and sent to die inevitably of pneumonia in a rocky fortress in the jura palafox of zaragoza young mina from navarre all victims of the tyrants corsican rancour he and bush would only be two more items in a list already notable denghien who had been shot in vincennes six years ago was of the bloodroyal and his death had caused a european sensation but bonaparte had murdered plenty more thinking of all those who had preceded him made hornblower gaze more yearningly from the carriage window and breathe more deeply of the free air still in sight of sea and hills mount caingou still dominating the background they halted at a posting inn beside the road to change horses caillard and the escort took new mounts four new horses were harnessed up to the coach and in less than a quarter of an hour they were off again breasting the steep slopes before them with renewed strength they must be averaging six miles to the hour at least thought hornblower his mind beginning to make calculations how far paris might be he could only guess five or six hundred miles he fancied from seventy to ninety hours of travel would bring them to the capital and they might travel eight twelve fifteen hours a day it might be five days it might be twelve days before they reached paris vague enough figures he might be dead in a weeks time or he might still be alive in three weeks still alive as hornblower thought those words he realized how greatly he desired to live it was one of those moments when the hornblower whom he observed so dispassionately and with faint contempt suddenly blended with the hornblower who was himself the most important and vital person in the whole world he envied the bent old shepherd in the distance with the plaid rug over his shoulders hobbling over the hillside bent over his stick here was a town coming there were ramparts a frowning citadel a lofty cathedral they passed through a gateway and the horses hoofs rang loudly on cobblestones as the coach threaded its way through narrow streets plenty of soldiers here too the streets were filled with variegated uniforms this must be perpignan of course the french base for the invasion of catalonia the coach stopped with a jerk in a wider street where an avenue of plane trees and a flagged quay bordered a little river and looking upward hornblower read the sign htel de la poste et du perdrix route nationale paris with a rush and bustle the horses were changed brown and hornblower were grudgingly allowed to descend and stretch their stiff legs before returning to attend to bushs wants they were few enough in his present fever caillard and the gendarmes were snatching a hasty meal the latter at tables outside the inn the former visible through the windows of the front room someone brought the prisoners a tray with slices of cold meat bread wine and cheese it had hardly been handed into the coach when the escort climbed upon their horses again the whip cracked and they were off the coach heaved and dipped like a ship at sea as it mounted first one humpbacked bridge and then another before the horses settled into a steady trot along the wide straight road bordered with poplars they waste no time said hornblower grimly no sir that they dont agreed brown bush would eat nothing shaking his head feebly at the offer of bread and meat all they could do for him was to moisten his lips with wine for he was parched and thirsty hornblower made a mental note to remember to ask for water at the next posting house and cursed himself for forgetting anything so obvious up to now he and brown shared the food eating with their fingers and drinking turn and turn about from the bottle of wine brown apologetically wiping the bottles mouth with the napkin after drinking and as soon as the food was finished hornblower was on his feet again craning through the carriage window watching the countryside drifting by a thin chill rain began soaking his scanty hair as he stood there wetting his face and even running in trickles down his neck but still he stood there staring out at freedom the sign of the inn where they stopped at nightfall read htel de la poste de sigean route nationale paris perpignan this place sigean was no more than a sparse village straggling for miles along the high road and the inn was a tiny affair smaller than the posting stables round the other three sides of the courtyard the staircase to the upper rooms was too narrow and winding for the stretcher to be carried up them it was only with difficulty that the bearers were able to turn with it into the salon which the innkeeper reluctantly yielded to them hornblower saw bush wincing as the stretcher jarred against the sides of the door we must have a surgeon at once for the lieutenant he said to the sergeant i will inquire for one the innkeeper here was a surly brute with a squint he was ungracious about clearing his best sittingroom of its spindly furniture and bringing beds for hornblower and brown and producing the various articles they asked for to help make bush comfortable there were no wax candles nor lamps only tallow dips which stank atrociously hows the leg feeling asked hornblower bending over bush all right sir said bush stubbornly but he was so obviously feverish and in such obvious pain that hornblower was anxious about him when the sergeant escorted in the maid with the dinner he asked sharply why has the surgeon not come there is no surgeon in this village no surgeon the lieutenant is seriously ill is there no no apothecary hornblower used the english word in default of french the cowdoctor went across the hills this afternoon and will not be back tonight there is no one to be found the sergeant went out of the room leaving hornblower to explain the situation to bush all right said the latter turning his head on the pillow with the feeble gesture which hornblower dreaded hornblower nerved himself id better dress that wound of yours myself he said we might try cold vinegar on it as they do in our service something cold said bush eagerly hornblower pealed at the bell and when it was eventually answered he asked for vinegar and obtained it not one of the three had a thought for their dinner cooling on the side table now said hornblower he had a saucer of vinegar beside him in which lay the soaking lint and the clean bandages which the surgeon at rosas had supplied were at hand he turned back the bedclothes and revealed the bandaged stump the leg twitched nervously as he removed the bandages it was red and swollen and inflamed hot to the touch for several inches above the point of amputation its pretty swollen here too sir whispered bush the glands in his groin were huge yes said hornblower he peered at the scarred end examined the dressings he had removed with brown holding the light there had been a slight oozing from the point where the ligature had been withdrawn yesterday much of the rest of the scar was healed and obviously healthy there was only the other ligature which could be causing this trouble hornblower knew that if it were ready to come out it was dangerous to leave it in cautiously he took hold of the silken thread the first gentle touch of it conveyed to his sensitive fingers a suggestion that it was free it moved distinctly for a quarter of an inch and judging by bushs quiescence it caused him no sudden spasm of pain hornblower set his teeth and pulled the thread yielded very slowly but it was obviously free and no longer attached to the elastic artery he pulled steadily against a yielding resistance the ligature came slowly out of the wound knot and all pus followed it in a steady trickle only slightly tinged with blood the thing was done the artery had not burst and clearly the wound was in need of the free drainage open to it now with the withdrawal of the ligature i think youre going to start getting well now he said aloud making himself speak cheerfully how does it feel better said bush i think its better sir hornblower applied the soaking lint to the scarred surface he found his hands trembling but he steadied them with an effort as he bandaged the stump not an easy job this last but one which he managed to complete in adequate fashion he put back the wicker shield tucked in the bedclothes and rose to his feet the trembling was worse than ever now and he was shaken and sick which surprised him supper sir asked brown ill give mr bush his hornblowers stomach resisted a protest at the suggestion of food he would have liked to refuse but that would have been too obvious a confession of weakness in front of a subordinate when ive washed my hands he said loftily it was easier to eat than he had expected when he sat down to force himself he managed to choke down enough mouthfuls to make it appear as if he had eaten well and with the passage of the minutes the memory of the revolting task on which he had been engaged became rapidly less clear bush displayed none of the appetite nor any of the cheerfulness which had been noticeable last night that was the obvious result of his fever but with free drainage to his wound it could be hoped that he would soon recover hornblower was tired now as a result of his sleepless night the night before and his emotions had been jarred into a muddle by what he had had to do it was easier to sleep tonight waking only at intervals to listen to bushs breathing and to sleep again reassured by the steadiness and tranquillity of the sound chapter six after that day the details of the journey became more blurred and indistinct up to that day they had had all the unnatural sharpness of a landscape just before rain looking back at the journey what was easiest to remember was bushs convalescence his steady progress back to health from the moment that the ligature was withdrawn from his wound his strength began to come back fast so that it would have been astonishing to anyone who did not know of his iron constitution and of the spartan life he had always led the transition was rapid between the time when his head had to be supported to allow him to drink and the time when he could sit himself up by his own unaided strength hornblower could remember those details when he tried to but all the rest was muddled and vague there were memories of long hours spent at the carriage window when it always seemed to be raining and the rain wetted his face and hair those were hours spent in a sort of melancholy hornblower came to look back on them afterwards in the same way as someone recovered from insanity must look back on the blank days in the asylum all the inns at which they stayed and the doctors who had attended to bush were confused in his mind he could remember the relentless regularity with which the kilometre figures displayed at the posting stations indicated the dwindling distance between them and paris paris paris paris somewhere at that point they changed from route nationale no to route nationale no each day was bringing them nearer to paris and death and each day he sank farther into apathetic melancholy issoire clermontferrand moulins he read the names of the towns through which they passed without remembering them autumn was gone now left far behind down by the pyrenees here winter had begun cold winds blew in melancholy fashion through the long avenues of leafless trees and the fields were brown and desolate at night he was sleeping heavily tormented by dreams which he could not remember in the morning his days he spent standing at the carriage window staring with sightless eyes over a dreary landscape where the chill rain fell it seemed as if he had spent years consecutively in the leathery atmosphere of the coach with the clatter of the horses hoofs in his ears and visible in the tail of his eye the burly figure of caillard riding at the head of the escort close to the offside hind wheel during the bleakest afternoon they had yet experienced it did not seem as if hornblower would be roused from his stupor even by the sudden unexpected stop which to a bored traveller might provide a welcome break in the monotony of travel dully he watched caillard ride up to ask the reason dully he gathered from the conversation that one of the coach horses had lost a shoe and gone dead lame he watched with indifference the unharnessing of the unfortunate brute and heard without interest the unhelpful answers of a passing travelling salesman with a packmule of whom caillard demanded the whereabouts of the nearest smith two gendarmes went off at a snails pace down a side track leading the crippled animal with only three horses the coach started off again towards paris progress was slow and the stage was a long one only rarely before had they travelled after dark but here it seemed that night would overtake them long before they could reach the next town bush and brown were talking quite excitedly about this remarkable mishap hornblower heard their cackle without noticing it as a man long resident beside a waterfall no longer hears the noise of the fall the darkness which was engulfing them was premature low black clouds covered the whole sky and the note of the wind in the trees carried with it something of menace even hornblower noted that nor was it long before he noticed something else that the rain beating upon his face was changing to sleet and then from sleet to snow he felt the big flakes upon his lips and tasted them with his tongue the gendarme who lit the lamps beside the drivers box revealed to them through the windows the front of his cloak caked thick with snow shining faintly in the feeble light of the lamp soon the sound of the horses feet was muffled and dull the wheels could hardly be heard and the pace of the coach diminished still further as it ploughed through the snow piling in the road hornblower could hear the coachman using his whip mercilessly upon his weary animals they were heading straight into the piercing wind and were inclined to take every opportunity to flinch away from it hornblower turned back from the window to his subordinates inside the coach the faint light which the glass front panel allowed to enter from the lamps was no more than enough to enable him just to make out their shadowy forms bush was lying huddled under all his blankets brown was clutching his cloak round him and hornblower for the first time noticed the bitter cold he shut the coach window without a word resigning himself to the leathery stuffiness of the interior his dazed melancholy was leaving him without his being aware of it god help sailors he said cheerfully on a night like this that drew a laugh from the others in the darkness hornblower just caught the note of pleased surprise in it which told him that they had noticed and regretted the black mood which had gripped him during the last few days and were pleased with this first sign of his recovery resentfully he asked himself what they expected of him they did not know as he did that death awaited him and bush in paris what was the use of thinking and worrying guarded as they were by caillard and six gendarmes with bush a hopeless cripple what chance was there of escape they did not know that hornblower had put aside all thought of escaping by himself if by a miracle he had succeeded what would they think of him in england when he arrived there with the news that he had left his lieutenant to die they might sympathize with him pity him understand his motive he hated the thought of any of that better to face a firing party at bushs side never to see lady barbara again never to see his child and better to spend his last few days in apathy than in fretting yet the present circumstances so different from the monotony of the rest of the journey had stimulated him he laughed and chatted with the others as he had not done since they had left beziers the coach crawled on through the darkness with the wind shrieking overhead already the windows on one side were opaque with the snow which was plastered upon them there was not warmth enough within the coach to melt it more than once the coach halted and hornblower putting his head out saw that they were having to clear the horses hoofs of the snow balled into ice under their shoes if were more than two miles from the next post house he announced sitting back again we wont reach it until next week now they must have topped a small rise for the horses were moving quicker almost trotting with the coach swaying and lurching over the inequalities of the road suddenly from outside they heard an explosion of shouts and yells he h h the coach swung round without warning lurching frightfully and came to a halt leaning perilously over to one side hornblower sprang to the window and looked out the coach was poised perilously on the bank of a river hornblower could see the black water sliding along almost under his nose two yards away a small rowing boat moored to a post swayed about under the influence of wind and stream otherwise there was nothing to be seen in the blackness some of the gendarmes had run to the coach horses heads the animals were plunging and rearing in their fright at the sudden apparition of the river before them somehow in the darkness the coach must have got off the road and gone down some side track leading to the river here the coachman had reined his horses round only a fraction of a second before disaster threatened caillard was sitting his horse blaring sarcasms at the others a fine coachman you are god knows why didnt you drive straight into the river and save me the trouble of reporting you to the souschef of the administration come along you men do you want to stay here all night get the coach back on the road you fools the snow came driving down in the darkness the hot lamps sizzling continuously as the flakes lighted on them the coachman got his horses under control again the gendarmes stood back and the whip cracked the horses plunged and slipped pawing for a footing and the coach trembled without stirring from the spot come along now shouted caillard sergeant and you pellaton take the horses you other men get to the wheels now altogether heave heave the coach lurched a scant yard before halting again caillard cursed wildly if the gentlemen in the coach would descend and help suggested one of the gendarmes it would be better they can unless they would rather spend the night in the snow said caillard he did not condescend to address hornblower directly for a moment hornblower thought of telling him that he would see him damned first there would be some satisfaction in that but on the other hand he did not want to condemn bush to a night of discomfort merely for an intangible selfgratification come on brown he said swallowing his resentment and he opened the door and they jumped down into the snow even with the coach thus lightened and with five men straining at the spokes of the wheels they could make no progress the snow had piled up against the steep descent to the river and the exhausted horses plunged uselessly in the deep mass god what a set of useless cripples raved caillard coachman how far is it to nevers six kilometres sir you mean you think its six kilometres ten minutes ago you thought you were on the right road and you were not sergeant ride into nevers for help find the mayor and bring every ablebodied man in the name of the emperor you ramel ride with the sergeant as far as the high road and wait there until he returns otherwise theyll never find us go on sergeant what are you waiting for and you others tether your horses and put your cloaks on their backs you can keep warm digging the snow away from that bank coachman come off that box and help them the night was incredibly dark two yards from the carriage lamps nothing was visible at all and with the wind whistling by they could not hear as they stood by the coach the movements of the men in the snow hornblower stamped about beside the coach and flogged himself with his arms to get his circulation back yet this snow and this icy wind were strangely refreshing he felt no desire at the moment for the cramped stuffiness of the coach and as he swung his arms an idea came to him which checked him suddenly in his movements until ridiculously afraid of his thoughts being guessed he went on stamping and swinging more industriously than ever the blood was running hot under his skin now as it always did when he was making plans when he had outmanoeuvred the natividad for instance and when he had saved the pluto in the storm off cape creux there had been no hope of escape without the means of transporting a helpless cripple now not twenty feet from him there was the ideal means the boat which rocked to its moorings at the river bank on a night like this it was easy to lose ones way altogether except in a boat on a river in a boat one had only to keep shoving off from shore to allow the current to carry one away faster than any horse could travel in these conditions even so the scheme was utterly harebrained for how many days would they be able to preserve their liberty in the heart of france two ablebodied men and one on a stretcher they would freeze starve possibly even drown but it was a chance and nothing nearly as good would present itself between now and the time when the firing party at vincennes would await them hornblower observed with mild interest that his fever was abating as he formed his resolve and he was sufficiently amused at finding his jaw set in an expression of fierce resolution to allow his features to relax into a grim smile there was always something laughable to him in being involved in heroics brown came stamping round the coach and hornblower addressed him contriving with great effort to keep his voice low and yet matteroffact were going to escape down the river in that boat brown he said aye aye sir said brown with no more excitement in his voice than if hornblower had been speaking of the cold hornblower saw his head in the darkness turn towards the nearly visible figure of caillard pacing restlessly in the snow beside the coach that man must be silenced said hornblower aye aye sir brown meditated for a second before continuing better let me do that sir very good now sir yes brown took two steps towards the unsuspecting figure here he said here you caillard turned and faced him and as he turned he received browns fist full on his jaw in a punch which had all browns mighty fourteen stone behind it he dropped in the snow with brown leaping upon him like a tiger hornblower behind him tie him up in his cloak whispered hornblower hold on to his throat while i get it unbuttoned wait heres his scarf tie his head up in that first the sash of the legion of honour was wound round and round the wretched mans head brown rolled the writhing figure over and with his knee in the small of his back tied his arms behind him with his neckcloth hornblowers handkerchief sufficed for his ankles brown strained the knot tight they doubled the man in two and bundled him into his cloak tying it about him with his swordbelt bush lying on his stretcher in the darkness of the coach heard the door open and a heavy load drop upon the floor mr bush said hornblower the formal mr came naturally again now the action had begun again we are going to escape in the boat good luck sir said bush youre coming too brown take that end of the stretcher lift starboard a bit steady bush felt himself lifted out of the coach stretcher and all and carried down through the snow get the boat close in snapped hornblower cut the moorings now bush lets get these blankets round you heres my cloak take it as well youll obey orders mr bush take the other side brown lift him into the sternsheets lower away bow thwart brown take the oars right shove off give way it was only six minutes from the time when hornblower had first conceived the idea now they were free adrift on the black river and caillard was gagged and tied into a bundle on the floor of the coach for a fleeting moment hornblower wondered whether caillard would suffocate before being discovered and he found himself quite indifferent in the matter bonapartes personal aidesdecamp especially if they were colonels of gendarmerie as well must expect to run risks while doing the dirty work which their situation would bring them meanwhile he had other things to think about easy he hissed at brown let the current take her the night was absolutely black seated on the stern thwart he could not even see the surface of the water overside for that matter he did not know what river it was but every river runs to the sea the sea hornblower writhed in his seat in wild nostalgia at a vivid recollection of sea breezes in the nostrils and the feel of a heaving deck under his feet mediterranean or atlantic he did not know which but if they had fantastic luck they might reach the sea in this boat by following the river far enough and the sea was englands and would bear them home to life instead of death to freedom instead of imprisonment to lady barbara to maria and his child the wind shrieked down on them driving snow down his neck thwarts and bottom boards were thick with snow he felt the boat swing round under the thrust of the wind which was in his face now instead of on his cheek turn her head to wind brown he ordered and pull slowly into it the surest way of allowing the current a free hand with them was to try to neutralize the effect of the wind a gale like this would soon blow them on shore or even possibly blow them upstream in this blackness it was impossible to guess what was happening to them comfortable mr bush he asked aye aye sir bush was faintly visible now for the snow had driven up already against the grey blankets that swathed him and could just be seen from where hornblower sat a yard away would you like to lie down thank you sir but id rather sit now that the excitement of the actual escape was over hornblower found himself shivering in the keen wind without his cloak he was about to tell brown that he would take one of the sculls when bush spoke again pardon sir but dyou hear anything brown rested on his oars and they sat listening no said hornblower yes i do by god underlying the noise of the wind there was a distant monotonous roaring hm said hornblower uneasily the roar was growing perceptibly louder now it rose several notes in the scale suddenly and they could distinguish the sound of running water something appeared in the darkness beside the boat it was a rock nearly covered rendered visible in the darkness by the boiling white foam round it it came and was gone in a flash the clearest proof of the speed with which the boat was travelling jesus said brown in the bows now the boat was spinning round lurching jolting all the water was white overside and the bellowing of the rapid was deafening they could do no more than sit and cling to their seat as the boat heaved and jerked hornblower shook himself free from his dazed helplessness which seemed to have lasted half an hour and probably lasted no more than a couple of seconds give me a scull he snapped at brown you fend off port side ill take starboard he groped in the darkness found a scull and took it from browns hand the boat spun hesitated plunged again all about them was the roar of the rapid the starboard side of the boat caught on a rock hornblower felt icy water deluge his legs as it poured in over the side behind him but already he was thrusting madly and blindly with his scull against the rock he felt the boat slip and swing he thrust so that the swing was accentuated and next moment they were clear wallowing sluggishly with the water up to the thwarts another rock slid hissing past but the roar of the fall was already dwindling christ said bush in a mild tone contrasting oddly with the blasphemy were through dyou know if theres a bailer in the boat brown demanded hornblower yessir there was one at my feet when i came on board find it and get this water out give me your other scull brown splashed about in the icy water in a manner piteous to hear as he groped for the floating wooden basin got it sir he reported and they heard the regular sound of the water being scooped overside as he began work in the absence of the distraction of the rapids they were conscious of the wind again now and hornblower turned the boats bows into it and pulled slowly at the sculls past experience appeared to have demonstrated conclusively that this was the best way to allow the current a free hand to take the boat downstream and away from pursuit judging by the speed with which the noise of the rapid was left behind the current of this river was very fast indeed that was only to be expected too for all the rain of the past few days must have brought up every river brim full hornblower wondered vaguely again what river this was here in the heart of france the only one with whose name he was acquainted and which it might possibly be was the rhne but he felt a suspicion that the rhne was fifty miles or so farther eastward this river presumably had taken its origin in the gaunt cevennes whose flanks they had turned in the last two days journey in that case it would run northward and must presumably turn westward to find the sea it must be the loire or one of its tributaries and the loire fell into the bay of biscay below nantes which must be at least four hundred miles away hornblowers imagination dallied with the idea of a river four hundred miles long and with the prospect of descending it from source to mouth in the depth of winter a ghostly sound as if from nowhere brought him back to earth again as he tried to identify it it repeated itself more loudly and definitely and the boat lurched and hesitated they were gliding over a bit of rock which providence had submerged to a depth sufficient just to scrape their keel another rock foam covered came boiling past them close overside it passed them from stern to bow telling him what he had no means of discovering in any other way in the blackness that in this reach the river must be running westward for the wind was in the east and he was pulling into it more of those to come yet sir said bush already they could hear the growing roar of water among rocks take a scull and watch the port side brown said hornblower aye aye sir ive got the boat nearly dry volunteered brown feeling for the scull the boat was lurching again now dancing a little in the madness of the river hornblower felt bow and stern lift successively as they dropped over what felt like a downward step in the water he reeled as he stood and the water remaining in the bottom of the boat surged and splashed against his ankles the din of the rapid in the darkness round them was tremendous white water was boiling about them on either side the boat swung and pitched and rolled then something invisible struck the port side amidships with a splintering crash brown tried unavailingly to shove off and hornblower swung round and with his added strength forced the boat clear they plunged and rolled again hornblower feeling in the darkness found the gunwale stove in but apparently only the two upper strakes were damaged chance might have driven that rock through below the water line as easily as it had done above it now the keel seemed to have caught the boat heeled hideously with bush and hornblower falling on their noses but she freed herself and went on through the roaring water the noise was dying down again and they were through another rapid shall i bail again sir asked brown yes give me your scull light on the starboard bow sir interjected bush hornblower craned over his shoulder undoubtedly it was a light with another close beside it and another farther on barely visible in the driving snow that must be a village on the river bank or a town the town of nevers six kilometres according to the coachman from where they had embarked they had come four miles already silence now hissed hornblower brown stop bailing with those lights to guide him in the darkness stable permanent things in this insane world of infinite indefiniteness it was marvellous how he felt master of his fate once more he knew again which was upstream and which was down the wind was still blowing downstream with a touch of the sculls he turned the boat downstream wind and current sped her along fast and the lights were gliding by rapidly the snow stung his face it was hardly likely there would be anyone in the town to observe them on a night like this certainly the boat must have come down the river faster than the plodding horses of the gendarmes whom caillard had sent ahead a new roaring of water caught his ear different in timbre from the sound of a rapid he craned round again to see the bridge before them silhouetted in white against the blackness by reason of the snow driven against the arches he tugged wildly first at one scull and then at both heading for the centre of an arch he felt the bow dip and the stern heave as they approached the water was banked up above the bridge and rushed down through the arches in a long sleek black slope as they whirled under hornblower bent to his sculls to give the boat sufficient way to carry her through the eddies which his seamans instinct warned him would await them below the piers the crown of the arch brushed his head as he pulled the floods had risen as high as that the sound of rushing water echoed strangely under the stonework for a second and then they were through with hornblower tugging madly at the sculls one more light on the shore and then they were in utter blackness again their sense of direction lost christ said bush again this time with utter solemnity as hornblower rested on his sculls the wind shrieked down upon them blinding them with snow from the bows came a ghostly chuckle god help sailors said brown on a night like this carry on with the bailing brown and save your jokes for afterwards snapped hornblower but he giggled nevertheless even despite of the faint shock he experienced at hearing the lower deck cracking jokes to a captain and a first lieutenant his ridiculous habit of laughing insanely in the presence of danger or hardship was already ready to master him and he giggled now while he dragged at the oars and fought against the wind he could tell by the way the blades dragged through the water that the boat was making plenty of leeway he only stopped giggling when he realized with a shock that it was hardly more than two hours back that he had first uttered the prayer about god helping sailors on a night like this it seemed like a fortnight ago at least that he had last breathed the leathery stuffiness of the inside of the coach the boat grated heavily over gravel caught freed itself bumped again and stuck fast all hornblowers shoving with the sculls would not get her afloat again nothing to do but shove her off said hornblower laying down his sculls he stepped over the side into the freezing water slipping on the stones with brown beside him between them they ran her out easily scrambled on board and hornblower made haste to seize the sculls and pull her into the wind yet a few seconds later they were aground again it was the beginning of a nightmare period in the darkness hornblower could not guess whether their difficulties arose from the action of the wind in pushing them against the bank or from the fact that the river was sweeping round in a great bend here or whether they had strayed into a side channel with scanty water however it was they were continually having to climb out and shove the boat off they slipped and plunged over the invisible stones they fell waist deep into unseen pools they cut themselves and bruised themselves in this mad game of blind mans buff with the treacherous river it was bitterly cold now the sides of the boat were glazed with ice in the midst of his struggles with the boat hornblower was consumed with anxiety for bush bundled up in cloak and blankets in the stern how is it with you bush he asked im doing well sir said bush warm enough aye aye sir ive only one foot to get wet now you know sir he was probably being deceitfully cheerful thought hornblower standing ankle deep in rushing water and engaged in what seemed to be an endless haul of the boat through invisible shallows blankets or no blankets he must be horribly cold and probably wet as well and he was a convalescent who ought to have been kept in bed bush might die out here this very night the boat came free with a run and hornblower staggered back waist deep in the chill water he swung himself in over the swaying gunwale while brown who apparently had been completely submerged came spluttering in over the other side each of them grabbed a scull in their anxiety to have something to do while the wind cut them to the bone the current whirled them away their next contact with the shore was among trees willows hornblower guessed in the darkness the branches against which they scraped volleyed snow at them scratched them and whipped them held the boat fast until by feeling round in the darkness they found the obstruction and lifted it clear by the time they were free of the willows hornblower had almost decided that he would rather have rocks if he could choose and he giggled again feebly with his teeth chattering naturally they were among rocks again quickly enough at this point apparently there was a sort of minor rapid down which the river rolled among rocks and banks of stones already hornblower was beginning to form a mental picture of the river long swift reaches alternating with narrow and rockencumbered stretches looped back and forth at the whim of the surrounding country this boat they were in had probably been built close to the spot where they had found her had been kept there as a ferry boat probably by farming people on the clear reach where they had started and had probably never been more than half a mile from her moorings before hornblower shoving off from a rock decided that the odds were heavily against her ever seeing her moorings again below the rapid they had a long clear run hornblower had no means of judging how long their eyes were quick now to pick out the snowcovered shore when it was a yard or more away and they kept the boat clear every glimpse gave them a chance to guess at the course of the river compared with the direction of the wind so that they could pull a few lusty strokes without danger of running aground as long as there was no obstructions in midchannel in fact it had almost stopped snowing hornblower guessed that what little snow was being flung at them by the wind had been blown from branches or scooped from drifts that did not make it any warmer every part of the boat was coated with ice the floorboards were slippery with it except where his heels rested while rowing ten minutes of this would carry them a mile or more more for certain he could not guess at all how long they had been travelling but he could be sure that with the countryside under thick snow they were well ahead of any possible pursuit and the longer this wonderful rockfree reach endured the safer they would be he tugged away fiercely and brown in the bows responded stroke for stroke rapids ahead sir said bush at length resting on his oar hornblower could hear far ahead the familiar roar of water pouring over rocks the present rate of progress had been too good to last and soon they would be whirling down among rocks again pitching and heaving stand by to fend off on the port side brown he ordered aye aye sir hornblower sat on his thwart with his scull poised the water was sleek and black overside he felt the boat swing round the current seemed to be carrying her over to one side and he was content to let her go where the main mass of water made its way was likely to be the clearest channel down the rapid the roar of the fall was very loud now by god said hornblower in sudden panic standing up to peer ahead it was too late to save themselves he had noticed the difference in the sound of the fall only when they were too close to escape here there was no rapid like those they had already descended not even one much worse here there was a rough dam across the river a natural transverse ledge perhaps which had caught and retained the rocks rolled down in the bed or else something of human construction hornblowers quick brain turned these hypotheses over even as the boat leaped at the drop along its whole length water was brimming over the obstruction at this particular point it surged over in a wide swirl sleek at the top and plunging into foaming chaos below the boat heaved sickeningly over the summit and went down the slope like a bullet the steep steady wave at the foot was as unyielding as a brick wall as they crashed into it hornblower found himself strangling under the water the fall still roaring in his ears his brain still racing in nightmare helplessness he was scraped over the rocky bottom the pressure in his lungs began to hurt him it was agony agony now he was breathing again one single gulp of air like fire in his throat as he went under again and down to the rocks at the bottom until his breast was hurting worse than before then another quick breath it was as painful to breathe as it was to strangle over and down his ears roaring and his head swimming the grinding of the rocks of the river bed over which he was scraped was louder than any clap of thunder he had ever heard another gulp of air it was as if he had been anticipating it but he had to force himself to make it for he felt as if it would be easier not to easier to allow this agony in his breast to consume him down again to the roar and torment below the surface his brain still working like lightning guessed how it was with him he was caught in the swirl below the dam was being swept downstream on the surface pushed into the undertow and carried up again along the bottom to be spewed up and granted a second in which to breathe before being carried round again he was ready this time to strike out feebly no more than three strokes sideways at his next breathing space when he was nextsucked down the pain in his breast was inconceivably greater and blending with that agony was another just as bad of which he now became conscious the pain of the cold in his limbs it called for every scrap of his resolution to force himself to take another breath and to continue his puny effort sideways when the time came for it down again he was ready to die willing anxious to die now so that this pain would stop a bit of board had come into his hand with nails protruding from one end that must be a plank from the boat shattered to fragments and whirling round and round with him eternally then his resolution flickered up once more he caught a gulp of air as he rose to the surface striking out for the shore waiting in apprehension to be dragged down marvellous he had time for a second breath and a third now he wanted to live so heavenly were these painless breaths he was taking but he was so tired and so sleepy he got to his feet fell as the water swept his legs away again from under him splashed and struggled in mad panic scrambling through the shallows on his hands and knees rising he took two more steps before falling with his face in the snow and his feet still trailing in the rushing water he was roused by a human voice bellowing apparently in his ear lifting his head he saw a faint dark figure a yard or two away bellowing with browns voice ahoy capn capn oh capn im here moaned hornblower and brown came and knelt over him thank god sir he said and then raising his voice the capns here mr bush good said a feeble voice five yards away at that hornblower fought down his nauseating weakness and sat up if bush were still alive he must be looked after at once he must be naked and wet exposed in the snow to this cutting wind hornblower reeled to his feet staggered clutched browns arm and stood with his brain whirling theres a light up there sir said brown hoarsely i was just goin to it if you hadnt answered my hail a light hornblower passed his hands over his eyes and peered up the bank undoubtedly it was a light shining faintly perhaps a hundred yards away to go there meant surrender that was the first reaction of hornblowers mind but to stay here meant death even if by a miracle they could light a fire and survive the night here they would be caught next morning and bush would be dead for certain there had been a faint chance of life when he planned the escape from the coach and now it was gone well carry mr bush up he said aye aye sir they plunged through the snow to where bush lay theres a house just up the bank bush well carry you there hornblower was puzzled by his ability to think and to speak while he felt so weak the ability seemed unreal fictitious aye aye sir they stooped and lifted him up between them linking hands under his knees and behind his back bush put his arms round their necks his flannel nightshirt dripped a further stream of water as they lifted him then they started trudging knee deep in the snow up the bank towards the distant light they stumbled over obstructions hidden in the snow they slipped and staggered then they slid down a bank and fell all together and bush gave a cry of pain hurt sir asked brown only jarred my stump captain leave me here and send down help from the house hornblower could still think without bush to burden them they might reach the house a little quicker but he could imagine all the delays that would ensue after they had knocked at the door the explanations which would have to be made in his halting french the hesitation and the time wasting before he could get a carrying party started off to find bush who meanwhile would be lying wet and naked in the snow a quarter of an hour of it would kill bush and he might be exposed for twice as long as that and there was the chance that there would be no one in the house to help carry him no said hornblower cheerfully its only a little way lift brown they reeled along through the snow towards the light bush was a heavy burden hornblowers head was swimming with fatigue and his arms felt as if they were being dragged out of their sockets yet somehow within the shell of his fatigue the inner kernel of his brain was still active and restless how did you get out of the river he asked his voice sounding flat and unnatural in his ears current took us to the bank at once sir said bush faintly surprised id only just kicked my blankets off when i touched a rock and there was brown beside me hauling me out oh said hornblower the whim of a river in flood was fantastic the three of them had been within a yard of each other when they entered the water and he had been dragged under while the other two had been carried to safety they could not guess at his desperate struggle for life and they would never know of it for he would never be able to tell them about it he felt for the moment a bitter sense of grievance against them resulting from his weariness and his weakness he was breathing heavily and he felt as if he would give a fortune to lay down his burden and rest for a couple of minutes but his pride forbade and they went on through the snow stumbling over the inequalities below the surface the light was coming near at last they heard a faint inquiring bark from a dog give em a hail brown said hornblower ahoy roared brown house ahoy instantly two dogs burst into a clamorous barking ahoy yelled brown again and they staggered on another light flashed into view from another part of the house they seemed to be in some kind of garden now hornblower could feel plants crushing under his feet in the snow and the thorns of a rose tree tore at his trouser leg the dogs were barking furiously suddenly a voice came from a dark upper window who is there it asked in french hornblower prodded at his weary brain to find words to reply three men he said wounded that was the best he could do come nearer said the voice and they staggered forward slipped down an unseen incline and halted in the square of light cast by the big lighted window in the ground floor bush in his nightshirt resting in the arms of the bedraggled other two who are you prisoners of war said hornblower wait one moment if you please said the voice politely they stood shuddering in the snow until a door opened near the lighted window showing a bright rectangle of light and some human silhouettes come in gentlemen said the polite voice chapter seven the door opened into a stone flagged hall a tall thin man in a blue coat with a glistening white cravat stood there to welcome them and at his side was a young woman her shoulders bare in the lamplight there were three others too maidservants and a butler hornblower fancied vaguely as he advanced into the hall under the burden of bushs weight on a side table the lamplight caught the ivory butts of a pair of pistols evidently laid there by their host on his deciding that his nocturnal visitors were harmless hornblower and brown halted again for a moment ragged and dishevelled and daubed with snow and water began to trickle at once to the floor from their soaking garments and bush was between them one foot in a grey worsted sock sticking out under the hem of his flannel nightshirt hornblowers constitutional weakness almost overcame him again and he had to struggle hard to keep himself from giggling as he wondered how these people were explaining to themselves the arrival of a nightshirted cripple out of a snowy night at least his host had sufficient selfcontrol to show no surprise come in come in he said he put his hand to a door beside him and then withdrew it you will need a better fire than i can offer you in the drawingroom felix show the way to the kitchen i trust you gentlemen will pardon my receiving you there this way sirs chairs felix and send the maids away it was a vast lowceilinged room stoneflagged like the hall its grateful warmth was like paradise in the hearth glowed the remains of a fire and all round them kitchen utensils winked and glittered the woman without a word piled fresh billets of wood upon the fire and set to work with bellows to work up a blaze hornblower noticed the glimmer of her silk dress her piled up hair was golden nearly auburn cannot felix do that marie my dear very well then as you will said their host please sit down gentlemen wine felix they lowered bush into a chair before the fire he sagged and wavered in his weakness and they had to support him their host clucked in sympathy hurry with those glasses felix and then attend to the beds a glass of wine sir and for you sir permit me the woman he had addressed as marie had risen from her knees and withdrew silently the fire was crackling bravely amid its battery of roasting spits and cauldrons hornblower was shivering uncontrollably nevertheless in his dripping clothes the glass of wine he drank was of no help to him the hand he rested on bushs shoulder shook like a leaf you will need dry clothes said their host if you will permit me i will he was interrupted by the reentrance of the butler and marie both of them with their arms full of clothes and blankets admirable said their host felix you will attend these gentlemen come my dear the butler held a silken nightshirt to the blaze while hornblower and brown stripped bush of his wet clothes and chafed him with a towel i thought i should never be warm again said bush when his head came out through the collar of the nightshirt and you sir you shouldnt have troubled about me wont you change your clothes now sir im all right well see you comfortable first said hornblower there was a fierce perverse pleasure in neglecting himself to attend to bush let me look at that stump of yours the blunt seamed end still appeared extraordinarily healthy there was no obvious heat or inflammation when hornblower took it in his hand no sign of pus exuding from the scars felix found a cloth in which hornblower bound it up while brown wrapped him about in a blanket lift him now brown well put him into bed outside in the flagged hall they hesitated as to which way to turn when marie suddenly appeared from the left hand door in here she said her voice was a harsh contralto i have had a bed made up on the ground floor for the wounded man i thought it would be more convenient one maid a gaunt old woman rather had just taken a warming pan from between the sheets the other was slipping a couple of hot bottles into the bed hornblower was impressed by maries practical forethought he tried with poor success to phrase his thanks in french while they lowered bush into bed and covered him up god thats good thank you sir said bush they left him with a candle burning at his bedside hornblower was in a perfect panic now to strip off his wet clothes before that roaring kitchen fire he towelled himself with a warm towel and slipped into a warm woollen shirt standing with his bare legs toasting before the blaze he drank a second glass of wine fatigue and cold fell away from him and he felt exhilarated and lightheaded as a reaction felix crouched before him tendering him a pair of trousers and he stepped into them and suffered felix to tuck in his shirt tails and button him up it was the first time since childhood that he had been helped into his trousers but this evening it seemed perfectly natural felix crouched again to put on his socks and shoes stood to buckle his stock and help him on with waistcoat and coat monsieur le comte and madame la vicomtesse await monsieur in the drawing room said felix it was odd how without a word of explanation felix had ascertained that brown was of a lower social level the very clothes he had allotted to brown indicated that make yourself comfortable here brown said hornblower aye aye sir said brown standing at attention with his black hair in a rampant mass only hornblower had had an opportunity so far of using a comb hornblower stepped in to look at bush who was already asleep snoring faintly at the base of his throat he seemed to have suffered no ill effects from his immersion and exposure his iron frame must have grown accustomed to wet and cold during twentyfive years at sea hornblower blew out the candle and softly closed the door motioning to the butler to precede him at the drawing room door felix asked hornblower his name and when he announced him hornblower was oddly relieved to hear him make a sad hash of the pronunciation it made felix human again his host and hostess were seated on either side of the fire at the far end of the room and the count rose to meet him i regret he said that i did not quite hear the name which my majordomo announced captain horatio hornblower of his britannic majestys ship sutherland said hornblower it is the greatest pleasure to meet you captain said the count sidestepping the difficulty of pronunciation with the agility to be expected of a representative of the old regime i am lucien antoine de ladon comte de graay the men exchanged bows may i present you to my daughterinlaw madame la vicomtesse de graay your servant maam said hornblower bowing again and then felt like a graceless lout because the english formula had risen to his lips by the instinct the action prompted he hurriedly racked his brains for the french equivalent and ended in a shamefaced mumble of enchant the vicomtesse had black eyes in the maddest contrast with her nearly auburn hair she was stoutly one might almost say stockily built and was somewhere near thirty years of age dressed in black silk which left sturdy white shoulders exposed as she curtseyed her eyes met his in complete friendliness and what is the name of the wounded gentleman whom we have the honour of entertaining she asked even to hornblowers unaccustomed ear her french had a different quality from the counts bush said hornblower grasping the import of the question with an effort first lieutenant of my ship i have left my servant brown in the kitchen felix will see that he is comfortable interposed the count what of yourself captain some food a glass of wine nothing thank you said hornblower he felt in no need of food in this mad world although he had not eaten since noon nothing despite the fatigues of your journey there could hardly be a more delicate allusion than that to hornblowers recent arrival through the snow drenched and battered nothing thank you repeated hornblower will you not sit down captain asked the vicomtesse they all three found themselves chairs you will pardon us i hope said the count if we continue to speak french it is ten years since i last had occasion to speak english and even then i was a poor scholar while my daughterinlaw speaks none bush said the vicomtesse brown i can say those names but your name captain is difficult orrenblor i cannot say it bush orrenblor exclaimed the count as though reminded of something i suppose you are aware captain of what the french newspapers have been saying about you recently no said hornblower i should like to know very much pardon me then the count took up a candle and disappeared through a door he returned quickly enough to save hornblower from feeling too selfconscious in the silence that ensued here are recent copies of the moniteur said the count i must apologize in advance captain for the statements made in them he passed the newspapers over to hornblower indicating various columns in them the first one briefly announced that a dispatch by semaphore just received from perpignan informed the ministry of marine that an english ship of the line had been captured at rosas the next was the amplification it proclaimed in triumphant detail that the hundred gun ship sutherland which had been committing acts of piracy in the mediterranean had met a welldeserved fate at the hands of the toulon fleet directed by admiral cosmao she had been caught unawares and overwhelmed and had pusillanimously hauled down the colours of perfidious albion under which she had committed so many dastardly crimes the french public was assured that her resistance had been of the poorest it being advanced in corroboration that only one french ship had lost a topmast during the cannonade the action took place under the eyes of thousands of the spanish populace and would be a salutory lesson to those few among them who deluded by english lies or seduced by english gold still cherished notions of resistance to their lawful sovereign king joseph another article announced that the infamous captain hornblower and his equally wicked lieutenant bush had surrendered in the sutherland the latter being one of the few wounded in the encounter all those peaceloving french citizens who had suffered as a result of their piratical depredations could rest assured that a military court would inquire immediately into the crimes these two had committed too long had the modern carthage sent forth her minions to execute her vile plans with impunity their guilt would soon be demonstrated to a world which would readily discriminate between the truth and the vile lies which the poisoned pens in cannings pay so persistently poured forth yet another article declared that as a result of admiral cosmaos great victory over the sutherland at rosas english naval action on the coasts of spain had ceased and the british army of wellington so imprudently exposed to the might of the french arms was already suffering seriously from a shortage of supplies having lost one vile accomplice in the person of the detestable hornblower perfidious albion was about to lose another on wellingtons inevitable surrender hornblower read the smudgy columns in impotent fury a hundred gun ship forsooth when the sutherland was only a seventyfour and almost the smallest of her rate in the list resistance of the poorest one topmast lost the sutherland had beaten three bigger ships into wrecks and had disabled a fourth before surrendering one of the few wounded twothirds of the sutherlands crew had given life or limb and with his own eyes he had seen the blood running from the scuppers of the french flagship english naval action had ceased there was not a hint that a fortnight after the capture of the sutherland the whole french squadron had been destroyed in the night attack on rosas bay his professional honour had been impugned the circumstantial lies had been well told too that subtle touch about only one topmast being lost had every appearance of verisimilitude europe might well believe that he was a poltroon as well as a pirate and he had not the slightest chance of contradicting what had been said even in england such reports must receive a little credit most of the moniteurs bulletins especially the naval ones were reproduced in the english press lady barbara maria his brother captains must all be wondering at the present moment just how much credence should be given to the moniteurs statements accustomed as the world might be to bonapartes exaggerations people could hardly be expected to realize that in this case everything said save for the bare statement of his surrender had been completely untrue his hands shook a little with the passion that consumed him and he was conscious of the hot flush in his cheeks as he looked up and met the eyes of the others it was hard to grope for his few french words while he was so angry he is a liar he spluttered at length he dishonours me he dishonours everyone said the count quietly but this but this said hornblower and then gave up the struggle to express himself in french he remembered that while he was in captivity in rosas he had realized that bonaparte would publish triumphant bulletins regarding the capture of the sutherland and it was only weakness to be enraged by them now that he was confronted by them will you forgive me asked the count if i change the subject and ask you a few personal questions certainly i presume you have escaped from an escort which was taking you to paris yes said hornblower where did you escape hornblower tried to explain that it was at a point where a byroad ran down to the rivers edge six kilometres on the farther side of nevers haltingly he went on to describe the conditions of his escape the silencing of colonel caillard and the wild navigation of the river in the darkness that must have been about six oclock i presume asked the count yes it is only midnight now and you have come twenty kilometres there is not the slightest chance of your escort seeking you here for some time that is what i wanted to know you will be able to sleep in tranquillity tonight captain hornblower realized with a shock that he had long taken it for granted that he would sleep in tranquillity at least as far as immediate recapture was concerned the atmosphere of the house had been too friendly for him to feel otherwise by way of reaction he began to feel doubts are you going to to tell the police we are here he asked it was infernally difficult to phrase that sort of thing in a foreign language and avoid offence on the contrary said the count i shall tell them if they ask me that you are not here i hope you will consider yourself among friends in this house captain and that you will make your stay here as long as is convenient to you thank you sir thank you very much stammered hornblower i may add went on the count that circumstances it is too long a story to tell you make it quite certain that the authorities will accept my statement that i know nothing of your whereabouts to say nothing of the fact that i have the honour to be mayor of this commune and so represent the government even though my adjoint does all the work of the position hornblower noticed his wry smile as he used the word honour and tried to stammer a fitting reply to which the count listened politely it was amazing now hornblower came to think about it that chance should have led him to a house where he was welcomed and protected where he might consider himself safe from pursuit and sleep in peace the thought of sleep made him realize that he was desperately tired despite his excitement the impassive face of the count and the friendly face of his daughterinlaw gave no hint as to whether or not they too were tired for a moment hornblower wrestled with the problem which always presents itself the first evening of ones stay in a strange house whether the guest should suggest going to bed or wait for a hint from his host he made his resolve and rose to his feet you are tired said the vicomtesse the first words she had spoken for some time yes said hornblower i will show you your room sir shall i ring for your servant no said the count out in the hall after hornblower had bowed good night the count indicated the pistols still lying on the side table perhaps you would care to have those at your bedside he asked politely you might feel safer hornblower was tempted but finally he refused the offer two pistols would not suffice to save him from bonapartes police should they come for him as you will said the count leading the way with a candle i loaded them when i heard your approach because there was a chance that you were a party of rfractaires young men who evade the conscription by hiding in the woods and mountains their number has grown considerably since the latest decree anticipating the conscription but i quickly realized that no gang meditating mischief would proclaim its proximity with shouts here is your room sir i hope you will find here everything you require the clothes you are wearing appear to fit so tolerably that perhaps you will continue to wear them tomorrow then i shall say good night i hope you will sleep well the bed was deliciously warm as hornblower slid into it and closed the curtains his thoughts were pleasantly muddled disturbing memories of the appalling swoop of the little boat down the long black slope of water at the fall and of his agonized battle for life in the water were overridden by mental pictures of the counts long mobile face and of caillard bundled in his cloak and dumped down upon the carriage floor he did not sleep well but he could hardly be said to have slept badly chapter eight felix entered the next morning bearing a breakfast tray and he opened the bed curtains while hornblower lay dazed in his bed brown followed felix and while the latter arranged the tray on the bedside table he applied himself to the task of gathering together the clothes which hornblower had flung down the night before trying hard to assume the unobtrusive deference of a gentlemans servant hornblower sipped gratefully at the steaming coffee and bit into the bread brown recollected another duty and hurried across to open the bedroom curtains gales pretty nigh dropped sir he said i think what wind theres left is backing southerly and we might have a thaw through the deep windows of the bedroom hornblower could see from his bed a wide landscape of dazzling white falling steeply away down to the river which was black by contrast appearing like a black crayon mark on white paper trees stood out starkly through the snow where the gale had blown their branches bare down beside the river the willows there some of them stood in the flood with white foam at their feet were still domed with white hornblower fancied he could hear the rushing of water and was certain that he could hear the regular droning of the fall the tumbling water at whose foot was just visible over the shoulder of the bank far beyond the river could be seen the snowcovered roofs of a few small houses ive been in to mr bush already sir said brown hornblower felt a twinge of remorse at being too interested in the landscape to have a thought to spare for his lieutenant and hes all right an sends you his best respects sir im goin to help him shave after ive attended to you sir yes said hornblower he felt deliciously languorous he wanted to be idle and lazy the present was a moment of transition between the miseries and dangers of yesterday and the unknown activities of today and he wanted that moment to be prolonged on and on indefinitely he wanted time to stand still the pursuers who were seeking him on the other side of nevers to be stilled into an enchanted rigidity while he lay here free from danger and responsibility the very coffee he had drunk contributed to his ease by relieving his thirst without stimulating him to activity he sank imperceptibly and delightfully into a vague daydream it was hateful of brown to recall him to wakefulness again by a respectful shuffling of his feet right said hornblower resigning himself to the inevitable he kicked off the bedclothes and rose to his feet the hard world of the matteroffact closing round him and his daydreams vanishing like the cloudcolours of a tropical sunrise as he shaved and washed in the absurdly small basin in the corner he contemplated grimly the prospect of prolonged conversation in french with his hosts he grudged the effort it would involve and he envied bush his complete inability to speak any other tongue than english having to exert himself today loomed as large to his selfwilled mind as the fact that he was doomed to death if he were caught again he listened absentmindedly to bushs garrulity when he went in to visit him and did nothing at all to satisfy his curiosity regarding the house in which they had found shelter and the intentions of their hosts nor was his mood relieved by his pitying contempt for himself at thus working off his ill temper on his unoffending lieutenant he deserted bush as soon as he decently could and went off in search of his hosts in the drawing room the vicomtesse alone was there and she made him welcome with a smile m de graay is at work in his study she explained you must be content with my entertaining you this morning to say even the obvious in french was an effort for hornblower but he managed to make the suitable reply which the lady received with a smile but conversation did not proceed smoothly with hornblower having laboriously to build up his sentences beforehand and to avoid the easy descent into spanish which was liable to entrap him whenever he began to think in a foreign tongue nevertheless the opening sentences regarding the storm last night the snow in the fields and the flood elicited for hornblower one interesting fact that the river whose roar they could hear was the loire four hundred miles or more from its mouth in the bay of biscay a few miles upstream lay the town of nevers a little way downstream the large tributary the allier joined the loire but there was hardly a house and no village on the river in that direction for twenty miles as far as pouilly from whose vineyards had come the wine they had drunk last night the river is only as big as this in winter said the vicomtesse in summer it dwindles away to almost nothing there are places where one can walk across it from one bank to the other then it is blue and its banks are golden but now it is black and ugly yes said hornblower he felt a peculiar tingling sensation down his thighs and calves as the words recalled his experience of the night before the swoop over the fall and the mad battle in the flood he and bush and brown might easily all be sodden corpses now rolling among the rocks at the bottom of the river until the process of corruption should bring them to the surface i have not thanked you and m de graay for your hospitality he said picking his words with care it is very kind of the count kind he is the kindest man in the whole world i cant tell you how good he is there was no doubting the sincerity of the counts daughterinlaw as she made this speech her wide humorous mouth parted and her dark eyes glowed really said hornblower the word vraiment slipped naturally from his lips now that some animation had come into the conversation yes really he is good all the way through he is sweet and kind by nature and not not as a result of experience he has never said a word to me not once not a word about the disappointment i have caused him you madame yes oh isnt it obvious i am not a great lady marcel should not have married me my father is a normandy peasant on his own land but a peasant all the same while the ladons counts of graay go back to to saint louis or before that marcel told me how disappointed was the count at our marriage but i should never have known of it otherwise not by word or by action marcel was the eldest son then because antoine had been killed at austerlitz and marcel is dead too he was wounded at aspern and i have no son no child at all and the count has never reproached me never hornblower tried to make some kind of sympathetic noise and louismarie is dead as well now he died of fever in spain he was the third son and m de graay is the last of the ladons i think it broke his heart but he has never said a bitter word the three sons are all dead said hornblower yes as i told you m de graay was an migr he lived in your town of london with his children for years after the revolution and then the boys grew up and they heard of the fame of the emperor he was first consul then and they all wanted to share in the glory of france it was to please them that the count took advantage of the amnesty and returned here this is all that the revolution has left of his estates he never went to paris what would he have in common with the emperor but he allowed his sons to join the army and now they are all dead antoine and marcel and louismarie marcel married me when his regiment was billeted in our village but the others never married louismarie was only eighteen when he died terrible said hornblower the banal words did not express his sense of the pathos of the story but it was all he could think of he understood now the counts statement of the night before that the authorities would be willing to accept his bare word that he had seen nothing of any escaped prisoners a great gentleman whose three sons had died in the imperial service would never be suspected of harbouring fugitives understand me went on the vicomtesse it is not because he hates the emperor that he makes you welcome here it is because he is kind because you needed help i have never known him to deny help to anyone oh it is hard to explain but i think you understand i understand said hornblower gently his heart warmed to the vicomtesse she might be lonely and unhappy she was obviously as hard as her peasant upbringing would make her and yet her first thought was to impress upon this stranger the goodness and virtue of her fatherinlaw with her nearlyred hair and black eyes she was a strikinglooking woman and her skin had a thick creaminess which enhanced her looks only a slight irregularity of feature and the wideness of her mouth prevented her from being of dazzling beauty no wonder the young subaltern in the hussars hornblower took it for granted that the dead vicomte de graay had been a subaltern of hussars had fallen in love with her during the dreary routine of training and had insisted on marrying her despite his fathers opposition hornblower thought he would not find it hard to fall in love with her himself if he were mad enough to allow such a thing to happen while his life was in the hands of the count and you asked the vicomtesse have you a wife in england children i have a wife said hornblower even without the handicap of a foreign language it was difficult to describe maria to a stranger he said that she was short and dark and he said no more her red hands and dumpy figure her loyalty to him which cloyed when it did not irritate he could not venture on a fuller description lest he should betray the fact that he did not love her and he had never betrayed it yet so that you have no children either asked the vicomtesse again not now said hornblower this was torment he told of how little horatio and little maria had died of smallpox in a southsea lodging and then with a gulp he went on to say that there was another child due to be born in january next let us hope you will be home with your wife then said the vicomtesse today you will be able to discuss plans of escape with my fatherinlaw as if this new mention of his name had summoned him the count came into the room on the tail of this sentence forgive my interrupting you he said even while he returned hornblowers bow but from my study window i have just seen a gendarme approaching this house from a group which was riding along the river bank would it be troubling you too much captain to ask you to go into monsieur bushs room for a time i shall send your servant in to you too and perhaps then you would be good enough to lock the door i shall interview the gendarme myself and you will only be detained for a few minutes i hope a gendarme hornblower was out of the room and was crossing over to bushs door before this long speech was finished while m de graay escorted him thither unruffled polite his words unhurried bush was sitting up in bed as hornblower entered but what he began to say was broken off by hornblowers abrupt gesture demanding silence a moment later brown tapped at the door and was admitted hornblower carefully locking the door after him what is it sir whispered bush and hornblower whispered an explanation still standing with his hand on the handle stooping to listen he heard a knocking on the outer door and the rattling of chains as felix went to open it feverishly he tried to hear the ensuing conversation but he could not understand it but the gendarme was speaking with respect and felix in the flat passionless tones of the perfect butler he heard the tramp of booted feet and the ring of spurs as the gendarme was led into the hall and then all the sounds died away with the closing of a door upon them the minutes seemed like hours as he waited growing aware of his nervousness he forced himself to turn and smile at the others as they sat with their ears cocked listening the wait was too long for them to preserve their tension soon they relaxed and grinned at each other not with hollow mirth as hornblowers had been at the start at last a renewed burst of sound from the hall keyed them up again and they stayed rigid listening to the penetrating voices and then they heard the clash of the outside door shutting and the voices ceased still it was a long time before anything more happened five minutes ten minutes and then a tap on the door startled them as though it were a pistol shot can i come in captain said the counts voice hurriedly hornblower unlocked the door to admit him and even then he had to stand and wait in feverish patience translating awkwardly while the count apologized to bush for intruding upon him and made polite inquiries about his health and whether he slept well tell him i slept nicely if you please sir said bush i am delighted to hear it said the count now in the matter of this gendarme hornblower brought forward a chair for him he would not allow it to be thought that his impatience overrode his good manners thank you captain thank you you are sure i will not be intruding if i stay that is good of you the gendarme came to tell me the narrative was prolonged by the need for interpreting to bush and brown the gendarme was one of those posted at nevers every available man in that town had been turned out shortly before midnight by a furious colonel caillard to search for the fugitives in the darkness they had been able to do little but with the coming of the dawn caillard had begun a systematic search of both banks of the river seeking for traces of the prisoners and making inquiries at every house and cottage along the banks the visit of the gendarme had been merely one of routine he had come to ask if anything had been seen of three escaped englishmen and to give warning that they might be in the vicinity he had been perfectly satisfied with the counts assurance upon the point in fact the gendarme had no expectation of finding the englishmen alive the search had already revealed a blanket one of those which had been used by the wounded englishman lying on the bank down by the bec dallier which seemed a sure indication that their boat had capsized in which case with the river in flood there could be no doubt that they had been drowned their bodies would be discovered somewhere along the course of the river during the next few days the gendarme appeared to be of the opinion that the boat must have upset somewhere in the first rapid they had encountered before they had gone a mile so madly was the river running i hope you will agree with me captain that this information is most satisfactory added the count satisfactory said hornblower could it be better if the french should believe them to be dead there would be an end to the pursuit he turned and explained the situation to the others in english and they endeavoured with nods and smiles to indicate to the count their gratification perhaps bonaparte in paris will not be satisfied with this bald story said the count in fact i am sure he will not and will order a further search but it will not trouble us thank you sir said hornblower and the count made a deprecatory gesture it only remains he said to make up our minds about what you gentlemen would find it best to do in the future would it be officious of me to suggest that it might be inadvisable for you to continue your journey while lieutenant bush is still unwell what does he say sir asked bush the mention of his name had drawn all eyes on him hornblower explained tell his lordship sir said bush that i can make myself a jury leg in two shakes an this time next week ill be walking as well as he does excellent said the count when this had been translated and expurgated for him and yet i cannot see that the construction of a wooden leg is going to be of much assistance in our problem you gentlemen might grow beards or wear disguises it was in my mind that by posing as german officers in the imperial service you might during your future journey provide an excuse for your ignorance of french but a missing foot cannot be disguised for months to come the arrival of a stranger without a foot will recall to the minds of inquisitive police officers the wounded english officer who escaped and was believed to be drowned yes said hornblower unless we could avoid all contact with police officers that is quite impossible said the count with decision in this french empire there are police officers everywhere to travel you will need horses certainly a carriage very probably in a journey of a hundred leagues horses and a carriage will bring you for certain to the notice of the police no man can travel ten miles along a road without having his passport examined the count pulled in perplexity at his chin the deep parentheses at the corners of his mobile mouth were more marked than ever i wish said hornblower that our boat had not been destroyed last night on the river perhaps the idea came up into his mind fully formed and as it did so his eyes met the counts he was conscious afresh of a strange sympathy between him and the count the same idea was forming in the counts mind simultaneously it was not the first time that he had noticed a similar phenomenon of course said the count the river how foolish of me not to think of it as far as orleans the river is unnavigable because of the winter floods the banks are practically deserted save at the towns and there are few of those which you could pass at night if necessary as you did at nevers unnavigable sir there is no commercial traffic there are fishermens boats here and there and there are a few others engaged in dredging sand from the river bed that is all from orleans to nantes bonaparte has been making efforts to render the river available to barges but i understand he has had small success and above briare the new lateral canal carries all the traffic and the river is deserted but could we descend it sir persisted hornblower oh yes said the count meditatively you could do so in summer in a small rowing boat there are many places where it would be difficult but never dangerous in summer exclaimed hornblower why yes you must wait until the lieutenant here is well and then you must build your boat i suppose you sailors can build your own boat you cannot hope to start for a long time and then in january the river usually freezes and in february come the floods which last until march nothing could live on the river then especially as it would be too cold and wet for you it seems to be quite necessary that you should give me the pleasure of your company until april captain this was something entirely unexpected this prospect of waiting for four months the opportunity to start hornblower was taken by surprise he had supposed that a few days three or four weeks at most would see them on their way towards england again for ten years he had never been as long as four months consecutively in the same place for that matter during those ten years he had hardly spent four months on shore altogether his mind sought unavailingly for alternatives to go by road undoubtedly would involve horses carriages contact with all sorts of people he could not hope to bring bush and brown successfully through and if they went by river they obviously would have to wait in four months bush could be expected to make a complete recovery and with the coming of summer they would be able to dispense with the shelter of inns or houses sleeping on the river bank avoiding all intercourse with frenchmen drifting downstream until they reached the sea if you have fishing rods with you supplemented the count anyone observing you as you go past the towns will look on you as a fishing party out for the day for some reason which i cannot fully analyse a fresh water fisherman can never be suspected of evil intent except possibly by the fish hornblower nodded it was odd that at that very moment he too had been visualizing the boat drifting downstream with rods out watched by incurious eyes from the bank it was the safest way of crossing france which he could imagine and yet april his child would be born lady barbara might have forgotten that he ever existed it seems monstrous he said that you should be burdened with us all through the winter i assure you captain your presence will give the greatest pleasure both to madame la vicomtesse and myself he could only yield to circumstances chapter nine lieutenant bush was watching brown fastening the last strap of his new wooden leg and hornblower from across the room was watching the pair of them vast heaving said bush belay bush sat on the edge of his bed and moved his leg tentatively good he said give me your shoulder now heave and wake the dead hornblower saw bush rise and stand he watched his lieutenants expression change to one of hurt wonderment as he clung to browns burly shoulders god said bush feebly how she heaves it was the giddiness only to be expected after weeks of lying and sitting evidently to bush the floor was pitching and tossing and judging by the movement of his eyes the walls were circling round him brown stood patiently supporting him as bush confronted this unexpected phenomenon hornblower saw bush set his jaw his expression hardening as he battled with his weakness square away said bush to brown set a course for the captain brown began walking slowly towards hornblower bush clinging to him the leathertipped end of the wooden leg falling with a thump on the floor at each effort to take a stride with it bush was swinging it too high while his sound leg sagged at the knee in its weakness god said bush again easy easy hornblower rose in time to catch him and to lower him into the chair where bush sat and gasped his big white face already unnaturally pale through long confinement was whiter than ever hornblower remembered with a pang the old bush burly and selfconfident with a face which might have been roughhewn from a solid block of wood the bush who feared nothing and was prepared for anything this bush was frightened of his weakness it had not occurred to him that he would have to learn to walk again and that walking with a wooden leg was another matter still take a rest said hornblower before you start again desperately anxious as bush had been to walk weary as he was of helplessness there were times during the next few days when hornblower had to give him active encouragement while he was learning to walk all the difficulties that arose had been unforeseen by him and depressed him out of proportion to their importance it was a matter of some days before he mastered his giddiness and weakness and then as soon as he was able to use the wooden leg effectively they found all manner of things wrong with it it was none too easy to find the most suitable length and they discovered to their surprise that it was a matter of some importance to set the leather tip at exactly the right angle to the shaft brown and hornblower between them at a worktable in the stable yard made and remade that wooden leg half a dozen times bushs bent knee on which his weight rested when he walked grew sore and inflamed they had to pad the kneecap and remake the socket to fit more than once while bush had to take his exercise in small amounts until the skin over his kneecap grew calloused and more accustomed to its new task and when he fell which was often he caused himself frightful agony in his stump which was hardly healed with his knee bent at right angles the stump necessarily bore the brunt of practically any fall and the pain was acute but teaching bush to walk was one way of passing the long winter days while orders from paris turned out the conscripts from every depot round and set them searching once more for the missing english prisoners they came on a day of lashing rain a dozen shivering boys and a sergeant wet through and made only the poorest pretence at searching the house and its stabling hornblower and bush and brown were safe enough behind the hay in an unobtrusive loft the conscripts were given in the kitchen a better meal by the servants than they had enjoyed for some time and marched off to prosecute their inquiries elsewhere every house and village for miles round was at least visited after that the next occurrence out of the ordinary was the announcement in bonapartes newspapers that the english captain and lieutenant hornblower and bush had met a welldeserved fate by being drowned in the loire during an attempt to escape from an escort which was conducting them to their trial undoubtedly this had saved the miscreants from the firing party which awaited them for the purpose of exacting the penalty of their flagrant piracy in the mediterranean hornblower read the announcement with mixed feelings when the count showed it to him not every man has the privilege of reading his own obituary his first reaction was that it would make their escape considerably easier seeing that the police would no longer be on the watch for them but that feeling of relief was swamped by a wave of other feelings maria in england would think herself a widow at this very moment when their child was about to be born what would it mean to her hornblower knew only too acutely that maria loved him as dearly as a woman could love a man although he only admitted it to himself at moments like this he could not guess what she would do when she believed him dead it would be the end of everything she had lived for and yet she would have a pension security a child to cherish she might set herself unconsciously to make a new life for herself in a clairvoyant moment hornblower visualized maria in deep mourning her mouth set in prim resignation the coarse red skin of her cheeks wet with tears and her red hands nervously clasping and unclasping she had looked like that the summer day when little horatio and little maria bad been buried in their common grave hornblower shuddered away from the recollection maria would at least be in no need of money the british press would see that the government did its duty there he could guess at the sort of articles which would be appearing in reply to this announcement of bonapartes the furious indignation that a british officer should be accused of piracy the openly expressed suspicions that he had been murdered in cold blood and had not died while attempting to escape the clamour for reprisals to this day a british newspaper seldom discussed bonaparte without recalling the death of another british naval captain wright who was said to have committed suicide in prison in paris everyone in england believed that bonaparte had had him murdered they would believe the same in this case it was almost amusing that nearly always the most effective attacks on the tyrant were based on actions on his part which were either trivial or innocent the british genius for invective and propaganda had long discovered that it paid better to exploit trivialities rather than inveigh broadly against policies and principles the newspapers would give more space to a condemnation of bonaparte for causing the death of a single naval officer than to a discussion of the criminal nature of say the invasion of spain which had resulted in the wanton slaughter of some hundreds of thousands of innocent people and lady barbara would read that he was dead too she would be sorry hornblower was prepared to believe that but how deep her sorrow would be he could not estimate at all the thought called up all the flood of speculations and doubts which lately he had been trying to forget whether she cared for him at all or not whether or not her husband had survived his wound and what he could do in the matter in any event i am sorry that this announcement seems to cause you so much distress said the count and hornblower realized that his expression had been anxiously studied during the whole reading he had for once been caught off his guard but he was on guard again at once he made himself smile it will make our journey through france a good deal easier he said yes i thought the same as soon as i read it i can congratulate you captain thank you said hornblower but there was a worried look in the counts face he had something more to say and was hesitating to say it what are you thinking about sir asked hornblower only this your position is in one way more dangerous now you have been pronounced dead by a government which does not admit mistakes cannot afford to admit them i am afraid in case i have done you a disservice in so selfishly accepting the pleasure of your company if you are recaptured you will be dead the government will see that you die without further attention being called to you hornblower shrugged his shoulders with a carelessness quite unassumed for once they were going to shoot me if they caught me this makes no difference he dallied with the notion of a modern government dabbling in secret murder for a moment was inclined to put it aside as quite impossible as something one might believe of the turks or perhaps even of the sicilians but not of bonaparte and then he realized with a shock that it was not at all impossible that a man with unlimited power and much at stake with underlings on whose silence he could rely could not be expected to risk appearing ridiculous in the eye of his public when a mere murder would save him it was a sobering thought but he made himself smile again bravely you have all the courage characteristic of your nation captain said the count but this news of your death will reach england i fear that madame orrenblor will be distressed by it i am afraid she will i could find means of sending a message to england my bankers can be trusted but whether it would be advisable is another matter if it were known in england that he was alive it would be known in france and a stricter search would be instituted for him it would be terribly dangerous maria would draw small profit from the knowledge that he was alive if that knowledge were to cause his death i think it would not be advisable said hornblower there was a strange duality in his mind the hornblower for whom he could plan so coolly and whose chances of life he could estimate so closely was a puppet of the imagination compared with the living flesh and blood hornblower whose face he had shaved that morning he knew by experience now that only when a crisis came when he was swimming for his life in a whirlpool or walking a quarterdeck in the heat of action that the two blended together that was the moment when fear came i hope captain said the count that this news has not disturbed you too much not at all sir said hornblower i am delighted to hear it and perhaps you will be good enough to give madame la vicomtesse and myself the pleasure of your company again tonight at whist you and mr bush whist was the regular way of passing the evening the counts delight in the game was another bond of sympathy between him and hornblower he was not a player of the mathematical variety as was hornblower rather did he rely upon a flair an instinctive system of tactics it was marvellous how often his blind leads found his partners short suit and snatched tricks from the jaws of the inevitable how often he could decide intuitively upon the winning play when confronted by a dilemma there were rare evenings when this faculty would desert him and when he would sit with a rueful smile losing rubber after rubber to the remorseless precision of his daughterinlaw and hornblower but usually his uncanny telepathic powers would carry him triumphantly through to the exasperation of hornblower if they had been opponents and to his intense satisfaction if they had been partners exasperation at the failure of his painstaking calculations or satisfaction of their complete vindication the vicomtesse was a good welltaught player of no brilliance whose interest in the game hornblower suspected was entirely due to her devotion to her fatherinlaw it was bush to whom these evenings of whist were a genuine penance he disliked card games of any sort even the humble vingtetun and in the supreme refinement of whist he was hopelessly at a loss hornblower had cured him of some of his worst habits of asking for instance what are trumps halfway through every hand had insisted on his counting the cards as they fell on his learning the conventional leads and discards and by so doing had made of him a player whose presence three good players could just tolerate rather than miss their evenings amusement but the evenings to him were periods of agonized hardbreathing concentration of flustered mistakes and shamefaced apology misery made no less acute by the fact that conversation was carried on in french in which he could never acquire any facility bush mentally classed together french whist and spherical trigonometry as subjects in which he was too old ever to make any further progress and which he would be content if he were allowed to leave entirely to his admired captain for hornblowers french was improving rapidly thanks to the need for continual use of the language his defective ear would never allow him to catch the trick of the accent he would always speak with the tonelessness of the foreigner but his vocabulary was widening and his grammar growing more certain and he was acquiring a fluency in the idiom which more than once earned him a pretty compliment from his host hornblowers pride was held in check by the astonishing fact that below stairs brown was rapidly acquiring the same fluency he was living largely with french people too with felix and his wife the housekeeper and their daughter louise the maid and living over the stables across the yard the family of bertrand who was felixs brother and incidentally the coachman bertrands wife was the cook with two daughters to help her in the kitchen while one of her young sons was footman under felix and the other two worked in the stables under their father hornblower had once ventured to hint to the count that the presence of himself and the others might well be betrayed to the authorities by one of all these servants but the count merely shook his head with a serene confidence that could not be shaken they will not betray me he said and so intense was his conviction on the point that it carried conviction to hornblower and the better he came to know the count the more obvious it became that no one who knew him well would ever betray him and the count added with a wry smile you must remember too captain that here i am the authorities hornblower could allow his mind to subside into security and sloth again after that a sense of security with a fantastic quality about it that savoured of a nightmare it was unreal to be mewed for so long within four walls deprived of the wide horizons and the endless variety of the sea he could spend his mornings tramping up and down the stable yard as though it were a quarterdeck and as though bertrand and his sons chattering about their duties were a ships crew engaged on their mornings deckwashing the smell of the stables and the land winds which came in over the high walls were a poor substitute for the keen freshness of the sea he spent hours in a turret window of the house with a spyglass which the count found for him gazing round the countryside the desolate vineyards in their winter solitude the distant towers of nevers the ornate cathedral tower and the graceful turrets of the gonzaga palace the rushing black river its willows half submerged the ice which came in january and the snow which three times covered the blank slopes that winter were welcome variations of the monotonous landscape there were the distant hills and the nearby slopes the trace of the valley of the loire winding off into the unknown and of the valley of the allier coming down to meet it to a landmans eye the prospect from the turret window would have been delightful even perhaps in the lashing rain that fell so often but to a seaman and a prisoner it was revolting the indefinable charm of the sea was wanting and so were the mystery and magic and freedom of the sea bush and brown noting the black bad temper in which hornblower descended from the turret window after a sitting with his spyglass wondered why he spent his time in that fashion he wondered why himself but weakly he could not stop himself from doing so specially marked was his bad temper when the count and his daughterinlaw went out riding returning flushed and healthy and happy after some brisk miles of the freedom for which he craved he was stupidly jealous he told himself angrily but he was jealous all the same he was even jealous of the pleasure bush and brown took in the building of the new boat he was not a man of his hands and once the design of the boat had been agreed upon its fifteen feet of length and four feet of beam and its flat bottom he could contribute nothing towards the work except unskilled labour his subordinates were far more expert with tools than he was with plane and saw and drill and characteristically found immense pleasure in working with them bushs childish delight in finding his hands softened by a long period of convalescence forming their distinguishing callouses again irritated him he envied them the simple creative pleasure which they found in watching the boat grow under their hands in the empty loft which they had adopted as a workshop more still he envied brown the accuracy of eye he displayed working with a spokeshave shaping the sculls without any of the apparatus of templates and models and stretched strings which hornblower would have found necessary they were black days all that winter of confinement january came and with it the date when his child would be born he was half mad with the uncertainty of it all with his worry about maria and the child with the thought that barbara would think him dead and would forget him even the counts sweetness of temper and unvarying courtesy irritated him as soon as it began to cloy he felt he would give a year of his life to hear him make a tart rejoinder to one of bushs clumsy speeches the impulse to be rude to the count to fire up into a quarrel with him even though or perhaps because he owed him his life was sometimes almost irresistible and the effort of selfcontrol tried his temper still further he was surfeited with the counts unwearying goodness even with the odd way in which their thoughts ran so frequently together it was queer even uncanny to see in the count so often what seemed like reflections of himself in a mirror it was madder still to remember that he had felt similar ties of sympathy sometimes with the wickedest man he had ever known with el supremo in central america el supremo had died for his crime on a scaffold at panama hornblower was worried by the thought that the count was risking the guillotine at paris for his friends sake it was mad to imagine any parallelism between the careers of el supremo and the count but hornblower was in a mad mood he was thinking too much and he had too little to do and his overactive brain was racketing itself to pieces there was insanity in indulging in ridiculous mystic speculations about spiritual relationships between himself and the count and el supremo and he knew it only selfcontrol and patience were necessary he told himself to come safely through these last few weeks of waiting but his patience seemed to be coming to an end and he was so weary of exerting selfcontrol it was the flesh that saved him when his spirit grew weak one afternoon descending from a long and maddening sitting with his telescope in the turret he met the vicomtesse in the upper gallery she was at her boudoir door about to enter and she turned and smiled at him as he approached his head was whirling somehow his exasperation and feverishness drove him into holding out both his hands to her risking a rebuff risking everything in his longing for some kind of comfort something to ease this unbearable strain she put her hands in his smiling still and at the touch selfpossession broke down it was madness to yield to the torrent of impulses let loose but madness was somehow sweet they were inside the room now and the door was closed there was sweet healthy satisfying flesh in his arms there were no doubts nor uncertainties no mystic speculations now blind instinct could take charge all the bodily urges of months of celibacy her lips were ripe and rich and ready the breasts which he crushed against him were hillocks of sweetness in his nostrils was the faint intoxicating scent of womanhood beyond the boudoir was the bedroom they were there now and she was yielding to him just as another man might have given way to drink might have stupefied his brain in beastly intoxication so hornblower numbed his own brain with lust and passion he forgot everything and he cared for nothing in this mad lapse from selfcontrol and she understood his motives which was strange and she did not resent them which was stranger still as his passion ebbed away he could see her face again clearly and her expression was tender and detached and almost maternal she was aware of his unhappiness as she had been aware of his lust for that splendid body of hers she had given him her body because of his crying need for it as she might have given a cup of water to a man dying of thirst now she held his head to her breast and stroked his hair rocking a little as though he were a child and murmuring little soothing words to him a tear fell from her eye on to hornblowers temple she had come to love this englishman but she knew only too well that it was not love which had brought him into her arms she knew of the wife and child in england she guessed at the existence of the other woman whom he loved it was not the thought of them which brought the tears to her eyes it was the knowledge that she was not any part of his real life that this stay of his on the banks of the loire was as unreal to him as a dream something to be endured until he could escape again to the sea into the mad world which to him was sanity where every day he would encounter peril and discomfort these kisses he was giving her meant nothing to him compared with the business of life which was war the same war which had killed her young husband the wasteful prodigal beastly business which had peopled europe with widows and disfigured it with wasted fields and burned villages he was kissing her as a man might pat his dogs head during an exciting business deal then hornblower lifted his face to hers again and read the tragedy in her eyes the sight of her tears moved him inexpressibly he stroked her cheek oh my dear he said in english and then began to try to find french words to express what he wanted to say tenderness was welling up within him in a blinding moment of relevation he realized the love she bore him and the motives which had brought her submissively into his arms he kissed her mouth he brushed away the splendid red hair from her pleading eyes tenderness reawoke passion and under his caresses her last reserve broke down i love you she sighed her arms about him she had not meant to admit it either to him or to herself she knew that if she gave herself to him with passion he would break her heart in the end and that he did not love her not even now when tenderness had replaced the blind lust in his eyes he would break her heart if she allowed herself to love him for one more second she had that clairvoyance before she let herself sink into the selfdeception which she knew in the future she would not believe to be selfdeception but the temptation to deceive herself into thinking he loved her was overwhelming she gave herself to him passionately chapter ten the affair thus consummated seemed to hornblowers mind at least to clear the air like a thunderstorm he had something more definite to think about now than mystic speculations there was maries loving kindness to soothe him and for counterirritant there was the pricking of his conscience regarding his seduction of his hosts daughterinlaw under his hosts roof his uneasiness lest the counts telepathic powers should enable him to guess at the secret he shared with marie the fear lest someone should intercept a glance or correctly interpret a gesture kept his mind healthily active and the loveaffair while it ran its course brought with it a queer unexpected happiness marie was everything hornblower could desire as a mistress by marriage she was of a family noble enough to satisfy his liking for lords and yet the knowledge that she was of peasant birth saved him from feeling any awe on that account she could be tender and passionate protective and yielding practical and romantic and she loved him so dearly while at the same time she remained reconciled to his approaching departure and resolute to help it on in every way that his heart softened towards her more and more with the passage of the days that departure suddenly became a much nearer and more likely possibility by coincidence it seemed to come up over the horizon from the hopedfor into the expected only a day or two after hornblowers meeting with marie in the upper gallery the boat was finished and lay painted and equipped in the loft ready for them to use brown kept it filled with water from the well and proudly announced that it did not leak a drop the plans for their journey to the sea were taking definite shape fat jeanne the cook baked biscuit for them hornblower came triumphantly into his own then as the only person in the house who knew how ships biscuit should be baked and jeanne worked under his supervision anxious debate between him and the count had ended in his deciding against running the risk of buying food while on their way unless compelled the fifty pounds of biscuit which jeanne baked for them would provide the three of them with a pound of bread each day for seventeen days and there was a sack of potatoes waiting for them and another of dried peas and there were long thin arles sausages as dry as sticks and to hornblowers mind not much more digestible but with the merit of staying eatable for long periods and some of the dry cod which hornblower had come to know during his captivity at ferrol and a corner of bacon taken all in all as hornblower pointed out to the count who was inclined to demur they were going to fare better on their voyage down the loire than they had often fared in the ships of his majesty king george hornblower accustomed for so long to sea voyages never ceased to marvel at the simplicity of planning a river trip thanks to the easy solution of the problem of water supply overside they would have unlimited fresh water for drinking and washing and bathing much better water too as he told the count again than the stinking green stuff alive with animalculae doled out at the rate of four pints a head a day with which people in ships had to be content he could anticipate no trouble until they neared the sea it was only with their entry into tidal waters that they would be in any danger he knew how the french coast swarmed with garrisons and customs officers as a lieutenant under pellew he had once landed a spy in the salt marshes of bourgneuf and it would be under their noses that they would have to steal a fishing boat and make their way to sea thanks to the continental system and the fear of english descents and precautions against espionage tidal waters would be watched closely indeed but he felt he could only trust to fortune it was hard to make plans against contingencies which might take any shape whatever and besides those dangers were weeks away and hornblowers newly contented mind was actually too lazy to devote much thought to them and as he grew fonder of marie too it grew harder to make plans which would take him away from her his attachment for her was growing even as strong as that it was left to the count to make the most helpful suggestion of all if you would permit me he said one evening i would like to tell you of an idea i have for simplifying your passage through nantes it would give me pleasure to hear it sir said hornblower the counts longwinded politeness was infectious please do not think said the count that i wish to interfere in any way in the plans you are making but it occurred to me that your stay on the coast might be made safer if you assumed the role of a high official of the customs service i think it would sir said hornblower patiently but i do not understand how i could do it you would have to announce yourself if necessary as a dutchman said the count now that holland is annexed to france and king louis bonaparte has fled it is to be presumed that his employes will join the imperial service i think it is extremely likely that say a colonel of dutch douaniers should visit nantes to learn how to perform his duties especially as it was over the enforcement of customs regulations that bonaparte and his brother fell out your very excellent french would be just what might be expected of a dutch customs officer even though please pardon my frankness you do not speak quite like a native frenchman but but stammered hornblower it really seemed to him that the counts customary good sense had deserted him it would be difficult sir difficult smiled the count it might be dangerous but if you will forgive my contradicting you so directly it would hardly be difficult in your english democracy you perhaps have had no opportunity of seeing how much weight an assured manner and a uniform carry with them in a country like this which has already made the easy descent from an autocracy to a bureaucracy a colonel of douaniers on the coast can go anywhere command anything he never has to account for himself his uniform does that for him but i have no uniform sir said hornblower and before the words were out of his mouth he guessed what the count was going to say we have half a dozen needlewomen in the house smiled the count from marie here to little christine the cooks daughter it would be odd if between them they could not make uniforms for you and your assistants i might add that mr bushs wound which we all so much deplore will be an actual advantage if you adopt the scheme it is exactly consonant with bonapartes methods to provide for an officer wounded in his service by giving him a position in the customs mr bushs presence with you would add a touch of shall we say realism to the effect produced by your appearance the count gave a little bow to bush in apology for thus alluding to bushs crippled condition and bush returned it awkwardly from his chair in bland ignorance of at least two thirds of what had been said the value of the suggestion was obvious to hornblower at once and for days afterwards the women in the house were at work cutting and stitching and fitting until the evening came when the three of them paraded before the count in their neat coats of blue piped with white and red and their rakish kpis it was the making of these which had taxed maries ingenuity most for the kpi was still at that time an unusual headdress in the french government services on hornblowers collar glittered the eightpointed stars of colonels rank and the top of his kpi bore the goldlace rosette as the three of them rotated solemnly before the count the latter nodded approvingly excellent he said and then hesitated there is only one addition which i can think of to add realism excuse me a moment he went off to his study leaving the others looking at each other but he was back directly with a little leather case in his hand which he proceeded to open resting on the silk was a glittering cross of white enamel surmounted by a golden crown and with a gold medallion in the centre we must pin this on you he said no one reaches colonels rank without the legion of honour father said marie it was rare that she used the familiar mode of address with him that was louismaries i know my dear i know but it may make the difference between captain hornblowers success or or failure his hands trembled a little nevertheless as he pinned the scarlet ribbon to hornblowers coat sir sir it is too good of you protested hornblower the counts long mobile face as he stood up was sad but in a moment he had twisted it into his usual wry smile bonaparte sent it to me he said after after my sons death in spain it was a posthumous award to me of course it is nothing the trinkets of the tyrant can never mean anything to a knight of the holy ghost but because of its sentimental value i should be grateful if you would endeavour to preserve it unharmed and return it to me when the war is over i cannot accept it sir said hornblower bending to unpin it again but the count checked him please captain he said wear it as a favour to me it would please me if you would more than ever after his reluctant acceptance did hornblowers conscience prick him at the thought that he had seduced this mans daughterinlaw while enjoying his hospitality and later in the evening when he found himself alone with the count in the drawing room the conversation deepened his sense of guilt now that your stay is drawing to an end captain said the count i know how much i shall miss your presence after you have gone your company has given me the very greatest pleasure i do not think it can compare with the gratitude i feel towards you sir said hornblower the count waved aside the thanks which hornblower was endeavouring awkwardly to phrase a little while ago we mentioned the end of the war perhaps there will come an end some day and although i am an old man perhaps i shall live to see it will you remember me then and this little house beside the loire of course sir protested hornblower i could never forget he looked round the familiar drawing room at the silver candelabra the oldfashioned louis seize furniture the lean figure of the count in his blue dresscoat i could never forget you sir repeated hornblower my three sons were all young when they died said the count they were only boys and perhaps they would not have grown into men i could have been proud of and already when they went off to serve bonaparte they looked upon me as an oldfashioned reactionary for whose views they had only the smallest patience that was only to be expected if they had lived through the wars we might have become better friends later but they did not and i am the last ladon i am a lonely man captain lonely under this present regime and yet i fear that when bonaparte falls and the reactionaries return to power i shall be as lonely still but i have not been lonely this winter captain hornblowers heart went out to the lean old man with the lined face sitting opposite him in the uncomfortable armchair but that is enough about myself captain went on the count i wanted to tell you of the news which has come through it is all of it important the salute which we heard fired yesterday was as we thought in honour of the birth of an heir to bonaparte there is now a king of rome as bonaparte calls him to sustain the imperial throne whether it will be any support i am doubtful there are many bonapartists who will not i fancy be too pleased at the thought of the retention of power indefinitely in a bonaparte dynasty and the fall of holland is undoubted there was actual fighting between the troops of louis bonaparte and those of napoleon bonaparte over the question of customs enforcement france now extends to the baltic hamburg and lubeck are french towns like amsterdam and leghorn and trieste hornblower thought of the cartoons in the english newspapers which had so often compared bonaparte with the frog who tried to blow himself up as big as an ox i fancy it is symptomatic of weakness said the count perhaps you do not agree with me you do i am glad to have my suspicions confirmed more than that there is going to be war with russia already troops are being transferred to the east and the details of a new conscription were published at the same time as the proclamation of a king of rome there will be more refractories than ever hiding about the country now perhaps bonaparte will find he has undertaken a task beyond his strength when he comes to grips with russia perhaps so said hornblower he had not a high opinion of russian military virtues but there is more important news still said the count there has at last been published a bulletin of the army of portugal it was dated from almeida it took a second or two for hornblower to grasp the significance of this comment and it only dawned upon him gradually along with the endless implications it means said the count that your wellington has beaten bonapartes massna that the attempt to conquer portugal has failed and that the whole of the affairs of spain are thrown into flux again a running sore has been opened in the side of bonapartes empire which may drain him of his strength at what cost to poor france one can hardly imagine but of course captain you can form a more reliable opinion of the military situation than i can and i have been presumptuous in commenting on it yet you have not the facilities which i have of gauging the moral effect of this news wellington has beaten junot and victor and soult now he has beaten massna the greatest of them all there is only one man now against whom european opinion can measure him and that is bonaparte it is not well for a tyrant to have rivals in prestige last year how many years of power would one have given bonaparte if asked twenty i think so now in we change our minds ten years we think in we may revise our estimate again and say five i myself do not believe the empire as we know it will endure after empires collapse at a rate increasing in geometrical progression and it will be your wellington who will pull this one down i hope sincerely you are right sir said hornblower the count was not to know how disturbing this mention of wellington was to his audience he could not guess that hornblower was daily tormented by speculations as to whether wellingtons sister was widowed or not whether lady barbara leighton ne wellesley ever had a thought to devote to the naval captain who had been reported dead her brothers triumphs might well occupy her mind to the exclusion of everything else and hornblower feared that when at last he should reach england she would be far too great a lady to pay him any attention at all the thought irked him he went to bed in a peculiarly sober mood his mind busy with problems of the most varying nature from speculations about the approaching fall of the french empire to calculations regarding the voyage down the loire which he was about to attempt lying awake long after midnight he heard his bedroom door quietly open and close he lay rigid instantly conscious of a feeling of faint distaste at this reminder of the intrigue which he was conducting under a hospitable roof very gently the curtains of his bed were drawn open and in the darkness he could see through half opened eyes a shadowy ghost bending over him a gentle hand found his cheek and stroked it he could no longer sham sleep and he pretended to wake with a start it is marie oratio said a voice softly yes said hornblower he did not know what he should say or do for that matter he did not know what he wanted mostly he was conscious of maries imprudence in thus coming to his room risking discovery and imperilling everything he shut his eyes as though still sleepy to gain time for consideration the hand ceased to stroke his cheek hornblower waited for a second or two more and was astonished to hear the slight click of the latch of the door again he sat up with a jerk marie had gone as silently as she had come hornblower continued to sit up puzzling over the incident but he could make nothing of it certainly he was not going to run any risks by going to seek marie in her room and asking for explanations he lay down again to think about it and this time with its usual capriciousness sleep surprised him in the midst of his speculations and he slept soundly until brown brought him his breakfast coffee it took him half the morning to nerve himself for what he foresaw to be a very uncomfortable interview it was only then that he tore himself away from a last inspection of the boat in bushs and browns company and climbed the stairs to maries boudoir and tapped at the door he entered when she called and stood there in the room of so many memories the golden chairs with their oval backs upholstered in pink and white the windows looking out on the sunlit loire and marie in the windowseat with her needlework i wanted to say good morning he said at length as marie did nothing to help him out good morning said marie she bent her head over her needlework the sunshine through the windows lit her hair gloriously and spoke with her face concealed we only have to say good morning today and tomorrow we shall say goodbye yes said hornblower stupidly if you loved me said marie it would be terrible for me to have you go and to know that for years we should not meet again perhaps for ever but as you do not then i am glad that you are going back to your wife and your child and your ships and your fighting that is what you wanted and i am pleased that you should have it all thank you said hornblower still she did not look up you are the sort of man she went on whom women love very easily i do not expect that i shall be the last i dont think that you will ever love anybody or know what it is to do so hornblower could have said nothing in english in reply to these two astonishing statements and in french he was perfectly helpless he could only stammer goodbye said marie goodbye madame said hornblower lamely his cheeks were burning as he came out into the upper hall in a condition of mental distress in which humiliation only played a minor part he was thoroughly conscious of having acted despicably and of having been dismissed without dignity but he was puzzled by the other remarks marie had made it had never occurred to him that women loved him easily maria it was odd that similarity of names maria and marie loved him he knew he had found it a little tiresome and disturbing barbara had offered herself to him but he had never ventured to believe that she had loved him and had she not married someone else and marie loved him hornblower remembered guiltily an incident of a few days ago when marie in his arms had whispered hotly tell me you love me and he had answered with facile kindness i love you dear then i am happy answered marie perhaps it was a good thing that marie knew now that he was lying and had made easy his retreat another woman with a word might have sent him and bush to prison and death there were women capable of it and this question of his never loving anyone surely marie was wrong about that she did not know the miseries of longing he had been through on barbaras account how much he had desired her and how much he still desired her he hesitated guiltily here wondering whether his desire would survive gratification that was such an uncomfortable thought that he swerved away from it in a kind of panic if marie had merely revengefully desired to disturb him she certainly had achieved her object and if on the other hand she had wanted to win him back to her she was not far from success either what with the torments of remorse and his sudden uneasiness about himself hornblower would have returned to her if she had lifted a finger to him but she did not at dinner that evening she appeared young and lighthearted her eyes sparkling and her expression animated and when the count lifted his glass for the toast of a prosperous voyage home she joined in with every appearance of enthusiasm hornblower was glum beneath his forced gaiety only now with the prospect of an immediate move ahead of him had he become aware that there were decided arguments in favour of the limbo of suspended animation in which he had spent the past months tomorrow he was going to leave all this certainty and safety and indifferent negativeness there was physical danger ahead of him that he could face calmly and with no more than a tightening of the throat but besides that there was the resolution of all the doubts and uncertainties which had so troubled him hornblower was suddenly aware that he did not so urgently desire his uncertainties to be resolved at present he could still hope if leighton were to declare that hornblower had fought at rosas contrary to the spirit of his orders if the court martial were to decide that the sutherland had not been fought to the last gasp and courts martial were chancy affairs if if if and there was maria with her cloying sweetness awaiting him and the misery of longing for lady barbara all in contrast with the smoothness of life here with the counts unruffled politeness and the stimulus of maries healthy animalism hornblower had to force a smile as he lifted his glass chapter eleven the big green loire was shrinking to its summer level hornblower had seen its floods and its ice come and go had seen the willows at its banks almost submerged but now it was back safely in its wide bed with a hint of goldenbrown gravel exposed on either bank the swift green water was clear now instead of turbid and under the blue sky the distant reaches were blue as well in charming colour contrast with the springtime emerald of the valley and the gold of the banks the two sleek dun oxen patient under the yoke had dragged the travoissledge down to the waters edge in the first early light of dawn brown and hornblower walking beside to see that the precious boat balanced on it came to no harm and bush stumping breathlessly behind them the boat slid gently into the water and under bushs supervision the stable hands loaded her with the bags of stores which they had carried down the faint morning mist still lay in the valley and wreathed over the surface of the water awaiting the coming of the sun to drink it up it was the best time for departure the mist would shield them from inquisitive persons who might be unduly curious at the sight of the expedition starting off up at the house farewells had all been said the count as unruffled as ever as though it were usual for him to rise at five in the morning and marie smiling and calm in the stable yard and the kitchen there had been tears all the women had lamented browns going weeping unashamed and yet laughing through their tears as he laughed and joked in the voluble french which he had acquired and as he smacked their broad posteriors hornblower wondered how many of them brown had seduced that winter and how many anglofrench children would be born next autumn as a result remember your promise to return after the war the count had said to hornblower marie will be as delighted to see you as i shall be his smile had conveyed no hint of a hidden meaning but how much did he guess or know hornblower gulped as he remembered shove off he rasped brown take the sculls the boat scraped over the gravel and then floated free as the current took her dancing away from the little group of stable hands and the stolid oxen vague already in the mist the rowlocks creaked and the boat swayed to browns pulls hornblower heard the noises and felt bush seated in the stern beside him but for some seconds he saw nothing there was a mist about him far denser than the reality the one mist cleared with the other as the sun came breaking through warm on hornblowers back high up the bank on the opposite side was the orchard at which hornblower had often gazed from his window it was marvellous now under its load of blossom looking back he saw the chteau shining in the sun the turrets at the corners had been added he knew no more than fifty years ago by a comte de graay with a rococo taste for the antique but they looked genuine enough at a distance it was like a fairy castle in the pearly light a dream castle and already the months he had spent there seemed like a dream too a dream from which he regretted awakening mr bush he said sharply ill trouble you to get out your rod and make an appearance of fishing take a slower stroke brown they went drifting on down the noble river blue in the distance and green overside clear and transparent so that they could actually see the bottom passing away below them it was only a few minutes before they reached the confluence of the allier itself a fine river almost the size of the loire and the united stream was majestically wide a hundred and fifty fathoms at least from bank to bank they were a long musket shot from land but their position was safer even than that implied for from the waters edge on either side stretched an extensive no mans land of sand and willow which the periodic floods kept free from human habitations and which was only likely to be visited by fishermen and laundering housewives the mist had entirely vanished now and the hot sun bore with all the promise of one of those splendid spring days of central france hornblower shifted in his seat to make himself more comfortable the hierarchy of this his new command was topheavy a proportion of one seaman to one lieutenant and one captain was ludicrous he would have to exercise a great deal of tact to keep them all three satisfied to see that brown was not made resentful by having all the work to do and yet that discipline was not endangered by a too democratic division of labour in a fifteen foot boat it would be difficult to keep up the aloof dignity proper to a captain brown he said ive been very satisfied with you so far keep in my good books and ill see youre properly rewarded when we get back to england therell be a warrant for you as masters mate if you want it thank ee sir thank ee very kindly but im happy as i am beggin your pardon sir he meant he was happy in his rating as a coxswain but the tone of his voice implied more than that hornblower looked at him as he sat with his face turned up to the sun pulling slowly at the sculls there was a blissful smile on his face the man was marvellously happy he had been wellfed and wellhoused for months with plenty of womens society with light work and no hardship even now there was a long prospect ahead of him of food better than he had ever known before he entered france of no harder work than a little gentle rowing of no need ever to turn out on a blustering night to reef topsails twenty years of the lower deck in king georges navy hornblower realized must make any man form the habit of living only in the present tomorrow might bring a flogging peril sickness death certainly hardship and probably hunger and all without the opportunity of lifting a finger to ward off any of these for any lifting of a finger would make them all more certain twenty years of being at the mercy of the incalculable and not merely in the major things of life but in the minor ones must make a fatalist of any man who survived them for a moment hornblower felt a little twinge of envy of brown who would never know the misery of helplessness or the indignity of indecision the river channel here was much divided by islands each bordered by a rim of golden gravel it was hornblowers business to select what appeared to be the most navigable channel no easy task shallows appeared mysteriously right in the centre of what had seemed to be the main stream over these the clear green water ran faster and faster and shallower and shallower until the bottom of the boat was grating on the pebbles sometimes the bank would end there with astonishing abruptness so that one moment they were in six inches of rushing water and the next in six feet of transparent green but more than once now they found themselves stuck fast and brown and hornblower trousers rolled to the knee had to get out and haul the boat a hundred yards over a barely covered bank before finding water deep enough hornblower thanked his stars that he had decided on having the boat built flatbottomed a keel would have been a hampering nuisance then they came to a dam like the one which had brought them disaster in the darkness during their first attempt to navigate the river it was half natural half artificial roughly formed of lumps of rock piled across the river bed and over it the river poured in fury at a few points pull over to the bank there brown snapped hornblower as his coxswain looked to him for orders they ran the boat up on to the gravel just above the dam and hornblower stepped out and looked downstream there was a hundred yards of turbulent water below the dam they would have to carry everything down it took three journeys on the part of hornblower and brown to carry all their stores to the point he chose for them to reenter the river bush with his wooden leg could only just manage to stumble over the uneven surface unladen and then they addressed themselves to the business of transporting the boat it was not easy there was a colossal difference between dragging the boat through shallows even an inch deep only and carrying her bodily hornblower contemplated the task glumly for some seconds before plunging at it he stooped and got his hands underneath take the other side brown now lift between them they could just raise it they had hardly staggered a yard with it before all the strength was gone from hornblowers wrists and fingers and the boat slipped to the ground again he avoided browns eye and stooped again exasperated lift he said it was impossible to carry the heavy boat that way he had no sooner lifted it than he was compelled to drop it again its no go sir said brown gently well have to get her upon our backs sir thats the only way hornblower heard the respectful murmur as if from a long distance if you take the bows beggin your pardon sir ill look after the stern here sir lift tother way round hold it sir till i can get aft right sir ready lift they had the boat up on their backs now stooping double under the heavy load hornblower straining under the lighter bows thought of brown carrying the much heavier stern and he set his teeth and vowed to himself that he would not rest until brown asked to within five seconds he was regretting his vow his breath was coming with difficulty and there were stabbing pains in his chest it grew harder and harder to take the trouble to attend to the proper placing of his feet as he stumbled over the uneven surface those months in the chteau de graay had done their work in making him soft and out of condition for the last few yards of the portage he was conscious of nothing save the overwhelming weight on his neck and shoulders and his difficulty of breathing then he heard bushs bluff voice right sir let me get hold sir with the small but welcome help that bush could afford he was able to disengage himself and lower the boat to the ground brown was standing over the stern gasping and sweeping the sweat off his forehead with his forearm hornblower saw him open his mouth to make a remark presumably regarding the weight of the boat and then shut it again when he remembered that now he was under discipline again and must only speak when spoken to and discipline hornblower realized required that he himself should display no sign of weakness before his subordinates it was bad enough that he should have had to receive advice from brown as to how to lift the boat take hold again brown and well get her into the water he said controlling his breathing with a vast effort they slid the boat in and heaved the stores on board again hornblowers head was swimming with the strain he thought longingly of his comfortable seat in the stern and then put the thought from him ill take the sculls brown he said brown opened and shut his mouth again but he could not question explicit orders the boat danced out over the water with hornblower at the sculls happy in the rather baseless conviction that he had demonstrated that a captain in the kings navy was the equal even in physical strength of any mere coxswain however herculean his thews once or twice that day shallows caught them out in midstream which they were unable to pass without lightening the boat to a maximum extent when hornblower and brown ankledeep in rushing water could drag the boat no farther bush had to get out too his wooden leg sinking in the sand despite its broad leather sole and limp downstream to the edge of the shallows and wait until the others dragged the lightened boat up to him once he had to stand holding the bag of bread and the roll of bedding before they could tug the boat over the shallows and on that occasion they had to unstrap his wooden leg help him in and then tug the leg free from the sand so deeply had it sunk there was another portage to be made that day fortunately not nearly such a long one as the first altogether there was quite enough interest in the days journey to keep them from growing bored on that big lonely river it was almost like travelling through an uninhabited country for the greater part of the day there was hardly a soul in sight once they saw a skiff moored to the bank which was obviously used as a ferryboat and once they passed a big wagon ferry a flatbottomed scow which was moored so as to swing itself across the river by the force of the current pendulumfashion on long mooring ropes once they passed a small boat engaged in the task of dredging sand for building purposes from the river bed there were two weatherbeaten men on board hard at work with small hand dredgers on poles which they scraped over the bottom and emptied into the boat it was a nervous moment as they approached them bush and brown with their ornamental fishing rods out hornblower forcing himself to do no more with the sculls than merely keep the boat in midstream he had thought as they drifted down of giving orders to bush and brown regarding the instant silencing of the two men if they appeared suspicious but he checked himself he could rely on their acting promptly without warning and his dignity demanded that he should betray none of the apprehension which he felt but the apprehension was quite baseless there was no curiosity in the glances which the two sand dredgers threw at them and there was cordiality in their smiles and in their polite bonjour messieurs bonjour said hornblower and brown bush had the sense to keep shut the mouth which would instantly have betrayed them and devoted his attention instead to his rod clearly boats with fishing parties on board were just common enough on the loire to escape comment and besides the intrinsic innocence of fishing as a pastime shielded them from suspicion as hornblower and the count had agreed long before and nobody could ever dream that a small boat in the heart of france was manned by escaped prisoners of war the commonest sight of all along the river was the women washing clothes sometimes singly sometimes in little groups whose gossiping chatter floated out to them distinctly over the water the englishmen could hear the clop clop clop of the wooden beaters smacking the wet clothes on the boards and could see the kneeling women sway down and up as they rinsed them in the current most of the women looked up from their work and gave them a glance as they drifted by but it was never more than a long glance and often not as much in time of war and upheaval there were so many possible explanations for the women not to know the occupants of the boat that their inability did not trouble them of the roaring rapids such as had nearly destroyed them once before they saw nothing the junction of the allier and the cessation of the winter floods accounted for that the rockstrewn sand bars represented the sites of winter rapids and were far easier to navigate or rather to circumvent in fact there were no difficulties at all even the weather was benign a lovely clear day of sunshine comfortably warm lighting up the changing panorama of gold and blue and green brown basked in it all unashamedly and the hardbitten bush took his ease whenever the peacefulness of it caught him napping in bushs stern philosophy mankind naval mankind at least was born to sorrow and difficulty and danger and any variation from such a state of affairs must be viewed with suspicion and not enjoyed too much lest it should have to be paid for at compound interest it was too good to be true this delightful drifting down the river as morning wore into noon and noon into prolonged and dreamy afternoon with a delicious lunch to eat of a cold pate and a bottle of wine the little towns or rather villages which they passed were all perched up high on the distant banks beyond the flood limits hornblower who already knew by heart the brief itinerary and table of distances which the count had made out for him was aware that the first town with a bridge was at briare which they could not reach until late evening he had intended to wait above the town until nightfall and then to run through in the darkness but as the day wore on his resolve steadily hardened to push on without waiting he could not analyse his motives he was aware that it was a very remarkable thing for him to do to run into danger even the slightest when urged neither by the call of duty nor the thirst for distinction here the only benefit would be the saving of an hour or twos time the nelsonian tradition to lose not an hour was grained deeply into him but it was hardly that which influenced him partly it was his innate crossgrainedness everything had gone so supremely well their escape from their escort had been almost miraculous the coincidence which had brought them to the chteau de graay where alone in all france they could have found safety was more nearly miraculous still now this voyage down the river bore every promise of easy success his instinctive reaction to all this unnatural prosperity was to put himself into the way of trouble there had been so much trouble in his life that he felt uneasy without it but partly he was being driven by devils he was morose and cantankerous marie was being left behind and he was regretting that more with every yard that divided them he was tormented by the thought of the shameful part he had played and by memories of the hours they had spent together sentimentally he was obsessed with longing for her and ahead of him lay england where they thought him dead where maria would by now have reconciled herself to her loss and would be doubly and painfully happy with him in consequence and where barbara would have forgotten him and where a court martial to inquire into his conduct awaited him he thought grimly that it might be better for everyone if he were dead he shrank a little from the prospect of returning to england as one might shrink from a cold plunge or as he shrank from the imminent prospect of danger that was the ruling motive he had always forced himself to face danger to advance bravely to meet it he had always gulped down any pill which life had presented to him knowing that any hesitation would give him a contempt for himself more bitter still so now he would accept no excuse for delay briare was in sight now down at the end of the long wide reach of the river its church tower was silhouetted against the evening sky and its long straggling bridge stood out black against the distant silver of the water hornblower at the sculls looked over his shoulder and saw all this he was aware of his subordinates eye turned inquiringly upon him take the sculls brown he growled they changed places silently and bush handed over the tiller to him with a puzzled look he had been well aware of the design to run past bridges only at night there were two vast black shapes creeping over the surface of the river down there barges being warped out of the lateral canal on one side and into the canal of briare on the other by way of a channel across the river dredged for the purpose hornblower stared forward as they approached under the impulse of browns steady strokes a quick examination of the water surface told him which arch of the bridge to select and he was able to discern the towropes and warps of the barges there were teams of horses both on the bridge and on the banks silhouetted clearly against the sky as they tugged at the ropes to drag the bulky barges across the rushing current men were looking at them now from the bridge and there was just sufficient gap left between the barges to enable the boat to slip between without the necessity to stop and make explanations pull he said to brown and the boat went careering headlong down the river they slid under the bridge with a rush and neatly rounded the stern of one of the barges the burly old man at the tiller with a little grandchild beside him looked down at them with a dull curiosity as they shot by hornblower waved his hand gaily to the child excitement was a drug which he craved which always sent his spirits high and looked up with a grin at the other men on the bridge and on the banks then they were past and briare was left behind easy enough sir commented bush yes said hornblower if they had been travelling by road they certainly would have been stopped for examination of their passports here on the unnavigable river such a proceeding occurred to no one the sun was low now shining right into his eyes as he looked forward and it would be dark in less than an hour hornblower began to look out for a place where they could be comfortable for the night he allowed one long island to slide past them before he saw the ideal spot a tiny hummock of an island with three willow trees the green of the central part surrounded by a broad belt of golden brown where the receding river had left the gravel exposed well run the boat aground over there brown he announced easy pull starboard pull both easy it was not a very good landing hornblower despite his undoubted ability in handling big ships had much to learn regarding the behaviour of flatbottomed boats amid the shoals of a river there was a black eddy which swung them round the boat had hardly touched bottom before the current had jerked her free again brown tumbling over the bows was nearly waist deep in water and had to grab the painter and brace himself against the current to check her the tactful silence which ensued could almost be felt while brown tugged the boat up to the gravel again hornblower in the midst of his annoyance was aware of bushs restless movement and thought of how his first lieutenant would have admonished a midshipman guilty of such a careless piece of work it made him grin to think of bush bottling up his feelings and the grin made him forget his annoyance he stepped out into the shallow water and helped brown run the lightened boat farther up the bank checking bush when he made to step out too bush could never accustom himself to seeing his captain at work while he sat idle the water was no more than ankledeep by the time he allowed bush to disembark they dragged the boat up as far as she could go and brown made fast the painter to a peg driven securely into the earth as a precaution in case any unexpected rise in the water level should float the boat off the sun had set now in the flaming west and it was fast growing dark supper said hornblower what shall we have a captain with strict ideas of discipline would merely have announced what they should eat and would certainly not have called his subordinates into consultation but hornblower was too conscious of the topheavy organization of his present ships company to be able to maintain appearances to that extent yet bush and brown were still oppressed by a lifelong experience of subordination and could not bring themselves to proffer advice to their captain they merely fidgeted and stood silent leaving it to hornblower to decree that they should finish off the cold pate with some boiled potatoes once the decision was made bush proceeded to amplify and interpret his captains original order just as a good first lieutenant should ill handle the fire here he said there ought to be all the driftwood we need brown yes an ill want some sheerlegs to hang the pan over the fire cut me three off those trees there bush felt it in his bones that hornblower was meditating taking part in the preparation of supper and could not bear the thought he looked up at his captain half appealingly half defiantly a captain should not merely never be seen doing undignified work but he should be kept in awful isolation screened away in the mysterious recesses of his cabin homblower left them to it and wandered off round the tiny island looking over at the distant banks and the far houses fast disappearing in the growing twilight it was a shock to discover that the pleasant green which carpeted most of the island was not the grass he had assumed it to be but a bank of nettles knee high already despite the earliness of the season judging by his language brown on the other side had just made the same discovery while seeking fuel with his feet bare hornblower paced the gravel bank for a space and on his return it was an idyllic scene which met his eyes brown was tending the little fire which flickered under the pot swinging from its tripod while bush his wooden leg sticking stiffly out in front of him was peeling the last of the potatoes apparently bush had decided that a first lieutenant could share menial work with the sole member of the crew without imperilling discipline they all ate together wordless but friendly beside the dying fire even the chill air of the evening did not cool the feeling of comradeship of which each was conscious in his own particular way shall i set a watch sir asked bush as supper ended no said hornblower the minute additional security which would be conferred by one of them staying awake would not compare with the discomfort and inconvenience of everyone losing four hours sleep each night bush and brown slept in cloak and blanket on the bare soil probably hornblower anticipated most uncomfortably for himself there was a mattress of cut nettles cunningly packed under the boat cover which brown had prepared for him on the most level part of the gravel spit presumably at a grave cost in stings he slept on it peacefully the dew wetting his face and the gibbous moon shining down upon it from the starry sky vaguely he remembered in a troubled fashion the stories of the great leaders of men charles xii especially who shared their mens coarse fare and slept like them on the bare ground for a second or two he feared he should be doing likewise and then his common sense overrode his modesty and told him that he did not need to have recourse to theatrical tricks to win the affections of bush and brown chapter twelve those days on the loire were pleasant and every day was more pleasant than the one preceding for hornblower there was not merely the passive pleasure of a fortnights picnic but there was the far more active one of the comradeliness of it all during his ten years as a captain his natural shyness had reinforced the restrictions surrounding his position and had driven him more and more in upon himself until he had grown unconscious of his aching need for human companionship in that small boat living at close quarters with the others and where one mans misfortune was everyones he came to know happiness his keen insight made him appreciate more than ever the sterling good qualities of bush who was secretly fretting over the loss of his foot and the inactivity to which that loss condemned him and the doubtfulness of his future as a cripple ill see you posted as captain said hornblower on the only occasion on which bush hinted at his troubles if its my last act on earth he thought he might possibly contrive that even if disgrace awaited him personally in england lady barbara must still remember bush and the old days in the lydia and must be aware of his good qualities as hornblower was himself an appeal to her properly worded even from a man broken by court martial might have an effect and might set turning the hidden wheels of government patronage bush deserved post rank more than half the captains he knew on the list then there was brown with his unfailing cheerfulness no one could judge better than hornblower the awkwardness of browns position living in such close proximity to two officers but brown always could find the right mixture of friendliness and deference he could laugh gaily when he slipped on a rounded stone and sat down in the loire and he could smile sympathetically when the same thing happened to hornblower he busied himself over the jobs of work which had to be done and never not even after ten days routine had established something like a custom appeared to take it for granted that his officers would do their share hornblower could foresee a great future for brown if helped by a little judicious exertion of influence he might easily end as a captain too darby and westcott had started on the lower deck in the same fashion even if the court martial broke him hornblower could do something to help him elliott and bolton at least would not desert him entirely and would rate brown as midshipman in their ships if he asked them to with special earnestness in making these plans for the future of his friends hornblower could bring himself to contemplate the end of the voyage and the inevitable court martial with something like equanimity for the rest during those golden days he was able to avoid all thought of their approaching end it was a placid journey through a placid limbo he was leaving behind him in the past the shameful memory of his treatment of marie and the troubles to come were still in the future for once in his life he was able to live in the lotuseating present all the manifold little details of the journey helped towards this desirable end they were so petty and yet temporarily so important selecting a course between the golden sandbanks of the river stepping out overside to haul the boat over when his judgement was incorrect finding a lonely island on which to camp at night and cooking supper when one was found drifting past the gravel dredgers and the rare fishing parties avoiding conspicuous behaviour while passing towns there were always trifles to occupy the mind there were the two nights when it rained and they all slept huddled together under the shelter of a blanket stretched between willow trees there had been a ridiculous pleasure about waking up to find bush snoring beside him with a protective arm across him there was the pageantry of the loire gien with its chteaufortress high on its terraces and sully with its vast rounded bastions and chteauneufsurloire and jargeau then for miles along the river they were in sight of the gaunt square towers of the cathedral of orleans orleans was one of the few towns with an extensive river front past which they had to drift unobtrusively and with special care at its difficult bridges orleans was hardly out of sight before they reached beaugency with its interminable bridges of countless arches and its strange square tower the river was blue and gold and green the rocks above nevers were succeeded by the gravel banks of the middle reaches and now the gravel gave way to sand golden sand amid the shimmering blue of the river whose water was a clear green overside all the contrasted greens delighted hornblowers eyes the green of the neverending willows of the vineyards and the cornfields and the meadows they passed blois its steeplyhumped bridge crowned by the pyramid whose inscription proclaimed the bridge to be the first public work of the infant louis xv and chaumont and amboise their lovely chteaux towering above the river and tours an extensive water front to sidle past here too and langeais the wild desolation of the islandstudded river was punctuated everywhere by towers and chteaux and cathedrals on the distant banks below langeais the big placid vienne entered the river on their left and appeared to convey some of its own qualities to the united stream which was now a little slower and more regular in its course its shallows becoming less and less frequent after saumur and the innumerable islands of les ponts de c the even bigger maine came in on their right and finally deprived the wild river of all the characteristics which had endeared it to them here it was far deeper and far slower and for the first time they found the attempt to make the river available for commercial traffic successful here they had passed numerous traces of wasted work on bonapartes part higher up but below the confluence of the maine the groynes and dykes had withstood the winter floods and the continual erosion had piled up long beaches of golden sand on either bank and had left in the centre a deep channel navigable to barges they passed several working their way up to angers from nantes mostly they were being towed by teams of mules but one or two were taking advantage of a westerly wind to make the ascent under vast gaffmainsails hornblower stared hungrily at them for they were the first sails he had seen for months but he put aside all thought of stealing one a glance at their clumsy lines assured him that it would be more dangerous to put to sea even for a short distance in one of those than in the cockleshell boat they had already that westerly wind that brought the barges up brought something else with it too brown diligently tugging at the sculls as he forced the boat into it suddenly wrinkled his nose begging your pardon sir he said i can smell the sea they sniffed at the breeze all three of them by god youre right brown said bush hornblower said nothing but he had smelt the salt as well and it had brought with it such a wave of mixed feelings as to leave him without words and that night after they had camped there were just as many desolate islands to choose from despite the changes in the river hornblower noticed that the level of the water had risen perceptibly above where it had stood when they beached the boat it was not flood water like the time when after a day of heavy rain their boat had nearly floated during the night on this evening above nantes there had been no rain no sign of it for three days hornblower watched the water creep up at a rate almost perceptible watched it reach a maximum dally there for a space and then begin to sink it was the tide down at paimbuf at the mouth there was a rise and fall of ten or twelve feet at nantes one of four or six up here he was witnessing the last dying effort of the banked up sea to hold the river back in its course there was a strange emotion in the thought they had reached tidewater at last the habitat on which he had spent more than half his life they had travelled from sea to sea from the mediterranean to what was at least technically the atlantic this same tide he was witnessing here washed also the shores of england where were barbara and maria and his unknown child and the lords commissioners of the admiralty but more than that it meant that their pleasant picnic on the loire was over in tidal water they could not hope to move about with half the freedom they had known inland strange faces and new arrivals would be scanned with suspicion and probably the next fortyeight hours or so would determine whether he was to reach england to face a court martial or be recaptured to face a firing squad hornblower knew that moment the old sensation of excitement which he called fear to himself the quickened heart beat the dampening palms the tingling in the calves of his legs he had to brace himself to master these symptoms before returning to the others to tell them of his observations high water half an hour back sir repeated bush in reply yes mm said bush brown said nothing as accorded with his position in life but his face bore momentarily the same expression of deep cogitation they were both assimilating the fact in the manner of seamen hornblower knew that from now on with perhaps a glance at the sun but not necessarily with a glance at the river they would be able to tell offhand the state of the tide producing the information without a thought by the aid of a subconscious calculating ability developed during a lifetime at sea he could do the same himself the only difference between them was that he was interested in the phenomenon while they were indifferent to it or unaware of it chapter thirteen for their entrance into nantes hornblower decided that they must wear their uniforms as officials of the customs service it called for long and anxious thought to reach this decision a desperately keen balancing of chances if they arrived in civilian clothes they would almost certainly be questioned and in that case it would be almost impossible to explain their lack of papers and passports whereas in uniform they might easily not be questioned at all and if they were a haughty demeanour might still save them but to pose as a colonel of douaniers would call for histrionic ability on the part of hornblower and he mistrusted himself not his ability but his nerve with remorseless selfanalysis he told himself that he had played a part for years posing as a man of rigid imperturbability when he was nothing of the kind and he asked himself why he could not pose for a few minutes as a man of swaggering and overbearing haughtiness even under the additional handicap of having to speak french in the end it was in despite of his doubts that he reached his decision and put on the neat uniform and pinned the glittering legion of honour on his breast as always it was the first moment of departure which tried him most getting into the sternsheets of the boat and taking the tiller while brown got out the sculls the tension under which he laboured was such that he knew that if he allowed it the hand that rested on the tiller would tremble and the voice which gave the orders to brown would quaver so he carried himself with the unbending rigidity which men were accustomed to see in him and he spoke with the insensitive harshness he always used in action under the impulse of browns sculls the river glided away behind them and the city of nantes came steadily nearer houses grew thicker and thicker on the banks and then the river began to break up into several arms to hornblower the main channel between the islands was made obvious by the indications of traces of commercial activity along the banks traces of the past largely for nantes was a dying town dying of the slow strangulation of the british blockade the lounging idlers along the quays the deserted warehouses all indicated the dire effects of war upon french commerce they passed under a couple of bridges with the tide running strongly and left the huge mass of the ducal chteau to starboard hornblower forced himself to sit with careless ease in the boat as though neither courting nor avoiding observation the legion of honour clinked as it swung upon his breast a side glance at bush suddenly gave him enormous comfort and reassurance for bush was sitting with a masklike immobility of countenance which told hornblower that he was nervous too bush could go into action and face an enemys broadside with an honest indifference to danger but this present situation was trying his nerves severely sitting watched by a thousand french eyes and having to rely upon mere inactivity to save himself from death or imprisonment the sight was like a tonic to hornblower his cares dropped from him and he knew the joy and thrill of reckless bravery beyond the next bridge the maritime port began here first were the fishing boats hornblower looked keenly at them for he had in mind to steal one of them his experience under pellew in the blockading squadron years ago was serving him in good stead now for he knew the ways of those fishing boats they were accustomed to ply their trade among the islands of the breton coast catching the pilchards which the french persisted in calling sardines and bringing their catch up the estuary to sell in the market at nantes he and bush and brown between them could handle one of those boats with ease and they were seaworthy enough to take them safely out to the blockading squadron or to england if necessary he was practically certain that he would decide upon such a plan so that as they rowed by he sharply ordered brown to pull more slowly and he turned all his attention upon them below the fishing boats two american ships were lying against the quay the stars and stripes fluttering jauntily in the gentle wind his attention was caught by a dreary clanking of chains the ships were being emptied of their cargoes by gangs of prisoners each man staggering bent double under a bag of grain that was interesting hornblower looked again the chain gangs were under the charge of soldiers hornblower could see the shakos and the flash of the musket barrels which gave him an insight into who the poor devils might be they were military criminals deserters men caught sleeping at their posts men who had disobeyed an order all the unfortunates of the armies bonaparte maintained in every corner of europe their sentences condemned them to the galleys and as the french navy no longer used galleys in which they could be forced to tug at the oars they were now employed in all the hard labour of the ports twice as lieutenant in pellews indefatigable hornblower had seen picked up small parties of desperate men who had escaped from nantes in much the same fashion as he himself proposed now to do and then against the quay below the american ships they saw something else something which caused them to stiffen in their seats the tricolour here was hoisted above a tattered blue ensign flaunting a petty triumph witch of endor tengun cutter said bush hoarsely a french frigate caught her on a lee shore off noirmoutier last year by god isnt it what youd expect of the french its eleven months ago and theyre still wearing french colours over british she was a lovely little ship even from where they were they could see the perfection of her lines speed and seaworthiness were written all over her the frogs dont seem to have oversparred her the way youd expect em to commented bush she was ready for sea and their expert eyes could estimate the area of the furled mainsail and jib the high graceful mast nodded to them almost imperceptibly as the cutter rocked minutely beside the quay it was as if a prisoner were appealing to them for aid and the flapping colours tricolour over blue ensign told a tragic story in a sudden rush of impulse hornblower put the helm over lay us alongside the quay he said to brown a few strokes took them there the tide had turned some time ago and they headed against the flood brown caught a ring and made the painter fast and first hornblower nimbly and then bush with difficulty mounted the stone steps to the top of the quay suiveznous said hornblower to brown remembering at the last moment to speak french hornblower forced himself to hold up his head and walk with a swagger the pistols in his side pockets bumped reassuringly against his hips and his sword tapped against his thigh bush walked beside him his wooden leg thumping with measured stride on the stone quay a passing group of soldiers saluted the smart uniform and hornblower returned the salute nonchalantly amazed at his new coolness his heart was beating fast but ecstatically he knew he was not afraid it was worth running this risk to experience this feeling of mad bravery they stopped and looked at the witch of endor against the quay her decks were not of the dazzling whiteness upon which an english first lieutenant would have insisted and there was a slovenliness about her standing rigging which was heartbreaking to contemplate a couple of men were moving lackadaisically about the deck under the supervision of a third anchor watch muttered bush two hands and a masters mate he spoke without moving his lips like a naughty boy in school lest some onlooker should read his words and realize that he was not speaking french everyone else on shore the lubbers went on bush hornblower stood on the quay the tiny breeze blowing round his ears soldiers and sailors and civilians walking by the bustle of the unloading of the american ships noisy in the distance bushs thoughts were following on the heels of his own bush was aware of the temptation hornblower was feeling to steal the witch of endor and to sail her to england bush would never have thought of it himself but years of service under his captain made him receptive of ideas however fantastic fantastic was the right word those big cutters carried a crew of sixty men and the gear and tackle were planned accordingly three men one a cripple could not even hope to be able to hoist the big mainsail although it was just possible that the three of them might handle her under sail in the open sea in fair weather it was that possibility which had given rise to the train of thought but on the other hand there was all the tricky estuary of the loire between them and the sea and the french hornblower knew had removed the buoys and navigation marks for fear of an english raid unpiloted they could never hope to find their way through thirtyfive miles of shoals without going aground and besides there were batteries at paimbuf and saint nazaire to prohibit unauthorized entrance and exit the thing was impossible it was sheer sentimentality to think of it he told himself suddenly selfcritical again for a moment he turned away and strolled up towards the american ships and watched with interest the wretched chain gangs staggering along the gang planks with their loads of grain the sight of their misery sickened him so did the bullying sergeants who strutted about in charge of them here if anywhere he told himself was to be found the nucleus of that rising against bonaparte which everyone was expecting all that was needed was a desperate leader that would be something worth reporting to the government when he reached home farther down the river yet another ship was coming up to the port her topsails black against the setting sun as with the flood behind her she held her course close hauled to the faint southerly breeze she was flying the stars and stripes american again hornblower experienced the same feeling of exasperated impotence which he had known in the old days of his service under pellew what was the use of blockading a coast and enduring all the hardships and perils of that service if neutral vessels could sail in and out with impunity their cargoes of wheat were officially noncontraband but wheat was of as vital importance to bonaparte as ever was hemp or pitch or any other item on the contraband list the more wheat he could import the more men he could draft into his armies hornblower found himself drifting into the eternal debate as to whether america when eventually she became weary of the indignities of neutrality would turn her arms against england or france she had actually been at war with france for a short time already and it was much to her interest to help pull down the imperial despotism but it was doubtful whether she would be able to resist the temptation to twist the british lions tail the new arrival smartly enough handled was edging in now to the quay a backed topsail took the way off her and the warps creaked round the bollards hornblower watched idly bush and brown beside him as the ship was made fast a gang plank was thrown to the quay and a little stout man made ready to walk down it from the ship he was in civilian clothes and he had a rosy round face with a ridiculous little black moustache with upturned ends from his manner of shaking hands with the captain and from the very broken english which he was speaking hornblower guessed him to be the pilot the pilot in that moment a surge of ideas boiled up in hornblowers mind it would be dark in less than an hour with the moon in its first quarter already he could see it just visible in the sky high over the setting sun a clear night the tide about to ebb a gentle breeze southerly with a touch of east a pilot available on the one hand a crew on the other then he hesitated the whole scheme was rash to the point of madness beyond that point it must be illdigested unsound his mind raced madly through the scheme again but even as it did so he was carried away by the wave of recklessness there was an intoxication about throwing caution to the winds which he had forgotten since his boyhood in the tense seconds which were all he had while the pilot was descending the gang plank and approaching them along the quay he had formed his resolution he nudged his two companions and then stepped forward and intercepted the fat little pilot as he walked briskly past them monsieur he said i have some questions to ask you will you kindly accompany me to my ship for a moment the pilot noted the uniform the star of the legion of honour the assured manner why certainly he said his conscience was clear he was guilty of no more than venal infringements of the continental system he turned and trotted alongside hornblower you are a newcomer to this port colonel i fancy i was transferred here yesterday from amsterdam answered hornblower shortly brown was striding along at the pilots other elbow bush was bringing up the rear gallantly trying to keep pace with them his wooden leg thumping the pavement they came up to the witch of endor and made their way up her gang plank to her deck the officer there looked at them with a little surprise but he knew the pilot and he knew the customs uniform i want to examine one of your charts if you please said hornblower will you show us the way to the cabin the mate had not a suspicion in the world he signed to his men to go on with their work and led the way down the brief companion to the after cabin the mate entered and politely hornblower thrust the pilot in next before him it was a tiny cabin but there was sufficient room to be safe when they were at the farther end he stood by the door and brought out his two pistols if you make a sound he said and excitement rippled his lips into a snarl i will kill you they simply stood and stared at him but at last the pilot opened his mouth to speak speech was irrepressible with him silence snapped hornblower he moved far enough into the room to allow brown and bush to enter after him tie em up he ordered belts and handkerchiefs and scarves did the work efficiently enough soon the two men were gagged and helpless their hands tied behind them under the table with em said hornblower now be ready for the two hands when i bring em down he ran up on deck here you two he snapped ive some questions to ask you come down with me they put down their work and followed him meekly to the cabin where hornblowers pistols frightened them into silence brown ran on deck for generous supply of line with which to bind them and to make the lashings of the other two more secure yet then he and bush neither of them had spoken as yet since the adventure began looked to him for further orders watch em said hornblower ill be back in five minutes with a crew therell be one more man at least to make fast he went up to the quay again and along to where the gangs of galley slaves were assembling weary after their days work of unloading the ten chained men under the sergeant whom he addressed looked at him with lacklustre eyes only wondering faintly what fresh misery this spruce colonel was bringing them sergeant he said bring your party down to my ship there is work for them there yes colonel said the sergeant he rasped an order at the weary men and they followed hornblower down the quay their bare feet made no sound but the chain which ran from waist to waist clashed rhythmically with their stride bring them down on to the deck said hornblower now come down into the cabin for your orders it was all so easy thanks to that uniform and star hornblower had to try hard not to laugh at the sergeants bewilderment as they disarmed him and tied him up it took no more than a significant gesture with hornblowers pistol to make the sergeant indicate in which pocket was the key of the prisoners chain ill have these men laid out under the table if you please mr bush said hornblower all except the pilot i want him on deck the sergeant and the mate and the two hands were laid out none too gently and hornblower went out on deck while the others dragged the pilot after him it was nearly quite dark now with only the moon shining the galley slaves were squatting listlessly on the hatchcoaming hornblower addressed them quietly despite his difficulty with the language his boiling excitement conveyed itself to them i can set you men free he said there will be an end of beatings and slavery if you will do what i order i am an english officer and i am going to sail this ship to england does anyone not want to come there was a little sigh from the group it was as if they could not believe they were hearing aright probably they could not in england went on hornblower you will be rewarded there will be a new life awaiting you now at last they were beginning to understand that they had not been brought on board the cutter for further toil that there really was a chance of freedom yes sir said a voice i am going to unfasten your chain said hornblower remember this there is to be no noise sit still until you are told what to do he fumbled for the padlock in the dim light unlocked it and snapped it open it was pathetic the automatic gesture with which the first man lifted his arms he was accustomed to being locked and unlocked daily like an animal hornblower set free each man in turn and the chain clanked on the deck he stood back with his hands on the butts of his pistols ready in case of trouble but there was no sign of any the men stood dazed the transition from slavery to freedom had taken no more than three minutes hornblower felt the movement of the cutter under his feet as the wind swung her she was bumping gently against the fendsoff hung between her and the quay a glance over the side confirmed his conclusions the tide had not yet begun to ebb there were still some minutes to wait and he turned to brown standing restless aft of the mainmast with the pilot sitting miserably at his feet brown he said quietly run down to our boat and bring me my parcel of clothes run along now what are you waiting for brown went unhappily it seemed dreadful to him that his captain should waste precious minutes over recovering his clothes and should even trouble to think of them but hornblower was not as mad as he might appear they could not start until the tide turned and brown might as well be employed fetching clothes as standing fidgeting for once in his life hornblower had no intention of posing before his subordinates his head was clear despite his excitement thank you he said as brown returned panting with the canvas bag get me my uniform coat out he stripped off his colonels tunic and put on the coat which brown held for him experiencing a pleasant thrill as his fingers fastened the buttons with their crown and anchor the coat was sadly crumpled and the gold lace bent and broken but still it was a uniform even though the last time he had worn it was months ago when they had been capsized in the loire with this coat on his back he could no longer be accused of being a spy and should their attempt result in failure and recapture it would shelter both himself and his subordinates failure and recapture were likely possibilities as his logical brain told him but secret murder now was not the stealing of the cutter would attract sufficient public attention to make that impossible already he had bettered his position he could not be shot as a spy nor be quietly strangled in prison if he were recaptured now he could only be tried on the old charge of violation of the laws of war and hornblower felt that his recent exploits might win him sufficient public sympathy to make it impolitic for bonaparte to press even that charge it was time for action now he took a belaying pin from the rail and walked up slowly to the seated pilot weighing the instrument meditatively in his hand monsieur he said i want you to pilot this ship out to sea the pilot goggled up at him in the faint moonlight i cannot he gabbled my professional honour my duty hornblower cut him short with a menacing gesture of the belaying pin we are going to start now he said you can give instructions or not as you choose but i tell you this monsieur the moment this ship touches ground i will beat your head into a paste with this hornblower eyed the white face of the pilot his moustache was lopsided and ridiculous now after his rough treatment the mans eyes were on the belaying pin with which hornblower was tapping the palm of his hand and hornblower felt a little thrill of triumph the threat of a pistol bullet through the head would not have been sufficient for this imaginative southerner but the man could picture so clearly the crash of the belaying pin upon his skull and the savage blows which would beat him to death that the argument hornblower had selected was the most effective one yes monsieur said the pilot weakly right said hornblower brown lash him to the rail there then we can start mr bush will you take the tiller if you please the necessary preparations were brief the convicts were led to the halliards and the ropes put in their hands ready to haul on the word of command hornblower and brown had so often before had experience in pushing raw crews into their places thanks to the allembracing activities of the british pressgangs and it was good to see that browns french eked out by the force of his example was sufficient for the occasion cut the warps sir volunteered brown no cast them off snapped hornblower cut warps left hanging to the bollards would be a sure proof of a hurried and probably illegal departure to cast them off meant possibly delaying inquiry and pursuit by a few more minutes and every minute of delay might be precious in the uncertain future the first of the ebb was tightening the ropes now simplifying the business of getting away from the quay to handle the tiny foreandaft rigged ship was an operation calling for little either of the judgement or of the brute strength which a big square rigger would demand and the present circumstances the wind off the quay and the ebbing tide made the only precaution necessary that of casting off the stern warp before the bow as brown understood as clearly as hornblower it happened in the natural course of events for hornblower had to fumble in the dim light to disentangle the clove hitches with which some french sailor had made fast and brown had completed his share long before him the push of the tide was swinging the cutter away from the quay hornblower in the uncertain light had to time his moment for setting sail making allowance for the unreliability of his crew the eddy along the quayside the tide and the wind hoist away said hornblower and then to the men tirez mainsail and jib rose to the accompaniment of the creaking of the blocks the sails flapped bellied flapped again then they filled and bush at the tiller the cutter steered with a tiller not a wheel felt a steady pressure the cutter was gathering way she was changing from a dead thing to a live she heeled the tiniest fraction to the breeze with a subdued creaking of her cordage and simultaneously hornblower heard a little musical chuckle from the bows as her forefoot bubbled through the water he picked up the belaying pin again and in three strides was at the pilots side balancing the instrument in his hand to the right monsieur gabbled the individual keep well to the right port your helm mr bush were taking the starboard channel said hornblower and then translating the further hurried instructions of the pilot meet her keep her at that the cutter glided on down the river in the faint moonlight from the bank of the river she must make a pretty picture no one would guess that she was not setting forth on some quite legitimate expedition the pilot was saying something else now hornblower bent his ear to listen it had regard to the advisability of having a man at work with the lead taking soundings and hornblower would not consider it for a moment there were only brown and himself who could do that and they both might be wanted at any moment in case it should be necessary for the cutter to go about moreover there would be bound to be a muddle about fathoms and metres no said hornblower you will have to do your work without that and my promise still holds good he tapped his palm with the belaying pin and laughed that laugh surprised him it was so bloodcurdling in its implications anyone hearing it would be quite sure that hornblower was determined upon clubbing the pilot to death if they went aground hornblower asked himself if he were acting and was puzzled to discover that he could not answer the question he could not picture himself killing a helpless man and yet he could not be sure this fierce relentless determination that consumed him was something new to him just as it always was he was aware of the fact that once he had set his hand to a scheme he never allowed any consideration to stop his carrying it through but he always looked upon himself as fatalistic or resigned it was always startling to detect in himself qualities which he admired in other men but it was sufficient and satisfactory for the moment to know that the pilot was quite sure that he would be killed in an unpleasant fashion if the cutter should touch ground within half a mile it was necessary to cross to the other side it was amusing to note how this vast estuary repeated on a grand scale the characteristics of the upper river where the clear channel serpentined from shore to shore between the sandbanks at the pilots warning hornblower got his motley crew together in case it might be necessary to go about but the precaution was needless closehauled and with the tide running fast behind her the cutter glided across hornblower and brown at the sheets and bush at the tiller demonstrating once more what an accomplished seaman he was they steadied her with the wind again over her quarter hornblower anxiously testing the direction of the wind and looking up at the ghostly sails monsieur pleaded the pilot monsieur these cords are tight hornblower laughed again horribly they will serve to keep you awake then he said his instinct had dictated the reply his reason confirmed it it would be best to show no hint of weakness towards this man who had it in his power to wreck everything the more firmly the pilot was convinced of his captors utter pitilessness the less chance there was of his playing them false better that he should endure the pain of tight ligatures than that three men should risk imprisonment and death and suddenly hornblower remembered the four other men the sergeant and the mate and the two hands who lay gagged and bound in the cabin they must be highly uncomfortable and probably fairly near to suffocation it could not be helped no one could be spared for a moment from the deck to go below and attend them there they must lie until there was no hope of rescue for them he found himself feeling sorry for them and put the feeling aside naval history teemed with stories of recaptured prizes in which the prisoners had succeeded in overpowering weak prize crews he was going to run no risk of that it was interesting to note how his mouth set itself hard at the thought without his own volition and it was equally interesting to observe how his reluctance to go home and face the music reacted contrariwise upon his resolution to see this affair through he did not want to fail and the thought that he might be glad of failure because of the postponement of the settlement of his affairs only made him more set in his determination not to fail i will loosen the cords he said to the pilot when we are off noirmoutier not before chapter fourteen they were off noirmoutier at dawn with the last dying puff of wind the grey light found them becalmed and enwreathed in a light haze which drifted in patches over the calm surface of the sea awaiting the rising of the sun to dissipate it hornblower looked round him as the details became more clear the galley slaves were all asleep on the foredeck huddled together for warmth like pigs in a sty with brown squatting on the hatch beside them his chin on his hand bush still stood at the tiller betraying no fatigue after his sleepless night he held the tiller against his hip with his wooden leg braced against a ring bolt against the rail the pilot drooped in his bonds his face which yesterday had been plump and pink was this morning drawn and grey with pain and fatigue with a little shudder of disgust hornblower cut him loose i keep my promise you see he said but the pilot only dropped to the deck his face distorted with pain and a minute later he was groaning with the agony of returning circulation the big mainsail boom came inboard with a clatter as the sail flapped i cant hold the course sir said bush very well said hornblower he might have expected this the gentle night wind which had wafted them down the estuary was just the sort to die away with the dawn leaving them becalmed but had it held for another half hour had they made another couple of miles of progress they would be far safer there lay noirmoutier to port and the mainland astern through the shredding mist he could make out the gaunt outlines of the semaphore station on the mainland sixteen years ago he had been second in command of the landing party which pellew had sent ashore to destroy it the islands were all heavily garrisoned now with big guns mounted as a consequence of the incessant english raids he scanned the distance which separated them from noirmoutier measuring it with his eye they were out of big gun range he fancied but the tide might easily drift them in closer he even suspected from what he remembered of the set of the tides that there was danger of their being drifted into the bay of bourgneuf brown he called sharply wake those men up set them to work with the sweeps on either side of every gun was a thole for a sweep six on each side of the ship brown shoved his bleareyed crew into their positions and showed them how to get out the big oars with the long rope joining the looms one two three pull shouted brown the men put their weight on the oars the blades bubbled ineffectively through the still water one two three pull one two three pull brown was all animation gesticulating running from man to man beating time with his whole body gradually the cutter gathered way and as she began to move the oar blades began to bite upon the water with more effect one two three pull it did not matter that brown was counting time in english for there was no mistaking his meaning nor the meaning of the convulsive movements of his big body pull the galley slaves sought for foothold on the deck as they tugged browns enthusiasm was infectious so that one or two of them even raised their voices in a cracked cheer as they leaned back now the cutter was perceptibly moving bush swung the tiller over felt the rudder bite and steadied her on her course again she rose and fell over the tiny swell with a clattering of blocks hornblower looked away from the straining men over the oily sea if he had been lucky he might have found one of the ships of the blockading squadron close inshore often they would come right in among the islands to beard bonaparte but today there was no sail in sight he studied the grim outlines of the island for signs of life even as he looked the gallowslike arms of the semaphore station on the mainland sprang up to attention they made no further movement and hornblower guessed that they were merely announcing the operators readiness to receive a message from the station further inshore invisible to him he could guess the purport of the message then the arms started signalling moving jerkily against the blue sky transmitting a brief reply to the interior another period of quiescence and then hornblower saw the signal arms swing round towards him previously they had been nearly in profile automatically he turned towards noirmoutier and he saw the tiny speck of the flag at the masthead there dip in acknowledgement noirmoutier was ready to receive orders from the land round and round spun the arms of the semaphore up and down went the flag in acknowledgement of each sentence near the foot of the mast appeared a long jet of white smoke rounding off instantly into a ball and one after the other four fountains of water leaped from the glassy surface of the sea as a shot skipped over it the dull report following after the nearest fountain was a full half mile away so that they were comfortably out of range make those men pull roared hornblower to brown he could guess what would be the next move under her sweeps the cutter was making less than a mile in the hour and all day long they would be in danger unless a breeze came and his straining eye could see no hint of a breeze on the calm surface of the sea nor in the vivid blue of the morning sky at any moment boats crowded with men would be putting off towards them boats whose oars would move them far faster than the cutters sweeps there would be fifty men in each perhaps a gun mounted in the bows as well three men with the doubtful aid of a dozen galley slaves could not hope to oppose them yes i can by god said hornblower to himself as he sprang into action he could see the boats heading out from the tip of the island tiny dots upon the surface of the sea the garrison must have turned out and bundled into the boats immediately on receiving the order from the land pull shouted brown the sweeps groaned on the tholes and the cutter lurched under the impulse hornblower had cleared away the aftermost sixpounder on the port side there was shot in the locker under the rail but no powder keep the men at work brown he said and watch the pilot aye aye sir said brown he stretched out a vast hand and took hold of the pilots collar while hornblower dived into the cabin one of the four prisoners there had writhed and wriggled his way to the foot of the little companion hornblower trod on him in his haste with a curse he dragged him out of the way as he expected there was a hatchway down into the lazarette hornblower jerked it open and plunged through it was nearly dark for the only light was what filtered through the cabin skylight and down the hatchway and he stumbled and blundered upon the piledup stores inside he steadied himself whatever the need for haste there was no profit in panic he waited for his eyes to grow accustomed to the darkness while overhead he could hear brown still bellowing and the sweeps still groaning on the tholes then in the bulkhead before him he saw what he sought a low doorway with a glass panel which must indicate the magazine the gunner would work in there by the light of a lantern shining through he heaved the piledup stores out of his way sweating in his haste and the heat and wrenched open the door feeling about him in the tiny space crouching nearly double his hands fell upon four big hogsheads of gunpowder he fancied he could feel the grittiness of gunpowder under his feet any movement on his part might start a spark and blow the cutter to fragments it was just like the french to be careless with explosives he sighed with relief when his fingers encountered the paper containers of ready charges he had hoped to find them but there had always been the chance that there were no cartridges available and he had not been enamoured of the prospect of using a powderladle he loaded himself with cartridges and backed out of the tiny magazine to the cabin and sprang up on deck again to the clear sunshine the boats were appreciably nearer for they were no longer black specks but boats creeping beetlelike over the surface towards them three of them already spaced out in their race to effect a recapture hornblower put down his cartridges upon the deck his heart was pounding with his exertions and with excitement and each successive effort that he made to steady himself seemed to grow less successful it was one thing to think and plan and direct to say do this or go there and it was quite another to have success dependent upon the cunning of his own fingers and the straightness of his own eye his sensations were rather similar to those he experienced when he had drunk a glass of wine too many he knew clearly enough what he had to do but his limbs were not quite as ready as usual to obey the orders of his brain he rumbled more than once as he rigged the traintackle of the gun that fumbling cured him he rose from the task shaking his unsteadiness from him like christian losing his burden of sin he was cool now set completely on the task in hand here you he said to the pilot the pilot demurred for a moment full of fine phrases regarding the impossibility of training a gun upon his fellow countrymen but a sight of the alteration in hornblowers expression reduced him to instant humble submission hornblower was unaware of the relentless ferocity of his glance being only conscious of a momentary irritation at anyone crossing his will but the pilot had thought that any further delay would lead to hornblowers killing him pitilessly and the pilot may have been right between them they laid hold of the traintackle and ran the gun back hornblower took out the tampion and went round to the breech he twirled the elevating screw until his eye told him that the gun was at the maximum elevation at which it could be run out he cocked the lock and then crouching over the gun so that the shadow of his body cut off the sunlight jerked the lanyard the spark was satisfactory he ripped open a cartridge poured the powder into the muzzle of the gun folded the paper into a wad and rammed the charge home with the flexible rammer a glance towards the boats showed that they were still probably out of range so that he was not pressed for time he devoted a few seconds to turning over the shot in the locker selecting two or three of the roundest and then strolled across the deck to the starboard side locker and made a selection from there for long range work with a sixpounder he did not want shot that bounced about during its passage up the gun and was liable to fly off godknewwhere when it emerged he rammed his eventual selection well down upon the wad at this elevation there was no need for a second wad and ripping open a second cartridge he primed the breach allons he snapped at the pilot and then ran the gun up two men were the barest minimum crew for a sixpounder but hornblowers long slight body was capable of exerting extraordinary strength at the behest of his mind with a handspike he trained the gun round aft as far as possible even so the gun did not point towards the leading boat which lay far abaft the beam the cutter would have to yaw to fire at her hornblower straightened himself up in the sunlight brown was chanting hoarsely at the galley slaves almost in his ear and the aftermost sweep had been working right at his elbow and he had not noticed either so intent had he been on his task for the cutter to yaw meant losing a certain amount of distance he had to balance that certain loss against the chances of hitting a boat with a sixpounder ball at two thousand yards it would not pay at present it would be better to wait a little for the range to shorten but it was an interesting problem even though it could have no exact solution in consequence of the presence of an unknown which was the possibility of the coming of a wind of that there was still no sign long and anxiously though hornblower stared over the glassy sea as he looked round he caught the eye of bush at the tiller directed anxiously at him bush was awaiting the order to yaw hornblower smiled at him and shook his head resuming his study of the horizon the distant islands the unbroken expanse to seaward where lay freedom a seagull was wheeling overhead dazzling white against the blue and crying plaintively the cutter was nodding a little in the faint swell beggin you pardon sir said brown in his ear beggin your pardon sir pull these men cant go on much longer sir look at that one over there on the starboard side sir pull there could be no doubt of it the men were swaying with fatigue as they reached forward with the long sweeps dangling from browns hand was a length of knotted cord clearly he had already been using the most obvious argument to persuade them to work give em a bit of a rest sir and summat to eat an drink an theyll go on all right sir pull you bastards they havent had no breakfast sir nor no supper yesterday very good said hornblower you can rest em and get em fed mr bush let her come slowly round he bent over the gun oblivious at once to the clatter of the released sweeps as the galley slaves ceased work just as he was oblivious that he himself had not eaten or drunk or slept since yesterday at the touch of the tiller and with her residual way the cutter turned slowly the black mass of a boat appeared in the v of the dispart sight and he waved his hand to bush the boat had disappeared again and came back into his field of vision as bush checked the turn with the tiller but not quite in alignment with the gun hornblower eased the gun round with the handspike until the aim was true drew himself up and stepped out of the way of the recoil lanyard in hand of necessity he was far more doubtful of the range than of the direction and it was vital to observe the fall of the shot he took note of the motion of the cutter on the swell waited for the climax of the roll and jerked the lanyard the gun roared out and recoiled past him he sprang sideways to get clear of the smoke the four seconds of the flight of the shot seemed to stretch out indefinitely and then at last he saw the jet of water leap into brief existence fully two hundred yards short and a hundred yards to the right that was poor shooting he sponged out the gun and reloaded it called the pilot to him with an abrupt gesture and ran the gun out again it was necessary he realized to get acquainted with the weapon if he wanted to do any fancy shooting with it so that he made no alteration in elevation endeavoured to lay the gun exactly as before and jerked the lanyard at as nearly the same instant of the roll as possible this time it appeared that the elevation was correct for the shot pitched well up to the boat but it was out to the right again fifty yards off at least it seemed likely that the gun therefore had a tendency to throw to the right he trained the gun round a trifle to the left and still without altering the elevation fired again too far to the left and two hundred yards short again hornblower told himself that a variation of two hundred yards in the fall of shot from a sixpounder at full elevation was only to be expected and he knew it to be true but that was cold comfort to him the powder varied from charge to charge the shot were never truly round quite apart from the variations in atmospheric conditions and in the temperature of the gun he set his teeth aimed and fired again short and a trifle to the left it was maddening breakfast sir said brown at his elbow hornblower turned abruptly and there was brown with a tray bearing a basin of biscuit a bottle of wine a jug of water a pewter mug the sight made hornblower realize that he was intensely hungry and thirsty what about you asked hornblower were all right sir said brown the galley slaves were squatting on the deck wolfing bread and drinking water so was bush over by the tiller hornblower discovered that his tongue and the roof of his mouth were dry as leather his hands shook as he mixed water with wine and gulped it down beside the cabin skylight lay the four men who had been left in bonds in the cabin their hands were free now although their feet were still bound the sergeant and one of the seamen were noticeably pale i took the liberty of bringing em up sir said brown those two was pretty nigh dead cause o their gags sir but theyll be all right soon i fancy sir it had been thoughtless cruelty to leave them bound thought hornblower but going back in his mind through the events of the night he could not think of any time until now when any attention could have been spared for them in war there was always plenty of cruelty these beggars said brown indicating the galley slaves wanted to throw the sojer overboard when they saw im sir he grinned widely as though that were very amusing the remark opened a long vista of thought regarding the miseries of the life of a galley slave and the brutalities of their guards yes said hornblower gulping down a morsel of biscuit and drinking again you had better set em all to work at the sweeps aye aye sir i had the same idea beggin your pardon sir we can have two watches with all these men arrange it as you like said hornblower turning back to the gun the nearest boat was appreciably nearer now hornblower judged it advisable to make a small reduction in the elevation and this time the shot pitched close to the boat almost among the oars on one side apparently beautiful sir said bush beside the tiller hornblowers skin was prickling with sweat and powder smoke he took off his gold laced coat suddenly conscious of the heavy weight of the pistols in the side pockets he proffered them to bush but the latter shook his head and grinned pointing to the bellmouthed blunderbuss on the deck beside him that would be a far more efficacious weapon if there was trouble with their motley crew for an exasperated moment hornblower wondered what to do with the pistols and finally laid them handy in the scuppers before sponging out and reloading the gun the next shot was a close one too apparently the small reduction of range had had a profound effect on the accuracy of the gun hornblower saw the shot pitch close to the bows of the boat it would be a matter of pure chance at that range if he scored an actual hit for no gun could be expected to be accurate to fifty yards sweeps are ready sir said brown very good mr bush kindly lay a course so that i can keep that boat under fire brown was a pillar of strength he had had rigged only the three foremost sweeps on each side setting six men to work on them the others were herded together forward ready to relieve the men at work when they were tired six sweeps would only just give the big cutter steerage way but continuous slow progress was preferable to an alternation of movement and passivity what arguments he had used to persuade the four frenchmen who were not galley slaves to work at the sweeps hornblower judged it best not to inquire it was sufficient that they were there their feet hobbled straining away at the sweeps while brown gave them the time his knotted ropes end dangling from his fist the cutter began to creep through the blue water again the rigging rattling at each tug on the sweeps to make the chase as long as possible she should have turned her stern to her pursuers instead of keeping them on her quarter but hornblower had decided that the chance of scoring a hit with the gun was worth the loss in distance a decision of whose boldness he was painfully aware and which he had to justify he bent over the gun and aimed carefully and this time the shot flew wide again watching the splash from the rail hornblower felt a surge of exasperation for a moment he was tempted to hand the gun over to bush for him to try his hand but he put the temptation aside in the face of stark reality without allowing false modesty to enter into the debate he could rely on himself to lay a gun better than bush could tirez he snapped at the pilot and between them they ran the gun up again the pursuing boats creeping black over the blue sea had shown no sign so far of being dismayed by the bombardment to which they were being subjected their oars kept steadily at work and they maintained resolutely a course which would cut the witch of endors a mile or so further on they were big boats all three of them carrying at least a hundred and fifty men between them only one of them need range alongside to do the business hornblower fired again and then again doggedly fighting down the bitter disappointment at each successive miss the range was little over a thousand yards now he judged what he would call in an official report long cannon shot he hated those black boats creeping onward immune threatening his life and liberty just as he hated this cranky gun which would not shoot the same two rounds running the sweat was making his shirt stick to him and the powdergrains were irritating his skin at the next shot there was no splash hornblower could see no sign of its fall anywhere then he saw the leading boat swing half round and her oars stop moving youve hit her sir called bush next moment the boat straightened on her course again her oars hard at work that was disappointing it had hardly been likely that a ships long boat could survive a direct hit from a sixpounder ball without injury to her fighting ability but it was possible all the same hornblower felt for the first time a sense of impending failure if the hit he had scored with such difficulty was of no avail what was the sense in continuing the struggle then doggedly he bent over the gun again staring along the sights to allow for the small amount of right hand bias which the gun exhibited even as he looked he saw the leading boat cease rowing again she wavered and then swung round signalling wildly to the other boats hornblower trained the gun round upon her and fired again and missed but he could see that she was perceptibly lower in the water the other boats drew up alongside her evidently to transfer her crew port a point mr bush yelled hornblower already the group of boats was out of the field of fire of the gun and yet was far too tempting a mark to ignore the french pilot groaned as he helped to run the gun up but hornblower had no time for his patriotic protests he sighted carefully and fired again there was no sign of a splash the ball had taken effect but presumably upon the boat which had already been hit for immediately afterwards the other two drew away from their waterlogged fellow to resume the pursuit brown was changing over the men at the sweeps hornblower remembered now that he had heard him cheering hoarsely when he had scored his hit and hornblower found a second in which to admire his masterful handling of the men prisoners of war and escaping slaves alike there was time for admiration but no time for envy the pursuers were changing their tactics one boat was heading straight at them while the other diverging a little was still heading to intercept them the reason was soon obvious for from the bows of the former boat came a puff of smoke and a cannonball raised a splash from the surface of the water on the cutters quarter and skipped past the stern hornblower shrugged his shoulders at that a threepounder boat gun fired from a platform far more unsteady even than the witch of endor could hardly do them any harm at that range and every shot meant delay in the pursuit he trained his gun round upon the intercepting boat fired and missed he was already taking aim again before the sound of the second shot from the boat gun reached his ears and he did not trouble to find out where the ball went his own shot fell close to its target for the range was shortening and he was growing more experienced with the gun and more imbued with the rhythm of the long atlantic swell which rocked the witch of endor three times he dropped a shot so close to the boat that the men at the oars must have been wetted by the splashes each shot deserved to be a hit he knew but the incalculable residuum of variables in powder and ball and gun made it a matter of chance just where the ball fell in a circle of fifty yards radius however well aimed ten guns properly controlled and fired together in a broadside would do the business but there was no chance of firing ten guns together there was a crash from forward a fountain of splinters from the base of a stanchion and a shot scarred the deck diagonally close beside the fore hatchway no you dont roared brown leaping forward with his ropes end keep pulling you bastard he jerked the scared galley slave who had dropped his sweep the shot must have missed him by no more than a yard back into position pull he shouted standing magnificent in his superb physique right in the midst of them the weary ones lying on the deck the others sweating at the sweeps the knotted rope swinging from his hand he was like a lion tamer in a cage hornblower could see there was no need for him and his pistols and he bent again this time with a real twinge of envy over his gun the boat which was firing at them had not closed in at all if anything she had fallen a trifle back but the other one was far nearer by now hornblower could see the individual men in her the dark heads and the brown shoulders her oars were still for the moment and there was some movement in her as if they were rearranging the men at the oars now she was in motion again and moving far faster and heading straight at them the officer in charge having worked up as close as this had doublebanked his oars so as to cover the last most dangerous zone with a rush pouring out the carefully conserved energy of his men prodigally in his haste to come alongside hornblower estimated the rapidly diminishing range twirled the elevating screw and fired the shot hit the water ten yards from her bows and must have ricochetted clean over her he sponged and loaded and rammed a missfire now he told himself would be fatal and he forced himself to go through the routine with all the exactness he had employed before the sights of the gun were looking straight at the bows of the boat it was point blank range he jerked the lanyard and sprang instantly to reload without wasting time by seeing where the shot went it must have passed close over the heads of the men at the oars for when he looked along the sights again there she was still heading straight at him a tiny reduction in elevation and he stepped aside and jerked the lanyard he was dragging at the train tackles before he could look again the bows of the boat had opened like a fan in the air above her there was a black dot a water breaker presumably sent flying like a football by the impact of the shot which had hit clean and square upon her stem at water level her bows were lifted a little out of the water the loose strakes spread wide and then they came down again and the water surged in and she was gunwale deep in a flash her bottom smashed presumably as well as her bows by the passage of the shot brown was cheering again and bush was capering as well as he could with a wooden leg while steering and the little french pilot at his side pulling in his breath with a sharp hissing noise there were black dots on the surface of the blue water where men struggled for their lives it must be bitter cold and they would die quickly those who could not find support on the shattered hull but nothing could be done to help them already they had more prisoners than they could conveniently handle and any delay would bring the other boat alongside them keep the men at work said hornblower harshly to brown and unnecessarily then he bent to reload the gun once more what course sir asked bush from the tiller he wanted to know if he should steer so as to allow fire to be opened on the third boat which had ceased firing now and was pulling hastily towards the wreck keep her as she is snapped hornblower he knew perfectly well that the boat would not annoy them further having seen two of her fellows sunk and being of necessity vastly overcrowded she would turn back sooner than maintain the contest and so it proved after the boat had picked up the survivors they saw her swing round and head towards noirmoutier followed by a derisive cheer from brown hornblower could look round him now he walked aft to the taffrail beside bush it was curious how much more natural it felt to be there than at the gun and scanned the horizon during the fight the cutter had made very decided progress under her sweeps the mainland was lost in the faint haze noirmoutier was already far behind but there was still no sign of a breeze they were still in danger if darkness should find them where boats could reach them from the islands a night attack would tell a very different story they needed every yard they could gain and the men must go on slaving at the sweeps all through the day all through the night too if necessary he was conscious now that he ached in every joint after the frantic exertions of serving the gun the whole morning and he had had a whole night without sleep so had bush so had brown he felt that he stank of sweat and smoke and his skin tingled with powder grains he wanted rest yet automatically he walked over to make the gun secure again to put the unused cartridges out of harms way and to repocket the pistols which he noticed reproaching his carelessness from the scuppers chapter fifteen at midnight and not before a tiny breeze came whispering over the misty surface of the water at first merely swinging over the big mainsail and setting the rigging chattering but then breathing more strongly until the sails could catch it and hold it filling out in the darkness until hornblower could give the word for the exhausted men at the sweeps to abandon their labour and the cutter could glide on with almost imperceptible motion so slowly that there was hardly a bubble at her bows yet even at that faster than the sweeps had moved her out of the east came that breath of wind steady even though feeble hornblower could feel hardly any pull as he handled the mainsheet and yet the cutters big area of canvas was able to carry her graceful hull forward over the invisible surface as though in a dream it was like a dream indeed weariness and lack of sleep combined to make it so for hornblower who moved about his tasks in a misty unreality which matched the misty darkness of the sea the galley slaves and prisoners could lie and sleep there was no fear of trouble from them at present when they had spent ten hours out of the last twenty pulling at the sweeps with hands which by nightfall were running with blood but there was no sleep for him nor for bush and brown his voice sounded strange and distant in his own ears like that of a stranger speaking from another room as he issued his orders the very hands with which he held the ropes seemed not to belong to him it was as if there was a cleavage between the brain with which he was trying to think and the body which condescended to obey him somewhere to the northwest lay the fleet which maintained its unsleeping watch over brest he had laid the cutter on a northwesterly course with the wind comfortably on her quarter and if he could not find the channel fleet he would round ushant and sail the cutter to england he knew all this it made it more like a dream than ever that he could not believe it although he knew it the memory of marie de graays upper boudoir or of his battle for life in the floodwater of the loire was far more real to him than this solid little ship whose deck he trod and whose mainsheet he was handling setting a course for bush to steer was like playing a makebelieve game with a child he told himself desperately that this was not a new phenomenon that often enough before he had noticed that although he could dispense with one nights sleep without missing it greatly on the second in succession his imagination began to play tricks with him but it did not help to clear his mind he came back to bush at the tiller when the faint binnacle light made the lieutenants face just visible in the darkness hornblower was even prepared to enter into conversation in exchange for a grasp at reality tired mr bush he asked no sir of course not but how is it with you sir bush had served with his captain through too many fights to have an exaggerated idea of his strength well enough thank you if this breeze holds sir said bush realizing that this was one of the rare occasions when he was expected to make small talk with his captain well be up to the fleet in the morning i hope so said hornblower by god sir said bush what will they say of this in england bushs expression was rapt he was dreaming of fame of promotion for his captain as much as for himself in england said hornblower vaguely he had been too busy to dream any dreams himself to think about what the british public sentimental as always would think of an escaping british captain retaking almost singlehanded a captured ship of war and returning in her in triumph and he had seized the witch of endor in the first place merely because the opportunity had presented itself and because it was the most damaging blow he could deal the enemy since the seizure he had been at first too busy and latterly too tired to appreciate the dramatic quality of his action his distrust of himself and his perennial pessimism regarding his career would not allow him to think of himself as dramatically successful the unimaginative bush could appreciate the potentialities better than he could yes sir said bush eagerly even with tiller and compass and wind claiming so much of his attention he could be loquacious at this point itll look fine in the gazette this recapture of the witch even the morning chronicle sir the morning chronicle was a thorn in the side of the government ever ready to decry a victory or make capital of a defeat hornblower remembered how during the bitter early days of his captivity at rosas he had worried about what the morning chronicle would say regarding his surrender of the sutherland he felt sick now suddenly his mind was active enough now most of its vagueness must have been due he told himself because he had been refusing in cowardly fashion to contemplate the future until this night everything had been uncertain he might have been recaptured at any moment but now as sure as anything could be at sea he would see england again he would have to stand his trial for the loss of the sutherland and face a court martial after eighteen years of service the court might find him guilty of not having done his utmost in the presence of the enemy and for that there was only one penalty death that article of war did not end as others did with the mitigating words or such less penalty byng had been shot fifty years before under that article of war absolved on that account the wisdom of his actions in command of the sutherland might still be called into question he might be found guilty of errors of judgement in hazarding his ship in a battle against quadruple odds and be punished by anything from dismissal from the service which would make him an outcast and a beggar down to a simple reprimand which would merely wreck his career a court martial was always a hazardous ordeal from which few emerged unscathed cochrane sydney smith half a dozen brilliant captains had suffered damage at the hands of a court martial and the friendless captain hornblower might be the next and a court martial was only one of the ordeals that awaited him the child must be three months old now until this moment he had never been able to think clearly about the child boy or girl healthy or feeble he was torn with anxiety for maria and yet gulping at the pill of reality he forced himself to admit that he did not want to go back to maria he did not want to it had been in mad jealousy of the moment when he heard of lady barbaras marriage to admiral leighton that the child had been conceived maria in england marie in france his conscience was in a turmoil about both of them and underlying the turmoil was an unregenerate hunger for lady barbara which had remained quiescent during his preoccupation but which he knew would grow into an unrelenting ache an internal cancer the moment his other troubles ceased if ever they did bush was still babbling away happily beside him at the tiller hornblower heard the words and attached no meaning to them hahm he said quite so he could find no satisfaction in the simple pleasures bush had been in ecstasy about the breath of the sea the feeling of a ships deck underfoot not now not with all these bitter thoughts thronging his mind the harshness of his tone checked bush in the full career of his artless and unwonted chatter and the lieutenant pulled himself up abruptly hornblower thought it was absurd that bush should still cherish any affection for him after the cutting cruelty with which he sometimes used him bush was like a dog thought hornblower bitterly too cynical for the moment to credit bush with any perspicacity at all like a dog coming fawning to the hand that beat him hornblower despised himself as he walked forward again to the mainsheet to a long long period of a solitary black hell of his own there was just the faintest beginning of daylight the barest pearly softening of the sombreness of night a greyness instead of a blackness in the haze when brown came aft to hornblower beggin your pardon sir but i fancy i see the loom of something out there just now on the port bow sir there dyou see it sir hornblower strained his eyes through the darkness perhaps there was a more solid nucleus to the black mist out there a tiny something it came and went as his eyes grew tired what dyou make of it brown i thought it was a ship sir when i first saw it but in this haze sir there was a faint chance she might be a french ship of war it was about as likely as to find the king unguarded when leading from a suit of four to an ace much the most likely chance was that she was an english ship of war and the next most likely that she was a merchantman the safest course was to creep down upon her from the windward because the cutter lying nearer the wind than any squarerigged ship could do could escape if necessary the way she came trusting to the mist and darkness and surprise to avoid being disabled before she got out of range mr bush i fancy theres a sail to leeward put the cutter before the wind and run down to her if you please be ready to go about if i give the word jibsheet brown hornblowers head was clear again now in the face of a possible emergency he regretted the quickening of his pulse uncertainty always had that effect the cutter steadied upon her new course creeping before the wind over the misty water mainsail boom far out to port hornblower experienced a moments doubt in case bush was sailing her by the lee but he would not allow himself to call a warning he knew he could trust a sailor of bushs ability not to risk a gibe in an emergency of this sort he strained his eyes through the darkness the mist was patchy coming and going as he looked but that was a ship without any doubt she was under topsails alone that made it almost certain that she was an english ship of war one of the fleet which maintained unceasing watch over brest another patch of mist obscured her again and by the time they had run through it she was appreciably nearer and dawn was at hand her sails were faint grey in the growing light now they were close upon her suddenly the stillness was rent by a hail highpitched penetrating its purity of quality almost unspoilt by the speaking trumpet the voice which uttered it was trained in clarity in atlantic gales cutter ahoy what cutters that at the sound of the english speech hornblower relaxed there was no need now to go about to claw to windward to seek shelter in the mist but on the other hand all the unpleasantness of the future which he had been visualizing were certain now he swallowed hard words failing him for the moment what cutters that repeated the hail impatiently unpleasant the future might be he would fly his colours to the last and if his career were ending he would end it with a joke his britannic majestys armed cutter witch of endor captain horatio hornblower what ships that triumph captain sir thomas hardy what did you say that cutter was hornblower grinned to himself the officer of the watch in the strange sail had begun his reply automatically it was only after he had stated the names of his ship and captain that it had suddenly dawned upon him that the cutters statement was quite incredible the witch of endor had been a prize to the french for nearly a year and captain horatio hornblower had been dead six months hornblower repeated what he had said before both bush and brown were chuckling audibly at a joke which appealed to them forcibly indeed come under my lee and no tricks or ill sink you hailed the voice from the cutter they could hear the guns being run out in the triumph hornblower could picture the bustle on board hands being turned up the captain being called sir thomas hardy must be nelsons late flag captain at trafalgar two years hornblowers senior in the captains list hornblower had known him as a lieutenant although since then their paths had hardly crossed bush eased the cutter under the stern of the twodecker and brought her to the wind under her lee dawn was coming up fast now and they could see the details of the ship as she lay hove to rolling in the swell and a long shuddering sigh burst from hornblowers breast the sturdy beauty of the ship the two yellow streaks along her sides checkered with black gunports the pendant at the main the hands on the deck the red coats of the marines the boatswains voice roaring at dilatory seamen all the familiar sights and sounds of the navy in which he had grown up moved him inexpressibly at this moment the end of his long captivity and flight the triumph had launched a boat which came dancing rapidly over to them and a young midshipman swung himself dexterously on board dirk at his hip arrogant suspicion on his face four seamen at his back with pistols and cutlasses whats all this demanded the midshipman his glance swept the cutters deck observing the sleepy prisoners rubbing their eyes the woodenlegged civilian at the tiller the bareheaded man in a kings coat awaiting him you call me sir barked hornblower as he had done to midshipmen ever since he became a lieutenant the midshipman eyed the gold laced coat undoubtedly it was trimmed in the fashion of the coat of a captain of more than three years seniority and the man who wore it carried himself as though he expected deference yes sir said the midshipman a little abashed that is lieutenant bush at the tiller you will remain here with these men under his orders while i go to interview your captain aye aye sir said the midshipman stiffening to attention the boat bore hornblower to the triumphs side the coxswain made the fourfinger gesture which indicated the arrival of a captain but marines and sideboys were not in attendance as hornblower went up the side the navy could not risk wasting her cherished compliments on possible impostors but hardy was there on deck his huge bulk towering over everyone round him hornblower saw the expression of his beefy face alter as he saw him good god its hornblower all right said hardy striding forward with his hand outstretched welcome back sir how do you come here sir how did you retake the witch how what hardy wanted to say was how have you risen from the grave but such a question seemed to savour of impoliteness hornblower shook hands and trod gratefully the quarterdeck of a ship of the line once more his heart was too full for speech or his brain was too numb with fatigue and he could make no reply to hardys questioning come below to my cabin said hardy kindly phlegmatic though he was he still could just appreciate the others difficulty there was more ease in the cabin sitting on the cushioned locker under the portrait of nelson that hung on the bulkhead and with the timbers groaning faintly all round and the blue sea visible through the great stern window hornblower told a little of what happened to him not much and not in detail only half a dozen brief sentences for hardy was not a man with much use for words he listened with attention pulling at his whiskers and nodding at each point there was a whole gazette he remarked about the attack in rosas bay they brought leightons body back for burial in st pauls the cabin swam round hornblower hardys homely face and magnificent whiskers vanished in a mist he was killed then hornblower asked he died of his wounds at gibraltar so barbara was a widow had been one for six months now have you heard anything of my wife asked hornblower the question was a natural one to hardy little use though he himself had for women and he could see no connexion between it and the preceding conversation i remember reading that she was awarded a civil list pension by the government when the news of of your death arrived no other news there was a child coming none that i know of i have been four months in this ship hornblowers head sunk on his breast the news of leightons death added to the confusion of his mind he did not know whether to be pleased or sorry about it barbara would be as unattainable to him as ever and perhaps there would be all the jealous misery to endure of her remarriage now said hardy breakfast theres bush and my coxswain in the cutter said hornblower i must see that all is well with them first chapter sixteen a midshipman came into the cabin as they ate breakfast the fleets in sight from the masthead sir he reported to hardy very good as the midshipman went out again hardy turned back to hornblower i must report your arrival to his lordship is he still in command asked hornblower startled it was a surprise to him that the government had left admiral lord gambier in command of the channel fleet for three years despite the disastrous waste of opportunity at the basque roads he hauls down his flag next month said hardy gloomily most officers turned gloomy when discussing dismal jimmy they whitewashed him at the court martial and had to leave him his full three years a shade of embarrassment appeared in hardys expression he had let slip the mention of a court martial to a man who soon would endure the same ordeal i suppose they had to said hornblower his train of thought following that of his fellow captain as he wondered if there would be any whitewash employed at his trial hardy broke the embarrassed silence which followed would you care to come on deck with me he asked over the horizon to leeward was appearing a long line of ships closehauled they were in rigid regular line and as hornblower watched they went about in succession in perfect order as if they were chained together the channel fleet was at drill eighteen years of drill at sea had given them their unquestioned superiority over any other fleet in the world victorys in the van said hardy handing his glass to hornblower signal midshipman i triumph to flag have on board hornblower looked through the glass while hardy dictated his message the threedecker with her admirals flag at the main was leading the long line of ships the broad stripes on her side glistening in the sunlight she had been jerviss flagship at st vincent hoods in the mediterranean nelsons at trafalgar now she was dismal jimmys a tragedy if ever there was one signalhoists were soaring up to her yardarms hardy was busy dictating replies the admiral is signalling for you to go on board sir he said at last turning back to hornblower i trust you will do me the honour of making use of my barge the triumphs barge was painted primrose yellow picked out with black and so were the oarblades her crew wore primrosecoloured jumpers with black neckcloths as hornblower took his seat his hand still tingling with hardys handclasp he reminded himself gloomily that he had never been able to afford to dress his barges crew in a fancy rigout he always felt sore on the point hardy must be a wealthy man with his trafalgar prize money and his pension as colonel of marines he contrasted their situations hardy a baronet moneyed famous and he himself poor undistinguished and awaiting trial they piped the side for him in the victory as admiralty regulations laid down the marine guard at the present the sideboys in white gloves to hand him up the pipes of the boatswains mates all atwittering and there was a captain on the quarterdeck ready to shake hands with him odd that was to hornblower seeing that soon he would be on trial for his life im calendar captain of the fleet he said his lordship is below waiting for you he led the way below extraordinarily affable i was first of the amazon he volunteered when you were in indefatigable do you remember me yes said hornblower he had not risked a snub by saying so first i remember you plainly said calendar i remember hearing what pellew had to say about you whatever pellew said about him would be favourable he had owed his promotion to pellews enthusiastic recommendation and it was pleasant of calendar to remind him of it at this crisis of his career lord gambiers cabin was not nearly as ornate as captain hardys had been the most conspicuous item of furniture therein was the big brassbound bible lying on the table gambier himself heavyjowled gloomy was sitting by the stern window dictating to a clerk who withdrew on the arrival of the two captains you can make your report verbally sir for the present said the admiral hornblower drew a deep breath and made the plunge he sketched out the strategic situation at the moment when he took the sutherland into action against the french squadron off rosas only a sentence or two had to be devoted to the battle itself these men had fought in battles themselves and could fill in the gaps he described the whole crippled mass of ships drifting helpless up rosas bay to where the guns of the fortress awaited them and the gunboats creeping out under oars one hundred and seventeen killed said hornblower one hundred and fortyfive wounded of whom fortyfour died before i was removed from rosas my god said calendar it was not the deaths in hospital which called forth the exclamation that was a usual proportion but the total casualty list far more than half the crew of the sutherland had been put out of action before surrendering thompson in the leander lost ninetytwo out of three hundred my lord he said thompson had surrendered the leander to a french ship of the line off crete after a defence which had excited the admiration of all england i was aware of it answered gambier please go on captain hornblower told of how he witnessed the destruction of the french squadron of how caillard arrived to take him to paris of his escape first from his escort and then from drowning he made only a slight mention of count de graay and of his voyage down the loire that was not an admirals business but he descended to fuller details when he told of his recapture of the witch of endor details here were of importance because in the course of the manifold activities of the british navy it might easily happen that a knowledge of harbour arrangements at nantes and of the navigational difficulties of the lower loire might be useful good god almighty man said calendar how can you be so coldblooded about it werent you captain calendar interrupted gambier i have requested you before not to allude to the deity in that blasphemous fashion any repetition will incur my serious displeasure kindly continue captain hornblower there was only the brush with the boats from noirmoutier to be described now hornblower continued formally but this time gambier himself interrupted him you say you opened fire with a sixpounder he said the prisoners were at the sweeps and the ship had to be steered who laid the gun i did my lord the french pilot helped me mm and you frightened em off hornblower confessed that he had succeeded in sinking two out of the three boats sent against him calendar whistled his surprise and admiration but the hard lines in gambiers face only set harder still yes he said and then we went on under sweeps until midnight my lord and then we picked up a breeze we sighted triumph at dawn there was silence in the cabin only broken by the noises on deck until gambier stirred in his chair i trust captain he said that you have given thanks to the almighty for these miraculous preservations of yours in all these adventures i can see the finger of god i shall direct my chaplain at prayers this evening to make a special mention of your gratitude and thankfulness yes my lord now you will make your report in writing you can have it ready by dinner time i trust you will give me the pleasure of your company at dinner i will then be able to enclose it in the packet i am about to despatch to their lordships yes my lord gambier was still thinking deeply witch of endor can carry the despatches he said like every admiral the world over his most irritating and continuous problem was how to collect and disseminate information without weakening his main body by detachments it must have been an immense relief to him to have the cutter drop from the clouds as it were to carry these despatches he went on thinking i will promote this lieutenant of yours bush into her as commander he announced hornblower gave a little gasp promotion to commander meant almost certain post rank within the year and it was this power of promotion which constituted the most prized source of patronage an admiral in command possessed bush deserved the step but it was surprising that gambier should give it to him admirals generally had some favourite lieutenant or some nephew or some old friends son awaiting the first vacancy hornblower could imagine bushs delight at the news that he was at last on his way to becoming an admiral himself if he lived long enough but that was not all by no means all promotion of a captains first lieutenant was a high compliment to the captain himself it set the seal of official approval on the captains proceedings this decision of gambiers was a public not merely a private announcement that hornblower had acted correctly thank you my lord thank you said hornblower she is your prise of course went on gambier government will have to buy her on her arrival hornblower had not thought of that it meant at least a thousand pounds in his pocket that coxswain of yours will be in clover chuckled calendar hell take all the lower decks share that was true too brown would have a quarter of the value of the witch of endor for himself he could buy a cottage or land and set up in business on his own account if he wished to witch of endor will wait until your report is ready announced gambier i will send my secretary in to you captain calendar will provide you with a cabin and the necessities you lack i hope you will continue to be my guest until i sail for portsmouth next week it would be best i think the last words were a delicate allusion to that aspect of the matter which had occupied most of hornblowers thoughts on his arrival and which had not as yet been touched upon the fact that he must undergo court martial for the loss of the sutherland and was of necessity under arrest until that time by old established custom he must be under the supervision of an officer of equal rank while under arrest there could be no question of sending him home in the witch of endor yes my lord said hornblower despite all gambiers courtesy and indulgence towards him despite calendars open admiration he still felt a constriction of the throat and a dryness of the mouth at the thought of that court martial they were symptoms which persisted even when he tried to settle down and compose his report with the aid of the competent young clergyman who made his appearance in the cabin to which calendar conducted him arma virumque cano quoted the admirals secretary after the first halting sentences hornblowers report naturally began with the battle of rosas you begin in medias res sir as every good epic should this is an official report snapped hornblower it continues the last report i made to admiral leighton his tiny cabin only allowed him to walk three paces each way and crouching nearly double at that some unfortunate lieutenant had been turned out to make room for him in a flagship even in a big threedecker like the victory the demand for cabins always greatly exceeded the supply what with the admiral and the captain of the fleet and the flag lieutenant and the secretary and the chaplain and the rest of the staff he sat down on the breech of the twelvepounder beside the cot continue if you please he ordered having regard to these conditions i therefore proceeded it was finished in the end it was the third time that morning that hornblower had recounted his adventures and they had lost all their savour for him now he was dreadfully tired his head drooped forward at his breast as he squatted on the gun and then he woke with a snort he was actually falling asleep while he sat you are tired sir said the secretary yes he forced himself to wake up again the secretary was looking at him with eyes shining with admiration positive heroworship it made him feel uncomfortable if you will just sign this sir i will attend to the seal and the superscription the secretary slipped out of the chair and hornblower took the pen and dashed off his signature to the document on whose evidence he was soon to be tried for his life thank you sir said the secretary gathering the papers together hornblower had no more attention to spare for him he threw himself face downward on to the cot careless of appearances he went rushing giddily down a tremendous slope into blackness he was snoring before the secretary had reached the door and he never felt the touch of the blanket with which the secretary returned five minutes later tiptoeing up to the cot to spread it over him chapter seventeen something enormously painful was recalling hornblower to life he did not want to return it was agony to wake up it was torture to feel unconsciousness slipping away from him he clung to it tried to recapture it unavailingly remorselessly it eluded him somebody was gently shaking his shoulder and he came back to complete consciousness with a start and wriggled over to see the admirals secretary bending over him the admiral will dine within the hour sir he said captain calendar thought you might prefer to have a little time in which to prepare yes grunted hornblower he fingered instinctively the long stubble on his unshaven chin yes the secretary was standing very stiff and still and hornblower looked up at him curiously there was an odd set expression on the secretarys face and he held a newspaper imperfectly concealed behind his back whats the matter demanded hornblower it is bad news for you sir said the secretary what news hornblowers spirits fell down into the depths of despair perhaps gambier had changed his mind perhaps he was going to be kept under strict arrest tried condemned and shot perhaps i remembered having seen this paragraph in the morning chronicle of three months ago sir said the secretary i showed it to his lordship and to captain calendar they decided it ought to be shown to you as early as possible his lordship says what is the paragraph demanded hornblower holding out his hand for the paper it is bad news sir repeated the secretary hesitatingly let me see it damn you the secretary handed over the newspaper one finger indicating the paragraph the lord giveth the lord taketh away he said blessed be the name of the lord it was a very short paragraph we regret to announce the death in childbed on the seventh of this month of mrs maria hornblower widow of the late captain horatio hornblower bonapartes martyred victim the tragedy occurred in mrs hornblowers lodgings at southsea and we are given to understand that the child a fine boy is healthy hornblower read it twice and he began on it a third time maria was dead maria the tender the loving you can find consolation in prayer sir said the secretary but hornblower paid no attention to what the secretary said he had lost maria she had died in childbed and having regard to the circumstances in which the child had been engendered he had as good as killed her maria was dead there would be no one no one at all to welcome him now on his return to england maria would have stood by him during the court martial and whatever the verdict she would never have believed him to be at fault hornblower remembered the tears wetting her coarse red cheeks when she had last put her arms round him to say goodbye he had been a little bored by the formality of an affectionate goodbye then he was free now the realization came creeping over him like cold water in a warm bath but it was not fair to maria he would not have bought his freedom at such a price she had earned by her own devotion his attention his kindness and he would have given them to her uncomplainingly for the rest of his life he was desperately sorry that she was dead his lordship instructed me sir said the secretary to inform you of his sympathy in your bereavement he told me to say that he would not take it amiss if you decided not to join him and his guests at dinner but sought instead the consolation of religion in your cabin yes said hornblower any help which i can give sir none said hornblower he continued to sit on the edge of the cot his head bowed and the secretary shuffled his feet get out of here said hornblower without looking up he sat there for some time but there was no order in his thoughts his mind was muddled there was a continuous undercurrent of sadness a hurt feeling indistinguishable from physical pain but fatigue and excitement and lack of sleep deprived him of any ability to think clearly finally with a desperate effort he pulled himself together he felt as if he was stifling in the stuffy cabin he hated his stubbly beard and the feelings of dried sweat pass the word for my servant he ordered the sentry at his door it was good to shave off the filthy beard to wash his body in cold water to put on clean linen he went up on deck the clean sea air rushing into his lungs as he breathed it was good too to have a deck to pace up and down up and down between the slides of the quarterdeck carronades and the line of ringbolts in the deck with all the familiar sounds of shipboard life as a kind of lullaby to his tired mind up and down he walked up and down as he had walked so many hours before in the indefatigable and the lydia and the sutherland they left him alone the officers of the watch collected on the other side of the ship and only stared at him unobtrusively politely concealing their curiosity about this man who had just heard of the death of his wife who had escaped from a french prison who was waiting his trial for surrendering his ship the first captain to strike his colours in a british ship of the line since captain ferris in the hannibal at algecira up and down he walked the goodly fatigue closing in upon him again until his mind was stupefied with it until he found that he could hardly drag one foot past the other then he went below to the certainty of sleep and oblivion but even in his sleep tumultuous dreams came to harass him dreams of maria against which he struggled sweating knowing that marias body was now only a liquid mass of corruption nightmares of death and imprisonment and everrecurring dreams of barbara smiling to him on the farther side of the horrors that encompassed him from one point of view the death of his wife was of benefit to hornblower during those days of waiting it provided him with a good excuse for being silent and unapproachable without being thought impolite he could find a strip of deck and walk by himself in the sunshine gambier could walk with the captain of the fleet or the flag captain little groups of lieutenants and warrant officers could walk together chatting lightly but they all kept out of his way and it was not taken amiss that he should sit silent at the admirals dinner table and hold himself aloof at the admirals prayer meetings had it not been so he would have been forced to mingle in the busy social life of the flagship talking to officers who would studiously avoid all reference to the fact that shortly they would be sitting as judges on him at his court martial he did not have to join in the eternal technical discussions which went on round him stoically pretending that the responsibility of having surrendered a british ship of the line sat lightly on his shoulders despite all the kindness with which he was treated he felt a pariah calendar could voice open admiration for him gambier could treat him with distinction the young lieutenants could regard him with wideeyed heroworship but they had never hauled down their colours more than once during his long wait hornblower found himself wishing that a cannonball had killed him on the quarterdeck of the sutherland there was no one in the world who cared for him now the little son in england in the arms of some unknown fostermother might grow up ashamed of the name he bore suspecting morbidly that the others would treat him like an outcast if they could he anticipated them and made an outcast of himself bitterly proud he went through all that period of black reaction by himself without companionship during those last days of gambiers tenure of command until hood came out in the britannia to take over the command and amid the thunder of salutes the victory sailed for portsmouth there were headwinds to delay her passage she had to beat up the channel for seven long days before at last she glided into spithead and the cable roared out through the hawsehole hornblower sat in his cabin he felt no interest in the green hills of the isle of wight nor in the busy prospect of portsmouth the tap which came at his cabin door heralded he supposed the arrival of the orders regarding his court martial come in he said but it was bush who entered stumping along on his wooden leg his face wreathed in smiles his arms burdened with packages and parcels at the sight of that homely face hornblowers depression evaporated like mist he found himself grinning as delightedly as bush he wrung his hand over and over again sat him down in the only chair offered to send for drinks for him all trace of selfconsciousness and reserve disappearing in the violence of his reaction oh im well enough sir thank you said bush in reply to hornblowers questions and this is the first chance ive had of thanking you for my promotion dont thank me said hornblower a trace of bitterness creeping back into his voice you must thank his lordship i know who i owe it to all the same said bush sturdily theyre going to post me as captain this week they wont give me a ship not with this leg of mine but theres the dockyard job at sheerness waiting for me i should never be captain if it werent for you sir rubbish said hornblower the pathetic gratitude in bushs voice and expression made him feel uncomfortable and how is it with you sir asked bush regarding him with anxious blue eyes hornblower shrugged his shoulders fit and well he said i was sorry to hear about mrs hornblower sir said bush that was all he needed to say on that subject they knew each other too well to have to enlarge on it i took the liberty sir said bush hastily of bringing you out your letters there was a good deal waiting for you yes said hornblower this big package is a sword im sure sir said bush he was cunning enough to think of ways of capturing hornblowers interest lets open it then said hornblower indulgently a sword it was sure enough with a goldmounted scabbard and a gold hilt and when hornblower drew it the blue steel blade bore an inscription in gold inlay it was the sword of one hundred guineas value which had been presented to him by the patriotic fund for his defeat of the natividad in the lydia and which he had left in pawn with duddingstone the ships chandler at plymouth as a pledge for payment for captains stores when he was commissioning the sutherland a sight too much writing on this for me duddingstone had complained at the time lets see what duddingstone has to say said hornblower tearing open the note enclosed in the package sir it was with great emotion that i read today of your escape from the corsicans clutches and i cannot find words to express my relief that the reports of your untimely death were unfounded nor my admiration of your exploits during your last commission i cannot reconcile it with my conscience to retain the sword of an officer so distinguished and have therefore taken the liberty of forwarding the enclosed to you hoping that in consequence you will wear it when next you enforce britannias dominion of the seas your obedient and humble servant to command j duddingstone god bless my soul said hornblower he let bush read the note bush was a captain and his equal now as well as his friend and there was no disciplinary objection to allowing him to know to what shifts he had been put when commissioning the sutherland hornblower laughed a little selfconsciously when bush looked up at him after reading the note our friend duddingstone said hornblower must have been very moved to allow a pledge for forty guineas to slip out of his fingers he spoke cynically to keep the pride out of his voice but he was genuinely moved his eyes would have grown moist if he had allowed them im not surprised sir said bush fumbling among the newspapers beside him look at this sir and at this heres the morning chronicle and the times i saved them to show you hoping youd be interested hornblower glanced at the columns indicated somehow the gist of them seemed to leap out at him without his having to read them the british press had let itself go thoroughly as even bush had foreseen the fancy of the british public had been caught by the news that a captain whom they had imagined to be foully done to death by the corsican tyrant had succeeded in escaping and not merely in escaping but in carrying off a british ship of war which had been for months a prize to the corsican there were columns in praise of hornblowers daring and ability a passage in the times caught hornblowers attention and he read it more carefully captain hornblower still has to stand his trial for the loss of the sutherland but as we pointed out in our examination of the news of the battle of rosas bay his conduct was so well advised and his behaviour so exemplary on that occasion whether he was acting under the orders of the late admiral leighton or not that although the case is still sub judice we have no hesitation in predicting his speedy reappointment heres what the antigallican has to say sir said bush what the antigallican had to say was very like what the other newspapers had said it was beginning to dawn upon hornblower that he was famous he laughed uncomfortably again all this was a most curious experience and he was not at all sure that he liked it coldbloodedly he could see the reason for it lately there had been no naval officer prominent in the affections of the public cochrane had wrecked himself by his intemperate wrath after the basque roads while six years had passed since hardy had kissed the dying nelson collingwood was dead and leighton too for that matter and the public always demanded an idol like the israelites in the desert they were not satisfied with an invisible object for their devotion chance had made him the publics idol and presumably government were not sorry seeing how much it would strengthen their position to have one of their own men suddenly popular but somehow he did not like it he was not used to fame he distrusted it and his everpresent personal modesty made him feel it was all a sham i hope youre pleased sir said bush looking wonderingly at the struggle on hornblowers face yes i suppose i am said hornblower the navy bought the witch of endor yesterday at the prize court said bush searching wildly for news which might delight this odd captain of his four thousand pounds was the price sir and the division of the prize money where the prize has been taken by an incomplete crew is governed by an old regulation i didnt know about it sir until they told me it was made after that boats crew from squirrel after she foundered captured the spanish plate ship in two thirds to you sir thats two thousand six hundred pounds and a thousand to me and four hundred for brown hm said hornblower two thousand six hundred pounds was a substantial bit of money a far more concrete reward than the acclamation of a capricious public and theres all these letters and packets sir went on bush anxious to exploit the propitious moment the first dozen letters were all from people unknown to him writing to congratulate him on his success and escape two at least were from madmen apparently but on the other hand two were from peers even hornblower was a little impressed by the signatures and the coroneted notepaper bush was more impressed still when they were passed over to him to read thats very good indeed sir isnt it he said there are some more here hornblowers hand shot out and picked one letter out of the mass offered him the moment he saw the handwriting and then when he had taken it he stood for a second holding it in his hand hesitating before opening the anxious bush saw the hardening of his mouth and the waning of the colour in his cheeks watched him while he read but hornblower had regained his selfcontrol and his expression altered no farther london bond street rd june dear captain hornblower it is hard for me to write this letter so overwhelmed am i with pleasure and surprise at hearing at this moment from the admiralty that you are free and well i hasten to let you know that i have your son here in my care when he was left orphaned after the lamented death of your wife i ventured to take charge of him and make myself responsible for his upbringing while my brothers lords wellesley and wellington consented to act as his godfathers at his baptism whereat he was consequently given the names richard arthur horatio richard is a fine healthy boy with a wonderful resemblance to his father and he has already endeared himself greatly to me to such an extent that i shall be conscious of a great loss when the time comes for you to take him away from me let me assure you that i shall look upon it as a pleasure to continue to have charge of richard until that time as i can easily guess that you will be much occupied with affairs on your arrival in england you will be very welcome should you care to call here to see your son who grows in intelligence every day it will give pleasure not only to richard but to your firm friend barbara leighton hornblower nervously cleared his throat and reread the letter there was too much crowded in it for him to have any emotion left richard arthur horatio hornblower with two wellesleys as godfathers and growing in intelligence every day there would be a great future ahead of him perhaps up to that moment hornblower had hardly thought about the child his paternal instincts had hardly been touched by any consideration of a child he had never seen and they further were warped by memories of the little horatio who had died of smallpox in his arms so many years ago but now he felt a great wave of affection for the unknown little brat in london who had managed to endear himself to barbara and barbara had taken him in charge possibly because widowed and childless she had sought for a convenient orphan to adopt and yet it might be because she still cherished memories of captain hornblower whom at the time she had believed to be dead at bonapartes hands he could not bear to think about it any more he thrust the letter into his pocket all the others he had dropped on the deck and with immobile face he met bushs gaze again there are all these other letters sir said bush with masterly tact they were letters from great men and from madmen one contained an ounce of snuff as a token of some eccentric squires esteem and regard but there was only one which caught hornblowers attention it was from some chancery lane lawyer the name was unfamiliar who wrote it appeared on hearing from lady barbara leighton that the presumption of captain hornblowers death was unfounded previously he had been acting under the instructions of the lords commissioners of the admiralty to settle captain hornblowers estate and working in conjunction with the prize agent at port mahon with the consent of the lord chancellor upon the death intestate of mrs maria hornblower he had been acting as trustee to the heir richard arthur horatio hornblower and had invested for the latter in the funds the proceeds of the sale of captain hornblowers prizes after the deduction of expenses as captain hornblower would see from the enclosed account there was the sum of three thousand two hundred and ninetyone pounds six and fourpence invested in the consolidated fund which would naturally revert to him the lawyer awaited his esteemed instructions the enclosed accounts which hornblower was about to thrust aside had among the innumerable six and eightpences and three and fourpences one set of items which caught his eye they dealt with the funeral expenses of the late mrs hornblower and a grave in the cemetery of the church of st thomas beckett and a headstone and fees for gravewatchers it was a ghoulish list which made hornblowers blood run a little colder it was hateful more than anything else it accentuated his loss of maria he would only have to go on deck to see the tower of the church where she lay he fought down the depression which threatened to overmaster him once more it was at least a distraction to think about the news in that lawyers letter to contemplate the fact that he owned three thousand odd pounds in the funds he had forgotten all about those prizes he had made in the mediterranean before he came under leightons command altogether that made his total fortune nearly six thousand pounds not nearly as large as some captains had contrived to acquire but handsome enough even on halfpay he would be able to live in comfort now and educate richard arthur horatio properly and take his place in a modest way in society the captains list has changed a lot since we saw it last sir said bush and he was echoing hornblowers train of thought rather than breaking into it have you been studying it grinned hornblower of course sir upon the position of their names in that list depended the date of their promotion to flag rank year by year they would climb it as death or promotion eliminated their seniors until one day if they lived long enough they would find themselves admirals with admirals pay and privileges its the top half of the list which has changed most sir said bush leighton was killed and ball died at malta and troubridge was lost at sea in indian waters sir and theres seven or eight others whove gone youre more than halfway up now hornblower had held his present rank eleven years but with each coming year he would mount more slowly in proportion to the decrease in number of his seniors and it would be or so before he could fly his flag hornblower remembered the count de graays prediction that the war would end in promotion would be slower in peace time and bush was ten years older than he and only just beginning the climb probably he would never live to be an admiral but then bush was perfectly content with being a captain clearly his ambition had never soared higher than that he was fortunate were both of us very lucky men bush said hornblower yes sir agreed bush and hesitated before going on im giving evidence at the court martial sir but of course you know what my evidencell be they asked me about it at whitehall and they told me that what i was going to say agreed with everything they knew youve nothing to fear from the court martial sir chapter eighteen hornblower told himself often during the next twentyfour hours that he had nothing to fear from the court martial and yet it was nervous work waiting for it to hear the repeated twitter of pipes and stamping of marines boots overhead as the compliments were given to the captains and admirals who came on board to try him to hear silence close down on the ship as the court assembled and to hear the sullen boom of the court martial gun as the court opened and the click of the cabin door latch as calendar came to escort him before his judges hornblower remembered little enough afterwards of the details of the trial only a few impressions stood out clearly in his memory he could always recall the flash and glitter of the gold lace on the coats of the semicircle of officers sitting round the table in the great cabin of the victory and the expression on bushs anxious honest face as he declared that no captain could have handled a ship with more skill and determination than hornblower had handled sutherland at rosas bay it was a neat point which hornblowers friend the officer the admiralty had sent to conduct his defence made when his question brought out the fact that just before the surrender bush had been completely incapacitated by the loss of his foot so that he bore no responsibility whatever for the surrender and had no interest in presenting as good a case as possible there was an officer who read seemingly for an eternity long extracts from depositions and official reports in a spiritless mumble the greatness of the occasion apparently made him nervous and affected his articulation much to the annoyance of the president of the court at one point the president actually took the paper from him and himself read in his nasal tenor admiral martins pronouncement that the sutherlands engagement had certainly made the eventual destruction of the french squadron more easy and in his opinion was all that had made it possible there was an awkward moment when a discrepancy was detected between the signal logs of the pluto and caligula but it passed away in smiles when someone reminded the court that signal midshipmen sometimes made mistakes during the adjournment there was an elegant civilian in buff and blue with a neat silk cravat who came into hornblower with a good many questions frere his name was hookham frere hornblower had a vague acquaintance with the name he was one of the wits who wrote in the antigallican a friend of cannings who for a time had acted as ambassador to the patriot government of spain hornblower was a little intrigued by the presence of someone deep in cabinet secrets but he was too preoccupied waiting for the trial to reopen to pay much attention to him or to answer his questions in detail and it was worse when all the evidence had been given and he was waiting with calendar while the court considered its decision hornblower knew real fear then it was hard to sit apparently unmoved while the minutes dragged by waiting for the summons to the great cabin to hear what his fate would be his heart was beating hard as he went in and he knew himself to be pale he jerked his head erect to meet his judges eyes but the judges in their panoply of blue and gold were veiled in a mist which obscured the whole cabin so that nothing was visible to hornblowers eyes save for one little space in the centre the cleared area in the middle of the table before the presidents seat where lay his sword the hundredguinea sword presented by the patriotic fund that was all hornblower could see the sword seemed to hang there in space unsupported and the hilt was towards him he was not guilty captain hornblower said the president of the court that nasal tenor of his had a pleasant tone this court is of the unanimous opinion that your gallant and unprecedented defence of his majestys ship sutherland against a force so superior is deserving of every praise the country and this court can give your conduct together with that of the officers and men under your command reflects not only the highest honour on you but on the country at large you are therefore most honourably acquitted there was a little confirmatory buzz from the other members of the court and a general bustle in the cabin somebody was buckling the hundredguinea sword to his waist someone else was patting his shoulder hookham frere was there too speaking insistently congratulations sir and now are you ready to accompany me to london i have had a post chaise horsed and waiting this last six hours the mists were only clearing slowly everything was still vague about him as he allowed himself to be led away to be escorted on deck to be handed down into the barge alongside somebody was cheering hundreds of voices were cheering the victorys crew had manned the yards and were yelling themselves hoarse all the other ships at anchor there were cheering him this was fame this was success precious few other captains had ever been cheered by all the ships in a fleet like this i would suggest that you take off your hat sir said freres voice in his ear and show how much you appreciate the compliment he took off his hat and sat there in the afternoon sun awkwardly in the sternsheets of the barge he tried to smile but he knew his smile to be wooden he was nearer tears than smiles the mists were closing round him again and the deepchested bellowing was like the shrill piping of children in his ears the boat rasped against the wall there was more cheering here as they handed him up people were thumping him on the shoulder wringing his hand while a blaspheming party of marines forced a passage for him to the post chaise with its horses restless amid the din then a clatter of hoofs and a grinding of wheels and they were flying out of the yard the postillion cracking his whip a highly satisfactory demonstration of sentiment on the part of the public and of the armed forces of the crown said frere mopping his face hornblower suddenly remembered something which made him sit up tense stop at the church he yelled to the postillion indeed sir and might i ask why you gave that order i have the express commands of his royal highness to escort you to london without losing a moment my wife is buried there snapped hornblower but the visit to the grave was unsatisfactory was bound to be with frere fidgeting and fuming at his elbow and looking at his watch hornblower pulled off his hat and bowed his head by the grave with its carved headstone but he was too much in a whirl to think clearly he tried to murmur a prayer maria would have liked that for she was always pained by his free thinking frere clucked with impatience come along then said hornblower turning on his heel and leading the way back to the post chaise the sun shone gloriously over the countryside as they left the town behind them lighting up the lovely green of the trees and the majestic rolling downs hornblower found himself swallowing hard this was the england for which he had fought for eighteen long years and as he breathed its air and gazed round him he felt that england was worth it damned lucky for the ministry said frere this escape of yours something like that was needed even though wellingtons just captured almeida the mob was growing restive we had a ministry of all the talents once now its a ministry of no talent i cant imagine why castlereagh and canning fought that duel it nearly wrecked us so did gambiers affair at the basque roads cochranes been making a thorough nuisance of himself in the house ever since has it ever occurred to you that you might enter parliament well it will be time enough to discuss that when youve been to downing street its sufficient at present that youve given the mob something to cheer about mr frere seemed to take much for granted for instance that hornblower was wholeheartedly on the government side and that hornblower had fought at rosas bay and had escaped from france solely to maintain a dozen politicians in office it rather damped hornblowers spirits he sat silent listening to the rattle of the wheels hrh is none too helpful said frere he didnt turn us out when he assumed the regency but he bears us no love the regency bill didnt please him remember that when you see him tomorrow he likes a bit of flattery too if you can make him believe that you owe your success to the inspiring examples both of hrh and of mr spencer perceval you will be taking the right line whats this horndean the postillion drew the horses to a halt outside the inn and ostlers came running with a fresh pair sixty miles from london commented mr frere weve just time the inn servants had been eagerly questioning the postillion and a knot of loungers smocked agricultural workers and a travelling tinker joined them looking eagerly at hornblower in his blue and gold someone else came hastening out of the inn his red face and silk cravat and leather leggings seemed to indicate him as the local squire acquitted sir he asked naturally sir replied frere at once most honourably acquitted hooray for hornblower yelled the tinker throwing his hat into the air the squire waved his arms and stamped with joy and the farm hands echoed the cheer down with boney said frere drive on it is surprising how much interest has been aroused in your case said frere a minute later although naturally one would expect it to be greatest along the portsmouth road yes said hornblower i can remember said frere when the mob were howling for wellington to be hanged drawn and quartered that was after the news of cintra i thought we were gone then it was his court of inquiry which saved us as it happened just as yours is going to do now do you remember cintra i was commanding a frigate in the pacific at the time said hornblower curtly he was vaguely irritated and he was surprised at himself at finding that he neither liked being cheered by tinkers nor flattered by politicians all the same said frere its just as well that leighton was hit at rosas not that i wished him harm but it drew the teeth of that gang it would have been them or us otherwise i fancy his friends counted twenty votes on a division you know his widow ive heard i have that honour a charming woman for those who are partial to that type and most influential as a link between the wellesley party and her late husbands yes said hornblower all the pleasure was evaporating from his success the radiant afternoon sunshine seemed to have lost its brightness petersfield is just over the hill said frere i expect therell be a crowd there frere was right there were twenty or thirty people waiting at the red lion and more came hurrying up all agog to hear the result of the court martial there was wild cheering at the news and mr frere took the opportunity to slip in a good word for the government its the newspapers grumbled frere as they drove on with fresh horses i wish we could take a lead out of boneys book and only allow em to publish what we think they ought to know emancipation reform naval policy the mob wants a finger in every pie nowadays even the marvellous beauty of the devils punch bowl was lost on hornblower as they drove past it all the savour was gone from life he was wishing he was still an unnoticed naval captain battling with atlantic storms every stride the horses were taking was carrying him nearer to barbara and yet he was conscious of a sick vague desire that he was returning to maria dull and uninteresting and undisturbing the crowd that cheered him at guildford market day was just over stank of sweat and beer he was glad that with the approach of evening frere ceased talking and left him to his thoughts depressing though they were it was growing dark when they changed horses again at esher it is satisfactory to think that no footpad or highwayman will rob us laughed frere we have only to mention the name of the hero of the hour to escape scot free no footpad or highwayman interfered with them at all as it happened unmolested they crossed the river at putney and drove on past the more frequent houses and along the dark streets number ten downing street postie said frere what hornblower remembered most vividly of the interview that followed was freres first sotto voce whisper to perceval hes safe which he overheard the interview lasted no more than ten minutes formal on the one side reserved on the other the prime minister was not in talkative mood apparently his main wish seemed to be to inspect this man who might perhaps do him an ill turn with the prince regent or with the public hornblower formed no very favourable impression either of his ability or of his personal charm pall mall and the war office next said frere god how we have to work london smelt of horses it always did hornblower remembered to men fresh from the sea the lights of whitehall seemed astonishingly bright at the war office there was a young lord to see him someone whom hornblower liked at first sight palmerston was his name the under secretary of state he asked a great many intelligent questions regarding the state of opinion in france the success of the last harvest the manner of hornblowers escape he nodded approvingly when hornblower hesitated to answer when asked the name of the man who had given him shelter quite right he said youre afraid some damned foolll blab it out and get him shot some damned fool probably would ill ask you for it if ever we need it badly and you will be able to rely on us then and what happened to these galley slaves the first lieutenant in the triumph pressed them for the service my lord so theyve been hands in a kings ship for the last three weeks id rather be a galley slave myself hornblower was of the same opinion he was glad to find someone in high position with no illusions regarding the hardships of the service ill have them traced and brought home if i can persuade your superiors at the admiralty to give em up i can find a better use for em a footman brought in a note which palmerston opened his royal highness commands your presence he announced thank you captain i hope i shall again have the pleasure of meeting you shortly this discussion of ours has been most profitable and the luddites have been smashing machinery in the north and sam whitbread has been raising cain in the house so that your arrival is most opportune good evening captain it was those last words which spoilt the whole effect lord palmerston planning a new campaign against bonaparte won hornblowers respect but lord palmerston echoing freres estimate of the political results of hornblowers return lost it again what does his royal highness want of me he asked of frere as they went down the stairs together thats to be a surprise for you replied frere archly you may even have to wait until tomorrows levee to find out it isnt often prinnys sober enough for business at this time in the evening probably hes not you may find tact necessary in your interview with him it was only this morning thought hornblower his head whirling that he had been sitting listening to the evidence at his court martial so much had already happened today he was surfeited with new experiences he was sick and depressed and lady barbara and his little son were in bond street not a quarter of a mile away what time is it he asked ten oclock young pam keeps late hours at the war office hes a glutton for work oh said hornblower god only knew at what hour he would escape from the palace he would certainly have to wait until tomorrow before he called at bond street at the door a coach was waiting coachmen and footmen in the royal red liveries sent by the lord chamberlain explained frere kind of him he handed hornblower in through the door and climbed after him ever met his royal highness he went on no but youve been to court i have attended two levees i was presented to king george in ah prinnys not like his father and you know clarence i suppose yes the carriage had stopped at a doorway brightly lit with lanterns the door was opened and a little group of footmen were awaiting to hand them out there was a glittering entrance hall where somebody in uniform and powder and with a white staff ran his eyes keenly over hornblower hat under your arm he whispered this way please captain hornblower mr hookham frere somebody announced it was an immense room dazzling with the light of its candles a wide expanse of polished floor and at the far end a group of people bright with gold lace and jewels somebody came over to them dressed in naval uniform it was the duke of clarence popeyed and pineappleheaded ah hornblower he said hand held out welcome home hornblower bowed over the hand come and be presented this is captain hornblower sir evenin captain corpulent handsome and dissipated weak and sly was the sequence of impressions hornblower received as he made his bow the thinning curls were obviously dyed the moist eyes and the ruddy pendulous cheeks seemed to hint that his royal highness had dined well which was more than hornblower had everyones been talkin about you captain ever since your cutter whats its name now came in to portsmouth indeed sir hornblower was standing stiffly at attention yes and damme so they ought to so they ought to damme captain best piece of work i ever heard of good as i could have done myself here conyngham make the presentations hornblower bowed to lady this and lady that to lord somebody and to sir john somebodyelse bold eyes and bare arms exquisite clothes and blue garterribbons were all the impressions hornblower received he was conscious that the uniform made for him by the victorys tailor was a bad fit now lets get the business done with said the prince call those fellows in someone was spreading a carpet on the floor someone else was bearing in a cushion on which something winked and sparkled there was a little procession of three solemn men in red cloaks someone dropped on one knee to present the prince with a sword kneel sir said lord conyngham to hornblower he felt the accolade and heard the formal words which dubbed him knight but when he rose a little dazed the ceremony was by no means over there was a ribbon to be hung over his shoulder a star to be pinned on his breast a red cloak to be draped about him a vow to be repeated and signatures written he was being invested as a knight of the most honourable order of the bath as someone loudly proclaimed he was sir horatio hornblower with a ribbon and star to wear for the rest of his life at last they took the cloak from his shoulders again and the officials of the order withdrew let me be the first to congratulate you sir horatio said the duke of clarence coming forward his kindly imbecile face wreathed in smiles thank you sir said hornblower the broad star thumped his chest as he bowed again my best wishes colonel said the prince regent hornblower was conscious of all the eyes turned on him at that speech it was that which warned him that the prince was not making a slip regarding his rank sir he said inquiringly as seemed to be expected of him his royal highness explained the duke has been pleased to appoint you one of his colonels of marines a colonel of marines received pay to the amount of twelve hundred pounds a year and did no duty for it it was an appointment given as a reward to successful captains to be held until they reach flag rank six thousand pounds he had already hornblower remembered now he had twelve hundred a year in addition to his captains half pay at least he had attained financial security at last for the first time in his life he had a title a ribbon and star he had everything he had ever dreamed of having in fact the poor mans dazed laughed the regent loudly delighted i am overwhelmed sir said hornblower trying to concentrate again on the business in hand i hardly know how to thank your royal highness thank me by joining us at hazard your arrival interrupted a damned interesting game ring that bell sir john and lets have some wine sit here beside lady jane captain surely you want to play yes i know about you hookham you want to slip away and tell john walter that ive done my duty you might suggest at the same time that he writes one of his damned leaders and has my civil list raised i work hard enough for it god knows but i dont see why you should take the captain away oh very well then damn it you can go if you want to i didnt imagine said frere when they were safely in the coach again that youd care to play hazard i wouldnt not with prinny if he were using his own dice well how does it feel to be sir horatio very well said hornblower he was digesting the regents allusion to john walter this was the editor of the times he knew it was beginning to dawn upon him that his investiture as knight of the bath and appointment as colonel of marines were useful pieces of news presumably their announcement would have some influence politically too that was the reason for haste they would convince doubting people that the governments naval officers were achieving great things it was almost as much a political move to make him a knight as was bonapartes scheme to shoot him for violating the laws of war the thought took a great deal of the pleasure out of it i took the liberty said frere of engaging a room for you at the golden cross youll find them expecting you i had your baggage sent round shall i stop the coach there or do you want to visit fladongs first hornblower wanted to be alone the idea of visiting the naval coffee house tonight for the first time in five years had no appeal for him especially as he felt suddenly selfconscious in his ribbon and star even at the hotel it was bad enough with host and boots and chambermaid all unctuously deferential with their yes sir horatio and no sir horatio making a procession out of lighting him up to his room and fluttering round him to see that he had all he wanted when all he wanted now was to be left in peace there was little enough peace for him all the same when he climbed into bed resolutely as he put out of his mind all recollection of the wild doings of the day he could not stop himself thinking about the fact that tomorrow he would be seeing his son and lady barbara he spent a restless night chapter nineteen sir horatio hornblower announced the butler holding open the door for him lady barbara was there it was a surprise to see her in black hornblower had been visualizing her as dressed in the blue gown she had worn when last he had seen her the greyblue which matched her eyes she was in mourning now of course for leighton had been dead less than a year still but the black dress suited her well her skin was creamy white against it hornblower remembered with a strange pang the golden tang of her cheeks in those old days on board the lydia welcome she said her hands outstretched to him they were smooth and cool and delicious he remembered their touch of old the nurse will bring richard directly meanwhile my heartiest congratulations on your success thank you said hornblower i was extremely lucky maam the lucky man said lady barbara is usually the man who knows how much to leave to chance while he digested this statement he stood awkwardly looking at her until this moment he had forgotten how olympian she was what selfassurance kindly selfassurance she had which raised her to inaccessible heights and made him feel like a loutish schoolboy his knighthood must appear ridiculously unimportant to her the daughter of an earl the sister of a marquis and of a viscount who was well on his way towards a dukedom he was suddenly acutely conscious of his elbows and hands his awkwardness only ended with the opening of the door and the entrance of the nurse plump and rosy in her ribboned cap the baby held to her shoulder she dropped a curtsey hullo son said hornblower gently he did not seem to have much hair yet under his little cap but there were two startling brown eyes looking out at his father nose and chin and forehead might be as indeterminate as one would expect in a baby but there was no ignoring those eyes hullo baby said hornblower gently again he was unconscious of the caress in his voice he was speaking to richard as years before he had spoken to little horatio and little maria he held up his hands to the child come to your father he said richard made no objections it was a little shock to hornblower to feel how tiny and light he was hornblower years ago had grown used to older children but the feeling passed immediately there baby there said hornblower richard wriggled in his arms stretching out his hands to the shining gold fringe of his epaulette pretty asked hornblower da said richard touching the threads of bullion thats a man said hornblower his old skill with babies had not deserted him richard gurgled happily in his arms smiled seraphically as he played with him kicked his chest with tiny kicks through his dress that good old trick of bowing the head and pretending to butt richard in the stomach had its neverfailing success richard gurgled and waved his arms in ecstasy what a joke said hornblower oh what a joke suddenly remembering he looked round at lady barbara she had eyes only for the baby her serenity strangely exalted her smile tender he thought then that she was moved by her love for the child richard noticed her too goo he said with a jab of an arm in her direction she came nearer and richard reached over his fathers shoulder to touch her face hes a fine baby said hornblower o course hes a fine babby said the wet nurse reaching for him she took it for granted that godlike fathers in glittering uniforms would only condescend to notice their children for ten seconds consecutively and would need to be instantly relieved of them at the end of that time hes a saucy one said the wet nurse the baby back in her arms he wriggled there those big brown eyes of his looking from hornblower to barbara say bye bye said the nurse she held up his wrist and waved his fat fist at them bye bye do you think hes like you asked barbara as the door closed behind the nurse and baby well said hornblower with a doubtful grin he had been happy during those few seconds with the baby happier than he had been for a long long time the morning up to now had been one of black despondency for him he had told himself that he had everything heart could desire and some inner man within him had replied that he wanted none of it in the morning light his ribbon and star had appeared gaudy gewgaws he never could contrive to feel proud of himself there was something vaguely ridiculous about the name sir horatio hornblower just as he always felt there was something vaguely ridiculous about himself he had tried to comfort himself with the thought of all the money he had there was a life of ease and security before him he would never again have to pawn his goldhilted sword nor feel selfconscious in good society about the pinchbeck buckles on his shoes and yet the prospect was frightening now that it was certain there was something of confinement about it something reminiscent of these weary weeks in the chteau de graay how well he remembered how he fretted there unease and insecurity which had appeared such vast evils when he suffered under them had something attractive about them now hard though that was to believe he had envied brother captains who had columns about themselves in the newspapers surfeit in that way was attained instantaneously he had discovered bush and brown would love him neither more nor less on account of what the times had to say about him he would scorn the love of those who loved him more and he had good reason to fear that there would be rivals who would love him less he had received the adulation of crowds yesterday that did not heighten his good opinion of crowds and he was filled with a bitter contempt for the upper circle that rules those crowds within him the fighting man and the humanitarian both seethed with discontent happiness was a dead sea fruit that turned to ashes in the mouth decided hornblower generalizing recklessly from his own particular experience prospect and not possession was what gave pleasure and his crossgrainedness would deprive him now that he had made that discovery even of the pleasure in prospect he misdoubted everything so much freedom that could only be bought by marias death was not a freedom worth having honours granted by those that had the granting of them were no honours at all and no security was really worth the loss of insecurity what life gave with one hand she took back with the other the political career of which he had once dreamed was open to him now especially with the alliance of the wellesley faction but he could see with morbid clarity how often he would hate it and he had been happy for thirty seconds with his son and now more morbidly still he asked himself cynically if that happiness could endure for thirty years his eyes met barbaras again and he knew she was his for the asking to those who did not know and understand who thought there was romance in his life when really it was the most prosaic of lives that would be a romantic climax she was smiling at him and then he saw her lips tremble as she smiled he remembered how marie had said he was a man whom women loved easily and he felt uncomfortable at being reminded of her end
