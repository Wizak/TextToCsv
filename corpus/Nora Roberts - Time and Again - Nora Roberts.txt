nora roberts time and again time was chapter he was going down the instrument panel was a maze of wildly flashing numbers and lights and the cockpit was spinning like a merrygoround gone mad he didnt need the scream of warning bells to tell him he was in trouble he didnt need the insistent red blip on his computer screen to tell him the trouble was big hed known that the moment hed seen the void swearing clamping down on his panic he struggled with the controls using one hand to shove the lever forward for full power the vehicle bucked and shuddered fighting the gravitational pull the gs hit him like a wall all around him metal screamed against metal hold together baby he managed to say as his lips stretched back over his teeth the floor near his feet ripped open in a jagged line three inches long hold together you son of a he jammed hard due east swearing again when it seemed that no matter how cleverly he maneuvered he and his ship would be sucked into the hole the cockpit lights went out leaving only the whirl of kaleidoscopic colors from the instrument panel his ship went into a spiral tumbling end over end like a stone fired from a slingshot now the light was white hot and brilliant instinctively he threw up an arm to shield his eyes the sudden crushing pressure on his chest left him helpless to do more than gasp for breath briefly before he lost consciousness he remembered that his mother had wanted him to be a lawyer but hed just had to fly when he came to he was no longer spiralinghe was in a screaming freefall a glance at his instruments showed him only that they were damaged the numbers racing backward a new force had him plastered back against his seat but he could see the curve of the earth knowing he could pass out again at any moment he lunged forward to knock the throttle back and turn the ship over to the computer it would he knew scan for an unpopulated area and if god was in his heaven the crash control in the old bucket would still be functional maybe just maybe hed live to see another sunrise and how bad could practicing law be he watched the world rush toward him blue and green and beautiful the hell with it he thought flying a desk would never be like this libby stood on the porch of the cabin and watched the night sky boil the wicked slices of lightning and the blowing curtain of rain were the best show in town even though she was standing under the overhang her hair and her face were wet behind her the lights in the cabin glowed a warm cozy yellow the next boom of thunder made her grateful shed set out candles and kerosene lamps but the light and warmth didnt lure her back tonight she preferred the chill and the crashing power that was barreling through the mountains if the storm kept up much longer it would be weeks before the north pass through the mountains was negotiable it didnt matter she thought as another spear of lightning split the sky she had weeks in fact she thought with a grin hugging herself against the brisk wind she had all the time in the world the best decision shed ever made had been to pack up and dig in at her familys hideaway cabin shed always had an affection for mountains the klamaths of southwestern oregon had everything she wanted a spectacular view high rugged peaks pure air and solitude if it took six months to write her dissertation on the effects of modernizing influences on the kolbari islanders then so be it shed spent five years studying cultural anthropology three of them in extensive field work she hadnt let up on herself since her eighteenth birthday and she certainly hadnt given herself any time alone away from family studies and other scientists the dissertation was important to hertoo important she could sometimes admit coming here to work alone giving herself a little time for selfstudy was an excellent compromise shed been born in the squat twostory cabin behind her and shed spent the first five years of her life here in these mountains living as free and unfettered as a deer it made her smile to remember how she and her younger sister had run barefoot how they had believed the world began and ended with them and their counterculture parents she could still picture her mother weaving mats and rugs and her father digging happily in his garden at night there had been music and long fascinating stories the four of them had been happily selfsufficient seeing other people only on their monthly trips to brookings for supplies they might have continued just that way but the sixties had become the seventies an art dealer had discovered one of libbys mothers wall hangings almost simultaneously her father had found that a certain mixture of his homegrown herbs brewed into a soothing and delicious tea before libbys eighth birthday her mother had become a respected artist and her father a successful young entrepreneur the cabin had become a vacation hideaway when the family had moved into the portland mainstream perhaps it was libbys own culture shock that had steered her toward anthropology her fascination with it with societys structures and the effects of outside influences had often dominated her life sometimes she nearly forgot the times she was living in with her avid quest for answers whenever that happened she came back here or took a few days to visit her family that was all it took to ground her in the present starting tomorrow she decided if the storm was over she would turn her computer on and get to work but only for four hours a day for the past eighteen months she had too often worked triple that everything in its timethat was what her mother had always said well this time she was going to get back a little of the freedom shed experienced during the first five years of her life peaceful libby let the wind rush through her hair and listened to the hammering of rain on rock and earth despite the storm and the rocketing thunder she felt serene in all her life she had never known a more peaceful spot she saw the light race across the sky and for a moment she was fooled into thinking it might be ball lightning or perhaps a meteor but when the sky lit up she caught a vague outline and a quick flash of metal she stepped forward into the rain instinctively narrowing her eyes as the object rushed closer she raised her hand to her throat a plane even as she watched it seemed to skim the tops of the firs just to the west of the cabin the crash echoed through the woods leaving her frozen to the spot then she was running back into the cabin for her slicker and her firstaid kit moments later with the thunder rolling overhead she clambered into her land rover shed noted the spot where shed seen the plane go down and she could only hope her sense of direction was as keen as it had always been it took her almost thirty minutes of fighting both the blinding storm and the rainrutted roads and logging trails she gritted her teeth as the land rover plunged through a swollen stream she knew all too well the dangers of flash floods in the mountains still she kept her speed just above the point of safety negotiating the twists and turns as much from instinct as from memory as it happened she almost ran over him libby hit the brakes hard when her headlights beamed over a figure crumpled at the side of the narrow trail the land rover skidded spitting mud before the wheels grabbed hold grabbing her flashlight she scrambled out to kneel beside him alive she felt a surge of relief when she pressed her fingers against the pulse in his throat he was dressed all in black and he was already soaked to the skin automatically she tossed the blanket she was carrying over him and began to probe for broken bones he was young and lean and well muscled as she examined him she prayed that those facts would work in his favor ignoring the lightning racing across the sky she played her flashlight over his face the gash on his forehead concerned her even in the driving rain she could see that it was bleeding badly but the possibility of a broken back or neck made her reluctant to shift him moving quickly she went back for the firstaid kit she was applying a butterfly bandage to his wound when he opened his eyes thank god that single thought ran through her mind as she instinctively took his hand to soothe him youre going to be all right dont worry are you alone he stared at her but saw only a vague outline what was there anyone with you is anyone else hurt no he struggled to sit up the world spun again as he grabbed at her for support his hands slid off her wet slicker im alone he managed before he blacked out again he had no idea just how alone libby slept in snatches most of the night shed been able to get him inside the cabin and as far as the couch shed stripped him dried him and tended his wounds before shed fallen into a half doze in the big armchair by the fire periodically she rose to check his pulse and pupils he was in shock and shed decided he undoubtedly had a concussion but the rest of his wounds were relatively minor some bruised ribs and a few nasty scratches a very lucky man she mused as she sipped her tea and studied him in the firelight most fools were who else but a fool would have been flying through the mountains in a storm like this it was still raging outside the cabin she set the cup aside to throw another log on the fire the light grew sending towering shadows throughout the room a very attractive fool she added with a smile as she arched her sore back he was an inch or two over six feet and well built she considered it good luck for both of them that she was strong accustomed to carrying heavy packs and equipment leaning against the mantle she watched him definitely attractive she thought again hed be even more so when his color returned though he was pale now his face had good bone structure celtic she thought with those lean high cheekbones and that full sculpted mouth it was a face that hadnt seen a razor for a day or two that and the bandage on his forehead gave him a rakish almost dangerous look his eyes were blue she remembered a particularly dark intense blue definitely celtic origins she thought again as she picked up her tea his hair was black coal black and it waved slightly even when it was dry he wore it too long to be military she reflected frowning as she remembered the clothes shed taken off him the black jumpsuit had a decidedly military look to it and there had been some sort of insignia over the breast pocket perhaps he was in some elite section of the air force she shrugged and settled into the chair then again hed worn old scuffed hightop sneakers as well sneakers and a very expensivelooking watchone with a halfdozen tiny dials the only thing shed been able to figure out on it after a brief look was that it wasnt keeping the right time apparently both the watch and its owner had been damaged in the crash i dont know about the watch she told him over a yawn but i think youre going to be all right with that she dozed off again he woke once with a splitting headache and blurred vision there was firelight or a firstclass simulation he could smell the woodsmoke and rain he thought he had a misty memory of having stumbled through the rain the most he could concentrate on was the fact that he was alive and warm he remembered being cold and wet and disoriented afraid at first that he had crashed into an ocean there had been someone a woman low quiet voice soft gentle hands he tried to think but the drumming in his head made the effort too painful he saw her sitting in an old chair with a colorful blanket over her lap a hallucination maybe but it was certainly a pleasant one her hair was dark and the firelight was glinting off it it appeared to be chinlength and very full and was now tousled appealingly around her face she was sleeping he could see the quiet rise and fall of her breasts in this light her skin seemed to glow gold her features were sharp almost exotic set off by a wide mouth that was soft and relaxed in sleep as hallucinations went you couldnt do much better closing his eyes again he slept until sunrise she was gone when he surfaced the second time the fire was still crackling and the dim light coming through the window was watery the pain in his head hadnt dulled but it was bearable with cautious fingertips he probed the bandage on his forehead he realized he might have been unconscious for hours or for days even as he tried to struggle upright he discovered that his body was weak and rubbery so was his mind obviously he decided as he used what strength he had to take in his surroundings the small dimly lit room appeared to be fashioned out of stone and wood hed seen some carefully preserved relics that had been built of such primitive materials his family had once taken a vacation west that had included tours of parks and monuments he turned his head enough so that he could watch the flames eat at the logs the heat was dry and the scent was smoke but it was hardly likely that he would have been given shelter and care in a museum or a historical park the worst part was that he didnt have a clue where he was oh youre awake libby paused in the doorway with a cup of tea in her hand when her patient just stared at her she smiled reassuringly and crossed to the couch he looked so helpless that the shyness she had battled all her life was easily overcome ive been worried about you she sat on the edge of the couch and took his pulse he could see her more clearly now her hair was no longer tousled but was combed sleekly from a side part it was a warm shade of brown exotic was exactly the right word to describe her he decided with her longlidded eyes slender nose and full mouth in profile she reminded him of a drawing hed once seen of the ancient egyptian queen cleopatra the fingers that lay lightly on his wrist were cool who are you steady she thought with a nod as she continued to monitor his pulse and stronger im not florence nightingale but im all youve got she smiled again and holding each of his eyelids up in turn peered closely at his pupils how many of me do you see how many should i see with a chuckle she arranged a pillow behind his back just one but since youre concussed you may be seeing twins i only see one smiling he reached up to touch her subtly pointed chin one beautiful one color rushed into her cheeks even as she jerked her head back she wasnt used to being called beautiful only competent try some of this my fathers secret blend it isnt even on the market yet before he could decline she was holding the cup to his lips thanks oddly the flavor brought back a foggy memory of childhood what am i doing here recovering you crashed your plane in the mountains a few miles from here my plane dont you remember a frown came and went in her eyes gold eyes big tawny gold eyes itll come back after a bit i imagine you took a bad hit on the head she urged more tea on him and resisted a foolish urge to brush the hair back from his forehead i was watching the storm or i might not have seen you go down its fortunate youre not hurt more than you are theres no phone in the cabin and the twoways in being repaired so i cant even call for a doctor twoway the radio she said gently do you think you could eat maybe your name liberty stone she set the tea aside then laid a hand on his brow to check for fever she considered it a minor miracle that he hadnt caught a chill my parents were in the first wave of sixties counterculture so im liberty which is better than my sister who got stuck with sunbeam noting his confusion she laughed just call me libby how about you i dont the hand on his brow was cool and real so she had to be real he reasoned but what in the hell was she talking about whats your name i usually like to know who it is ive saved from plane wrecks he opened his mouth to tell herand his mind was blank panic skidded along his spine she saw it whiten his face and glaze his eyes before his fingers clamped hard over her wrist i canti cant remember dont push it she swore silently thinking of the radio she had so conscientiously taken for repairs on her trip in for supplies youre disoriented i want you to rest try to relax and ill fix you something to eat when he closed his eyes she got directly to her feet and started back into the kitchen hed had no identification libby remembered as she began to prepare an omelet no wallet no papers no permits he could be anyone a criminal a psychopath no laughing to herself she grated some cheese over the egg mixture her imagination had always been fruitful hadnt the ability to picture primitive and ancient cultures as real peoplefamilies lovers childrenpushed her forward in her career but imagination aside she had also always been a good judge of character that too probably came from her fascination with people and their habits and she admitted ruefully from the fact that she had always been more comfortable observing people than interacting with them the man who was wrestling with his own demons in her living room wasnt a threat to her whoever he was he was harmless she flipped the omelet expertly then turned to reach for a plate with a shriek she dropped the pan eggs and all her harmless patient was standing gloriously naked in her kitchen doorway hornblower he managed as he started to slide down the jamb caleb hornblower dimly he heard her swearing at him shaking off his giddiness he surfaced to find her face close to his her arms were around him and she was struggling to drag him up in an attempt to help her he reached out and sent them both sprawling winded libby lay flat on her back pinned under his body youd better still be disoriented sorry he had time to register that she was tall and very firm did i knock you down yes her arms were still around him her hands splayed over a ridge of muscle along his back she snatched them away blaming her breathlessness on her fall now if you dont mind youre a little heavy he managed to brace one hand on the floor and push himself up a couple of inches he was dazed he admitted to himself but he wasnt dead and she felt like heaven beneath him maybe im too weak to move was that amusement yes libby decided that was definitely amusement in his eyes that ageless and particularly infuriating male amusement hornblower if you dont move youre going to be a whole lot weaker she caught the quick flash of his grin before she squirmed out from under him she made a halfhearted attempt to keep her eyes on his faceand only his faceas she helped him up if youre going to walk around youre going to have to wait until you can manage it on your own she slipped a supporting hand around his waist and instantly felt a strong uncomfortable reaction and until i dig through my fathers things and find you some pants right he sank gratefully onto the couch this time stay put until i come back he didnt argue he couldnt the walk to the kitchen doorway and back had sapped what strength hed had left it was an odd and unwelcome feeling this weakness he couldnt remember having been sick a day in his adult life true hed bashed himself up pretty good in that aircycle wreck but hed been whateighteen damn it if he could remember that why couldnt he remember how hed gotten here closing his eyes he sat back and tried to think above the throbbing in his head hed wrecked his plane that was what shelibbyhad said he certainly felt as though hed wrecked something it would come back just as his name had come back to him after that initial terrifying blankness she walked back in carrying a plate lucky for you i just laid in supplies when he opened his eyes she hesitated and nearly bobbled the eggs a second time the way he looked she told herself halfnaked with only a blanket tossed over his lap and the glow of the fire dancing over his skin was enough to make any womans hands unsteady then he smiled it smells good my specialty she let out a long quiet breath then sat beside him can you manage it yeah i only get dizzy when i stand up he took the plate and let his hunger hold sway after the first bite he sent her a surprised glance are these real real of course theyre real with a little laugh he took another forkful i havent had real eggs ini dont remember she thought shed read somewhere that the military used egg substitutes these are real eggs from real chickens the way he plowed his way through them made her smile you can have more this should hold me he looked back to see her smiling as she sipped her everpresent cup of tea i guess i havent thanked you for helping me out i just happened to be in the right place at the right time why are you here he took another look around the cabin in this place i suppose you could say im on sabbatical im a cultural anthropologist and ive just finished several months of field research im working on my dissertation here it pleased her that he hadnt made the usual comment about her being too young to be a scientist why not she took his empty plate and set it aside its quietexcept for the occasional plane crash how are your ribs hurt he looked down noticing the bruises for the first time no not really just sore you know youre very lucky except for the head wound you got out of that with cuts and bruises the way you were coming down i didnt expect to find anyone alive the crash control he got a misty image of himself pushing switches lights flashing lights the echo of warning bells he tried to focus to concentrate but it broke apart are you a test pilot what no no i dont think so she put a comforting hand on his then unnerved by the depth of her reaction cautiously removed it again i dont like puzzles he muttered im crazy about them so ill help you put this one together he turned his head until their eyes met maybe you wont like the solution a ripple of unease ran through her hed be strong when his injuries healed his body would be as strong as she sensed his mind was and they were alone as completely alone as any two people could be she shook off the feeling and busied herself drinking tea what was she supposed to do toss him and his concussion out into the rain we wont know until we find it she said at length if the storm lets up i should be able to get you to a doctor in a day or two in the meantime youll have to trust me he did he couldnt have said why but from the moment hed seen her dozing in the chair hed known she was someone he could count on the problem was he didnt know if he could trust himselfor if she could libby she turned toward him again and the moment she did he lost what hed wanted to say you have a nice face he murmured and watched her tawny eyes turn wary he wanted to touch her felt compelled to but the moment he lifted his hand she was up and out of reach i think you should get some more rest theres a spare bedroom upstairs she was speaking quickly now her words fast and edgy i couldnt get you up there last night but youd be more comfortable he studied her for a moment he wasnt used to women backing away from him cal mused over that impression until he was certain it was a true one no when there was attraction between a man and a woman the rest was easy maybe all his circuits werent working but he knew there was attraction on both sides are you matched libbys brows lifted into her fringe of bangs am i what matched do you have a mate she had to laugh thats a quaint way of putting it no not at the moment let me help you upstairs she held up a hand before he could push himself up id really appreciate it if youd keep that blanket on its not cold he said then with a shrug he hooked the material around his hips here lean on me she draped his arm over her shoulder then slipped her own around his waist steady almost when they started forward he found that he was only slightly dizzy he was almost sure he could have made it on his own but he liked the idea of starting up the stairs with his arm wrapped around her ive never been in a place like this before her heart was beating a little too quickly since he was putting almost none of his weight on her she couldnt blame it on exertion proximity however was a different matter i suppose its rustic by most standards but ive always loved it rustic was a mild word for it he mused but he didnt want to offend her always yes i was born here he started to speak again but when he turned his head he caught a whiff of her hair when his body tightened he became aware of his bruises right in here sit at the foot of the bed while i turn it down he did as she asked then ran his hand over one of the bedposts amazed it was wood he was certain it was wood but it didnt seem to be more than twenty or thirty years old and that was ridiculous this bed its comfortable really dad made it so its a little wobbly but the mattress is good cals fingers tightened on the post your father made this its wood solid oak and heavy as a truck believe it or not i was born in it since at that time my parents didnt believe in doctors for something as basic and personal as childbirth i still find it hard to picture my father with his hair in a ponytail and wearing love beads she straightened and caught cal staring at her is something wrong he just shook his head he must need resta lot more rest was this he made a weak gesture to indicate the cabin was this some kind of experiment her eyes softened showing a combination of amusement and affection you could call it that she went to a rickety bureau her father had built after rummaging through it she came up with a pair of sweatpants you can wear these dad always leaves some clothes out here and youre pretty much the same size sure he took her hand before she could leave the room where did you say we were he looked so concerned that she covered his hand with hers oregon southwest oregon just over the california border in the klamath mountains oregon the tension in his fingers relaxed slightly usa the last time i looked concerned she checked for fever again he took her wrist concentrating on keeping his grip light what planet her eyes flew to his if she hadnt known better she would have sworn the man was serious earth you know the third from the sun she said humoring him get some rest hornblower youre just rattled yeah he let out a long breath i guess youre right just yell if you need something he sat where he was when she left him he had a feeling a bad one but she was probably righthe was rattled if he was in oregon in the northern hemisphere of his own planet he wasnt that far off course off course he repeated as his head began to pound what course had he been on he looked down at the watch on his wrist and frowned at the dials in a gesture that came from instinct rather than thought he pressed the small stem on the side the dials faded and a series of red numbers blinked on the black face los angeles a wave of relief washed over him as he recognized the coordinates hed been returning to base in la after after what damn it he lay down slowly and discovered that libby had been right the bed was surprisingly comfortable maybe if he just went to sleep clocked out for a few hours he would remember the rest because it seemed important to her cal tugged on the sweats what had she gotten herself into libby wondered she sat in front of her computer and stared at the blank screen she had a sick man on her handsan incredibly goodlooking sick man one with a concussion partial amnesia and eyes to die for she sighed and propped her chin on her hands the concussion she could handle shed considered learning extensive first aid as important as studying the tribal habits of western man fieldwork often took scientists to remote places where doctors and hospitals didnt exist but her training didnt help her with the amnesia and it certainly didnt help her with his eyes her knowledge of man came straight out of books and usually dealt with his cultural and sociopolitical habits any oneonone had been purely scientific research she could put up a good front when it was necessary her battle with a crushing shyness had been long and hard ambition had pushed her through driving her to ask questions when she would have preferred to have melded with the background and been ignored it had given her the strength to travel to work with strangers to make a select few trusted friends but when it came to a personal manwoman relationship for the most part the men she saw socially were easily dissuaded the majority of them were intimidated by her mind which she admitted was usually onetrack then there was her family thinking of them made her smile her mother was still the dreamy artist who had once woven blankets on a handmade loom and her father libby shook her head as she thought of him william stone might have made a fortune with herbal delights but he would never be a threepiecesuit executive bob dylan music and board meetings lost causes and profit margins the one man shed brought home to a family dinner had left confused and unnervedand undoubtedly hungry libby remembered with a laugh he hadnt been able to do more than stare at her mothers zucchiniandsoybean soufflвђљ libby was a combination of her parents idealism scientific practicality and dreamy romanticism she believed in causes in mathematical equations and in fairy tales a quick mind and a thirst for knowledge had locked her far too tightly to her work to leave room for real romance and the truth was that real romance when applied to her scared the devil out of her so she sought it in the past in the study of human relationships she was twentythree and as caleb hornblower had put it unmatched she liked the phrase found it accurate and concise on the one hand and highly romantic on the other to be matched she mused was the perfect way to describe a relationship she corrected herself a true relationship like her parents perhaps the reason she was more at ease with her studies than with men was that she had yet to meet her match satisfied with her analysis she slipped on her glasses and went to work chapter the rain had slowed when he woke it was only a hiss and patter against the windows it was as soothing as a sleep tape cal lay still for a moment reminding himself where he was and struggling to remember why hed dreamed something about flashing lights and a huge black void the dreams had brought a clammy sweat to his skin and had accelerated his heartbeat he made a conscious effort to level it pilots had to have a strong and thorough control over their bodies and their emotions decisions often had to be made instantly even instinctively and the rigors of flight required a disciplined healthy body he was a pilot he kept his eyes closed and concentrated on that hed always wanted to fly hed been trained his mouth went dry as he fought to remember anything any small piece the isf he closed his hands into fists until his pulse leveled again hed been with the isf and earned a captaincy captain hornblower that was right he was sure of it captain caleb hornblower cal everyone called him cal except his mother a tall striking woman with a quick temper and an easy laugh a new flood of emotion struck him he could see her somehow that more than anything else gave him a sense of identity he had familynot a mate of that he was sure but parents and a brother his father was a quiet man steady dependable his brother jacob cal let out a quiet breath as the name and the image formed in his mind jacob was brilliant impulsive stubborn because his head was pounding again he let it go it was enough his eyes opened slowly and he thought of libby who was she not just a beautiful woman with warm brown hair and eyes like a cat being beautiful was easy even ordinary she didnt strike him as ordinary perhaps it was the place he frowned at the log walls and the gleaming glass windows nothing was ordinary here and certainly no woman he had ever known would have chosen to live here like this alone had she really been born in the bed he was now in or had she been joking it occurred to cal that a great deal of her behavior was odd and perhaps there was a joke somewhere and hed missed the punch line a cultural anthropologist he mused that might explain it it was possible hed dropped down in the middle of some kind of field experiment a simulation for her own reasons liberty stone was living in the fashion of the era she studied it was odd certainly but as far as he was concerned most scientists were a bit odd he could certainly understand looking toward the future but why anyone would want to dig back into the past was beyond him the past was done and couldnt be changed or fixed so why study it her business he supposed he owed her from what he could piece together he might well have died if she hadnt come along hed have to pay her back as soon as he was working on all thrusters again it pleased him to know that he was a man who settled debts liberty stone libby he turned her name over in his mind and smiled he liked the sound of her name the soft sound of it soft like her eyes it was one thing to be beautiful it was another to have gorgeous velvet eyes you could change the color of them the shape but never the expression maybe it was that that made her so appealing everything she felt seemed to leap right into her eyes hed managed to stir a variety of feelings in her cal thought as he pushed himself up in bed concern fear humor desire and she had stirred him even through his confusion hed felt a strong healthy response a manwoman response he dropped his head into his hands as the room spun his system might be churning for libby stone but he was far from ready to do anything about it more than a little disgusted he settled back on the pillows a little more rest he decided a day or two of letting his body heal should snap his mind and his memory back he knew who he was and where he was the rest would come a book on the table beside the bed caught his eye hed always liked to read almost as much as hed liked to fly he preferred the written word to tapes or disks that was another good and solid memory pleased with it cal picked up the book the title puzzled him journey to andromeda seemed a particularly foolish name for a book especially when it was touted as science fiction anyone with a free weekend could journey to andromedaif he liked being bored into a coma with a small frown he started to leaf through the book then his eyes fell on the copyright page that was wrong the clammy sweat was back that was ridiculous the book he was holding was new the back hadnt been broken and the pages looked as though theyd never been turned some stupid clerical error he told himself but his mouth was bonedry it had to be an error how else could he be holding a book that had been published nearly three centuries ago absorbed in her work libby ignored the small circle of pain at the center of her back she knew very well that posture was important when she was writing for several hours at a stretch but once she lost herself in ancient or primitive civilizations she always forgot everything else she hadnt eaten since breakfast and the tea shed carried up with her was stonecold her notes and reference books were scattered everywhere along with clothes she hadnt yet put away and the stack of newspapers shed picked up at the store shed toed off her shoes and had her stockinged feet curled around the legs of her chair occasionally she stopped hammering at the keyboard to push her round black framed glasses back on her nose it cannot be argued that the addition of modern implements has a strong and not always positive effect on an isolated culture such as the kolbari the islanders have remained in the latter years of the twentieth century at a folk level and do not as has been implied in the human relations area files seek integration with the modern industrial societies what may be seen by certain factions as offering the convenience of progress medically industrially educationally is most often libby what the word came but in a hiss of annoyance before she turned oh she spotted cal pale and shaky with one hand braced on the doorframe and the other wrapped around a paperback what are you doing up hornblower i told you to call if you needed anything annoyed with him and with the interruption she rose to help him to a chair the moment she touched his arm he jerked away what are you wearing on your face the tone of his voice had her moistening her lips it was fury with a touch of fear a dangerous combination glasses reading glasses i know what they are damn it why are you wearing them go slow she warned herself she took his arm gently and spoke as if she were soothing a wounded lion i need them to work why havent you had them fixed my glasses he gritted his teeth your eyes why havent you had your eyes fixed cautious she took the glasses off and held them behind her back why dont you sit down he only shook his head i want to know the meaning of this libby looked at the book in his hand the one he was shaking in her face she cleared her throat i dont know the meaning since i havent read it i imagine my father left it here hes into science fiction thats not what i patience he told himself he had never had an abundance of it and now was the time to use all he could find open it up to the copyright page all right i will if youll sit youre not looking well he reached the chair in two rocky strides open it read the date head injuries could often cause erratic behavior libby thought she didnt believe he was dangerous but all the same she decided it was best to humor him and read the year out loud then she tried an easy smile hot off the presses she added is that supposed to be a joke im not sure he was furious she realized and terrified caleb she said his name quietly as she crouched beside him does that book have something to do with your work my work the question threw her off enough to have her frowning at him then at the computer behind her im an anthropologist that means i study i know what it means patience be damned he thought incensed he snatched the book from her i want to know what this means its just a book if i know my father its secondrate science fiction about invasions from the planet kriswold you know mutants and ray guns and space warriors that kind of thing she eased it from his hand let me get you back to bed ill make you some soup he looked at her saw the soft eyes overflowing with concern the encouraging half smile and the nerves his gaze shifted to where her hand lay almost protectively over his despite the fact that he had obviously frightened her there was a link there it was absurd to believe that almost as absurd as it was to believe the date in the book maybe im losing my mind no her fear forgotten she lifted her free hand to his face soothing him as she would have anyone who seemed so utterly lost youre hurt he closed surprisingly strong fingers over her wrist jolted the memory banks yeah maybe libby his eyes were suddenly intense almost desperate whats the date today its may the th or th i lose track no the whole thing he fought to keep the urgency out of his voice please okay its probably tuesday the th then she repeated the year hows that fine he pulled out every ounce of control and managed to smile at her one of them was crazy and he dearly hoped it was libby you got anything to drink around here besides that tea she frowned for a moment then her face cleared brandy theres always some downstairs hold on a minute yeah thanks he waited until he heard her moving down the stairs then cautiously he rose and pulled open the first drawer that came to hand there had to be something in this ridiculous place to tell him what was going on he found lingerie neatly stacked despite the chaos of the rest of the room he frowned a moment over the styles and materials shed said she wasnt matched yet it was obvious that she wore things to please a man apparently she preferred the romance of past eras even when it came to her underwear far from comfortable with the ease with which he could picture libby in this little chocolatebrown swatch with the white lace he shoved the drawer shut again the next drawer was just as tidy and held jeans and sturdy hiking pants he puzzled for a moment over a zipper ran it slowly up and down then shoved the jeans back into place annoyed he turned and started toward her desk where her computer continued to hum he had time to think it was a noisy archaic machine before he stumbled over the pile of newspapers he didnt scan the headlines or study the picture his eyes were drawn to the date he was unarguably in the twentieth century his stomach clenched ignoring the sudden buzzing in his ears he bent to snatch up the paper words danced in front of his eyes something about arms talksnuclear arms he noted with a kind of dull horrorand hail damage in the midwest there was a tease about the mariners trouncing the braves very slowly knowing his legs would give out in a moment he lowered himself back into the chair it was too bad he thought dully it was too damn bad but it wasnt libby stone who was going crazy caleb the moment she saw his face libby rushed into the room with brandy sloshing in a snifter youre white as a sheet its nothing he had to be careful now very careful i guess i stood up too fast i think you really could use some of this she held the snifter until she was certain he had both hands on it take it slow she began but hed already drained it sitting back on her heels she frowned at him that should cure you or knock you out again the brandy was the genuine article and no hallucination he decided it was velvet fire coursing down his throat he closed his eyes and let the fire spread im still a little disoriented how long have i been here since last night the color was coming back she noted his voice sounded calmer more controlled it wasnt until her muscles relaxed that she realized how tightly theyd been tensed i guess i saw you crash about midnight you saw it well i saw the lights and heard you hit she smiled continuing to monitor his pulse when he opened his eyes again for a minute i thought i was seeing a meteor or a ufo or something aa ufo he repeated dazed not that i believe in extraterrestrials or spaceships or anything but my fathers always been fascinated by that kind of thing i realized it was a plane he was staring at her again she thought but there was curiosity rather than anger in his eyes feeling better he couldnt have begun to tell her how and what he was feeling cal had an idea that that was all for the best he needed to think before he said too much some still hoping it was all some bizarre mistake he rattled the paper in his hand whered you get this i drove into brookings a couple of days ago thats about seventy miles from here i picked up supplies and a few newspapers she glanced absently at the one in his hand i havent gotten around to reading any of them yet so theyre already old news yeah he looked at the papers that were still on the floor old news with a laugh she rose and began to make an effort to tidy the room i always feel so cut off here more so than when im in the field hundreds of miles away i imagine we could establish a colony on mars and i wouldnt hear about it until it was all over a colony on mars he murmured feeling his stomach sink as he glanced at the paper again i think youve got about a hundred years to go sorry ill miss it with a sigh she looked out the window rains starting up again maybe we can catch the weather on the early news after stepping over books she flicked on a small portable television after a moment a snowy picture blinked on she dragged a hand through her hair and decided to watch without her glasses the weather should be on in acaleb she tilted her head to one side fascinated by his dumbstruck expression id swear youd never seen a television in your life what he brought himself back wishing he had another brandy a television hed heard of them of course in the same way libby had heard of covered wagons i didnt realize you had one were rustic she told him not primitive she narrowed her eyes when he gave a choked laugh maybe you should lie down again yeah and when he woke up again this would all have been a dream mind if i take these papers she stood to help him up i dont know if you should be reading i think thats the least of my worries he discovered that the room didnt spin this time but it was still a comfort to drape his arm around her shoulders strong shoulders he thought and a soft scent libby if i wake up and find out this has all been an illusion i want you to know youve been the best part of it thats nice i mean it the brandy and his own weakened system were taking over because his mind felt as if it had been fried in a solar blast he didnt fight it she had little trouble easing him into bed but his arm stayed around her shoulders long enough to keep her close just close enough to brush his lips over hers the very best she jerked back like a spring he was asleep and her blood was pounding who was caleb hornblower the question interrupted libbys work throughout the evening her interest in the kolbari islanders didnt even come close to her growing fascination with her unexpected and confusing guest who was he and what was she going to do about him the trouble was she had a whole list of unanswered questions that applied to her odd patient caleb hornblower libby was a great listmaker and a woman who knew herself well enough to be aware that all her organizational talents were eaten up by her work who was he why had he been flying through a storm at midnight where did he come from and where had he been going why had a simple paperback novel sent him into a panic why had he kissed her libby pulled herself up short there that particular question wasnt importantit wasnt even relevant he hadnt really kissed her she reminded herself and whether he had or hadnt wasnt the issue it was gratitude she decided and began to nibble on her thumbnail hed only been trying to show her that he was grateful to her libby certainly understood that a kiss wascould bea very casual gesture it was part of western culture over the centuries it had become as unimportant as a smile or a handshake it was a sign of friendship affection sympathy gratitude and desire she bit down harder on her nail not all societies used the kiss of course many tribal cultures she was lecturing again libby thought in disgust she looked down at her hands and she was biting her nails that was a bad sign what she needed was to get her mind off hornblower for a while and fill her stomach pressing a hand to it libby rose she wasnt going to get any work done this way so she might as well eat since calebs room was dark she passed it by telling herself shed check on him when she came back up sleep was undoubtedly more essential to his recovery than another meal there was a low rumble of thunder as she descended the stairs another bad sign she thought at this rate it would be days before she could get him down the mountain perhaps someone was already looking for him friends family business associates a wife or a lover everyone had someone she groped for the kitchen light as the sky cracked with the first bolt of lightning it was going to be another boomer she decided as she opened the refrigerator door finding nothing that appealed to her she rummaged through the cupboards a night like this called for a nice bowl of soup and a seat by the fire alone she sighed a little as she opened the can recently shed begun to think about being alone as a scientist she knew the reason she lived in a culture of couples singleunmatched she remembered with a quick smilesingle men and women often found themselves dissatisfied and depressed in their own company the entertainment media subtlyand not so subtlydrilled into them the pleasures of relationships families added pressure for the single to marry and continue the family line goodnatured friends offered help and advice generally unwanted on finding a mate the human being was programmed almost from birth to search for and find a companion of the opposite sex maybe that was why shed resisted an interesting analysis libby mused as she stirred the soup the desire for individuality and selfsufficiency had been ingrained in her from birth it would take a very special person to tempt her to share she had dated only rarely in high school the same pattern had held true in college shed had no interest that wasnt precisely true she thought she had had interestthe trouble was it had usually been scientific shed never met a man who dazzled her enough to stop her from making lists and forming hypotheses professor stone theyd called her in high school and it still rankled in college shed been considered a professional virgin shed detested that had struggled to ignore it pouring her energy into her studies the appeal of her personality had made her friends both male and female but intimate relationships were another matter when all the data had been analyzed there had never been one who had made her well yearn libby decided that was the appropriate term she supposed there wasnt a man on the planet who could make her yearn wooden spoon in hand she turned to take out a bowl for the second time she saw cal framed in the doorway she gave a muffled shriek and the spoon went flying a flash of lightning lit up the room then it was plunged into darkness libby damn it hornblower i wish you wouldnt do that her voice was breathless as she rummaged through drawers for a candle you scared the life out of me did you think i was one of the mutants from andromeda there was a dry tone to the words that had her wrinkling her nose i told you i dont read that stuff she closed a drawer on her thumb swore then wrenched open another where are the stupid matches she turned and bumped solidly into his chest in the dark lightning flashed again illuminating his face it took only that instant for her mouth to go dry hed looked stunning strong and dangerous youre shaking his voice had gentled almost imperceptibly but the hands on her shoulders stayed firm are you really frightened no i she wasnt a woman to be scared of the dark certainly she wasnt a woman to be afraid of a manintellectually speaking but she was shaking the hands that had reached up to his bare chest trembledand intellect had nothing to do with it i need to find the matches why did you turn the lights off she smelled wonderful in the cool unrelieved darkness he could concentrate on her scent it was light and almost sinfully feminine i didnt the storm knocked out the power his fingers tightened on her arms hard enough to make her gasp caleb cal lightning flashed again and she saw that his eyes had darkened he was staring out the window into the storm now people call me cal his grip had eased though she ordered herself to relax the crash of the thunder made her jolt i like caleb she said hoping her voice was pleasant and casual well have to save it for special occasions you have to let me go he slid his hands down to her wrists then back why her mind went blank beneath her palms she could feel the strong steady beating of his heart slowly his fingers skimmed down to her elbows where his thumbs traced lazy erotic circles on the sensitive inner skin she could no longer see him but she could taste the warm flutter of his breath on her parted lips i she felt each separate muscle in her body go lax dont the word nearly strangled her as she jerked back i need to find the matches so you said leaning weakly against the counter she began to search the drawer again even after she found a pack it took her a full minute to light the match thoughtful his hands plunged deep in the pockets of the sweats cal watched the little flame dance and flicker she lit two tapers keeping her back to him i was heating soup would you like some all right it helped to keep her hands busy you must be feeling better his mouth twisted into a humorless smile when he thought of the hours hed lain in the dark willing his memory to return completely i must be headache not much of one she poured the water shed already boiled for tea then arranged everything meticulously on a tray i was going to sit by the fire okay he picked up the two candles and led the way the storm helped cal thought it made everything he was seeing everything he was doing seem that much more unreal perhaps by the time the rain stopped hed know what he had to do did the storm wake you yeah it wouldnt be the last lie he told her though he was sorry for the necessity of it cal smiled and settled in a chair by the fire there was something charming about being in a place where a simple rainstorm could leave you in the dark dependent on candles and firelight no computer could have set a better scene how long do you think itll be before you regain power an hour she tasted the soup it nearly calmed her a day she laughed and shook her head dad always talked about hooking up a generator but it was one of those things he never got around to when we were kids wed sometimes have to cook over the fire for days in the winter and wed sleep all curled up here on the floor while my parents took turns making sure the fire didnt die out you liked it cal knew people who went into preserved areas and camped hed always thought they were strange but the way libby spoke of it it seemed homey i loved it i guess those first five years helped me handle the more primitive parts of digs and fieldwork she was relaxed again he could see it in her eyes hear it in her voice though a nervous libby held a definite appeal for him he wanted her relaxed now the more at ease she was the more information he might glean what era do you study no specific era im hung up on tribal life mainly isolated cultures and the effects of modern tools and machines things like how electricity changes the sociopolitical mores of the traditional man ive toyed around with extinct cultures aztecs incas this was easy she decided the more she talked about her work the less she would think about that jolting moment in the kitchen and her own inexplicable reaction to it im planning on going to peru in the fall howd you get started i think it was a trip to the yucatan when i was a kid and all those wonderful mayan ruins have you ever been to mexico looking back he remembered a particularly wild night in acapulco yes about ten years ago or a couple of centuries from now he thought and frowned into his bowl bad time what no this tea he took another sip its familiar grinning she tucked her legs up under her my father will be glad to hear that herbal delightthats his company he started it right here in this cabin cal looked down into his cup then laid his head back and laughed i thought that was a myth no with a half smile forming she studied him i dont get the joke its hard to explain should he tell her that over two centuries from now herbal delight would be one of the ten biggest and most powerful companies on earth and its colonies should he tell her that it made not only tea but organic fuel and god knew what else here was cal hornblower he thought sitting cozily in a chair in the cabin where it all began he noted that she was staring at him as if she were going to check his pulse again my mother used to give me this he told her when i had he wasnt sure what childhood illness he could name but he was certain it wasnt red dust fever whenever i wasnt feeling well a cure for all ills youre remembering more patches pieces he said still cautious its easier to remember childhood than last night i dont think thats unusual are you married where had that come from she wondered and immediately turned her attention to the fire he was glad she wasnt looking at him when the grin split his face no it wouldnt be wise for me to want you if i were her mouth dropped open and she twisted around to look at him quickly she rose and began stacking the dishes on the tray i should take these back in would you rather i didnt tell you she had to swallow once hard before she could speak at all tell me what that i want you he closed his hand over her wrist to keep her still it amazed and aroused him to feel her pulse hammering his wordbyword perusal of the newspaper hadnt given him an inkling of how men and women interacted in the here and now but he didnt believe it could be so different yesno smiling he took the tray out of her hands which i dont think its a good idea when he stood up she stepped back and felt the heat from the fire on her legs caleb is this a special occasion he traced a fingertip across her jaw and watched her eyes go as hot as the flames behind her dont it was ridiculous he couldnt make her tremble with just a touch but all he had done was touch her and she was trembling when i woke up and saw you sleeping in the chair in the firelight i thought you were an illusion he rubbed his thumb gently over her bottom lip you look like one now she didnt feel like one she felt real shatteringly real and terrified i have to bank the fire for the night and you should go back to bed we can bank the fire for the night then we can go to bed she squared her shoulders furious at the realization that her palms were sweating she would not stammer she promised herself she would not act the inexperienced fool she would handle him the way a strong independent woman would a woman who knew her own mind im not going to sleep with you i dont know you so that was a condition cal mused after thinking it over he found it rather sweet and not completely unreasonable all right how long do you need she stared at him at length she dragged both hands through her hair i cant figure out if youre joking or not but i do know youre the oddest man ive ever met you dont know the half of it he watched her bank the fire carefully competent hands he thought an athletic body and the most vulnerable eyes hed ever seen well get to know each other tomorrow then well sleep together she straightened so quickly that she rapped her head on the mantel swearing and rubbing her head she turned to him not necessarily in fact its very unlikely he took the screen and placed it in front of the fire exactly as he had seen her do earlier why because flustered she fumbled for words for a moment i dont do that kind of thing she recognized genuine astonishment when she saw it it was staring at her now out of cals dark blue eyes at all really hornblower thats none of your business dignity helped but not a great deal as she swept up the tray the bowls slid dangerously and they would have crashed to the floor if he hadnt caught the end of the tray and balanced it why are you angry i only want to make love with you listen she took a deep breath ive had enough of all this i did you a favor and i dont appreciate you insinuating that i should hop into bed with you just because youveyouve got an itch i dont find it flatteringin fact i find it very insultingthat you think id make love with a perfect stranger just because its convenient he tilted his head trying to take it all in is inconvenient better she could only grit her teeth listen hornblower ill drop you off at the nearest singles bar the minute we can get out of here until then keep your distance with that she stormed out of the room he could hear the dishes crash in the kitchen he dug his hands in his pockets again as he started upstairs twentiethcentury women were very difficult to understand fascinating he admitted but difficult and what in the hell was a singles bar chapter he felt almost normal in the morning normal cal thought if you considered he hadnt even been born yet it was a bizarre situation highly improbable according to most of the current scientific theories and deep down he clung to the faint hope that he was having some kind of long involved dream if he was lucky he was in a hospital suffering from shock and a little brain damage but from the looks of things hed been snapped back over two centuries into the primitive often violent twentieth century the last thing he could remember before waking up on libbys couch was flying his ship no that wasnt quite accurate hed been fighting to fly his ship something had happened he couldnt quite bring that into focus yet whatever it had been it had been big his name was caleb hornblower hed been born in the year that made two his lucky number he remembered with a half laugh he was thirty unmatched the older of two sons and a former member of the international space force hed been a captain and for the last eighteen months hed been an independent hed made a routine supply delivery to the brigston colony on mars and had veered off from his normal route on the return trip home because of a meteor shower then it had happened whatever it was now he had to accept the fact that something had shot him back in time he had crashed not only through earths atmosphere but through about two and a half centuries he was a healthy intelligent flier who was stuck in a time when people considered interplanetary travel the stuff of science fiction and were incredibly playing around with nuclear fission the good part was that the experience hadnt killed him and hed landed in an isolated area in the hands of a gorgeous brunette it could he supposed be worse his problem at the moment was figuring out how he could get back to his own time alive he adjusted his pillow scratched at the stubble on his chin and wondered what libbys reaction would be if he went downstairs and calmly related his story hed probably find himself out the door wearing no more than her fathers sweats or shed call the authorities and have him hauled off to whatever passed for restandrehabilitation clinics at this point in time he didnt imagine they were luxury resorts what annoyed him at the moment was that hed been a poor history student what he knew about the twentieth century would barely fill a computer screen but he imagined they would have a pretty primitive way of dealing with a man who claimed hed crashed his f into a mountain after making a routine run to mars until he could find a way out he was going to have to keep his problem to himself in order to do so hed have to be more careful about what he said and what he did hed obviously made a misstep the night before in more ways than one he grimaced as he recalled libbys reaction to his simple suggestion that they spend the night together things were obviously done differently thenno now he corrected it was a pity he hadnt paid more attention to those old romances his mother liked to read in any case his problems ran a lot deeper than having been rejected by a beautiful woman he had to get back to his ship had to try to reconstruct what had happened in his head then he had to make it happen in reality as far as he could see that was the only way to get home again she had a computer he remembered as archaic as it was between that and the mini on his wrist he might be able to calculate a trajectory right now he wanted a shower a shave and some more of libbys eggs he opened his door and nearly walked into her the cup of coffee she held was steaming and she nearly splashed it all over his bare chest libby righted it though she thought a little scalding was just what he deserved i thought you might like some coffee thanks he noted that her voice was frigid her back stiff unless he missed his guess women hadnt changed that much the cold shoulder never went out of style i want to apologize he began offering her his best smile i know i veered out of orbit last night thats one way of putting it what i mean is you were right and i was wrong if that didnt do the trick he knew nothing about the nature of women all right nothing made her more uncomfortable than holding a grudge well forget it is it okay if i think you have beautiful eyes he saw her blush and was utterly charmed i suppose the corners of her mouth turned up shed been right about the celtic blood she reflected if the man didnt have irish ancestors shed have to go into a different line of work if you cant help it he held out a hand friends friends the moment she put her hand in his she wondered why it felt as though shed made a mistake or jumped off a bridge he had a way of using only the barest brush of his fingertips to send her pulse scrambling slowly wishing he wasnt so obviously aware of her reaction she drew her hand away im going to fix breakfast is it all right if i have a shower sure ill show you where everything is more comfortable with something practical to do she led the way down the hall clean towels in the closet she opened a narrow louvered door heres a razor if you want to shave she offered him a disposable safety razor and a can of shaving cream something wrong he was staring at the items she offered as though they were instruments of torture i guess youre used to an electric she said but i dont have one no he managed a weak smile hoping he wouldnt slit his throat this is fine toothbrush trying not to stare at him she handed him a spare that was still in its box we dont have an electric one of these either ill ah rough it fine take whatever looks like it will fit out of the bedroom there should be jeans and sweaters ill have something ready in a half hour time enough sure cal was still staring at the toiletries in his hands when she shut the door fascinating now that he was over the panic the fear and the disbelief he was finding the whole episode fascinating he studied the cardboard box and toothbrush with a grin like a boy whod found a fabulous puzzle under the christmas tree they were supposed to use these things three times a day he remembered hed read all about it they had different flavors of paste that they scrubbed all over their teeth sounded revolting cal squirted a dab of the shaving cream on his finger gamely he touched it to his tongue it was revolting how had anyone tolerated it of course that had all been in the days before tooth and gum diseases had been eradicated by fluoratyne after opening the box he ran a thumb over the bristles interesting he grimaced into the mirror studying his strong white teeth maybe he shouldnt take any chances setting everything on the sink he turned to look at the bathroom it was like something out of those old videos he thought the clunky oval tub with its single awkwardlooking shower head sticking out of the wall he would start filing it all away who could tell maybe hed write a book when he got home of more immediate importance was figuring out how to operate the shower above the lip of the tub were three round white knobs one was marked h another c and the middle was graced with an arrow cal scowled at them he could certainly figure out that they meant hot and cold but it was a far cry from the individual temperature settings he was accustomed to there would be no stepping inside and telling the computerized unit he wanted ninetyeight degrees at a mist it was fendforyourself he scalded himself first then froze then scalded himself again before he and the shower began to understand each other once it was running smoothly he could appreciate the feel of hot water beating down on his skin he found a bottle marked shampoo took a moment to be amused by the packaging then dumped some in his hand it smelled like libby almost immediately his stomach muscles tightened and a wave of desire flowed over him as hot as the water on his back that was odd baffled he continued to stare down at the pool of shampoo attraction had always been easysimple basic but this was painful he pressed a hand to his stomach and waited for it to pass but it persisted it probably had to do with the accident that was what he told himself and what he preferred to believe when he got back home hed have to check into a rest center for a full workup but hed lost his pleasure in the shower he toweled off quickly the scent of soap and shampooand libbywas everywhere the jeans were a little loose in the waist but he liked them natural cotton was so outrageously expensive that no one but the very rich could afford it the black rollnecked sweater had a hole in the cuff and made him feel at home hed always preferred casual comfortable clothes one of the reasons hed left the isf was that they had a penchant for uniforms and polish barefoot and pleased with himself he followed the scents of cooking into the kitchen she looked great her baggy pants accentuated her slenderness and made a man imagine all the curves and angles beneath the material he liked the way shed pushed the sleeves of the bulky red sweater up past her elbows she had very sensitive elbows he recalled and felt his stomach knot again he wasnt going to think of her that way hed promised himself hi this time she was expecting him and she didnt jump hi sit down you can eat before i check your bandage i hope you like french toast she turned holding a plate heaped with it when their eyes met her fingers curled tight around the edges she recognized the sweater but it didnt remind her of her father when it was tugged over cals long limber torso you didnt shave i forgot he didnt want to admit hed been afraid to try his skill at it it stopped raining i know the suns supposed to come out this afternoon she set the platter down then tried not to react when he leaned over her to sniff at the food did you really make that breakfast is my best meal she sat down breathing a little sigh of relief when he took the seat across from her i could get used to this eating he took his first bite and let his eyes close with a sigh of pure pleasure eating like this she watched him plow through the first stack how did you eat before packaged stuff mostly hed seen ads for complete meals in packages in the newspaper at least there was some hope for civilization i live like that myself most of the time when i come here i get the urge to cook stack wood grow herbs the kind of things we did when i was a kid and though shed come here for solitude shed discovered she enjoyed his company he seemed safe this morning despite her initial reaction to the way he looked in the black sweater and trim jeans she could almost believe shed imagined the tense and unexpected little scene by the fire the night before what do you do when youre not crashing planes i fly hed already thought his answer through and had decided it was best to stick as close to the truth as possible then you are in the service not anymore he picked up his coffee and smoothly changed the subject i dont know if ive really thanked you properly for everything youve done id like to pay you back for all this libby do you need anything done around here i dont think youre up to manual labor at this point if i stay in bed all day again ill go crazy she took a good look at his face trying not to be distracted by the shape of his mouth it was impossible to forget how close shed come to feeling it on hers your colors good no dizziness no you can help me wash the dishes sure he took his first good look at the kitchen like the bath it distracted and fascinated him the west wall was stone with a little hearth cut into it there was a hammered copper urn on the ledge stuffed with tall dried flowers and weeds the wide window over the sink opened onto a view of mountains and pine the sky was gray and clear of traffic he identified the refrigerator and the stove both a glossy white the wide plankedwood floor shone with a polished luster it felt cool and smooth under his bare feet looking for something with a little shake of his head he glanced back at her sorry the way you were staring out the window it seemed you were expecting to see something that wasnt there just ah taking in the view satisfied she gestured toward his plate are you finished yeah this is a great room ive always liked it of course its a lot more convenient with the new range you wouldnt believe the old museum piece we used to cook on he couldnt keep from grinning im sure i wouldnt why do i get the feeling theres a joke and its two inches above my head i couldnt say after picking up his plate he moved to the sink and began to open cupboards if youre looking for a dishwasher youre out of luck libby stacked the rest of the breakfast dishes in the sink my parents would never bend their sixties values that far no dishwasher no microwave no satellite dish she plugged the sink then reached in front of caleb for the bottle of dish detergent you want to wash or dry ill dry he watched delighted as she filled the sink with hot soapy water and began to scrub even the smell was nice he thought resisting the urge to bend down and sniff at the lemony bubbles libby rubbed an itch on her nose with her shoulder come on hornblower havent you ever seen a woman wash dishes before he decided to test her reaction no actually i think i did in a movie once with a bubbling laugh she handed him a plate progress steals all these charming duties from us in another hundred years well probably have robots that will stack the dishes inside themselves and sterilize them more like a hundred and fifty what do you want me to do with this he turned the plate in his hand dry it how she lifted a brow and nodded toward a neatly folded cloth you might try that right he dried the plate and picked up another i was hoping to go take a look of whats left of my shmy plane i can almost guarantee the logging trails washed out the land rover might make it but id really like to give it another day he bit down on his impatience youll point me in the right direction no but ill take you youve already done enough maybe but im not handing you the key to my car and you can hardly walk that distance on those roads she took the corner of his cloth and dried her hands while he tried to formulate a reasonable excuse why wouldnt you want me to see your plane hornblower even if youd stolen it i wouldnt know i didnt steal it his tone was just abrupt enough just annoyed enough to make her believe him well then ill help you find the wreckage as soon as the trails safe for now have a seat and let me look at that cut automatically he lifted his fingers to the bandage its all right youre having pain i can see it in your eyes he shifted his gaze to meet hers there was sympathy there a quiet comforting sympathy that made him want to rest his cheek on her hair and tell her everything it comes and goes then ill check it out give you a couple of aspirin and see if we can make it go again come on cal she took the cloth from him and led him to a chair be a good boy he sat down flicking her a glance of amused exasperation you sound like my mother she patted his cheek in reply before taking fresh bandages and antiseptic from a cupboard just sit still she uncovered the wound frowning over it in a way that made him shift uncomfortably in his chair sit still she murmured it was a nasty cut jagged and deep bruises the color of storm clouds bloomed around it it looks better at least there doesnt seem to be any infection youll have a scar appalled he lifted his fingers to the wound a scar so he was vain she thought more than a little amused dont worry itll look dashing id be happier if youd had a few stitches but i think thats more than my sears and roebuck degree can handle your what just a joke thisll sting some he swore loudly and richly when she cleaned the wound before she was half finished he grabbed her wrist sting some toughen up hornblower think about something else he set his teeth and concentrated on her face the burning pushed his breath out in a hiss her eyes reflected both determination and understanding as she went competently about cleaning treating and bandaging the wound she really was beautiful he realized as he studied her in the watery early sunlight it wasnt cosmetics and it was highly unlikely that there had been any restructuring this was the face shed been born with strong sharp and with a natural elegance that made him long to stroke her cheek again her skin had been soft he remembered babysmooth and color had rushed in and out of it as her emotions had shifted perhaps just perhaps she was an ordinary woman of her time but to him she was unique and almost unbearably desirable that was why she made him ache cal told himself as he felt the muscles in his stomach knot and stretch that was why she made him want her more than hed ever wanted anything before more than it was possible for him to want now she was real he reminded himself but it was he who was the illusion a man who had never been born yet one who felt as though he had never been more alive do you do this often he asked her she hated knowing she was causing him pain and she answered absently do what often rescue men he watched her lips curve and could almost taste them youre my first good there that should do arent you going to kiss it and make it better his mother had always done so as he imagined mothers had done for all time when she laughed he felt his heart lurch in his chest since you were brave she leaned down and brushed her lips just above the bandage it still hurts he took her hand before she could move away why dont you try again ill get the aspirin her hand flexed in his she would have backed away when he rose but something in his eyes told her it would do no good caleb i make you nervous his thumb caressed her knuckles its very stimulating im not trying to stimulate you apparently you dont have to try she was nervous he thought again but not frightened he would have stopped if hed seen fear instead he brought her hand to his lips then turned the palm upward you have wonderful hands libby gentle hands he saw the emotions flickering in her eyesconfusion unease desire he concentrated on the desire and drew her closer stop she was appalled by the lack of conviction in her own voice i told you i he brushed his lips against her temple and her knees turned to water im not going to bed with you with a quiet murmur of agreement he ran his hand up her back until her body was fitted against his it amazed him how much hed wanted to hold her like this her head nestled perfectly against his shoulder as if they had been made to dance together he had a moments regret that there wasnt music something low and pulsing the thought made him smile none of the women in his life had ever wanted to have the stage set nor had he ever had the urge to set one before relax he murmured and slid his hand up to the back of her neck im not going to make love with you im only going to kiss you panic had her straining away no i dont the fingers at the back of her neck shifted tightened held firm later when she could think she would tell herself that he had inadvertently touched some nerve some secret vulnerability an unspeakable pleasure sprang into her and her head fell back in submission on the heels of that flash of sensation he brought his lips to hers she went rigid though not from fear not from anger and certainly not in resistance it was shock wave after wave of it a live wire she thought dimly somehow she had closed her hand over a live wire and the voltage was deadly his lips barely touched hers teasing titillating tormenting it was a caress mouth against mouth unbearably erotic then it was a nibble an almost playful nibble and a caress again sweet and light and compelling his lips were warm and smooth as they rubbed a whispering trail over hers in arousing contrast the stubble of his beard scraped roughly over her cheek as he turned his head to trace the outline of her lips with his tongue it was ultimate impossibly so the way he tasted her toyed with her his tongue dipped to hers savoring dark new flavors before he changed the mood again and caught her bottom lip between his teeth nipping stopping unerringly at a point between pleasure and pain it was seduction the kind she had never dreamed of slow softedged inescapable seduction she could hear the low helpless sound that caught in her throat as he closed his teeth lightly over her chin the hand that had tensed against his chest began to tremble she felt the solid cabin floor sway under her feet her rigidity melted degree by degree until she was shuddering with the heat and pliant in his arms hed never experienced anything anyone like her it was as though she had melted against him quietly completely her taste was fresh like the air that wafted through the open window he heard the soft yielding sound of her sigh then her arms were around him clinging she plunged her fingers deep into his hair as she strained against him in a heartbeat her mouth went from submissive to avid pressing hungrily possessively desperately against his rocked by the force he dived into the kiss and let passion rule she wanted too much why hadnt she known shed been starving just the taste of him made her ravenous her body felt as though it would explode as dozens of new sensations arrowed into it each of them sharp separate and stunning a muffled cry escaped her when his arms tightened painfully around her she was no longer tremblingbut he was what was she doing to him he couldnt catch his breath he couldnt think but he could feeltoo much too quickly the loss of control was more dangerous to a pilot than an uncharted meteor storm hed only meant to give and take a moment of pleasure to satisfy a simple need but this was more than pleasure and it was far from simple he needed to pull back before he was sucked into something he didnt yet understand he drew her away with unsteady hands it helpeda littlethat her breathing was as ragged as his her eyes were wide and stunned yes stunned was the word he decided he felt as though hed flown into the side of a building what had he done confused she lifted a hand to her lips what had she done she could almost feel her blood bubbling through her veins libby took a step back wanting to find solid ground again and easy answers wait he couldnt resist he might curse himself for it later but he couldnt resist before the first shock waves had passed he hauled her against him a second time not again the single thought echoed in both their minds as they went under the pull was just as strong the need just as gripping she felt herself seesaw between limp surrender and furious demand before she managed to yank herself free she nearly stumbled and caught the back of a kitchen chair to steady herself her knuckles went white on the wood as she stared at him dragging air into her lungs she knew nothing about him yet she had given him more than she had ever given anyone her mind was trained to ask questions but at the moment it was her heart fragile and irrational that held sway if youre going to stay here in this house i dont want you to touch me again it was fear he saw in her eyes now he understood it as he felt a trace of it himself i didnt expect that any more than you did im not sure i like it any more than you do then we shouldnt have any trouble avoiding anything like this in the future he tucked his hands in his pockets and rocked back on his heels not bothering to analyze why he was suddenly so angry listen babe that was just as much your doing as mine you grabbed me no i kissed you you did the grabbing it gave him little satisfaction to see her color rise i didnt force myself on you libby and we both know it but if you want to pretend youve got ice in your veins thats fine with me the embarrassed flush fled from her face leaving it very white and very still in contrast her eyes went dark and wide the stunned hurt that glazed them had him cursing himself and stepping forward im sorry she shifted behind the chair and managed to speak calmly i dont want or expect an apology from you but i do expect cooperation his eyes narrowed youll get both i have a lot of work to do youre welcome to take the television into your room and there are books on the shelf by the fireplace id appreciate it if youd stay out of my way for the rest of the day he dug his hands into his pockets if she wanted to be stubborn he could match her fine she waited her arms crossed over her chest until he strode out of the room she wanted to throw something preferably something breakable he had no right to say that to her after what hed made her feel ice in her veins no her problem had always been that she felt too much wanted too much except when it came to personal physical onetoone relationships with men miserable she yanked out the chair and dropped onto it she was a devoted daughter a loving sister a faithful friend but no ones lover shed never experienced the driving need for intimacy at times shed been certain there was something lacking in her with one kiss cal had made her want things shed almost convinced herself werent important at least not for her she had her work she was ambitious and she knew she would make her mark she had her family her friends her associates damn it she was happy she didnt need some hotshot pilot who couldnt keep his plane in the air to come along and make her feel restlessand alive she mused running a fingertip over her bottom lip she hadnt known just how alive she could feel until hed kissed her it was ridiculous more unnerved than annoyed she sprang up to pour another cup of coffee hed simply reminded her of something she forgot from time to time she was a young normal healthy woman a woman she remembered who had just spent several months on a remote island in the south pacific what she needed was to finish her dissertation and get back to portland socialize take in some movies go to a few parties what she needed she decided with a nod was to get caleb hornblower on his way back to wherever the devil he came from taking the coffee she started upstairs for all she knew he might have dropped down from the moon she passed his room and couldnt prevent a quick snicker when she heard the frantic sounds of a television game show the man she thought as she slipped behind her own door was easily entertained chapter it was an education cal spent several hours engrossed in a sea of daytime television every ten or fifteen minutes he switched channels moving from game show to soap opera from talk show to commercial he found the commercials particularly entertaining with their bright often startling intensity he preferred the musical ones with their jumpy tunes and contagious cheer but others made him wonder about the people who lived in this time in this place some selections showcased frazzled women fighting things like grease stains and dull wax buildup he couldnt imagine his motheror any other woman for that matterworrying about which detergent made whites whiter but the commercials were delightful entertainment there were others that had attractive men and women solving their problems by drinking carbonated beverages or coffee it seemed everyone worked many outside in sweaty jobs so that they could go to a bar with friends at the end of the day and drink beer he thought their costumes were wonderful on a daytime drama he watched a woman have a brief intense conversation with a man about the possibility of her being pregnant either a woman was pregnant or she wasnt cal mused switching over to see a paunchy man in a checked jacket win a weeks vacation in hawaii from the winners reaction cal figured that must be a pretty big deal in the twentieth century he wondered as he caught snippets of the news at noon how humanity had ever made it to the twentyfirst century and beyond murder was obviously a popular sport as were discussions on arms limitations and treaties politicians apparently hadnt changed much he thought as he snacked on a box of cookies hed found in libbys kitchen his legs folded under him they were still longwinded they still danced around the truth and they still smiled a great deal but to imagine that world leaders had actually negotiated over how many nuclear weapons each would build and maintain was ludicrous how many had they thought they needed no matter he decided and switched back to a soap they had come to their senses eventually he liked the soaps the best though the picture was wavy and the sound occasionally jumped he enjoyed watching the people react agonizing about their problems contemplating marriages divorces and love affairs relationships had apparently been among the top ten problems of this century as he watched a curvy blonde with tears in her eyes and a toughlooking barechested man fell into each others arms for a long deep passionate kiss the music swelled until fadeout kissing was obviously an accepted habit of the time cal reflected so why had libby been so upset by one restless he rose and walked to the window he hadnt exactly reacted in an expected fashion himself the kiss had left him feeling angry uneasy and vulnerable none of those reactions had ever occurred before and none of them he admitted now had lessened his desire for her in the least he wanted to know everything there was to know about liberty stone what she thought what she felt what she wanted most what she liked the least there were dozens of questions he wanted to ask her dozens of ways he wanted to touch her and he knew that when he did her eyes would become dark and confused and depthless he could imagine with only the slightest effort what her skin would feel like on the back of her knee at the small of her back it was impossible there was only one thing he should be thinking about now going home the time with libby was only an interlude knowing as little as he did about women of this time didnt prevent him from being certain that liberty stone was not a woman a man could love and leave with any comfort one look in her eyes and you saw not only passion but home fires burning he was a man who had no intention of settling down anytime soon true his parents had matched early and had married fairly young at thirty but he had no desire to be matched mated or married yet and when he did cal reminded himself it would be on his own ground he would think of libby only as a distraction however pleasant in a tense and delicate situation he needed to be gone he pressed his palms against the cool glass of the window as if it were a prison he could easily escape this was an experience some men might have craved but he preferred breaking the boundaries of his own worldand his own time true hed learned things by reading the newspapers and watching the television in the twentieth century the world was a long way from reaching peace people worried a great deal about what to have for dinner and weapons were owned and used with reckless abandon a dozen farmfresh eggs could be had for about a dollarwhich was the current us currencyand everyone was on a diet it was all very interesting but he didnt think any of this information was going to help he had to concentrate on taking his mind back to what had happened on board his ship but he wanted to think about libby about what it had felt like to hold her against him he wanted to remember how she had heated about the way her lips had softened when his had met them when her arms had come around him he had trembled that had never happened to him before he had what he considered a normal healthy track record with women he enjoyed them both for company and for mutual physical pleasure since he believed in giving as much as he took most of his lovers had remained his friends but none of them had ever made his system churn as it had during one kiss with libby all at once shed taken him beyond what he knew and into some wild gutwrenching spin even now he could remember what it had felt like when her lips had gone hot and urgent against his his balance had tilted hed almost believed he saw lights whirling behind his eyes it had been like being pulled toward something of enormous limitless force his legs turned to water under him slowly he lifted a hand to brace himself against the wall the dizziness passed leaving a hollow throbbing at the base of his skull and suddenly he remembered he remembered the lights the flashing blinking lights in the cockpit navigational system failed shields inoperative automatic distress signal engaged the void he could see it and even now the sweat pearled cold on his brow a black hole wide and dark and thirsty it hadnt been on the charts he would never have wandered so close if it had been on the charts it had just been there and his ship had been dragged toward it he hadnt gone in the fact that he was alive and undoubtedly on earth made him certain of that it was possible that he had somehow skimmed the edge of it then shot like a rubber band through space and time the scientists of his era would question that idea time travel was only a theory and one that was usually laughed at but hed done it shaken he sat on the edge of the bed hed survived what no one in recorded history had survived lifting his hands he turned the palms upward and stared at them he was whole and relatively undamaged and he was lost he fought back a fresh wave of panic balling his hands into fists no not losthe wouldnt accept that if he had been shot one way it was only logical that he could be shot another back home he had his mind and his skill he glanced at his wrist unit he could work some basic computations on it it wouldnt be enough it wouldnt be nearly enough but when he got back to his ship if there was anything left of his ship refusing to consider the fact that it might be completely destroyed he began to pace it was possible that he could interface his mini with libbys machine he had to try he could hear her downstairs it sounded as though she were in the kitchen again but he doubted she would fix him another meal the regret came too quickly to block and the image of her sitting across the table from him flashed through his mind he couldnt afford regrets cal reminded himself and if there was any choice he wouldnt hurt her hed apologize again he decided in fact if he was successful with her computer he would get out of her life as smoothly and painlessly as possible he moved quickly quietly into her room he could only hope she would stay occupied until he made a few preliminary calculations hed have to be satisfied with those until he could find his ship and employ his own computer though impatience pushed at him he hesitated for another moment listening at the doorway she was definitely in the kitchen and judging by the banging going on she was still in a temper the computer with its awkward box screen and its quaint keyboard sat on the desk surrounded by books and papers cal sat in libbys chair and grinned at it engage the screen remained blank computer engage impatient with himself cal remembered the keyboard he tapped in a command and waited nothing sitting back he drummed his fingers on the desk and considered libby for reasons cal couldnt fathom had shut the machine down that was easily remedied he pushed through a few papers and picked up a letter opener he turned the keyboard over preparing to pry off the face then he saw the switch idiot he said to himself they had switches for everything here calling on his remaining patience he turned on the keyboard then searched for more switches on the unit when it began to hum he had to muffle a cry of triumph now were getting somewhere computer he caught himself with a shake of the head and began to type computer evaluate and conclude time warp factor he stopped himself again swore then pried off the plastic cover to reveal the memory board his impatience was making him sloppy andworsestupid you couldnt get anything out of a machine that hadnt been put in it was delicate timeconsuming work but he forced himself not to rush when he was finished it was juryrigged at best but his wrist unit was interfaced with libbys computer he took a deep breath and crossed the fingers on both hands hello computer hello cal the tinny words beeped from his wrist unit as the letters flashed across libbys screen oh baby its good to hear from you affirmative computer relay known data on theory of time travel through force of gravity and acceleration untested theory first proposed by dr linward bowers bowers hypothesized no cal dragged a hand through his hair in his hurry he was getting ahead of himself i dont have time for all of that now evaluate and conclude time travel and survival probability on encounter with black hole working insufficient data damn it it happened analyze necessary acceleration and trajectory stop he heard libby coming up the stairs and had time only to shut down the unit before she stepped inside what are you doing trying for a look of innocence cal smiled and swung out of the chair i was looking for you if youve messed with my machine i couldnt help glancing at your papers fascinating stuff i think so she frowned at her desk everything seemed in order i could have sworn i heard you talking to someone no one here but you and me he smiled again if he could distract her for a few minutes he could disengage his unit and wait for a safer time i was probably mumbling to myself libby he took a step toward her but she thrust a tray at him i made you a sandwich he took the tray and set it on the bed her simple kindness left him feeling as guilty as sin youre a very nice woman just because you annoy me doesnt mean id starve you i dont want to annoy you he stepped over quickly when she wandered toward the computer i dont seem to be able to avoid it im sorry you didnt like what happened before she cast him a quick uneasy glance thats better forgotten no its not needing the contact he closed a hand over hers whatever happens its something i wont forget you touched something in me libby something that hasnt been touched before she knew what he meant exactly precisely and it frightened her i have to get back to work do all women find it difficult to be honest im not used to this she blurted out i dont know how to deal with it im not comfortable around men im just not passionate when he laughed she spun away furious and embarrassed thats the most ridiculous thing ive ever heard youre overloaded with passion she felt something shift inside her strain for freedom for my work she said spacing her words carefully for my family but not in the way you mean she believed it cal decided as he studied her or she had made herself believe it in the past two days hed learned what it was like to doubt yourself if he could repay her in no other way perhaps he could show her what kind of woman she held trapped inside would you like to take a walk she blinked at him what a walk why he tried not to smile she was a woman who would require reasons its a nice day and id like to see a little of where i am you could show me she untangled the fingers shed twisted together hadnt she promised herself she would take time to enjoy herself he was right it was a nice day and her work could certainly wait youll need your shoes she told him there was a scent to the cool slightly moist air pine he realized after several moments mental debate the scent was pine like christmas but it came from the genuine article not a scent disk or a simulator the ground was thick with trees and the breeze though it was light sounded through them like a sea the clear paleblue sky was marred only by the grayedged clouds due north there was birdsong but for the cabin behind them and a dilapidated shed there were no manmade structuresjust mountain sky and forest this is incredible yes i know she smiled wishing it didnt please her quite so much that he appreciated and understood whenever i come here im tempted to stay he walked beside her matching her pace as they entered the sundappled forest it didnt feel odd being alone with her now it felt right why dont you my work primarily the university wouldnt pay me to walk in the woods what do they pay you for to research when you dont research how do you live how she tilted her head quietly i suppose i have an apartment in portland i study lecture read the path was steeper now for entertainment movies she shrugged music television yes she had to laugh sometimes too often what about you do you remember what you like to do fly his grin was quick and charming she hardly noticed when he took her hand theres nothing else like it not for me id like to take you up and show you her expression was bland as she glanced at the bandage on his head ill pass im a good pilot amused she reached down to pick a wildflower possibly absolutely in a move that was both smooth and natural he took the flower from her and slipped it into her hair i had some trouble with my instruments or i wouldnt be here because the gesture threw her off she stared at him for a moment before she began to walk again where were you going she slowed her pace as cal dallied picking wildflowers along the trail los angeles you had a long way to go he opened his mouth fooled for a moment into thinking she was making a joke yes he finally managed longer than i anticipated hesitantly she touched the blossom in her hair will someone be looking for you not for a while he turned his face to the sky if we find my plane tomorrow i can assess the damage and go on from there we should be able to drive into town in another day or two she wanted to smooth away the worry line that had formed between his brows you can see a doctor make some phone calls phone calls his baffled look had her worrying about his head injury again to your family or friends or your employer right he took her hand again absently sniffing at the clutch of flowers he held can you give me the bearing and distance from here to where you found me bearing and distance laughing she sat on the bank of a narrow fastrunning creek how about if i tell you it was that way she pointed toward the southeast ten miles as the crow flies double that by the road he dropped down beside her her scent was as fresh as the wildflowers and more alluring i thought you were a scientist that doesnt mean i can give you longitude and latitude or whatever ask me about the mudmen of new guinea and ill be brilliant ten miles eyes narrowed he scanned the fringe of fir where it thinned he could see a towering roughedged mountain blue in the sunlight and theres nothing between here and there no city no settlement no this area is still remote we get a few hikers now and again then it was unlikely that anyone had come across his ship that was one concern he could push to the back of his mind his main problem now was how to locate his ship without libby the easiest way he supposed would be to leave at first light in her vehicle but that was tomorrow he was coming to understand that time was too precious and too capricious to waste i like it here it was true he enjoyed sitting on the cool grass listening to the water it made him wonder what it would be like to come back to this same spot two centuries later what would he find the mountain would be there and possibly part of the forest that closed in around them this same creek might still rush over these same stones but there would be no libby the ache came again dull and gnawing when im home again he said very slowly ill think of you here would he she stared at the water at the play of sunlight over it and wished it didnt matter maybe youll come back sometime sometime he toyed with her fingers she would be a ghost to him then a woman who had existed only in a flash of time a woman who had made him wish for the impossible will you miss me i dont know but she didnt draw her hand away because she realized she would miss him more than was reasonable i think you will he forgot his ship his questions his future and concentrated on her he began to weave the flowers hed picked through her hair they name stars and moons and galaxies for goddesses he murmured because they were strong and beautiful and mysterious man mortal man could never quite conquer them most cultures have some historical belief in mythology she cleared her throat and began to pleat the baggy material of her slacks ancient astronomers he turned her face to his with a fingertip i wasnt talking about myths though you look like one with flowers in your hair gently he touched a petal near her cheek there be none of beautys daughters with a magic like thee and like music on the waters is thy sweet voice to me it was a dangerous man she knew instinctively who could smile like the devil and quote poetry in a voice like silk his eyes were the color of the sky just before dusk a deep dreamy blue shed never thought she was the kind of woman who could go weak just looking into a mans eyes she didnt want to be i should go back i have a lot of work to do you work too much his brow rose when she turned her head aside and frowned what button did i push restless more annoyed with herself than with him she shrugged someone always seems to be saying that to me sometimes i even say it to myself it isnt a crime is it she laughed because his question seemed so sincere not yet anyway its not a crime to take a day off no but nos enough why dont we say its miller time at her baffled look he spread his hands you know like on the commercials yes i know hooking an arm around one upraised knee she studied him poetry one moment beer commercials the next every now and again hornblower i wonder if youre for real oh im real he stretched out to watch the sky the grass was cool and soft beneath him and the wind played lazily through the trees what do you see up there she tilted her head back the sky a blue one thank goodness with a few clouds that should clear by evening dont you ever wonder whats beyond it beyond what the blue with his eyes halfclosed he imagined the endless sweep of stars the pure black of space the beautiful symmetry of orbiting moons and planets dont you ever think about the worlds up there just out of reach no she saw only the arc of blue speared through by mountains i suppose its because i think more about worlds that were my work usually keeps my feet and my eyes on the ground if theres going to be a world tomorrow you have to look to the stars he caught himself it seemed foolish to pine for something that might be lost how odd it was that he was thinking so much of the future and libby so much of the past when they had the here and now what movies and music he asked abruptly libby shook her head there seemed to be no order to his thought patterns before you said you liked movies and music for fun which ones all sorts good or bad im easily entertained tell me your favorite movie thats difficult but his eyes were so intense so earnest that she picked one at random from her list of favorites casablanca he liked the sound of it the way she said it whats it about come on hornblower everyone knows what its about i missed it he gave her a quick guileless smile that no woman should have trusted i must have been busy when it came out she laughed again with a quick shake of her head a brightening of her eyes sure both of us must have had pretty full schedules in the forties he let that pass what was the story he didnt care about the plot he only wanted to hear her talk to watch her as she did to humor him and because it was easy to sit by the water and daydream she began he listened enjoying the way she told the tale of lost love heroism and sacrifice even more he enjoyed the way she gestured with her hands the way her voice ebbed and flowed with her feelings and the way her eyes mirrored them darkening softening when she spoke of lovers reunited then pulled apart by destiny no happy ending cal murmured no but i always felt that rick found her again years later after the war why she had settled back pillowing her head on her folded arms because they belonged together when people do they find each other no matter what she was smiling when she turned her head but the smile faded slowly when she saw the way he was looking at her as if they were alone she thought not just alone in the mountains but totally completely alone as adam and eve had been she yearned for the first time in her life she yearnedbody mind and heart dont he said the word quietly as she started to scramble to her feet the lightest touch of his hand on her shoulder kept her still i wish you werent afraid of me im not but she was breathless as if shed already been running of what then of nothing his voice could be so gentle she thought so terrifyingly gentle but youre tense with his long limber fingers he began to rub at the tight muscles of her shoulders he shifted and his lips skimmed over her temple as cool and stirring as the breeze tell me what youre afraid of of this she lifted her hands to push against his chest i dont know how to fight what im feeling why do you have to he skimmed a hand down the side of her body astonished by the grinding need in his own its too soon but she was no longer pushing him away her resolve was melting in a flood of hot hammering need soon his laugh was strained as he buried his face against her throat its already been centuries caleb please there was an urgency in her voice a plea that was at once weak and unarguable he knew as he felt her body vibrate beneath his that he could have her just as he knew as he looked down at the clouded confusion in her eyes that once he had she might not forgive him need jerked inside him it was a new and frustrating sensation he rolled to one side and stood and with his back to her he watched the water ripple do you drive all men crazy she brought her knees up tight against her breasts no of course not then im just lucky i guess he lifted his eyes to the sky he wanted to be back there spearing through space alone free he heard the grass rustle as she stood and wondered if he would ever truly be free again i want you libby she didnt speak she couldnt no man had ever said those three simple words to her before if thousands had it wouldnt have mattered no one would ever have spoken them in just that way pushed to the brink by her silence he whirled around he wasnt her amiable slightly odd patient now but a furious healthy and obviously dangerous man damn it libby am i supposed to say nothing to feel nothing are those the rules here well the hell with it i want you and if i stay near you much longer im going to have you have me shed been certain her system was too weak and warm for anger but it filled her with a flash that had her body straightening like an arrow what like a shiny car on a showroom floor you can want anything you like cal but when those wants concern me ive got some say in it she was magnificent unbearably vivid with fury in her eyes and flowers clinging to her hair he would remember her like this always he knew it and he knew the memory would be bittersweet and yet his temper pushed him forward you can have all the say you like taking both her arms he pulled her against him but ill have something before i go this time she struggled it was pride pride and anger that had her jerking free then his arms came around her twin vises that clamped her body unerringly to his she would have sworn at him but his mouth closed hard over hers it was nothing like the first time then he had seduced persuaded tempted now he possessed not as if he had the right but simply taking it her muffled protest went unheeded her struggles ignored panic skidded up her spine then slid down again overwhelmed by pure desire she didnt want to be forced she didnt want to be left without choice that was her mind talking it was right it was reasonable but her body leaped forward leaving intellect far behind she reveled in the strength in the tension even in the temper she met power with power she came alive in his arms making him forget who and why and where when he could taste her hot and potent on his lips no other world no other time existed for him it was as new as exciting as frightening as it was for her irresistible the thought didnt come to him no thought could but she was as irresistible as the gravity that held their feet on the ground as compelling as the need that sent their pulses racing he dragged her head back and plunged into the velvet moistness of her waiting mouth the world was spinning with a moan she ran her hands up his back until she was clinging desperately to his shoulders she wanted it to go on spinning whirling madly until she was dizzy and breathless and limp she could hear the murmur of the water the whisper of the breeze through the pines there was a strong shaft of sunlight on her back she knew that in reality her feet were still on solid ground but the world was spinning and she was in love the sound that came from deep in her throat was one of surrender to him to herself he murmured her name a searing ache arrowed through him as desire veered painfully toward a new uncharted emotion the hand that had been roaming through her hair clenched reflexively he felt the petals of a flower crush the scent sweet and dying rose on the air he jerked away appalled the flower was in his hand fragile and mangled his gaze was drawn to her lips still warm and swollen from his his muscles trembled a wave of selfdisgust rose up inside him never never had he forced himself on a woman the idea itself was abhorrent to him the most shameful of sins the reality was unforgivablemost unforgivable because she mattered as no one else ever had did i hurt you he managed libby shook her head quickly too quickly hurt she thought that was nothing devastated with one kiss he had devastated her showed her that her will could be crumbled and her heart lost he wouldnt apologize cal turned away until he was certain he was under control enough to speak rationally but he would not apologize for wanting or for taking he would have nothing else of her when he left i cant promise that wont happen again but ill do my best to see that it doesnt you should go back inside now and that was all libby wondered after he had stripped her emotions to the bone he could calmly tell her to go back inside she opened her mouth to protest and she nearly took a step toward him before she stopped herself he was right of course what had happened should never happen again they were strangers whatever her heart told her to the contrary without a word she turned and left him alone by the creek later when the sun and shadows had shifted he opened his hand to let the wounded flower fall into the water he watched it drift away chapter she couldnt concentrate libby stared at her computer screen trying to work up some interest in the words shed already written the kolbari islanders and their traditional moon dance no longer fascinated her shed been certain work was the answeran immersion in it no one had ever distracted her from her studies before in college shed completed a thesis while her roommates threw an opendoor pizza party that singleminded concentration had followed her into her professional life shed written papers in tents by lamplight read notes on the back of a jogging mule and prepared lectures in the jungle once a project was begun nothing broke the flow as she read a single paragraph through for the third time all she could think of was cal it was a pity she hadnt had a greater interest in chemistry she thought pulling off her glasses to rub at her eyes if she had perhaps she would understand more clearly her reaction to him surely there was a book somewhere that would give her the information so that she could analyze it she didnt want to feel without being able to list logical reasons why daydreaming about love and romance was one thing experiencing it was something else altogether this wasnt like her with a long sigh she pushed away from the desk and folded her legs under her her eyes still on the screen she propped her elbows on her knees and braced her chin on her fisted hands she wasnt in love she told herself it had been a kneejerk reaction to the intensity of the moment people didnt really fall in love that quickly they could be attracted of course even strongly attracted for love though other factors had to be mixed in common ground and common interests libby decided that made good solid sense to her how could she be in love with cal when the only interest he had that she knew about was flying and eating she added with a reluctant smile an understanding of each others feelings goals temperaments surely that was vital to love how could she be in love when she didnt understand caleb hornblower in the least his feelings were a mystery to her his goals had never been discussed and his temperament seemed to change by the hour he was troubled a frown brought her brows together when she thought of the look that she so often saw in his eyes sometimes he made her think of a man who had taken a wrong turn on the freeway and ended up in a strange foreign land troubled yes but he was also just plain trouble she reminded herself trying to keep her compassion from outweighing her common sense his personality was too strong his charm too smooth his confidence too high she didnt have room in her neatly ordered life for a man like cal he would simply by existing cause chaos she heard him come in the kitchen door and her body braced automatically just as her pulse speeded up and her blood ran faster automatically disgusted with herself she scooted her chair back to her desk she was going to work in fact she was going to work straight through to midnight and she wasnt going to give cal another thought she caught herself gnawing on her thumbnail again damn it who is caleb hornblower the last thing shed expected from her muttered question was an answer the tinny disembodied voice had her jolting she grabbed the edge of her desk to keep from spilling out of her chair then stared openmouthed at her computer screen hornblower caleb captain isf retired oh my god with a hand to her throat she shook her head now just hold on she whispered holding it wasnt possible libby told herself as she pressed an unsteady hand to her mouth she had to be hallucinating that was it emotional stress overwork and the lack of a good nights sleep were causing her to hallucinate closing her eyes she took three deep breaths but when she opened them again the words were still on the screen what the devil is going on here information requested and relayed is additional data required with an unsteady hand she pushed aside some of the papers on her desk and uncovered cals watch she would have sworn the voice she had heard had come from it no it just wasnt possible using a fingertip she traced a threadslim transparent wire that ran from his watch to the computers drive what kind of game is he playing five hundred twenty games are available on this unit which would you prefer libby caleb stood just inside the doorway thinking fast there was no use berating himself for being careless in fact he wondered if subconsciously hed wanted to put himself in a position where he would be forced to tell her the truth but now when she turned he wasnt certain that would be good for either of them she wasnt just frightened she was furious all right hornblower i want you to tell me exactly whats going on here he tried an easy cooperative smile where right here damn it she jabbed a finger at the machine youd know more about that than i would its your work i want an explanation and i want it now he crossed to her a quick scan of the screen had a smile tugging at his mouth so shed wanted to know who he was there was some comfort in knowing she was as confused by him as he was by herand as interested no you dont he said it quietly and he would have taken her hand if she hadnt batted his away i not only want one i insist on one you you on a sound of frustration she took another breath he wasnt going to make her stutter you come in here and plug your watch into my machine and interface he said if youre going to work on a computer you should know the language she snapped her teeth together suppose you tell me how you can interface a watch with a pc a what she couldnt prevent the smirk personal computer youd better brush up on the language yourself nowanswers he put a hand on each of her shoulders youd never believe me youd better make me believe is that watch some kind of miniature computer yes he started to reach for it but she slapped a hand down on his wrist leave it ive never heard of any miniature computer that answers voice commands interfaces with a pc and claims to play over five hundred games no he looked down at her angry eyes you wouldnt have why dont you tell me how to get one hornblower ill buy my father one for christmas pure good humor tilted the corner of his mouth actually i dont think that models going to be on the market for a little while yet can i interest you in something else she kept her eyes level with his you can interest me in the truth stalling seemed to be the best approach he turned her hand over and linked his fingers with hers the whole truth or the simple parts are you a spy the last thing shed expected was laughter after his first chuckle it rolled out of him warm and delighted he kissed her once on each cheek before she could stop him you didnt answer my question she wiggled out of his hold are you an agent what makes you think so a wild guess she said throwing up her hands and spinning around the room you crash down in the middle of a storm no sensible person would have been driving in much less flying you have no ed you claim youre not in the military but you were wearing some kind of weird uniform your shoes were nearly falling apart but you have a watch that makes a rolex look like a tinkertoy a watch that talks back even as she said it it seemed so preposterous that she looked at the screen to make certain she hadnt imagined it all look i know intelligence agencies have some pretty advanced equipment it might not be james bond but whos james bond cal asked bond james code name fictional character created by twentiethcentury writer ian fleming novels include disengage cal ordered dragging a frustrated hand through his hair one look at libbys face told him he was in deep maybe you should sit down with a weak nod she sat on the edge of the bed though it was a bit late for precautions cal unhooked the wire and slipped it and his unit into his pocket you want an explanation she wasnt so sure anymore calling herself a coward she gave a quick jerky nod yes okay but youre not going to like it he sat in her chair and crossed his ankles i was making a routine run from the brigston colony excuse me the brigston colony cal repeated then he took the plunge on mars libby closed her eyes and rubbed a hand over her face give me a break hornblower i told you you wouldnt like it you want me to believe youre a martian dont be ridiculous she dropped her hand into her lap im ridiculous you sit there and try to feed me some story about coming from mars and im ridiculous for lack of anything better to do she tossed a pillow across the room then rose and began to pace look its not as though im prying into your personal life or even that i expect some kind of humble gratitude for dragging you in out of that storm but i think some mutual respect is in order here youre in my home hornblower and i deserve the truth yes i think you do im trying to give it to you fine temper wasnt going to help she thought she dropped back on the bed and spread her arms so youre from mars no im from philadelphia ah she let out a long relieved breath now were getting somewhere you were on your way to los angeles when you crashed your plane my ship her face remained calm and impassive that would be your spaceship youd call it that he leaned forward i had to reroute because of a meteor shower i was off course farther i realize than i had first thought because my instruments were unstable i ran into a black hole an uncharted one a black hole she no longer felt like laughing his eyes were absolutely sincere he believed it she realized as she folded her hands tightly in her lap his concussion was obviously much more serious than she had originally thought thats a compressed star very dense very powerful its gravity sucks up everythingstellar dust gas even light yes i know what a black hole is she had to keep him calm libby reasoned she would humor him express a friendly interest in his story then get him back into bed so you were flying your spaceship ran into a black hole and crashed in simple terms im not sure exactly what happened thats why i hooked my wrist unit up to your computer i need more information before i can calculate how to get back to mars no damn it to the twentythird century the small polite smile froze on her face i see no you dont he rose to prowl the room patience he told himself he could hardly expect her to accept in a moment what he still had trouble believing himself there have been theories about time travel for centuries its generally accepted that if a ship could get up the needed speed and slingshot around the sun it could pass through time its only theory at this point because no ones sure how to keep the ship from being sucked into the suns gravity and frying the same holds true for a black hole if id been pulled in the power and radiation would have ripped the ship apart it had to be blind luck but somehow i hit on the right trajectorythe precise speed distance angle instead of being pulled in i bounced off he flicked the curtain aside to look out at the darkening sky and landed here over two and a half centuries back in the past libby rose to lay a hesitant hand on his shoulder you should lie down he didnt look back at her didnt need to you dont believe me she opened her mouth but she couldnt bring herself to lie to him you believe it he turned then there was sympathy in her eyes the warm golden glow of it how would you explain it he reached in his pocket for his unit how would you explain this theres no need for explanations now im sorry i pressured you caleb youre tired you have no explanation for this he dropped the unit in his pocket again or for me all right my theory is that youre part of an intelligence operation perhaps some elite section of the cia you were probably burned outstress tension overwork when you crashed the shock and trauma of your head injury pushed you over the edge you dont want to be a part of what you were so youve chosen to give yourself a different time a different history so you think im crazy no the compassion was back in her eyes in her voice she touched her hand to the side of his face in a comforting gesture i think youre confused and you need rest and attention he started to swear but he caught himself if he continued to insist he would only frighten her hed already caused her a great deal of trouble that she didnt deserve youre probably right im still shaky from the crash i should get some rest thats a good idea she waited until he reached the door caleb dont worry its going to be all right he turned back thinking this would be the last time he saw her purple twilight filled the window at her back and she seemed to be standing at the edge of a mist her eyes were dark and full of compassion he remembered how rich and sweet the flavor of her lips was regret struck him like a fist you are he said quietly the most beautiful woman ive ever seen she stared speechless at the door he closed behind him he didnt sleep as he lay in the dark he could only think of her he switched on the television and watched the figures move like ghosts over the screen they were he realized more real than he she hadnt believed him there was little surprise in that but she had tried to comfort him he wondered if she knew how unique she was in this age or any other a woman who was strong enough to live on her own yet fragile enough to tremble in a mans arms his arms he wanted her in the pearlygray light of early dawn he wanted her almost more than he could stand just to hold her would be enough to lie beside her with her head settled on his shoulder in silence he could think of no other woman he would be content to spend hours of silence with if he had a choice but he had no choice he was lying across the bed fully dressed now he rose he had nothing to take with him and nothing to leave behind moving quietly downstairs he slipped out of the house the land rover was parked near the porch steps where she had left it the night shed brought him home he crossed to it casting a final glance at libbys window he hated to leave her stranded later hed break into a radio frequency and broadcast her location someone would come for her shed be mad the idea made him smile a little as he climbed into the drivers seat she would curse him hate him and she wouldnt forget him cal took a moment to be charmed by the oldfashioned instruments and controls the birds were singing as he tested the steering wheel and pumped the gas pedal curiously there was a lever between the seats marked with numbers running from one to four in an h pattern gears clanked when he shoved the lever forward confident he had the skill to operate such a simple vehicle he turned knobs when he got no response he jiggled the gearshift while depressing the floor pedals through trial and error he found the clutch and shifted smoothly into first gear a beginning he decided and wondered where the hell the designer had put the ignition youre going to have a hard time starting it without this libby stood on the porch one hand in a fist on her hip the other aloft with the ignition key dangling from her fingers she was mad all right cal thought but he didnt feel like smiling i was just thinking about taking a ride were you she tugged her hastily donned sweater farther over her hips before she walked down the steps its your bad luck i didnt leave the keys in the car so it took a key he should have known did i wake you she jabbed a fist hard at his shoulder youve got nerve hornblower feeding me all that garbage last night so id feel sorry for you then trying to steal my car what were you going to do hotwire it and leave me stranded id have thought a hotshot pilot like you would be able to do it faster and quieter i was just borrowing it he said though he doubted the difference would matter to her i thought youd be better off if i drove out to where i wrecked by myself shed trusted him she thought calling herself ten kinds of a fool shed felt sorry for him shed wanted to help him betrayal and fury had her clenching her fist until the key bit into her palm shed help him all right well you can stop thinking move over im sorry i said move over you want to go to the wreck ill take you to the wreck libby move over hornblower or that hole in your heads going to have company fine giving up he eased himself over the gearshift and dropped into the passenger seat dont say i didnt warn you to think i was feeling sorry for you he watched intrigued as she pushed the key into a slot and turned the engine roared to life the radio blared the windshield wipers swished and the heater blasted you really are a case she muttered switching knobs before he could comment she popped the clutch rammed down on the gas and sent them speeding onto the narrow dirt road libby he cleared his throat then pitched his voice above the noise of the engine i was doing what i thought was best for you i didnt want to involve you any more than i already have thats swell she yanked the gearshift back and sent stones flying just who do you work for hornblower im an independent oh i see her mouth tightened into a grim line you sell to the highest bidder the renewed anger in her tone puzzled him sure doesnt everyone some people dont put a price on their loyalty to their country cal pressed his fingers to his eyes he hadnt realized they were back to that libby i am not a spy i dont work for the cai cia whatever im a pilot i run supplies people equipment i deliver to spaceports colonies labs so youre playing that tune again she gritted her teeth as she sent the land rover over a sloping bank and across a stream water gushed up the sides what are you claiming to be this timean intergalactic truck driver he lifted his hands then let them fall close enough im not buying it anymore cal i dont think youre crazy i dont think youre deluded so cut it cut what when she only hissed at him he decided to try again once more calmly libby everything i told you is true stop it if she hadnt needed both hands on the wheel she might have slapped him i wish id never seen you you literally fall into my life and make me care about you make me feel things ive never felt before and all you do is lie he saw only one option on impulse he reached out and turned off the key the land rover bumped to a stop now listen to me with his free hand he grabbed her sweater and yanked her around damn it the oath came out as a murmur when he saw her face dont cry i cant stand it im not crying she wiped angry tears away with the backs of her hands give me back the key in a minute he released her holding his hand palm out in a gesture of truce i wasnt lying when i said i was leaving this morning because i thought it was best for you she believed him and she hated herself because he could so easily make her believe will you tell me what kind of trouble youre in yes because he couldnt resist he trailed a fingertip across her damp cheek after weve found thewhere i went downill tell you anything you want to know no more evasions or ridiculous stories ill tell you everything he lifted her hand then pressed his palm to hers you have my word libby he linked his fingers with hers what do i make you feel she drew her hand away to grip the wheel i dont know and i dont want to think about it id like you to know that ive never had the same feelings for another woman as i have for you i wish things could be different he was already saying goodbye she realized a rippling ache spread in her chest dont lets just concentrate on what needs to be done while she stared straight ahead he slipped the key back into the ignition you were right up there she told him as she switched it on at the curve the best i could say is that you were coming from that direction i got the impression when i saw you crash that you went down along that ridge somewhere with a frown she lifted a hand to shield her eyes strange it looks like theres a break in that bank of trees up there not strange cal thought when you considered that a ship over seventy meters long and thirty across had come down in them why dont we take a look libby turned off the road and started up the rocky slope the part of her that was still annoyed hoped the jostling ride gave cal the willies but when she glanced at him he was grinning this is great he shouted i havent done anything like this since i was a kid glad youre having fun she turned her attention back to driving and didnt notice when cal pushed a series of buttons on his watch excitement began to drum in him as he studied the directional beam on one of the dials twentyfive degrees north what that way he used his other hand to gesture with its that way two point five kilometers how do you know he sent her a brilliant smile trust me they climbed the ridge to where the line of pines thickened the scattered dogwoods were budded but not yet ready to bloom libby shivered once in the cool air before she shut the engine off i cant drive through this well have to walk its not far he was already out and offering an impatient hand a few hundred meters she kept her hand at her side as she stared at his watch it was sending out a low regular beep why is it doing that its scanning it only has a range of ten kilometers but its fairly accurate holding his wrist out he moved in a slow circle since i doubt theres anything metallic as big as my ship around here id say weve found it dont start that again libby pushed her hands into her pockets and started to walk youre supposed to be a scientist cal reminded her as he fell into step beside her i am a scientist she muttered which is why i know that men do not bounce off black holes and drop into the klamath mountains on the way back from mars he slung a friendly arm around her shoulders youre looking behind you libby not ahead youve never seen anyone who lived two centuries ago but you know they existed why is it so difficult to believe that they exist two centuries in the future i hope they will but i dont expect to offer them coffee he wasnt crazy she decided but he was clever you told me youd tell me the truthall of the truthwhen we found your plane im holding you to that she tossed up her head then froze oh my god less than twenty feet ahead she saw a gap in the trees the break she had spotted from beneath the ridge up close it looked as though a huge sickle had sliced through the forest hewing down a swath of evergreen and undergrowth more than thirty feet wide but there was no fire she had to quicken her pace to keep up with cal what could have done all this that when they reached the break cal pointed there nestling on the rocky needlestrewn ground was his ship trees some of them thirty feet high lay like pickup sticks around it dont go any closer until i check for radiation cal warned but he neednt have bothered libby couldnt have moved if shed wanted to using his wrist unit he checked the level and gave a quick nod its well within normal limits the time warp must have neutralized any excess he slipped an arm around her shoulders again come on inside ill show you my etchings dazed silent she went with him it was huge as big as a house and like no plane she had ever seen a military secret she told herself that was why cal had been so evasive but surely one man couldnt fly something so large the front was its narrowest point blunted somewhat bulletshaped before it curved out into the body there were no wings that thought caused an uneasy lurch in her stomach its shape reminded her of a stingray that scuttled across the ocean floor an experiment she told herself as she climbed over a fallen pine the body was a dull metallic color not glitzy enough to be called silver there were scrapes and dents and dust all over it like an old reliable family car she thought giddily the damage had happened in the accident she decided but it worried her more than a little that several of the dents looked old the pentagon or nasa or whoever had built it would certainly have taken better care of something that had to be worth millions of taxpayer dollars you came in this thing by yourself libby managed when he leaped down the slight slope to run his hand over the side of the ship sure his fingers moved over the metal in an unmistakable caress she handles like a dream who does it belong to its mine there was both pleasure and excitement in his eyes when he held up a hand to help her down i told you i didnt steal it as a wave of relief passed over him he spun her in a circle then kissed her hard on the mouth finding the taste alluring he kept her feet an inch off the ground and lingered over a second kiss caleb breathless dizzy she pushed away from him kissing yous become a habit libby he circled her waist with his hand ive always had a hard time breaking habits he was just trying to distract her she thought and he was doing an excellent job of it pull yourself together she ordered now weve found this thing you promised me an explanation we both know very well that nothing like this is owned by a private citizen spill it hornblower it is mine he told her still grinning or it will be after ten more payments he pressed a button to open the hatch libbys mouth dropped open as a door lifted up silently come on ill show you the registration unable to resist she walked up the two steps and into the cabin it was as large as her living room and was dominated by a control panel there were hundreds of colored buttons and levers in front of two highbacked black seats shaped like scoops have a seat he said staying close to the open hatch she rubbed her arms to ward off a sudden chill its ah dark in here oh yeah crossing to a panel he touched a switch libby let out a muffled shriek as the front of the craft opened i must have hit the shields when i started down she could only stare before her were the forest the distant mountains and the sky strong sunlight poured through you could hardly call it a windshield when it spanned twenty feet i dont understand because she needed to she moved quickly to one of the chairs and sat i dont understand any of this i felt the same way a couple of days ago cal opened a compartment scanned through some material then took out a small shiny card this is my pilots license libby after you read it take a nice long breath it might help his picture was in the corner his grin was as attractive and disarming as it was in the flesh the id claimed that he was a united states citizen and licensed to pilot all a to f model ships it listed his height as cm his weight as kg hair black eyes blue and his birth date was oh my god libby whispered you forgot to take that breath he closed a hand over hers on the card libby im thirty when i left la two months ago it was february thats crazy maybe but it happened this is a trick she pushed the card back into his hand and sprang up her heart was racing so hard and fast that she could feel it vibrating between her temples i dont know why youre doing this but its all some kind of elaborate trick im going home she rushed toward the hatch just as the door closed sit down libby please he saw the wild trapped look in her eyes and forced himself not to step toward her im not going to hurt you you know that just sit down and listen because she was angry that she had tried to run she walked stiffly back and sat down so he sat opposite her steepled his fingers and thought it all through there were times he supposed when it was best to treat an abnormal situation as if it were normal you didnt have any breakfast he said abruptly pleased with the inspiration he opened a small door and took out a glossy silver pouch how about ham and eggs without waiting for an answer he swiveled opened another door and tossed the pouch inside he pushed a button then sat smiling at her until a buzzer sounded taking a plate out of another compartment he opened the door and scooped out a heap of steaming eggs loaded with chunks of ham libby locked her icy hands in her lap youre full of tricks no trick irradiation come on taste he held the plate under her nose theyre not as good as yours but theyll do in a pinch libby you have to believe whats in front of your eyes no very slowly she shook her head from side to side i dont think i do not hungry she shook her head again more firmly this time with a shrug cal plucked a fork from a drawer and dug in i know how you feel no you dont she took his advice belatedly and sucked in three long breaths youre not sitting in what looks like a spaceship having a conversation with a man who claims to be from the twentythird century no but im sitting in my ship talking to a woman whos a couple of centuries older than i am she blinked at that then found laughteronly slightly hystericalbubbling out this is ludicrous oh yeah im not saying i believe it give it time her hand was no longer cold but it was still unsteady when she pressed it to her head i need to think fine with a sigh she sat back and studied him ill take that breakfast now chapter the eggs were bland but they were certainly hot irradiated libby thought as she took a second bite shed heard of the controversial process for preserving food still it was a far cry from a microwave tv dinner somehow shed woken up in the middle of a sciencefiction movie i keep telling myself there has to be another explanation cal polished off his eggs let me know if you find one dissatisfied she set her plate aside if all this is real you seem to be taking it very calmly ive had some time to get used to it are you going to eat the rest of that she shook her head then turned to stare through the clear shield she saw a pair of elk meander into the trees about a hundred yards away a beautiful sight she mused beautiful and normal here in the mountains of oregon if the elk had wandered down fifth avenue in manhattan they would still have been beautiful and they would still have been real but for reasons of basic geography they wouldnt have been normal there was no denying that cal was real was it possible that he and his incredible vehicle were a perfectly normal sight in another place in another time if it were true if she allowed herself for just one moment to believe it how must he feel she looked at the elk again they were standing in a patch of sunlight mustnt he be feeling as confused and displaced as any animal taken out of its natural habitat and tossed into a strange world she remembered the panic she had seen on his face the day hed come to her with a paperback novel a novel published this year libby reflected shed dismissed his pallor his dazed confusion as the effects of his head injury shed discounted his odd questions and remarks the same way now there was the shipand no matter how far she stretched it she couldnt call the vehicle a plane if she accepted that it was real and not part of some strange vivid dream then she had to accept cals story there are more things in heaven and earth horatio than are dreamt of in your philosophy hamlet he grinned at her quick suspicious look we still read shakespeare want some coffee she shook her head dream or not she needed answers you say you bounced off a black hole he smiled immeasurably relieved she believed him perhaps she didnt fully realize it herself but she believed him thats right or at least thats what i think im going to need my computer my instruments went berserk when we hit the gravitational field so i went to manual and managed to bank east i remember the force it must be what a fly feels like when someone gives it a good solid bat i passed out when i came to i was freefalling toward earth i switched back to computer and thought my troubles were over that doesnt explain how you ended up hereor should i say now there are a lot of theories the one i lean toward deals with the spacetime continuum its like a curved bowl he cupped his palm to demonstrate mathematically the bowl isnt space and it isnt time its a combination of both everything in it moves through space and time gravitys the curve of the bowl drawing everything down around the earth its not much of a curve you dont really feel it unless you say fall off a cliff but around the sun and around a black hole he deepened the cup of his palm and youre saying you were caught in that curve like a marble being spun around the lip of the bowl and somewhere somehow along the spin i was flicked off the speed the trajectory sent me tunneling not just through space but through time it sounds almost plausible when you say it its the only theory ive got maybe if we look at it itll sound more plausible leaning forward he turned a dial computer yes cal libby lifted a brow at the soft sultry voice since when do they make computers tall blond and busty he just grinned intergalactic runs can be lonely computer play back log date on screen cal swiveled in his chair and leaned forward as a small viewing screen rose out of the console sound filled the cockpit impassive he watched his own image flicker on from her chair libby stared mesmerized as the playback progressed she could see him sitting precisely where he was sitting now but there were lights flashing buzzers sounding while the cockpit vibrated he reached up to secure a safety strap she could see the sweat beading on his face as he fought the controls of the bucking ship widen image cal commanded then libby saw what he had seen through the shield there was the vastness of space seductive and compelling there were stars clusters of them and what was surely a distant planet there was a blackness an absolute blackness that spread for miles the ship seemed to be hurtling toward it she heard cal swearingor rather the image of cal was swearing as he pulled on a lever there was a sound a screaming rip of metal that seemed to vibrate all around her the cockpit began to roll end over end with sickening speed and then the screen went blank damn it computer continue playback memory banks damaged no further playback possible terrific he started to command an analysis but then he caught a glimpse of libby she was sitting limply in the chair beside his her cheeks a dead white her eyes glassy hey he was up quickly and leaning over her take it easy cupping her face in his hands he pressed his thumbs lightly on either side of her throat it was like i was there he cursed himself and took her icy hand in his to warm it he had known better cal thought in disgust but he had only been thinking of himself and his need to see what had happened i know im sorry it was horrible whatever doubts she had harbored had vanished completely during the playback her fingers tightened convulsively on his as she looked up at him its all been horrible for you no he combed his fingers through her hair not all softly gently he touched his lips to hers then skimmed them over her jaw she reached a hand to his face letting it linger while she gave and took the comfort what are you going to do im going to find a way back she felt a pain sharp and sudden of course he couldnt stay carefully she laid her hand back in her lap when will you go its going to take a little time he straightened and glanced around the cabin i need to do some repairs on the body of the ship there are a lot of calculations that have to be done id like to help you she made a helpless gesture with her hands i dont know how id like you to stay while im working i know youve got a lot to do but if you could spare a few hours sure she dug up a smile i dont get many offers to spend the day in a spaceship but she couldnt sit beside him at that moment if he looked at her too closely he might see what she had just discovered when he left he would break her heart can i look around all you want she was still pale he noted but her voice was strong perhaps like him she needed some tune alone id like to get the computer started on some calculations she left him to it trying not to jolt when automatic doors whispered open at her approach she entered what seemed to be a small lounge a pair of couches were built into the walls curving back then out with bright orange cushions a table of what appeared to be lucite was bolted to the floor there were a few glossy informational sheets tossed around the futures version of car and driver she thought with a nervous laugh as she chose one she tapped it absently against her thigh as she wandered around the room she was a sensible woman libby told herself a sensible woman accepted what couldnt be denied but there were no buts she was a scientist one who studied man for the time being she would study what man would be rather than what he had been for an hour she walked through the ship observing absorbing there was a narrow untidy room she took to be the galley there was no stove only a wall unit that resembled a microwave a refrigerator of sorts held a few bottles the labels were a familiar red white and blue and carried the name of a popular brand of american beer man hadnt changed that much libby decided she chose an equally familiar brand of soft drink and twisted off the cap she took a first experimental sip amazing she thought as she took another she might have found the bottle in her own refrigerator taking the bottle and its comforting familiarity with her she wandered on she found herself in an enormous bay area it was empty except for a huddle of boxes strapped into a comer hed said hed just made a supply run she remembered to mars when her stomach fluttered she took another sip from the bottle so man had conquered mars even in the twentieth century scientists had been making plans to do so she would have to ask cal when the first colony had been built and how the colonists had been chosen slowly she rubbed her fingers against her temple perhaps in a day or two this would all seem less fantastic then she would begin to think logically and ask appropriate questions she continued through the ship there was a second level that seemed to be comprised almost completely of bedrooms cabins libby corrected automatically on ships they were called cabins the furniture was streamlined and most of it was built directly into the wall smooth formed plastic and bright colors were the style she found cals almost by accident she didnt want to admit shed been looking there was little difference between his and the other cabins other than its homey untidiness she saw a jumpsuit similar to the one hed been wearing when shed found him tossed in a corner the bed was unmade on the wall was a picture eerily threedimensional of cal standing with a group of people the dwelling behind them was multileveled and almost entirely glass there were white terraces jutting out at all angles and there were tall shady trees on a green lawn this was his home she thought certain of it and his family she studied them again the woman was tall and striking and appeared much too young to be his mother a sister she wondered but then she remembered that he had spoken of only one brother they were all laughing cal had his arm slung around the shoulder of another man the height and build were similar and there was enough facial resemblance to make her certain that this was cals brother his eyes were green and even in the photograph they were uneasily piercing a tough customer she decided and shifted her attention to the third man in the photo he seemed slightly befuddled his face wasnt as blatantly handsome but there was kindness in it trapped in time she mused that was what a photograph did it trapped people in time just as cal was trapped now she lifted a hand but she caught herself just before she stroked the image of his face it was important to remember that he was only here until he could break free he had another life in another world what she was feeling about him for him was impossible just as impossible she thought as she pressed the cool bottle to her brow as the fact that she was standing in a vehicle designed to travel through space abruptly weary she sat down on the bed it was crazy all of it and the craziest part of all was that she had fallen in love for the first time in her life and the man she loved would soon be far beyond her reach with a sigh she stretched out on the slick cool sheets perhaps it was all a dream after all he found her there more than an hour later curled up on his bed she was sleeping as she had been the first time he remembered seeing her it brought him an odd unsettling feeling to watch her now she was lovely but it was no longer her beauty that drew him there was a sweetness about her a combination of compassion and shyness she had strength and passion and innocencean incredibly alluring innocence he wanted to go to her now to gather her up and make love with her in the softest gentlest way he knew but she wasnt for him he wished it could be like a fairy tale wished she could go on sleeping for a hundred years for two hundred and more until he awakened her and claimed her for his own he wasnt a prince he reminded himself he was just an ordinary man caught in an extraordinary situation moving quietly he crossed to the bed to draw the sheet over her she stirred murmured unable to resist he reached down to stroke her cheek her eyes fluttered open cal i had the strangest dream then she was awake and pushing herself up to stare around the cabin not a dream no he sat beside her no matter how much he lectured himself he couldnt deny the pleasure it gave him to share his bed with her if only as a friend how do you feel still a little rattled she combed both hands through her hair holding it away from her face for a moment before she let it fall im sorry i didnt realize id fallen asleep i guess my mind needed to shut off for a while its a little much to take in all at once libby yes she glanced distractedly around the cabin trying to let it all settle in im sorry i have to he closed his lips over hers and savored she was warm and soft from sleep he couldnt have explained to her how badly he needed that yielding texture reflexively she lifted a hand to his shoulder but there it relaxed it took all his willpower not to touch her and with the need raw in his gut to draw away i lied he murmured as his gaze dipped down to her mouth im not sorry but he rose and moved away from the bed she stood up and tried to keep her nervous fingers from fiddling with the hem of her sweater is that your family yeah hed been staring at the picture wishing life could be as simple as it had been at that moment my brother jacob and my parents the love somewhat wistful in his voice was unmistakable moved by it she laid a hand on his arm this is jacob she asked indicating his brother but they dont look old enough to be your parents it isnt difficult to look young he shrugged well it wont be and thats your home i grew up there its about twenty kilometers outside the city limits youll get back to them she buried her own yearnings love no matter how suddenly it came or how deep it reached was selfless think of the story youll have to tell if i remember but you couldnt forget the possibility struck her painfully she couldnt bear it if he forgot her if even her memory no longer existed ill write it down for you he shook off his black mood and turned to her id appreciate that will you let me go back with you she felt a flutter of hope go back to the cabin ive done about all i can for now i can start the repairs on the ship tomorrow i was hoping youd let me stay until its all ready of course it was foolish and selfish to hope that he would stay any longer than necessary she put on a bright smile as they started from the room i have dozens of questions to ask you i dont even know where to begin still she asked him nothing on the drive back he seemed distracted moody and her own mind was crowded with impressions and contradictions it would be best she decided if they pretended a kind of normality for a few hours then with a thud inspiration hit how would you like to have lunch in town what try to stay tuned hornblower would you like to drive into town you havent seen anything but this little slice if i suddenly found myself back in say the s id want to explore a little watch people it only takes a couple of hours what do you say the moodiness left his eyes and he smiled can i drive not on your life she laughed and tossed her hair back well stop back at the cabin for my purse it took more than thirty minutes to get to the highway through a narrow pass where the land rover had powered its way through the mud when they reached the highway cal saw the vehicles that had fascinated him on television they rumbled noisily along he shook his head as libby jockeyed aggressively for position i could teach you to fly a jet buggy in an hour the wind felt wonderful on her face they had today and perhaps a day or two more she wasnt going to lose a moment of it is that a compliment yeah youre still using whatgasoline thats right amazing being smug and superior suits youespecially since you didnt even know how to turn my car on idve figured it out he reached out to touch the flying strands of her hair if i were home id fly you to paris for lunch have you ever been there no she tried not to think too deeply about the romance of it well have to settle for pizza in oregon sounds great to me you know the strangest thing is the sky theres nothing in it a car whizzed by muffler coughing radio blaring what was that a car thats debatable but i meant what was the noise music hard rock she reached over to turn on the radio thats not as hard but its still rock its good with the music playing in his head he watched the buildings they passed neat singlefamily homes chunky apartment complexes and a spreading singlelevel shopping center the traffic thickened as they came closer to the city he could see the high rectangular forms of office buildings and condos it was a cluttered and to his eyes awkward skyline but it was oddly compelling here were people here life continued libby eased down the curving ramp and headed downtown theres a nice italian place very traditional red checked tablecloths candles in bottles handtossed pizza cal gave an absent nod there were people walking the sidewalk some old some young some plain some pretty there was noise from car engines and the occasional badtempered blare of a horn the air was warmer here and smelled slightly of exhaust for him it was a picture out of an old book come to life libby pulled into a graveled lot next to a squat whiteandgreen building the neon sign across the front window said rockys well its not paris its fine he murmured but he continued to twist his head and stare it must feel like stepping through the looking glass hmm oh he remembered the book one hed read as a teenager something like that more like something from h g wells its nice to know literature has survived are you hungry i was born hungry once again he fought off a darkening mood she was trying and so could he the restaurant was dim nearly empty and the air simmered with spices in the corner was a jukebox pumping out a current top hit after a glance at a sign that read please seat yourself libby led cal to a corner booth the pizzas really wonderful here have you had pizza before he flicked a finger at the hardened candle wax on the bottle in the center of the table some things transcend time pizzas one of them the waitress toddled over a plump young woman in a bright red bib apron that had rockys and a few splashes of tomato sauce dashed across the front she placed two paper napkins beside place mats decorated with maps of italy one large libby said taking cals appetite into account extra cheese and pepperoni would you like a beer yeah he tore a corner from the napkin and rolled it thoughtfully between his thumb and forefinger one beer and one diet cola why is everyone here on a diet cal asked before the waitress was out of earshot most of the ads deal with losing weight quenching thirst and getting clean libby ignored the quick curious look the waitress shot over her shoulder sociologically our culture is obsessed with health nutrition and physique we count calories pump iron and eat a lot of yogurt and pizza she added with a grin advertising reflects current trends i like your physique libby cleared her throat thanks and your face he added smiling and the way your voice sounds when youre embarrassed she let out a long windy sigh why dont you listen to the music the music stopped we can put more on on what the jukebox enjoying herself libby rose and extended a hand to him come on you can pick a song cal stood over the colorful machine scanning the titles this one he decided and this one and this one how does it work first you need some change ive had enough change for a while thanks no i mean change quarters chuckling she dug into her purse dont they use coins in the twentythird century no he plucked the quarter from her palm and examined it but ive heard of them we use them around here often with reckless abandon taking the quarter back she dropped it and two more into the slot an eclectic selection hornblower the music drifted out slow and romantic which is this the rose its a ballada standard i suppose even today do you like to dance yes i dont often but her words trailed away as he gathered her close cal shh he rubbed his cheek against her hair i want to hear the words they dancedswayed reallyas the music drifted through the speakers a mother with two squabbling children rested her elbow on her table and watched them with pleasure and envy in the glassedin kitchen a man with a bushy mustache tossed pizza dough in quick high twirls its sad no she could dream like this with her head cushioned on his shoulder and her body moving to their inner rhythm its about how love survives the words floated away her eyes were shut her arms still around him when the next selection blasted out with a primeval scream and a thundering drum roll what about this one its about being young she drew away embarrassed when she saw the smiles and stares of the other patrons we should sit down i want to dance with you again some other time people dont usually dance in pizza parlors okay obligingly he walked back across the room to their table their drinks were waiting as libby had with the drink in his galley cal found enormous comfort in the familiar taste of american beer just like home im sorry i didnt believe you at first babe didnt believe me at first in a natural gesture he reached across the table to take her hand tell me what do people do here on a date well they his thumb was skimming over her knuckles in a way that made her pulse unsteady they go to movies or restaurants i want to kiss you again her eyes darted up to his i dont really think dont you want me to kiss you if she doesnt the waitress said as she plopped their pizza in front of them i get off at five grinning cal slipped a slice of pizza onto a paper plate shes very friendly he commented to libby but i like you better terrific she took a bite are you always obnoxious mostly but i do like you a lot he waited a beat now youre supposed to say you like me too libby took another bite and chewed it thoroughly im thinking about it taking her napkin she dabbed at her mouth i like you better than anyone ive met from the twentythird century good are you going to take me to the movies i suppose i could like a date he took her hand again no carefully she removed it like an experiment well consider it part of your education his smile spread slow easy and undoubtedly dangerous im still going to kiss you goodnight it was dark when they returned to the cabin more than a little frazzled libby pushed open the door and tossed her purse aside i did not make a scene cal insisted i dont know what they call being asked to leave a theater where you come from but around here we call it making a scene i simply made some small practical comments about the film havent you heard about freedom of speech hornblower stopping herself she held up a hand and turned to the cupboard to get the brandy talking throughout the picture about it being a crock of space waste is not exercising the bill of rights its being rude with a shrug he plopped down on the couch and propped his feet on the coffee table come on libby all that bull about creatures from galactica invading earth i have a cousin on galactica and he doesnt have a face full of suction cups i should have known better than to take you to a sciencefiction movie she sipped the brandy then because she decided it was as much her fault as his she poured another snifter it was fiction hornblower fantasy rot all right she passed him the snifter but there were people in the theater who had paid to watch it how about that nonsense with the creatures sucking all the water out of the human body then there was the way that space jockey zipped around the galaxy shooting lasers do you have any idea how crowded that sector is no i dont she sampled more brandy tell you what next time well try a western remind me not to let you turn on star trek star treks a classic he said and sent her into a fit of giggles never mind you know i almost think im losing my grip i spent the morning in a spaceship and the afternoon eating pizza and not watching a movie i dont seem to be able to make sense of it all itll come clear he touched his glass to hers before settling his arm around her shoulders it was comforting the glow of the lamplight the warmth of the brandy the scent of the woman his woman cal thought if for only a moment i like this better than the movies tell me about liberty stone theres not much tell me so i can take it with me i was born here as i told you before in the bed i sleep in yes she sipped her brandy wondering if it was that or the image of him in the old bed that warmed her my mother used to weave blankets wall hangings rugs she would sell them to supplement what my father grew in the garden they were poor no they were children of the sixties i dont understand its difficult to explain they wanted to be closer to the land closer to themselves it was their part of a revolution against material power world violence the entire social structure of the time so we lived here and my mother bartered and sold her work in the surrounding towns one day an art buyer on a camping trip with his family came across one of her tapestries she smiled into her brandy the rest as they say is history caroline stone he said abruptly why yes with a laugh he downed the brandy and reached for the bottle in one smooth motion your mothers work is in museums bemused he picked up the corner of the blanket beside them ive seen it in the smithsonian he poured more brandy in her glass while she gaped at him this gets stranger and stranger she drank again letting the brandy influence her sense of unreality its you we need to talk about you i need to understand all these questions unable to sit any longer she cupped the snifter in both hands and started to pace the oddest ones pop into my mind i keep remembering you spoke of philadelphia and paris do you know what that means what we made it she lifted the snifter in a toast then recklessly drained it its still there all of it somehow no matter how close we came to blowing everything we survived theres a philadelphia in the future hornblower and thats the most wonderful thing i can imagine still laughing she spun in a circle all these years ive been studying the past trying to understand human nature and now ive had a glimpse of tomorrow i dont know how to thank you just looking at her left his stomach in a knot her cheeks were flushed with excitement her body was long and slim and wonderfully graceful as she moved wanting her was no longer an urge it was an obsession he drew a long careful breath glad i could help i want to know everything absolutely everything how people live how they feel how they court and make love and marry what games do the children play she leaned over to pour another inch of brandy in her glass are hot dogs still the best bet at a baseball game are mondays still the hardest day of the week youll have to make a list he told her he wanted to keep her talking moving laughing watching her now animated bursting with enthusiasm and humor was as arousing as being in her arms what i cant answer the computer can a list of course i make terrific lists her eyes glowed as she laughed at him i know there are more important things for me to ask nuclear disarmament world peace a cure for cancer and the common cold but i want to know it all from the inconsequential to the shattering impatiently she pushed her hair back from her face her words couldnt seem to keep up with her thoughts every second i think of something new do people still have sunday picnics have we beaten world hunger and homelessness do all men in your time kiss the way you do the snifter paused halfway to his lips very slowly very deliberately he set it down i cant answer that because ive only practiced on women i dont know where that came from she too set the snifter aside then rubbed her suddenly damp palms on the thighs of her jeans i suppose im a bit wired excuse me nervous excited confused she pushed her hands through her hair oh god caleb you confuse me even before before all this were even there libby she stared at him he hadnt moved but she saw that he had tensed thats odd she murmured i dont usually confuse anyone nothing seems to be exactly the way i expect it to be with you i guess im a coward because every time you come near me i want to run she closed her eyes thats not true you asked me once if i was afraid of you and i said i wasnt thats not true either i am afraid of you of me and most of all of thinking i might never feel this way again with anyone else she began to roam the room again picking up a pillow tossing it aside shifting a lamp i wish i knew what to do what to say i dont have any experience with this kind of thing and damn it i wish youd kiss me again and shut me up he thought he could feel each separate nerve in his body stretch libby you know i want you i havent kept it to myself but under the circumstances the fact that ill be gone in a few days thats just it suddenly she wanted to weep you will be gone i dont want to wonder what it might have been like i want to know i feel oh i dont know how i feel the only thing im sure of is that i want you to make love with me tonight she stopped shocked that she had said it aloud stunned that it was perhaps the truest thing shed ever said then the nerves were gone and the shock with them she was absolutely calm and absolutely certain caleb i want to be with you tonight he rose the hands he tucked in his pockets were two tense fists a few days ago it would have been easy things have changed libby i care about you you care so you dont want to love me i want to so badly i can taste it when his gaze whipped to hers she could see that he spoke nothing less than the truth i also know that youve had a little too much to drink and more than too much to deal with tonight he didnt dare touch her but his voice was like a caress there are rules libby she took what she knew might be the biggest step in her life when she moved to him and held out both hands break them chapter he could hear his own heart beating could feel the blood pumping to and from it in the shadowy light she looked mysterious impossibly erotic in a baggy sweater and worn corduroy her hair was mussed from the drive and from her own restless fingers he could imagine all too clearly what it would be like to smooth it himself how it would be to slip off all those layers of oversize clothing and find her slim and warm underneath he took a long careful breath and tried to think clearly libby he ran a hand over his roughened chin im trying to think like a man youd understand one from your time i dont seem to be doing a good job of it id rather youd think like yourself she wanted to be calm and confident this was a decision shed waited years to make she was sure but still there were nerves brought on by excitement anticipation and deeprooted doubts about her own capabilities as a woman time doesnt change everything caleb no he was certain men had felt this stirring since the first dawn but when he looked at her he was afraid that what he was feeling was far more complicated than basic attraction his throat was dry his palms were damp the harder he tried to think rationally the less clear his thoughts became maybe we should talk about it she resisted the urge to stare at her feet and kept her eyes on his dont you want me ive imagined making love with you a dozen times she felt the thrill and the fear tangle in a race up her spine when you imagined where were we here or in the forest or thousands of miles away in space theres a pond near my house with water as clear as glass and a bank of flowers my father planted ive seen you there with me it hurt more than a little knowing he would go back to that pond to a place where she couldnt follow but they had now the present was all that mattered all she would let matter she crossed to him knowing that they both needed for her to take the first step heres a good start she lifted a hand to his cheek kiss me again caleb how could he resist her he was certain no man could her eyes were huge and dark her lips were parted waiting slowly he lowered his just brushing testing her soft yielding sigh seemed to fill him need did a wild urgent need shaken by the scope of it he put his hands on her shoulders to draw her away libby dont make me seduce you she murmured i dont know how with a strangled laugh he pulled her hard against him burying his face in her hair too late you already have have i her arms were around him holding tight to what she told herself she would release without regret when the time came a shudder had her gripping harder when he caught her earlobe between his teeth i dont know what to do next cal plucked her up into his arms enjoy he told her before he carried her up the stairs he wanted her in the bed where hed dreamed of her in the pale light of the rising moon he laid her down whatever he had he would give her what she had he would take he understood pleasure the degrees the depths the layers soon very soon so would she slowly he undressed her drawing out the process for his own enjoyment and for the simple wonder of it every inch he uncovered delighted him the slender ankles the smooth calves the curving shoulders he watched her eyes widen and cloud with confused passions when he touched her palms skimming fingers trailing taking her hand he brought it to his mouth to taste and savor ive seen you like this he murmured even when i tried not to shed thought she would feel awkward even foolish she lay naked in the splash of moonlight and felt only beautiful as he looked his fill ive wanted to be here with you even when i tried not to she was smiling when she lifted her hands to undress him he was determined to be patient to be thorough to be very very gentle he knew as he understood she did not that there were hundreds of varied paths to fulfillment this time her first time it would be sweet then her inexperienced hands made his blood leap under his skin seduction unplanned was potent once he covered her hands with his and bit back a moan her fingers tightened under his and her body tensed am i doing something wrong no he let out his breath on a quick laugh and forced himself to relax a little too right this time shifting away he slipped out of the rest of his clothes remind me to ask you to undress me like that again later he brushed her hair back from her face and began to kiss her this first time i have things to show you places to take you he nipped lightly at her chin trust me i do but she was already trembling the brush of his body against hers warmth to warmth was like some strange exciting dream his hands roamed over her whispersoft limber as a violinists and a knot of heat built from her center out to her fingertips before she could do more than wrap her arms around him she melted into the kiss into the long luxurious depth of it then those clever fingers found a point some pulse that beat under the skin near the base of her spine and sent her reeling his mouth muffled her cry of stunned release as her body arched then went as fluid as water beneath his almost experimentally he eased her up and over again his own body vibrating from her pleasure incredible he murmured before she dragged his mouth back to hers her response had his blood pounding she was like a fast fuse and he held the stillsmoking match he knew that if he had taken her that instant she would have welcomed him just as he knew desire was only the root of the flower he wanted to give her the blossom delving deep he found the control that he needed to prolong passion rather than be commanded by it she seemed so fragile now her taste her scent the liquid movements she made under him like the moonbeams that washed the room she was pale and beautiful with his lips against her throat he could feel her pulse thunder echoing his own no fantasy he had ever indulged in no woman he had ever pleasured had been as glorious as the woman who held him now he linked a hand with hers knowing he would never find the words to explain to either of them what this night with her meant to him but he could show her he would show her one moment she was floating the next racing then she was flying love with him was a myriad of tastes and textures a storm of sensations a symphony of sounds his hands were almost unbearably gentle and the scrape of his beard against her skin was an arousing contrast as she gave herself the liberty of touching him of stroking him she discovered that his body was wiretaut and his muscles were trembling she wanted to think to analyze each moment but it was possible only to experience soft so incredibly soft she was almost afraid it was an illusion his touch the words he murmured the glow that seemed to surround her then there was heat stunningly real she was steeped in it in him he lifted her so that they were kneeling in the center of the bed wrapped close flickers of urgency came through a roughened caress a quickened breath a skim of fingers a press of pulse to pulse and he had her gasping her head thrown back her body curved against his he groaned and crushed his hungry mouth to her throat her nails bit into his skin even that aroused him here was passion wilder freer than any he had ever imagined she was open for him only him he was halfmad with the knowledge that she would give to him what she had given to no one else but gently dragging himself back he eased his possessive grip into a caress when he lowered his mouth to her breast the sound of pleasure came from both of them he used his tongue to tease his teeth to torment he could feel her skin hum under his hands and lips she was small delicate it helped to bring out the tenderness he wanted to show her but when he laid her back there was a strength and demand in the hands that pressed him against her so long the thought raced in and out of her mind as he did things to her for her things she had never imagined she had waited so long for this for him her response came freely and fully her loving of him totally instinctive there was no way for her to know as she spun in the world he had opened for her what she brought to him he was skilled and he used his skill to take her beyond those first flashes of pleasure into the velvet space reserved for lovers she was innocent yet just as truly just as easily she took him he slipped into her she closed around him it was a merging of bodies and of hearts and of time clouds dark silveredged clouds libby was floating on one she wanted to go on drifting forever her arms had slid from around him limp to lie on the rumpled sheets she couldnt find the strength to lift them and encircle him again nor could she find her voice she wanted to tell him not to movenot ever to move with her eyes closed and his body fitted so perfectly against hers she counted each beat of his heart silk her skin was like hot fragrant silk he was certain he could never get enough of it with his face buried in her hair he felt his system drift back to earth like a feather on the breeze how could he tell her that no one had ever moved him as she did how could he explain that at this moment he was more at home than he had ever been in his own world or in the sky he loved so much how could he accept that he had found his match in a place and in a time where he was a stranger he wouldnt think of it cal turned his lips into her neck for as long as it was possible he would live from minute to minute you are so lovely he propped himself on an elbow so that he could see her face the paleness of it in the moonlight it was flushed from the afterglow of lovemaking her eyes were clouded with the last dregs of spent passion very lovely he murmured and kissed her your skins still warm he began to nibble as though she were a delicacy he couldnt resist i dont think ill ever be cold again fresh desire began to tingle within her caleb her breath caught on a fast hot shudder you make me feel how with his tongue he traced her parted lips tell me how i make you feel magical her fingers curled into the sheets helpless and went lax strong she gripped his forearms rocked by a dazzling array of new sensations i dont know im going to love you again libby he crushed his mouth to hers in a soulwrenching kiss that left them both breathless and again and again each time i do itll be different there was a power building in him it might have frightened her if she hadnt felt its twin growing in her her eyes stayed open and on his as she lifted her arms and rose to meet him limbs entwined they lay together in the deepest part of the night and listened to the wind rising through the trees he was right libby thought each time was different excitingly different yet beautifully the same she could she hoped live out her life on the memories of this one night are you asleep she settled her head more comfortably in the curve of his shoulder no i might enjoy waking you he slid his hand up to cup her breast in fact im sure i would he nestled his leg cozily between her thighs libby yes somethings missing what food she smothered a yawn against his shoulder youre hungry now ive got to keep up my strength a quick wicked grin curved her lips youve been doing pretty well so far pretty well when she chuckled he pulled her on top of him but im not finished yet why dont i watch while you fix me a sandwich she traced lazy patterns on his chest with her fingertip so male chauvinism survives in the twentythird century i fixed you breakfast this morning she remembered the little silver bag more or less had it only been that morning could a life change so unalterably in just a few short hours hers had she wondered if that should frighten her but all she felt was gratitude all right she started to push away but then he gripped her hips and shifted her first things first he murmured and sent her soaring again later libby struggled into a robe wondering if her mind could handle the simple task of slapping some meat between two slices of bread hed drained her and filled her aroused her and soothed her until her limbs were weak and her mind was mush he switched on the bedside light as he rose out of the bed unabashedly naked got any cookies to go with that sandwich probably she didnt want to stare at him yes she did though she knew it was foolish her color rose as she lowered her eyes to watch her fingers fumble with the belt of her robe when he walked toward the door she looked up quickly youre not going downstairs like that like what without you need to put something on he leaned a hand against the doorjamb and grinned watching her blush delighted him why you should know how im built by now thats not the point what is the point giving up she gestured to the pile of clothes put something on okay ill put on the sweater very funny hornblower youre shy a glint came into his eyes one she recognized very well by now even as he took the first step toward her she snatched up the jeans and tossed them at him if you want me to fix you a sandwich youll have to cover up some of your attributes still grinning he struggled into the jeans if he put them on shed just have to take them off him later enjoying the idea he followed her downstairs why dont you fill the teakettle she suggested as she opened the refrigerator with what water she said with a sigh just water put it on the front burner of the stove and turn the little knob under it she pulled out some packaged ham some cheese and a hothouse tomato mustard hmm he was studying the stove sure people now had to be very patient he decided as he watched the electric coil of the burner slowly glow red with heat still there were advantages libbys cooking was a far cry from the quick packs he was accustomed to then there were the living arrangements though he had always loved the home hed grown up in and was more than comfortable in his quarters aboard his ship he liked the feel of real wood under his bare feet and the smell of it burning when she had a fire going in the main room then there was libby herself he wasnt certain it was proper to call her an advantage she was distinct unique and everything hed ever wanted in a woman his mouth fell open an instant before the heat from the burner singed his finger with a quick yelp he jumped back what is it for a moment he just stared at her her hair was tousled around her face and her eyes were heavy from lack of sleep the robe she wore seemed to swallow her up nothing he managed nearly overwhelmed by an emotion that he prayed was only desire i burned my finger dont play with the stove she said mildly then went back to making the sandwiches everything he wanted in a woman that wasnt possible he didnt know what he wanted in a woman and he was a long way from making up his mind or had been that thought put the fear of god into him that and the uncomfortable suspicion that his mind had been made up for him the moment hed opened his eyes and seen her dozing in the chair ridiculous he hadnt even known her then but he knew her now he couldnt be in love with her he watched as she tossed her hair back from her face with a flick of her hand and his stomach tied itself into knots attraction however outrageous was acceptable it wasnt possible that he was in love he could love being with her love making love with her laughing with her he could care for her find her fascinating and arousing but as for love that wasnt an option love here and in his time meant things neither of them could ever have together a home a family years as the kettle began to sputter he let out a long breath he was simply magnifying the situation she was special to him and always would be the days he spent with her would be a precious part of his life but it was essential for him to remember for both their sakes that his life began two hundred years after libby no longer existed is something wrong he glanced over to see her holding two plates her head cocked a bit to the side as it did whenever she was trying to work out a problem no he smiled and took the plates from her my mind was wandering eat hornblower she patted his cheek youll feel better because he wanted to believe it could be that simple he sat down and dug in while she fixed the tea it seemed natural libby thought for them to share tea and sandwiches in the middle of the nightjust the two of them sitting in the cozy kitchen with an owl hooting somewhere in the forest and the moonlight fading the awkwardness she had feltfoolishly she believedbefore shed tugged on her robe was gone better she asked him when hed downed half of his sandwich yes the tension that had slammed into him so unexpectedly had nearly dissipated he stretched out his legs so that the arch of his foot rubbed over her ankle there was something soothing in the contact like a long nap on a rainy afternoon she looked so pretty with her hair mussed and her eyes heavy how is it he murmured that im the first man to have you she nearly choked before she managed to swallow the tea that was halfway down her throat i dont she coughed a little then tugged the lapels of her robe closer i dont know how to answer that do you consider that an odd question charmed again he smiled leaning closer so that he could touch her hair youre so sensitive so attractive other men must have wanted you no that is i cant say i havent really paid much attention does it embarrass you for me to tell you youre attractive no but when she picked up her teacup with both hands she was flushed a little perhaps i cant be the first to have told you how lovely you are how warm he pried one of her hands from the cup to soothe her fingers how exciting yes you can almost unbearably aroused she let out a long shaky breath i havent had a lot of social experience with men my studies her breath snagged as he kissed her fingers my work he released her hand before he went with his impulse to make love with her again but you study men studying and interacting are different things he didnt have to touch her to stir her libby realized he only had to look as he was looking now im not very outgoing unless i concentrate on it he started to laugh then realized she believed it i think you underestimate liberty stone you took me in and cared for me and i was a stranger i could hardly have left you out in the rain you couldnt others could history may not be my strong suit libby but i doubt human nature has changed that much you went out in the storm to find me brought me into your home let me stay even when i annoyed you if i get back to my own time and place it will be because of you she rose then to fix more tea she didnt want she didnt want to think about his leaving though she knew she would have to it was wrong to pretend even for a few hours that he would stay with her and forget the life hed left behind i dont think giving you a bed and some scrambled eggs constitutes a real debt she made herself smile as she turned toward him again but if you want to be grateful i wont argue with you hed said something wrong though he couldnt put his finger on it cal could tell from the way her eyes had changed she was smiling at him but her eyes were dark and sad i dont want to hurt you libby her eyes softened now and he was relieved no i know that she sat down again and poured each of them another full cup what do you plan to do about getting back i mean how much do you know about physics next to nothing then lets just say ill put the ships computer to work the damage was pretty minimal so that shouldnt be a problem ill have to ask you to drive me out to the ship again of course she felt a bubble of panic and struggled to get past it i suppose youll want to stay on the ship now while you work out your calculations and make your repairs it would be more practical and it would certainly be more convenient cal gave it no more than a moments consideration i was hoping i could stay here ive got my aircycle on board so i can get back and forth easily enough if you dont mind the company no of course not she said it quickly too quickly flustering herself then she stopped and backed up your aircycle if it wasnt damaged in the crash he mused then he tossed the possibility aside well have a look tomorrow are you going to eat the rest of that what oh no she passed him the second half of her sandwich it was ridiculous she supposed but every now and then he said something that made her wonder if she was dreaming again cal she began slowly it occurs to me that i can never tell anyone about you or any of this id rather youd wait until id gone he finished off the sandwich but i dont mind if you tell anyone thats big of you she gave him a bland look tell me do they have padded cells in the twentythird century padded cells he took a moment to imagine one is that a joke only on me she told him as she rose to clear the plates it may be one on me too ive wondered if once i get back anyone will believe me a thought struck her that was both absurd and fascinating maybe i could do a time capsule i could write everything down put in a few interesting or pertinent items and seal it up we could bury iti dont know down by the stream perhaps when you got back you could dig it all up a time capsule the idea appealed to him not just scientifically but personally wouldnt it mean he would still have something of her even when they were separated by centuries he would need that he realized the solid proof of not only where he had been but that she had existed i can run it through the computer make sure we dont put it somewhere thats going to be covered by a building or a landslide or some such thing good she picked up a pad from the counter and began to scribble what are you doing making notes she squinted at her own writing and wished she had her glasses well need to write everything down of course starting with you and your ship what else should we put in it she wondered tapping the pencil against the pad a newspaper i think and a picture would be good we may have to drive back into town and find one of those little booths that take pictures no ill buy a polaroid camera she scribbled faster that way we can take pictures here in the house or right outside then well need some personal things she fingered the thin gold chain at her throat maybe some basic household items youre being a scientist he took her by the waist and drew her slowly unerringly against him i find that very exciting thats silly but it didnt seem silly at all when he lowered his head and began to nibble at her neck she felt the floor tilt beneath her feet cal hmm he journeyed up to a small vulnerable spot just behind her ear i wanted to the pad slipped out of her hand and landed on the floor at their feet to what quick and clever his fingers loosened the knot at her waist tonight you can have anything you want you she sighed as her robe slid off her shoulders just you thats the easy part more than willing to oblige he braced her against the counter a hundred erotic ideas swam through his mind he was going to see to it that neither of them thought the same way about this cozy little kitchen again the streaks of pink along her skin stopped him whats all this curious he ran a finger over the swell of her breast then shifted his hand to his chin ive scratched you what she was already floating an inch off the floor and she was less than willing to touch down i havent shaved in days annoyed with himself he bent to lightly kiss the skin hed irritated earlier youre so soft i didnt feel a thing she reached for him again but he only kissed her hair theres only one thing to do i know she ran her hands up his muscled back with a laugh he hugged her tighter thats two things he scooped her up again for no other reason than that it felt wonderful you dont have to carry me but she nuzzled into his shoulder i can walk to bed maybe but wed better use the bathroom for this the bathroom im going to have to deal with that nastylooking device he told her as he started up the stairs and youre going to walk me through it so i dont cut my throat nastylooking device she tried to put it all together as he carried her upstairs dont you know how to use a razor were civilized where i come from all instruments of torture have been outlawed is that so she waited until he set her down again i suppose that means women dont wear high heels or controltop panty hose never mind she said when he opened his mouth i think this could become a very philosophical discussion and its much too late opening the linen closet she took out the razor and the shaving cream here you go right he looked at the tools in his hand with a kind of resigned dread what a man did for his woman just how do i go about this this is all secondhand as ive never shaved my face before but i believe you spread on the shaving cream then slide the edge of the razor over your beard shaving cream he squirted some into his hand then ran his tongue over his teeth not toothpaste no i it didnt take her long to get the picture leaning back against the sink she covered her mouth with her hand and tried unsuccessfully not to giggle oh hornblower you poor thing cal studied the can in his hand as he saw it he really had no choice while libby was bent nearly double he turned aimed and fired chapter she awakened slowly muttering a bit when the sunlight intruded on her dreams she shifted or tried to but she was weighed down by an arm around her waist and a leg hooked possessively over hers content with that she snuggled closer and had the pleasure of feeling her sleepwarmed skin rub against cals she didnt know what time it was and for perhaps the first time in her life it didnt matter morning or afternoon she was happy to lie curled in bed dozing the day away as long as he was with her drifting nearly dreaming again she stroked a hand over him solid she thought he was solid and real and for the moment hers even with her eyes closed she could see him every feature of his face every line of his body there had never been anyone she had felt belonged so completely to her before even her parents for all their love all their understanding had belonged to each other initially she would always think of them as a unit first and last and sunny libby smiled a little as she thought of her sister even though she was younger by nearly two years sunny had always been independent and her own personargumentative and daring in ways libby could never try to emulate but cal it was true that he had only just appeared in her life would disappear again all too quickly but he was hers his laughter his temper his passion they all belonged to her now she would keep them treasure them long after he was gone to love as she did libby mused when every emotion every word every look had to be squeezed into a matter of hours was both precious and heartbreaking he thought hed been dreaming but the shape the texture the scent of a womans body were very very real libbys body her name was there his first waking thought she was pressed against him a perfect fit even in sleep the slow gentle stroke of her hand aroused him in the most exquisite way hed lost count of the times they had moved together during the night but he knew dawn had been breaking the last time shed cried out his name the light had been dim and pearly he would never forget it she was like a fantasy all soft curves agile limbs and tireless passions somewhere along the line he had stopped being the teacher and had been taught there was more to loving than the uncountable physical pleasures a man and a woman could offer each other there was trust and patience generosity and joy there was the drugging contentment of falling asleep knowing your partner would be there when you awoke partner the word floated through his mind his match was it fate or fancy that he had had to travel through time to meet his match he didnt want to think of it refused to all he wanted now was to make love with libby in the sunlight he shifted and before either of them was fully awake slipped into her her soft moan mingled with his own as their lips met acceptance affection arousal slowly drawing out the lazy delight they moved together their hands beginning a quiet exploration the kiss deepening i love you he heard her words a caressing whisper in his mind and answered them like an echo as his lips began to trace her face the admissions shocked neither of them as they were too dazed by the tumultuous sensations and emotions running through them she had never spoken those words to another man nor he to another woman before the impact hit home need had them clinging closer gracefully gloriously they took each other to the pinnacle later he nuzzled down between her breasts but he was no longer sleeping had she said she loved him and had he told her he loved her what disturbed him most was that he couldnt be sure if it had happened or if it had been his imagination something wished for while his mind was vulnerable with sleep and pleasure and he couldnt ask her didnt dare any answer she would give would hurt if she didnt love him it would be like losing part of his heart of his soul if she did it would make leaving her something akin to dying it was best for both of them to take what they had he wanted to make her laugh to see both passion and humor in her eyes to hear them in her voice and he would remember cal closed his eyes tight whatever happened to him he would always remember so would she he needed to be certain of his place in her memories come with me sliding off the bed he dragged her with him where to the bathroom again laughing she tried to snag her robe but he pulled her into the hall without it you dont need another shave good thing you only cut yourself three or four times and its your own fault you used up most of the shaving cream beforehand he sent her a wicked grin i liked rubbing it all over you better if youre getting ideas about the toothpaste maybe later he lifted her up and into the tub for now ill settle for a shower she let out a quick shriek when the cold water hit her before she could retaliate or form even a token protest he had joined her wrapping one arm around her while he adjusted the water temperature with his free hand he thought he was getting rather good at it she took a stream of water in the face sputtered started to swear then found herself caught in a hot wet endless kiss shed never experienced anything like it steamy air slick skin soapy hands her knees were weak by the time he shut the spray off and wrapped her in a towel as dizzy as she he rested a forehead on hers i think if were going to get anything doneanything else that iswed better get out of the house right after we eat she was amazed she had the energy to laugh naturally it was late afternoon when they stood by cals ship again clouds had moved in from the north bringing a chill libby told herself that was the reason she felt cold she hugged the short jacket tighter but the cold came from inside im standing here looking at it knowing its real but i still cant understand it cal nodded his contented relaxed mood had fled and he wasnt entirely sure why i get the same sensation whenever i look at your cabin there was a headache building behind his eyes the kind he knew came from tension look i know youve got work of your own and i dont want to hold you up but would you mind waiting a few minutes while i check the cycle no shed been hoping hed ask her to stay all day masking her disappointment she smiled at him actually id like to see it ill be right back he opened the hatch and disappeared inside he would do that again soon and for the last time libby thought she had to be prepared for it strange but shed imagined hed told her he loved her that morning it was a nice soothing thought though she understood he didnt really he couldnt he cared for her more than anyone had ever cared for her but he hadnt fallen deeply completely in love with her as she had with him because she loved him she was going to do everything she could to help him starting with accepting limitations it was a beautiful day after the most beautiful night of her life smiling really smiling she looked up at the cloudy sky the rain would come by evening and it would be welcome she glanced back at the ship when she heard a low metallic hum another door openedthe cargo door she assumed because of its size and location her mouth dropped open as cal on the back of a small streamlined bike raced out six inches above the ground it made a sound that was something like a purr not catlike or motorlike more like the sound of air parting it was shaped something like a motorcycle but without the bulk there were two wheels for ground transportation and a narrow padded seat to accommodate riders the body itself was a long curving cylinder that forked into two slender handlebars he droveor flewit over to her then sat grinning on the seat like a tenyearold showing off his first twelvespeed it runs great he made some small movement with his hand on the handgrips that had the purr deepening want a ride frowning she eyed the little gauges and buttons on the stock beneath the handlebars it looked like a toy i dont know come on libby wanting to share his pleasure he held out a hand youll like it i wont let anything happen to you she looked at him and at the bike hovering just above the pine needles that were strewn on the forest floor it was a small machineif indeed that was the proper termbut there was room enough for two on the narrow black seat the body was painted a metallic blue that glistened with deeper shades in the sunlight it looked harmless she decided after a moment and she doubted if anything so small could hold much power with a shrug she slid on the seat behind him better hold on he told her mostly because he wanted to feel her body curve against his the strength of the vibration beneath her shocked her though she knew it was foolish cal had looked harmless too she remembered hornblower shouldnt we have helmets or the words whipped away as he accelerated she might have screamed but instead she squeezed her eyes shut and gripped cal so tightly that he choked on a laugh he could feel her heart beating against him as fast and heavy as it had through the night with an innate skill honed finer by practice he steered once around the ship then up the slope speed hed always been addicted to it he felt the air slap his face stream through his hair and pressed for more the sky beckoned his first and most constant lover but he resisted aware that libby would be more frightened than thrilled if he took her too high too quickly instead he breezed through the forest winding around trees skimming over rock and water a bird burst off a branch just above their heads and went wheeling away chattering badtemperedly at the competition he could feel her grip relax a fraction then a little more her face was no longer pressed between his shoulder blades what do you think she could nearly breathe again it seemed her stomach had decided to stay in place at least for the moment she opened one eye for a cautious look and swallowed hard i think im going to murder you the minute were on the ground again relax the cycle tilted thirty degrees right then left as he danced through the trees easy for him to say she thought another look showed her that they were more than ten feet above the ground she gasped nearly managed to squeal out a demand to be set down but then it hit her she was flying not enclosed in some huge bulky plane thousands of feet up but freely lightly she could feel the wind on her face in her hair could taste the promise of spring on it there was no loud roar of engine noise to disturb the sensation they were skimming through the forest as playfully as birds he stopped in the center of the clearing his ship had created while the bike hovered he turned to look at her want me to go down no up she laughed and tossed her head back she had already felt the pull of the sky he was grinning when he leaned back to kiss her how high whats the limit i dont know but i dont think we ought to chance it if we go up above the trees somebody might spot us he was right of course libby pushed her hair out of her face wondering why she seemed to have so little sense when she was around him to the treetops then just once delighted with her he turned around he felt her arms hook firmly around him and then they were flying again hed never forget however many times he had taken to sky and space however many times he would yet take to them he would never forget this one playful flight with libby she was laughing and the sound of it caressed his ear as her body pressed companionably against his her fingers were linked loosely at his waist his only regret was that he couldnt watch her face as they rose up and up making love with her was like this as clean and clear as cutting through the air as mystifying and seductive as defying gravity he resisted the temptation to crest the trees contenting himself and her with gliding around the thick branches at a hundred feet below they could see a thin stream that cut through the rock and a waterfall driven by the spring rain and the snowmelt that danced down the ridge and fell into space the sun pushed through the clouds so that they could watch the pattern of shadows shift on the ground below for a moment they both turned their faces to the sky and wished he slowed for their descent and they seemed to drift downward weightless soundless libby felt her hair lift off her neck teased by the air currents she thought pleasantly of peter pan and fairy dust before they touched down lightly beside the ship okay when he turned to look over his shoulder libby noticed that the faint hum had stopped the chill had vanished it was wonderful i could have stayed up all day flyings habitforming no one knew that better than he he swung off then took her hand im glad you liked it it was over libby told herself when she felt her feet on solid ground again but she had one more memory to store away i loved it im not going to ask you how it works i doubt id understand anyway and it might spoil the fun with her hand still caught in his she looked at the ship her feelings about it were as confused as the rest of her emotions it had brought him to her and it would take him away ill let you get to work cal was dealing with the same tugofwar himself ill be back around nightfall all right she took her hand from his then stuck it restlessly in her pocket you wont have any trouble finding your way im a good navigator of course the birds they had frightened away with their ride were beginning to sing again time was slipping by well id better go he knew she was stalling but then so was he it was stupid cal told himself he would be with her again in a matter of hours you could come in with me but i dont think id get a lot done it was tempting she could go inside distract him keep him away from the computer and the answers for a few more hours but it wouldnt be right libby looked up at him again as all the love and the longing welled up inside her i havent gotten any work done the last couple of days either all right leaning over he kissed her see you tonight he stood by the open hatch as she started up the slope but when she reached the top of the ridge she didnt look back libby spent most of the day drafting an account of the series of events that had occurred over the last week she used cals words his theory to explain how he had come to be with her coloring them with her own impressions then she listed in the orderly fashion that was second nature to her everything that had happened from the time she had seen the flash in the sky until she had left cal beside the ship that was the simple part setting down the facts her memory was faultless she knew that would be both a blessing and a curse when she was alone again but for now she pulled together her objectivity and gave the story as much skill and dedication as she had her dissertation once done she read the entire story over twice refining or enlarging where she saw fit she was trained to report she mused as she studied the computer screen when cal presented his experiences to the scientists of his time she wanted him to have the benefit of whatever skill she could give him it was a fantastic story fantastic in the most literal sense of the word perhaps it wouldnt seem quite as fantastic in cals time how would his people react to him when he returned when he told his tale the accidental explorer she thought with a smile well columbus had been looking for india when hed discovered the new world she liked to think that he would be treated as a kind of hero that he was a man whose name would be in history books he had the look of a hero she mused daydreaming a little as her glasses slipped down her nose tall and tough the bandage over his brow added a rakish lookas the weeks growth of beard had before hed shaved it for her she remembered and felt the deep glow of pleasure he was perhaps an ordinary man in his time a man she supposed who did his job as others did who groaned over getting up in the morning one who occasionally drank too much or forgot to pay bills he wasnt wealthy or brilliant or wildly successful he was simply caleb hornblower a man who had taken a wrong turn and become extraordinary to her he would never be just a man he would always be the man would she love again no libby thought with the calm of absolute certainty she would be content somehow with her work and her family with her memories but to love again would be impossible she had even as a child believed that there would be only one man for her perhaps that was why it had always been so easy for her to concentrate on studies and career while her contemporaries had drifted in and out of relationships and fallen in and out of love she hated making mistakes libby smiled a little reluctantly at the admission it was a flaw certainly one of pride but she had always detested the idea of taking a misstep personally or professionally that was why she studied harder than most researched more thoroughly considered more carefully it had paid off she reflected as she pushed a few buttons and had her dissertation flashing onto the screen she was young for the degree of success shed achieved and she intended to achieve a great deal more she was old perhaps to be having her first love affair but caution and care hadnt led her astray loving cal would never be a mistake content she pushed her glasses more securely on her nose leaned forward and went to work he found her there hours later her posture long forgotten absorbed in a culture as different from hers as hers was to cal shed switched on the desk lamp at dusk and the light slanted across her hands strong capable hands cal thought probably inherited from her artist mother the nails were short and unpainted at the ends of long fingers there was a scar a faint one hed noticed before along the base of her thumb hed meant to ask her how shed come by it he thought hed been tired when hed come innot physically but mentally with the burden of figures and calculations weighing on his mind but now seeing her fatigue was forgotten hed managed somehow to stop thinking about her while hed worked it had been a deliberate effort to stop thinking stop wanting stop needing because of it hed managed to make some progress he was all but sure of what he had to do to get home he knew the odds and the risks now watching her he knew the sacrifice hed only known her briefly it was necessary very necessary to remind himself of that his life wasnt here with her he had a home an identity he had a family he realized now that he loved more than he had once comprehended but he stood and watched her as the minutes ticked away absorbing every breath every careless gesture the way her hair swept over her neck the way her stockinged foot tapped impatiently when her fingers paused now and then she would drag a hand through her hair or cup her chin in her palms and stare owlishly at the screen he found every movement endearing when he finally said her name his voice was strained libby she jolted and spun in her chair to stare at him the hallway was dark behind him he was just a silhouette propped casually against the doorframe love nearly smothered her oh i didnt hear you come in you were pretty deep in your work i guess when he stepped into the room the intensity in his eyes had her drawing her brows together what about yours did it go well yes you look upset is something wrong no he reached down to touch her face and his eyes softened no your calculations coming along her skin felt like silk he thought and it warmed under his touch in fact i made more progress than id expected oh he thought he saw a shadow flicker in her eyes but her voice was bright and encouraging thats good did you ride the cycle back yeah i left it behind the shed it had been a stupid question she thought he would hardly have hiked all the way she wanted to ask him to take her up again now while the moon was rising the wind was already picking up warning of rain it would be wonderful but he looked tired and troubled well after all that you must be hungry she glanced around as if noticing the dark for the first time i hadnt realized it was so late why dont i go down and toss something together it can wait taking her hand he drew her to her feet the machine continued to hum forgotten by both of them we can go down later and both throw something together i like the way you look in glasses with a quick laugh she reached for them he caught her hand so that both of hers were trapped in his no dont take them off he tilted his head to kiss her as if experimenting her taste was the same thank god most of the tension dissolved they make you look smart and serious though her heart was already thumping she smiled i am smart and serious yes i suppose you are he ran his thumbs over the inside of her wrists and felt her pulse scramble the way you look right now makes me want to see just how unintellectual i can make you with their hands still joined he bent to kiss her holding himself back teasing and nibbling her lips until her breath was a shudder libby yes what can you tell me about the mudmen of new guinea nothing she strained against him moaning a bit when his lips continued to brush featherlight over hers nothing at all kiss me caleb i am his lips cruised over her face skimming here lingering there she was like a volcano awakened after eons of sleep ready to burst free hot and molten touch me i will it was never what she expected he had her teetering on the edge with only a stroke of his hands then as she trembled back to earth he began to undress her peeling off her flannel shirt tugging off her jeans while they stood beside the bed she wore a narrow white undershirt in plain cotton it seemed to fascinate him as he toyed with the straps skimmed his finger along the low scooped neck before he slipped it up and over her head his lips were never still nor were his hands which roamed to exploit all the secrets hed already discovered delighted delirious she yanked his sweater over his head it amazed her that the need could have sharpened and grown outracing what she had felt for him the first time now she knew where he would take her and had already traveled some of the routes he navigated so expertly his skin was soft smooth it pleased her to run her hands up and over his back to feel it and the hard muscle beneath the contrast the peculiarly masculine contrast made her knees weak she heard his breath quicken as she stroked her hands from shoulder to waist to be wanted this desperately she could feel it in the way he touched her in the way his mouth came back to hers again and again for longer deeper hungrier kisses his tongue tangled with hers enticing erotic and she felt as well as heard him suck in his breath as her knuckles grazed his stomach she had learned cal thought dizzily and she had learned quickly her hands and the gentle movements of her body against his were driving him beyond reason he wanted to tell her to give him a moment to give him the time he needed to gain a firm lasting grip on control but it was already too late much too late he dragged her to the bed her gasp of surprise ended in a dark moan of pleasure she reached for him only to find herself gripping the bedclothes as he whipped her over the first raw edge shed thought she knew what loving was even a night steeped in it hadnt prepared her for this he was crazed and in a moment her madness matched his no gentle touch no easy persuasion it was all hot ripe need and a desperate race for satisfaction like two lost souls they rolled over the sheets and drowned in each other a desperate demand a fervent answer murmured requests were for the sane tonight there were only breathless moans and shuddering sighs her skin was so slick with the heat passion pumped into her that it slid sleekly over his each time his mouth found hers she tasted the rich musky flavor of desire there were no velvet clouds now but a storm breaking exciting electric she could almost hear the air singing with it drums seemed to pound inside her head inside her heart beating in an everincreasing rhythm gulping in air she rolled over him to press her open mouth to his throat his chest knowing only that his flavor was dark rich and wonderful he couldnt get enough no matter how much she gave he needed more and still more he was unaware that his fingers were digging hard into her skin bruising even as his lips followed the trail he could see her in the dim lamplight the way her damp skin glowed the way her head fell back each time pleasure overtook her her eyes were gold like some dark ancient coin tribute for a goddess he thought of her as one now as she rose over him her body curved back like a bow the light casting an aura around her hair he thought he would die for her thought he would die without her then she was taking him into her deeply fully he reached blindly as she did and their hands linked then there was no thought at all he held her close long after the tremors had subsided in both of them he tried to remember what he had done what she had done but it was all a blur of torrential sensations and emotions that had bordered on the violent he was afraid he had hurt her that now that her mind and body had cooled she would pull away from him and what was inside him libby her only answer was a slight shifting of her head against his chest one of her greatest pleasures was feeling his heart race under her cheek im sorry he stroked her hair wondering if it was too late for tenderness her eyes opened even that effort was almost more than she could manage there was a flicker of doubt she struggled to ignore you are yes i dont know what happened ive never treated another woman like that you havent he couldnt see the smile that curved her lips no cautious ready to release her if she jerked away he lifted her head id like to make it up to you he began then saw that the glint in her eyes was not tears but laughter youre smiling how she said kissing the bandage on his forehead would you like to make it up to me i thought id hurt you he rolled her over on her back then took a good long look she was still smiling and her eyes were dark with centuries of secrets only women fully understood i guess not you havent answered my question she stretched not because she meant to entice but because she felt as contented as a cat in a sunbeam how are you going to make it up to me well he glanced around the rumpled bed then shimmied up to look down at the floor reaching down he plucked up her fallen glasses he twirled them once by the sidepiece then grinned why dont you put these on and ill show you chapter libby was lingering over a second cup of coffee wondering if being in love was directly connected to the difficulty she was having facing a day cooped up with her computer she recognized the signs of procrastination in cal as well he sat across from her poking at the remains of her breakfast hed already eaten his own more than procrastination she mused he looked troubled again as he had when hed come back the night before as he had seemed she thought when theyd fallen asleep more than once during the night and the morning shed been certain he was about to tell her something something she was afraid she would hate to hear she wanted to find a way to encourage him to smooth the way to his leaving her love she thought with a sigh had made her crazy the rain had come in a long quiet shower that had lasted almost until morning now with the sun the light was soft ethereal and there were pockets of mist hugging the ground it was a good day for making excuses for taking aimless walks in the woods for making lazy love under a quilt but thinking like that libby reminded herself wouldnt help cal find his way home youd better get started it was a gentle nudge offered without enthusiasm yeah he would rather have sat where he was ignoring reality instead he stood and giving her a quick kiss walked to the back door when he opened it the kitchen filled with birdsong i was thinking id take a break during the afternoon maybe come back for lunch im getting so i cant stomach the stores on the ship it was more that he couldnt stand being away from her but she smiled taking him at his word okay already the day seemed brighter if im not slaving over a hot stove ill be upstairs working it seemed so normal libby thought when he closed the door behind him to part in the morning with an easy kiss and plans to meet for lunch that was probably best she decided after she topped off her cup and took it upstairs with her there was certainly little else about their relationship that anyone would have called normal she worked well into the afternoon blaming her edginess on the caffeine she didnt want to dwell on the fact that cal had seemed too quiet too thoughtful that morning they both had a lot on their minds and she reminded herself he would be back soon since it would be a habit soon broken she decided to cut her own work short to go down and fix him something special for lunch when she reached the base of the stairs she heard the sound of a car visitors werent just rare at the cabin they were nonexistent feeling equal parts surprise and annoyance she opened the front door oh my god now it was all surprise with a healthy dose of trepidation mom dad then it was love waves of it as she rushed out to greet her parents they stepped out from either side of a small battered pickup liberty caroline stone welcomed her daughter with a throaty laugh and a theatrical spread of her arms she was dressed almost identically to libby in faded jeans and a chunky hipgrazing sweater but unlike libbys plain red wool carolines was a symphony of hues and tones she had woven herself she wore two jetblack drop earringsin the same earand a necklace of tourmaline that glittered in the light libby kissed carolines smooth unpowdered cheek mom what are you doing here i used to live here she reminded libby then kissed her again while william stood back and grinned they were two of the three most important women in his life though they were a generation apart he noted with pride that his wife looked hardly older than his daughter their coloring and build was so similar that more often than not they were mistaken for sisters what am i he demanded part of the scenery he spun libby around for one of his hard swaying hugs my baby he said and gave her a loud smacking kiss the scientist my daddy she responded in kind the executive he winced just a little dont let it get around so let me get a look at you grinning libby took her own survey he still wore his hair too long to be conservative though there was a sprinkle of silver in the dark blond waves and a bit more dashed through his beard both were trimmed now by a barber with a french accent but little else about william stone had changed he was still the man she remembered the man who had carried her papoosestyle through the forest he was tall and at best he would be considered stringy long legs and arms gave him a gangly look his face was gaunt his cheekbones sunken his eyes were a deep pure gray that promised honesty so libby turned in a saucy circle what do you think not too bad he slipped an arm around carolines shoulders together they looked as they always had united we did a pretty good job on the first two caro you did an excellent job libby corrected then she stopped first two you and sunbeam love with an easy smile caroline reached in the back of the pickup why dont we get the groceries inside but igroceries biting her lip libby watched her parents pull out bags several bags she had to tell them something im so happy to see both of you she grunted a bit when her fattier set two heavy brown sacks in her arms and id like to that is i should tell you that im not alone thats nice absently william pulled out another sack he wondered if his wife had noticed the bag of barbecued potato chips hed stashed inside of course she had he thought she never missed anything we always like to meet your friends baby yes i know but this one caro take that one along inside ones enough for you to carry dad seeing no other way libby blocked her fathers progress she snagged her lip again when she heard the door swing open and shut behind her mother i really should explain explain what she wondered and how im listening libby but these bags are getting heavy he shifted them must be all the tofu its about caleb that caught his attention caleb who hornblower caleb hornblower hes here she managed weakly with me william cocked one gently arched brow oh really the man in question parked his cycle behind the shed and lecturing himself strode toward the house there was nothing wrong in taking an afternoon break in any case the computer was hard at work even in his absence hed completed most of the major repairs to the ship and in another day two at the most it would be ready for flight if he wanted to spend an extra hour or so with a beautiful exciting woman he was entitled he wasnt dragging his heels he wasnt in love with her and the sun revolved around the planets swearing under his breath he walked through the open back door just seeing her made him smile even if he could only see her small nicely rounded bottom as she rummaged in the bottom of the refrigerator his mood lifting he walked quietly over to grab her firmly intimately by the hips babe i can never make up my mind which side of you i like best caleb the astonished exclamation came not from the woman hed only just turned into his arms but from the kitchen doorway his head whipped around and he stared at libby who was gaping wideeyed from across the room her arms full of brown bags beside her stood a tall thin man who was eyeing him with obvious dislike slowly caleb turned back to see that he was embracing an equally attractive if somewhat older woman than the one hed expected hello she said and smiled quite beautifully you must be libbys friend yes he managed to clear his throat i must be you might want to let go of my wife william told him so that she can close the refrigerator i beg your pardon he took a long and very hasty step back i thought you were libby are you in the habit of grabbing my daughter by the dad libby cut him off as she dumped the bags on the table as beginnings went she thought this one was hardly auspicious this is caleb hornblower hes staying with me for a while cal these are my parents william and caroline stone terrific since he didnt think he could manage to have his molecules reappear in a different location he figured hed better face the music nice to meet you he found that the best place for his hands was his pockets libby looks a great deal like you so ive been told caroline beamed another smile at him though never quite in that way wanting to let him off the hook she offered him a hand will why dont you put those bags down and say hello to libbys friend he took his time about it william wanted to size the man up goodlooking enough he supposed strong features steady eyes time would tell hornblower is it william was pleased that cals grip was cool and firm yes it was the first time hed been weighed and measured so thoroughly since hed enlisted in the isf should i apologize again once was probably enough but william held his opinion on the rest in reserve i was just about to make lunch she had to do something libby thought to keep everyone busy until shed worked out a solution good idea caroline pulled fresh cauliflower out of a bag shed found the chips and a jar of pickled hot sausages william had smuggled in but ill make it why dont you give me a hand william but i brew some tea she suggested id love some tea libby said knowing it was a sure way to her fathers heart she took cal by the hand well be right back the moment they were in the living room she turned on him what are we going to do about what with a sound of disgust libby paced toward the fireplace ive got to tell them something and it can hardly be that youve just dropped in from the twentythird century no id just as soon you didnt but i never lie to them torn libby poked a charred log with her toe i cant he walked over to cup her chin in his hand leaving out a few small details isnt lying small details like the fact that you came visiting in a spaceship for one she closed her eyes it should be funny maybe it would be in five or ten years hornblower this situation would be awkward enough without the added bonus of you being from wheremake that whenyou are what situation she tried not to grind her teeth theyre my parents this is their house and you and i are she made a circling gesture with her hand lovers he supplied will you keep your voice down patient he laid his hands on her shoulders gently kneading libby they probably figured that out when i almost kissed your mother in the refrigerator about that i thought she was you i know still libby i realize it wasnt the most traditional way to meet your parents but i think that of the four of us i was the most surprised she couldnt help chuckling maybe absolutely so i think we should just get on to the next step which is lunch hornblower with a sigh she dropped her forehead on his chest it was a pity this was one of the things she loved about himhis ability to appreciate the simple things i wish youd get it through your head that this is a sensitive situation what are we going to do about it she waited one beat if you ask me about what im going to smack you you talk tough framing her face with his hands he lifted it lets see some action libby didnt make even a token protest as his mouth lowered to hers it was all some sort of a dream anyway she told herself surely she could make everything come out all right in her own dream there was a loud annoyed cough from behind her jerking away from cal she looked at her father ah your mother says lunch is ready though he hated acting so predictably he gave cal one last measuring look before he went back into the kitchen i think hes warming up to me cal mused in the kitchen william scowled at his wife that man always has his hands on one of my women one of your women caroline let out a long robust laugh really will she tossed her head so that both of her earrings danced he does have very nice hands looking for trouble with one arm he scooped her up against him always she gave him a warm and very provocative kiss before turning toward the doorway come sit down she said sharing her radiant smile with cal i just threw a salad together she had four bowls set out on her own woven mats in the center of the table was a concoction of vegetables and herbs with the surprising addition of green bananas sprinkled with wholewheat croutons and ready to be mixed with a yogurt dressing libby gave one wistful thought to the blts shed planned on before she sat down so cal caroline passed him the bowl are you an anthropologist no im a pilot he said just as libby announced cals a truck driver libby muttered under her breath as cal calmly dished up salad cargo he explained pleased that he could honor libbys wish to stick with the truth i deal primarily with cargo libby figures that makes me an airborne truck driver you fly william drummed his long skinny fingers on the table yes thats all i ever really wanted to do it must be exciting caroline leaned forward always willing to be fascinated sunbeam our other daughter is taking flying lessons maybe you can give her some pointers sunnys always taking lessons there was both amusement and affection in libbys voice as she passed the salad on to her mother shes good at everything she took up parachuting and figured the next step was to learn how to fly the plane herself makes sense he glanced over at caroline caroline stone he thought not for the first time the twentiethcentury genius cal would have found it no more incredible to be sharing a meal with vincent van gogh or voltaire this is a wonderful salad mrs stone caroline thanks she slanted a look at her husband knowing he would have preferred his sausages and chips and a cold beer after more than twenty years she hadnt quite converted him that never stopped her from trying i feel very strongly that proper nutrition is what keeps the mind clear and open she began i recently read a study where proper diet and exercise was directly linked to longer life spans if we cared for ourselves better we could live well over a hundred years noting the expression on cals face libby gave his ankle a kick under the table she had a feeling hed been about to inform her mother that people did live over the century mark and regularly whats the use of living that long if you have to eat leaves and twigs william began but then he noted his wifes narrowed look not that these arent great leaves you can have something sweet for dessert she leaned over to kiss his cheek six rings glittered on her hands as she offered the bowl to cal again have some more yes thanks he took a second serving his appetite continued to amaze libby i admire your work mrs stone really it still pleased her when anyone referred to her weaving as her work do you have a piece no its out of my reach he told her remembering the display hed seen behind glass at the smithsonian where are you from hornblower cal switched his attention to libbys father philadelphia your work must involve a lot of traveling cal didnt bother to suppress the grin more than you can imagine do you have a family my parents and my younger brother are still back back east despite himself william thawed a bit there had been something in cals eyes in his voice when hed spoken of his family enough libby decided was enough she pushed her bowl aside picked up her tea with both hands then leaned back her eyes on her father if you have an application form handy im sure cal could fill it out then youd have his date of birth and social security number as well a little snotty arent you will commented over a forkful of salad im snotty dont apologize will patted her hand we are what we are tell me cal whats your party affiliation dad just kidding with a lopsided grin he reached over to pull libby onto his lap she was born here you know yes she told me cal watched libby hook an arm around her fathers neck used to play naked right out that door while i was gardening despite herself libby laughed even as she closed a hand over her fathers throat monster can i ask him what he thinks of dylan she gave his head a shake no bob dylan or dylan thomas cal asked earning a narrowed look from william and one of surprise from libby before she remembered his affection for poetry either will decided dylan thomas was brilliant but depressing id rather read bob dylan read the lyrics dad now that thats settled why dont you tell me what youre doing here instead of driving your board of directors crazy i wanted to see my little girl she kissed him just above the beard because she knew it was partially true i saw you when i got back from the south pacific try again and i wanted caro to have the fresh air he sent his wife a smug look over his daughters shoulder we both figured the air around here worked well the first two times so wed try it again what are you talking about im talking about this place being good for your mothers condition condition youre sick libby was up and grabbing her mothers hands whats wrong will you never could come to the point what hes trying to say is im pregnant pregnant libby felt her knees go weak but how and you call yourself a scientist cal murmured and earned his first laugh from will but too dazed to be annoyed by the comment she looked back and forth between her parents they were young hardly more than forty and vital she knew there was nothing unusual about couples in their forties having babies but they were her parents youre going to have a baby i dont know what to say try congratulations will suggested no yes i mean i need to sit down she did on the floor between their chairs she discovered sitting wasnt enough and took three long breaths how do you feel caroline asked dazed she looked up studying her mothers face how do you feel eighteen though i have talked will out of delivering this one himself here at the cabin the way he did with you and sunny the womans lost her sixties values will muttered though he had been tremendously relieved when caroline had insisted on an obstetrician and a hospital so what do you think libby she rose to her knees so that she could hug each of them i think we should celebrate im one step ahead of you rising william went to the refrigerator then held a bottle aloft sparkling apple juice the cork popped with a sound as festive as champagne they toasted each other the baby the absent sunny the past and the future cal joined them drawn in by their pleasure in each other here was one more thing that time hadnt changed he thought the giddy delight a coming baby brought to people who wanted it hed never thought very seriously about starting a family hed known that when the time and the woman were right the rest would fall into place now he caught himself imagining what it would be like if he and libby were toasting their own expected child dangerous thoughts impossible thoughts he had only a matter of days left with herhours reallyand families required a lifetime even as he yearned for one life watching libbys parents together reminded him of his own family were they watching the sky wondering where he was how he was if only he could let them know he was safe cal hmm what he blinked and saw libby staring at him im sorry i was just saying we should build a fire sure one of my favorite spots here is in front of the fire caroline hooked her arm through williams im so glad we stopped by for the night for the night libby repeated were on our way to carmel caroline decided on the spot and gave williams hand a vicious squeeze before he could speak i craved a ride along the coast what she craved was a cheeseburger under her alfalfa sprouts william said thats when i knew she was pregnant and being pregnant entitles me to an afternoon nap caroline sent her husband a slow smile why dont you tuck me in i could use a nap myself with his arm around her shoulders they started out carmel last i heard we were spending a week here since when are we going to carmel since fours a crowd dummy that may be but i havent decided if i like the idea of libby being with him she likes it caroline walked into the bedroom and was flooded with memories the nights theyd shared and the mornings theyd made love in that bed argued politics planned ways to save the world from itself shed laughed there cried there and given birth there she sat on the edge and let her hands run over the spread she could almost feel the murmur of memories will his hands tucked in the back pocket of his jeans paced to the window she smiled at his back remembering how he had been at eighteen even thinner she recalled even more idealistic and just as wonderful they had always loved this place being children there having children there even when things had changed they had never lost that cocksure certainty of who and what they were she understood him heard his thoughts as if they were in her own head a cargo pilot will muttered and what the hell kind of name is hornblower theres something about him caro i dont know what but something im not sure rings true dont you trust liberty of course i do he looked back insulted its him i dont trust ah the echo of time she cupped a hand to her ear the exact words my father once spoke when referring to you he was a poor judge of character will muttered and turned back to the window most men are when it comes to the choices their daughters make i remember you telling my father that i knew my own mind lets see was that the first or second time he threw you out of the house both he had to grin he said youd be back in six months and that id end up selling daisies on a street corner fooled him didnt we that was nearly twentyfive years ago dont rub it in he fingered his beard doesnt it bother you that theyre heretogether you mean that theyre lovers yes he dug his hands in his pockets again shes our baby i remember you telling me once that making love was the most natural expression of trust and affection between two people that hangups about sex needed to be eradicated if the world was ever to experience true peace and goodwill i did not you certainly did we were crammed into the back seat of your vw steaming up the windows at the time he had to grin it must have worked it did mostly because id already decided you were the one i wanted you were the first man id ever loved will so i knew it was right she held out a hand and waited until hed clasped it that man downstairs is the first libbys ever loved she knows whats right he started to object but she tightened her grip we raised them to follow their hearts did we make a mistake no he laid a palm on the gentle slope of her belly well do the same for this one he has kind eyes she said softly when he looks at her his hearts in them you always were overly romantic thats how i caught you and kept me she murmured against his lips right he toyed with the hem of her sweater knowing how easy it would be to slip it over her head and exactly what he would find beneath you dont really want to sleep do you with a laugh she overbalanced so that they both tumbled onto the bed its so strange libby dropped down on the grass beside the stream thinking that my parents are going to have another child they looked happy didnt they very cal settled beside her except when your father was scowling at me she laughed a little as she rested her head on his shoulder sorry hes really a very friendly man most of the time ill take your word for it he plucked at a blade of grass it hardly mattered if he had her fathers approval or not soon cal would be out of his life and out of libbys she loved it here beside the water which ran fresh and cold over the rocks the grass was long and soft dotted along the bank with small blue flowers there would be foxglove in the summer growing as tall as a man and bending over the stream with its purple or white bells there would be lilies and columbine at dusk deer would come to drink and sometimes a lumbering bear would come fishing she didnt want to think of summer but of now when the air was as fresh as the water with a clear clean taste to it chipmunks raced in the forest beyond she and sunny had handfed the friendlier ones wherever she went to remote islands to desert outposts she would remember those early years of her life and be grateful for them thats going to be a very lucky baby she murmured then she smiled as a thought struck her to think after all these years i might have a brother he thought of his own jacob with his flaring temper and his sharp impatient mind i always wanted a sister theres something to be said for them too but they always seem to be prettier than you are he rolled her onto the grass i wish i could meet your sunbeam ow he rubbed a hand over his side where shed pinched him concentrate on me thats all i seem to do he braced his arm beside her head as he studied her face i have to go back to the ship for a little while she tried valiantly to keep the sorrow out of her eyes it had been easy to pretend there was no ship and no tomorrow i didnt have a chance to ask you how it was going quickly he thought too quickly ill know more when i check the computer can you make an excuse to your parents if im not back when they get up ill tell them youre off meditating my father will love it okay then tonight he lowered his head for a gentle kiss ill concentrate on you concentratings all youll do she linked her arms around his neck youre sleeping on the couch i am definitely in that case he slid down to her later during the night when the fire was burning low and the house was quiet cal sat alone fully dressed he knew how to get back at least he knew how he had gotten where and when he was and how to reverse the process with a few more repairs basically unnecessary ones he would be ready to go technically he would be ready but emotionally nothing had ever torn him quite so neatly in two if she asked him to stay god he was afraid if she did it would swing the balance of the tugofwar he was waging but she wouldnt ask him to stay he couldnt ask her to go perhaps when he made it back and offered the data to the world of science a new less dangerous way would be created to conquer time perhaps he could come back turning his head he looked into the fire more fantasies libby was facing the facts and so would he he thought he heard her on the stairs but when he looked it was william trouble sleeping he asked cal some you i always loved this place at night because he loved his daughter as well he was determined to make an effort to be civil if not exactly friendly the quiet the dark he stooped to add another log to the fire sparks flew then winked out i never pictured myself living anywhere else i never imagined living in a place like this or realized how hard it would be to leave a long way from philadelphia a very long way he recognized gloom when he heard it william had courted it early in his youth mistaking it for romance unbending a little he dug out the brandy and two snifters want a drink yeah thanks william settled in the winged chair and stretched out his long legs i used to sit here at night and ponder the meaning of life did you ever figure it out sometimes i did sometimes i didnt it had been simpler somehow when his main concerns had been world peace and social reform now god help him he was nearing middle agethat area that had always seemed so gray and distant it reminded him that he had once been a young man much younger than the one facing him now with his head in the clouds and his mind on a woman the times they are achanging he thought wryly and swirled his brandy are you in love with libby i was just asking myself that same question william sipped his brandy he preferred the traces of doubt and frustration he heard to a glib response hed always been glib no wonder carolines father had detested him come up with an answer not a comfortable one nodding william lifted his glass before i met caro i was planning to join the peace corps or a tibetan monastery she was fresh out of high school her father wanted to shoot me cal grinned he was beginning to enjoy the brandy i had a minute to be grateful you didnt have a weapon this afternoon being a pacifist by nature i only gave it a passing thought william assured him caros father thrived on the idea i cant wait to tell him i got her pregnant again relaxed now he savored the idea libbys hoping for a brother did she say that now he grinned lingering over the idea of a son she was my first every childs a miracle but the first i guess you never get over it she is a miracle she changed my life williams look sharpened hornblower might not realize he was in love he thought but there was little doubt about it caro likes you he commented she has a way of seeing into the heart of people i only want to say that libby isnt as sturdy as she seems be careful with her he rose then afraid he might start to pontificate get some sleep he advised caros bound to be up at dawn fixing wholewheat pancakes or yogurtandkiwi surprise he winced a little he was a man who would always yearn in his heart for bacon and eggs you won points by the way you dug into that tofu amandine casserole it was great no wonder she likes you he paused at the foot of the steps you know i have a sweater just like that really cal couldnt suppress the grin small world chapter i knew youd be up early libby slipped out the back door to join her mother not so early caroline sighed annoyed with herself for missing the sunrise ive found myself getting a slower start the last couple of months morning sickness no smiling caroline hooked an arm around libbys waist it seems all three of my children decided to spare me that did i ever tell you i appreciated it no well i do she gave libbys cheek a quick kiss and noted the faint shadows under her eyes biding her time she nodded toward the trees like to walk yes i would they started off at a meandering pace the bells caroline wore at her wrists and ears jingling cheerfully so much was the same libby thought the trees the sky the quiet cabin behind them and so much had changed she leaned her head against her mothers shoulder for a moment do you remember when we used to walk like this you and sunny and i i remember walking with you caroline laughed as the branches arched overhead in a cool green tunnel sunny never walked anywhere the moment she could stand she was off at a dash you and i would poke along just as were doing now and what would this child be like caroline wondered feeling a fresh thrill of anticipation then wed pick some flowers or berries so that dad would think wed been doing something productive it seems both our men are sleeping in today when libby didnt respond caroline waited until the silence between them was comfortable again the forest was alive with sounds the rustling of small game in the brush the call of birds in flight i like your friend libby im glad you do i wanted you to she bent to pick up a twig then broke small pieces off as she walked it was a nervous gesture caroline knew very well sunny would let any and all feeling burst straight out but libby her quiet sensible libby would hold them in its more important that you do i do very much suddenly aware of what she was doing libby tossed the rest of the twig aside hes kind and funny and strong this time ive had here with him its been wonderful for me i never really thought id find someone who would make me feel the way caleb makes me feel but you dont smile when you say that caroline reached up to touch her daughters face why this time we have its only temporary i dont understand why temporary if youre in love with him i am libby murmured very much in love with him then libby drew a long breath it was impossible to explain she thought he has to go back to his family to philadelphia caroline prompted her at a loss yes there was a smile now faint and wistful to philadelphia i dont see why that should make a difference she began then stopped and put a hand on libbys arm oh baby is he married no she might have laughed then but she noted the deep and genuine concern in her mothers eyes no its nothing like that caleb could never be dishonest its very hard to explain but i can tell you that right from the start we both knew that cal would have to go back where he belonged and i i would have to stay a few thousand miles shouldnt matter if two people want to be together sometimes distance is well longer than it looks dont worry leaning over she kissed carolines cheek i can honestly say that i wouldnt trade the time ive had with cal for anything there was a poster in the cabin when i was little do you remember it said something about if you had something let it go if it didnt come back to you it was never yours i never liked that poster caroline muttered this time libby did laugh lets pick some flowers libby watched them go a few hours later her father behind the wheel of the rumbling pickup her mothers earrings dancing as she leaned out of the window to wave until she was out of sight i like your parents libby turned to cal linking her hands around his neck they liked you too he leaned down for a brief kiss your mother maybe my father too if i had a year or two to win him over he might almost like me he wasnt scowling at you today no he rubbed his cheek against hers as he considered it was down to a sneer what are you going to tell them about what about why im not here with you ill tell them that you went home because she made the effort her answer sounded casual and easy so easy that he nearly swore just like that her voice was a little brittle now she knew with a tone that could easily be taken as callous they wont pry if i dont want them to it will be simpler for everyone if i tell them the truth which is was he determined to make it difficult she moved her shoulders restlessly things didnt work out and you went on with your life i went on with mine yeah i guess thats best no mess no regrets irritable she thrust her fists in her pockets you have a better idea no yours is just dandy he pulled away annoyed with himself annoyed with her ive got to get to the ship i know i thought id run into town and pick up the camera and some other things if i get back early enough ill ride out check on your progress fine he was damned if it was going to be so easy for her when he was being torn in two before he could regret it he yanked her against him and crushed his mouth down on hers hot edgy tasting of anger and frustration the kiss spun out libby hung on to maintain her physical as well as her emotional balance she couldnt wouldnt give him what he seemed to need total capitulation hed never asked for that before nor had she known she would so firmly withhold it trapped she couldnt soothe couldnt demand as he devoured in one long possessive stroke his hands ran up her body then down again with no lessening of force she might have protested there was something here that frightened her that left her weaknot meltingly but with an openended vulnerability that made her struggle to find her feet again there was no gentleness here nor was there the sense of urgent desire he had once shown her instead the kiss was like a punishment and a brutally effective one caleb she began hitching in a shallow breath when he released her that should give you something to think about he said then turned abruptly to stalk away stunned she stared after him one unsteady hand reached up to press against lips still tender from his assault when her breathing steadied her temper took hold shed think about it all right she stormed inside slamming the door behind her moments later she stormed out again to climb into the land rover it was all going perfectly and he was mad as hell technically he could take off within twentyfour hours the major repairs were done the calculations as finely tuned as he and the computer could make them in the time allotted his ship was ready he wasnt that was what it came down to she was certainly ready to see him off cal thought as he fused a tear in the inner shell with his spot laser damned anxious if it came to that she was probably in town right now buying a camera so that she could take a few souvenir pictures before she waved goodbye he shut off the laser and checked the seam why did she have to be so practical about it because she was practical he reminded himself as he yanked off his protective goggles that was one of the things he most admired about her she was practical warm intelligent shy he could still see the way her eyes had looked the first time hed told her he wanted her theyd gone from big and tawny to big and confused and when hed touched her shed gotten hot and trembly she was soft so incredibly soft cursing himself he stowed the laser in the tool compartment then tossed the goggles in beside them before he slammed the door he couldnt imagine a man in the universe being able to resist those eyes or that skin or that wide sexy mouth that was part of the problem he admitted as he prowled the ship men wouldnt maybe she hadnt paid attention before maybe shed been too wrapped up in her books and her work and her theories on the societal tendencies of man as a species one day she was going to slip those glasses off her nose and look aroundand realize that there were men fleshandblood men looking back at her men who could make promises he thought in disgust even if they didnt mean to keep them perhaps she hadnt realized how much passion how much heat how much power she held but hed opened those doors for her opened hellhed smashed them once he was gone other men would tend the fire hed lit the thought made him insane cal admitted it as he dragged his hands through his hair stark raving crazy he belonged in one of those padded cells libby had spoken of he couldnt stand itthe thought of someone else touching her kissing her undressing her with an oath he wheeled into his cabin and began to put it in order that is he tossed things around he was being selfish and unfair and he didnt care it was true that he would have to accept the fact that libby would go on with her life and that her life would include a loveror lovers he thought grinding his teeth a husband perhaps and children he had to accept that but he was damned if he had to like it after kicking a shoe into a corner he dug his hands into his pockets and stared at the picture of his family his parents he mused going over each feature of their faces as he had never bothered to before it had been three no four months since hed seen them if you didnt count the centuries they were attractive stronglooking people despite his fathers slightly hangdog expression they had always seemed so content to him so sure of their lives and what they wanted he liked to picture them at home with his mother laboring over some thick technical book and his father whistling between his teeth as he played with his flowers he had his mothers nose intrigued cal leaned down to peer closer strange hed never noticed that before apparently shed been satisfied with the one shed been born with and had passed it on to him and to jacob he realized as he studied his brothers image but to jacob shed passed along brilliance as well brilliance wasnt always a gift caleb thought with a grin it seemed to make jacob hotheaded questioning and impatient he remembered his mother saying that jt as his family called him was more fond of arguing than breathing cal decided hed probably inherited his fathers more even temperament except he didnt feel very eventempered at the moment with a sigh he sat on the bed youd like her he murmured to the images i wish you could meet her that was a first he thought hed never had the urge to bring any of his companions home for family approval it was probably the result of spending the day with libbys parents he was stalling rubbing his hands over his face cal admitted he was wasting his time with busywork and selfindulgent analysis he should already be gone but hed promised himself another day there was libbys time capsule to do that is if she was still speaking to him she was bound to be angry about the little number hed pulled on her before hed left that morning that was fine he decided as he stretched out hed rather have her angry than smilingly urging him on his way lazily he checked his watch she should be back in a couple hours right now he was going to have a nap to make up for the long frustrating and sleepless night hed spent on her couch switching on the sleep tape beside the bed he closed his eyes and tuned out idiot libby thought gripping the wheel tightly as she maneuvered the land rover along the winding switchback toward home conceited idiot she clarified hed better have an explanation when she saw him again no matter how she racked her brain she could come up with no reason why he had kissed her in that furious meanspirited way something to think about well she had thought about it libby reminded herself while she navigated the narrowing dirt road it still made her furious and it still didnt make any sense then again she had a twicemarried neighbor in portland who claimed men never made sense they always had to heras a species anyway libby thought grimly and on paper now for the first time she was involved in a oneonone with a fleshandblood member of the male genus and she was baffled libby bumped over rocks as she tried once again to solve the mystery of caleb hornblower perhaps it had had something to do with the visit by her parents but then hed been moody the morning before they had arrived moody but not angry she remembered and they had made slow quiet love by the stream during the afternoon hed seemed cheerful enough at dinner perhaps a little withdrawn but that was only natural it must be very difficult for him to be around people when he had to concentrate on not saying anything that might give him away she felt a tug of sympathy and stubbornly ignored it that was no reason for him to take his frustration out on her wasnt she trying to help him it was killing her inside but she was doing everything in her power to see that he got back to where he wanted to be she had her own life as well that fact soothed only a little as she barreled up a slope she should be working on her dissertation and making the preliminary plans for her next field study there was an offer of a lecture tour she had yet to fully consider instead she was running errandsbuying cameras and oatmeal cookies for the last time she decided huffily but then she realized that it would indeed be the last time she stopped the land rover when the trail narrowed to a footpath she hadnt really meant to come out to caleb during the entire trip shed told herself she would go back to the cabin and get to work yet here she was letting herself be pulled back at least there was something she could do for herself on impulse she grabbed the new polaroid from the shopping bag after unboxing it she skimmed over the directions then loaded it with the first of the packs of film shed bought as an afterthought she grabbed the bag of chunky oatmeal cookies from the top of the slope she studied the ship it lay huge and silent on the rocks and the downed trees like some strange sleeping animal deliberately she blocked out thoughts of the man inside and concentrated on the ship itself the sixteenwheeler of the future she decided carefully framing it the greyhound bus or power van all aboard for mars mercury and venus express trips to pluto and orion available with what was more a sigh than a snicker she took two pictures sitting on the edge of the slope she watched them develop fifty years ago she mused the idea of instant pictures had been science fiction she glanced back at the ship man worked fast very fast wanting a few more moments to herself she ripped open the bag of cookies and began to nibble of course shed never be able to show the picture that was already taking shape in her hand to anyone one was for the capsule but the other was for her personal files she wanted to believe it was the scientist who had taken it who would label and file it along with other pictures she would take and the hard copy of the report she was writing on this isolated experience but it had nothing to do with science and everything to do with the heart she didnt want to rely on her memory she slipped the pictures into her pocket swung the camera over her shoulder and started down when she reached the hatch she lifted her fist then started to laugh did one knock on the door of a spacecraft feeling foolish with the ship looming over her she rapped twice a chipmunk scurried over the ground scrambled onto the trunk of a fallen tree and stared at her i know its odd libby told him just remember to keep it under your hat she tossed half a cookie in his direction then turned back to knock again all right hornblower open up i feel like an idiot out here she tried knocking pounding shouting once she gave in to temper and slammed the hull with a good kick favoring her sore toes she stepped back furious with him shed nearly decided to turn back when it occurred to her he might not be able to hear her stepping closer she began to search for the device he had used to open the hatch it took her ten minutes when the hatch opened she stormed inside ready for a fight listen hornblower i he wasnt on the bridge frustrated libby dragged back her hair couldnt he even make himself available when she wanted to yell at him the shield was up she hadnt been able to see in from the outside but now she had a stunning panoramic view drawn she crossed over to the controls how would it feel she wondered as she sat in his chair to pilot something so huge so powerful she scanned the buttons and switches spread out before her was it any wonder he loved it even a woman who had always been firmly rooted to the ground could imagine the wild limitless freedom of traveling through space there would be planets balls of color and light the glimmer of distant stars the glow of orbiting moons she liked to think of him that way weaving through the stars the way he had woven through the trees with her on the cycle libby took a last scan of the controls then studied the computer a little ill at ease she glanced around the empty bridge before she leaned forward computer working she jolted then swallowed a nervous laugh there were two questions she wanted to ask but only one she truly wanted the answer to because she believed in facing facts libby inhaled exhaled then plunged computer what is the status on the calculations for the return journey to the twentythird century calculations complete probability index formulated risk factors trajectory thrust degree of orbit velocity and success factors locked in is report desired no so he was finished shed known it even when shed tried to tell herself she had a few more days with him he hadnt told her but she thought she understood why cal wouldnt want to hurt her and he would know would have to know how she felt no matter how hard she tried to treat their relationship as a single moment in time one based on passion and affection and mutual need he had seen through her he was trying to be kind she wanted to be glad for him she had to be glad for him she took a minute to adjust then asked what she had asked once before computer working who is caleb hornblower hornblower caleb captain isf retired born february to katrina hardesty hornblower and byram edward hornblower place of birth philadelphia pennsylvania graduate wilson freemont memorial academy attended princeton university withdrew after sixteen months without degree enlisted isf served six years seven months military record as follows with her lips pursed libby listened to the readout of cals military career there was citation after citationjust as there was reprimand after reprimand his record as a pilot was flawless his disciplinary record was an entirely different matter she couldnt help but smile she thought of her father and his ingrained distrust of the military system yes given a bit of time she thought he would have grown very fond of cal credit rating the computer continued stop libby heaved a sigh she wasnt interested in cals credit rating shed pried far enough into his personal life as it was any other answers she wanted would have to come from him and quickly rising she began to wander through the ship looking for him it was the music that tipped her off she heard it first distant and lovely with a vague curiosity something classical with a kind of swelling passion as she followed it she tried to identify the composer she found cal asleep in his cabin the music filled the room every corner of it yet it was soft soothing seductive she felt the tug the almost irresistible urge to slip into the bed beside him snuggling close until he woke and made slow sweet love to her she shook it off the music she decided somehow it was comforting and erotic at the same time exactly the way his kisses could be she wouldnt let it influence her or let herself forget that she was angry with him still she took a picture of him as he slept then slipped it almost guiltily into her pocket after leaning against the doorway she lifted her chin it was a deliberately defiant pose and she enjoyed it so this is how you work though shed pitched her voice above the music he went on sleeping she considered going over and giving his shoulder a shove then came up with a better idea she slipped two fingers of her left hand into her mouth inhaled then blew out a sharp shrill whistle just as sunny had taught her he came up in the bed like a rocket red alert he shouted before he saw her smirking at him from the doorway after leaning back against the cushioned headboard he ran a hand over his eyes hed been dreaming out in space whipping through the galaxy with the controls at his fingertips and worlds racing by hundreds of thousands of miles beneath him shed been there right beside him an arm wrapped around his waist all the fascination all the thrill of flying glowing on her face until something had gone wrong and the ship had shaken the gauges had blinked the bells had sounded hed heard her scream as theyd gone into a dive he hadnt known what to do quite suddenly his mind had gone blank he hadnt been able to save her here she was now while his heart was still sprinting from the dream looking cocky and ready to spar what the hell was that for he looked as though hed had a scare she certainly hoped so it seemed the most efficient way to wake you up i tell you hornblower you keep working like this youll wear yourself right out i was taking a break he wished hed taken a good long slug of potent electricblue antellis liquor i didnt sleep much last night too bad as sympathy went it left a lot to be desired still studying him she dug for a cookie that couch is lumpy ill make a note of it maybe thats why you woke up on the wrong side of it she took her time nipping off tiny bite after tiny bite it was an attempt to make him hungry and she succeeded though not in the way shed intended he could feel his muscles tightening each separate one i dont know what you mean its an expression ive heard it he knew he snapped the words out but he couldnt help it she flicked out her tongue to catch a crumb at the corner of her mouth he nearly groaned i didnt wake up on the wrong side of anything well i suppose it could be your nature to be surly and youve managed to repress it lately im not surly he all but growled it no arrogant then is that better her slow half smile was meant to annoy but it provoked a different emotion trying to ignore her and what was going on inside his own rebellious body he looked at his watch you took a long time in town my times my own hornblower his brows arched if she hadnt been so smug about her own control she might have noticed that the eyes beneath them had darkened you want to fight me her lips turned up again she was the very picture of innocence why caleb after meeting my parents you should know im a born pacifist i was rocked to sleep with folk songs he muttered an opinion a single twosyllable word that libby had always thought belonged to the slang of the twentieth century intrigued she cocked her head so thats still the response when someone doesnt have a clever or intelligent answer its such a comfort to know some traditions survive he threw his legs off the edge of the bed and his eyes on hers slowly unfolded himself he didnt step toward her not yet not until he could trust himself not to plant a good clean jab on her outthrust chin strange hed never noticed the stubborn set of it before or that idareyou look in her eyes the worst of it was the arrogance was every bit as arousing as the warmth youre pushing babe i figure its only fair to warn you that i dont come from a particularly peaceful family well carefully she chose another cookie that certainly puts the fear of god into me after rolling up the bag she tossed it at him so that his defensive catch crumbled half the contents i dont know whats gotten under your skin hornblower but ive got better things to do than worry about it you can stay here and sulk if you like but im going back to work she barely managed to turn around he grabbed her arms and had her pressed into the wall his fingers digging in later she would wonder why she had been surprised that he could move that quickly or that beneath the easy disposition there lurked a fierce rawedged temper you want to know whats wrong with me his eyes so close to hers were the color that edged lightning bolts is that what all this buttonpushings about libby i dont care whats wrong with you she kept her chin up though her mouth had gone dry libby knew that for her offering an apology would always be easier than sticking with a fight sometimes it wasnt pacifism but cowardice she straightened her spine and drew in a deep breath she was sticking i dont give a damn whats wrong with you now let me go you should he wrapped her hair around his hand to pull her head back slowly exposing her throat do you think that every emotion a man has toward a woman is gentle kind loving im not a fool she began to struggle and she was more annoyed than afraid when he didnt release her no youre not her eyes were on his fury matching fury he thought he felt something break inside him the last bolt that had caged the uncivilized maybe its time i taught you the rest i dont need you to teach me anything thats right therell be others to teach you wont there jealousy clawed deep drawing thick hot blood damn you and damn them every one of them think of this whenever anyone else touches you tomorrow ten years from tomorrow youll wish it was me ill see to it with his words still hanging in the air he pulled her to the bed chapter she fought him she refused to be taken in anger no matter how deep her love the bed sank beneath their combined weights molding to them like a cocoon the music drifted calm and beautiful his hands were rough as they dragged at the buttons of her shirt she didnt speak it never occurred to her to beg him to stop or to give in to the tears that would surely have snapped him back to his senses instead she struggled trying to roll away from his ruthlessly seeking hands she fought furiously bucking pushing against him waging a private war against the traitorous response of her body which would betray her heart she would hate him for this the knowledge nearly broke her if he succeeded in what he set out to do it would wash away other memories and leave this one this violent distorted one dominant unable to bear it she fought now for both of them he knew her too well every curve every dip every pulse on a wave of fury he locked her wrists in one hand and dragged her arms over her head his mouth savaged her neck while his free hand slid down unerringly to find one of those secret vulnerable places he heard her moan as the unwanted unavoidable pleasure tore into her her body tensed a wire ready to snap it arched a bow pulled taut he felt the burst of release as it shuddered through her heard her chokedoff cry he saw her lips quiver before she pressed them hard together regret burned through him he had no right no one did to take something beautiful and use it as a weapon hed wanted to hurt her for something beyond her control and he had no more he realized than he had hurt himself libby she only shook her head her eyes tightly closed wishing for words that werent there cal rolled over and stared at the ceiling i have no excuse there is no excuse for treating you that way she managed to swallow the tears it relieved her made it possible for her to steady her breathing and open her eyes maybe not but theres usually a reason id like to hear it he didnt answer for a long time they lay close and tense not quite touching there were dozens of reasons he could give herlack of sleep overwork the anxiety over the possible failure of his flight they would all be accurate to a point but they wouldnt be the truth libby he knew set great store by honesty i care for you he said slowly it isnt easy knowing i wont see you again i realize we both have our own lives he added before she could speak our own place maybe were both doing what has to be done but i dont like the idea that its easy for you it isnt he knew it was selfish but it relieved him to hear it reaching over he linked his hand with hers im jealous of what of the men youll meet the ones youll love the ones wholl love you but no dont say anything let me get it all out and over with it doesnt seem to matter that i know its wrong intellectually its a gut reaction libby and im used to going with them every time i imagine another man touching you the way ive touched you seeing you the way ive seen you i go a little crazy and thats why youve been angry with me she turned her head to study his profile over my imagined future affairs i guess youve got a right to make me sound like an idiot im not trying to he moved his shoulders in what might have been a shrug i can even see him hes about sixfour and built like one of those greek gods adonis she suggested smiling he gets my vote shut up but she noted that his lips curved slightly hes got blond hair streaked kind of windswept and this strong rockhard jaw with one of those clefts in it like kirk douglas he shot her a suspicious look you know a guy like this only by reputation because she sensed that the storm was over she kissed cals shoulder anyway hes got brains too which is another reason i really hate him hes a doctor not medical but philosophy he can discuss the traditional mating habits of obscure tribes with you for hours and he plays piano wow im impressed hes rich cal went on almost viciously a credit rating he takes you to paris and makes love to you in a room overlooking the seine then he gives you a diamond as big as a fist well well she gave it some thought can he quote poetry he even writes it oh my god she put a hand to her heart i dont suppose you could tell me where im going to meet him i want to be ready he rolled over just enough to look at her her eyes were bright but with amusement not tears youre getting a real charge out of this arent you yes she lifted a hand to his face i suppose it might make you feel better if i promised id join a convent okay he took her wrist to bring her palm against his mouth can i get it in writing ill think about it his eyes were clear again deep and clear he was cal now the man she could love and understand are we finished fighting looks like it im sorry libby ive been acting like a lupz im not sure what that means but youre probably right friends he bent down to brush her lips with his friends before he could draw back she cupped his head in her hand and held him against her for a longer deeper and much less friendly kiss cal hmm he traced her lips with his tongue memorizing their shape and texture did this guy have a name ouch torn between laughter and pain she jerked back you bit me damn right it was your fantasy she reminded him primly not mine and lets keep it that way but he was grinning as he ran his hand up the smooth skin where her shirt had parted i can give you others if youre willing to settle yes his palm rounded over her breast working magic oh yes if i took you to paris wed spend the first three days in that hotel suite and never get out of bed he continued to tease nipping here stroking there stopping just short of possession wed drink champagne bottle after bottle and eat small dishes with exotic names and tastes id know every inch of your body every pore of your skin wed stay in that big soft bed and go places no one else had ever been cal she trembled as he circled her breasts with slow openmouthed kisses then wed get dressed i can see you in something thin and white something that skims off your shoulders dips down your back something that makes every man who sees you want to murder me i dont even see them with a sigh she traced her hands down him lingering over every plane and angle i only see you the stars are out millions of them you can smell paris its rich water and flowers wed walk for miles so you could see all those incredible lights and wonderful ancient buildings wed stop and drink wine in a cafe at a table with an umbrella then wed go back and make love again for hours and hours his lips came back to hers drugging her we dont need paris for that no he braced himself over her bracketing her head between his hands her face was already glowing her eyes were half closed that soft smile was on her lips he wanted to remember this this one instant when there was nothing and no one but her oh god libby i need you it was all she needed to hear all she would ever ask to hear she reached up to enfold him there was urgency here she could taste it as his tongue plunged deep into her mouth demanding impatient his hands molded her body because his feelings mirrored her own her response was explosive her blood was molten throbbing as it flowed close under her skin the heat was unbearable delicious it grew only more intense as he stripped her a primitive sound hummed deep in her throat with a speed and fury that rocked him she was yanking off his shirt dragging his jeans over his hips desperate she rolled reversing their positions making a fast hot journey over him she heard his breath catch and the sound sent her excitement soaring to new heights power it was indeed the ultimate aphrodisiac she could make him tremble and ache and whisper her name shed never known that with such little effort she could make him helpless and he was beautiful the feel of him under her hands the taste of him that lingered on her tongue and strong there were ridges of muscles firm tight but they trembled under the delicate dance of her fingertips hed wanted to make her remember cal groaned under the weight of the sensations she was bringing to him it was he who would remember always the music that he had always loved the simple eloquence of it filled his head he knew it would remind him of her from now to forever he could feel the heat radiate from her as she moved her body up his searching finding his mouth her kiss was slow sultry something he could drown in then she was laughing evading his questing hands as she drove him toward madness again he couldnt bear it his heart was pounding against his ribs echoed by dozens of frantic pulses throughout his body the rhythm seemed to call out her name again and again until he was filled with it libby the word was hoarse as raw as his need for gods sake then she closed over him like hot velvet the sound she made was hardly more than a moan but it vibrated with triumph lost in her own pleasure she set a wild pace feeling her strength bound high then higher as her need swelled a freefall through space a springboard through time hed experienced both but they were nothing compared with this blindly he reached for her and his hands slid down her slick skin just as their palms met they leaped over the top together perfection lazily content libby cuddled closer resting her cheek just over cals heart all but purring as he stroked her hair soothed every part of her was content body mind heart she wondered how long it was possible for two people to lie curled in bed without food or water forever she smiled to herself she could almost believe it my parents have a cat she murmured a fat yellow cat named marigold he doesnt have an ounce of ambition a male cat named marigold still smiling she ran a hand down his arm you met my parents right anyway he lies on the windowsill every afternoon all afternoon right this minute i know exactly how he feels she stretched only a little because even that seemed to require too much effort i like your bed hornblower ive grown fond of it myself they were silent for a while drifting that music it was playing in her head now sweet almost unbearably romantic i keep thinking i should recognize it salvadore simeon is he a new composer depends on your point of view late twentyfirst century oh her bubble burst sometimes forever was a very short time holding on one last moment she turned her head to press her lips to his chest his heart beat there strong and steady poetry classical music and aircycles an interesting combination is it yes very i also know youre hooked on soaps and game shows thats research he grinned as she pushed herself to a sitting position beside him i want to be able to speak intelligently on all popular forms of twentiethcentury entertainment he paused a moment thinking do you suppose they kept archives i really want to know if blake and eva work things out in spite of dorians conniving then theres the problem of whos framing justin for the murder of the evil and despicable carlton slade i vote for the sweetfaced but hardhearted vanessa hooked she said again and drew her knees up to her chest to grin at him dont you have soaps sure never took the time to watch i always figured they were for homeworkers homeworkers she repeated it liking the precise genderless phrase i havent asked you all those questions libby settled her chin on her knees when we get back we should finish writing up everything thats happened to you he flicked a finger down her arm everything everything that applies while were doing that and putting the capsule together you can fill me in on the future all right he climbed out of bed maybe it would be best if they stayed busy for the next few hours he started to reach for his pants then noticed the polaroid which had fallen to the floor whats this a camera selfdeveloping you can have a picture in about ten seconds is that so amused he turned it over in his hands hed been given one for his tenth birthday that could do precisely the same thingand it had fitted into the palm of his hand it had also kept the time reported the temperature and played his favorite music youve got that superior smirk on your face again hornblower sorry what do you do push this button thats rightno but she was too late hed already framed her and shot men have been murdered for less i thought you wanted pictures he said reasonably as he held the developing image in his hand im not dressed yeah he smiled its not bad he decided onedimensional but it gets the point across a very sexy point across snatching at the sheet she scrambled to the foot of the bed and made a grab you want to see he held the print tantalizingly out of reach but turned it so that libby saw herself her arms hooked around her bare legs her hair tousled her eyes heavy god i love it when you blush libby im not blushing she told herself she wasnt laughing either as she tugged on her clothes cal set the camera aside and tugged them off her again when they left the ship the shadows were long after a brief discussion they decided to strap cals cycle to the back of the land rover and drive back together its a good idea libby allowed if we had some rope what for turning a knob under the seat of the cycle cal pulled out two thick hooked straps libby shrugged well i suppose if you want to do it the easy way she bent over the back wheel planted her feet and braced herself what are you doing im going to help you lift it she took a firm grip and blew the hair out of her eyes well come on cal tucked his tongue into his cheek okay but dont strain yourself do you have any idea how much equipment we lug around on digs he smiled at her no plenty on three one two three she let out an astonished breath as they lifted the cycle shoulderhigh it couldnt have weighed more than thirty pounds youre a riot hornblower thanks he secured the cycle quickly you going to let me drive this time when she dug the keys out of her pocket and jiggled them he went into his pitch come on libby theres no one around be that as it may you never showed me a drivers license if were talking technicalities i dont think it would apply libby if i can pilot that he jerked his thumb in the direction of the ship i sure as hell can drive this i want to see what its like she tossed him the keys just remember this vehicle stays on the ground got it as pleased as a kid with a new toy he settled behind the wheel it works with gears right i believe so fascinating this pedal here the clutch she said and wondered if shed just taken her life in her hands the clutch right thats what disengages the system so that you can change gears higher gears for higher speeds thats the idea isnt it the other pedal the one beside it thats the brake pay attention to the brake hornblower pay very close attention dont worry about a thing he sent her a cocky grin then turned the key see they went in reverse for two fast feet before they came to a jarring stop just a minute i think ive got it now youve got to put it in offroad off what though her palms were slightly damp she showed him take it easy will you and try to go forward no problem the land rover bucked the first few feet causing libby to grip the dash with both hands and pray cal was having the time of his life and he was a little disappointed when the ride smoothed out nothing to it he sent her a cocky grin just watch where youre going oh god she tossed her hands in front of her face so that she wouldnt see the tree they were about to ram are you always a nervous passenger he asked conversationally as he maneuvered around the tree i could grow to hate you im sure of it loosen up babe lets take a little detour cal we should run for the gusto he finished isnt that the phrase i think its go for the gusto but this isnt a beer commercial she bit her lip and clung to her safety belt anyway you can keep it i think id rather live a long dull life he plunged down a rocky slope driving as if hed been born behind the wheel this is the next best thing to flying he shot her a look well maybe not the next best but its close i think several of my vital organs have jarred loose cal youre going to go right through that the water swooshed up two glittering curtains on either side of the land rover libby was drenched when he shot up the opposite bank stream she muttered dragging her soaked hair out of her eyes as wet as she was he gave a delighted whoop and swung around to go through the stream again she heard her own laughter as the water slapped over her a second time youre crazy they left the ground briefly then jolted down with a thud but youre not dull you know with a few modifications this would go over big at home i cant figure out why they dont make them anymore if i came up with a prototype i could send my credit rating through the ozone youre not taking it with you i still have fourteen payments to make just a thought he could have driven for hours but the air was chill and she was beginning to shiver cal circled back do you know where we are sure about twenty degrees northeast of the ship he tugged on her wet hair i told you i could navigate tell you what when we get back well take a hot shower then we can build a fire and have some of that brandy then we can he swore and hit the brakes hard a group of four in hiking gear was a few feet ahead damn libby muttered we hardly ever get anyone this close in so early in the season it took only a glance for her to determine that the price tags had hardly been removed from the packs and boots if they hike much farther in that direction theyll be on top of the ship libby swallowed a bubble of panic and smiled as the group approached hello well hi there the man big solid and fortyish leaned on the land rover youre the first people weve seen since morning we dont get many hikers up this way thats why we picked it right susie he patted a pretty exhaustedlooking woman on the shoulder her only answer was a very weary nod rankin jim rankin he took cals hand and pumped it my wife susie and our boys scott and joe nice meeting you cal hornblower libby stone out fourwheeling it huh noting cals blank look libby said yes we were about to head in backpackings for us jim grinned broadly it took less than ten seconds to see that only jim was enthusiastic about tackling the mountains on foot that might be an advantage how far have you come started off from big vista nice little campground but too crowded i wanted to show the wife and boys nature in the rough libby judged the boys to be about thirteen and fifteen and both looked as if they were on the edge of whining calculating the distance to the big vista campground she could hardly blame them thats quite a hike were tough right boys both sent him miserable looks you werent planning to go up this path libby asked gesturing matter of fact we were thought wed try for the ridge before nightfall susie groaned and bent over to massage an aching calf muscle you wont be able to reach it this way up aheads a logging and reforesting area did you see the break in the trees yeah i did he fiddled with the pedometer at his waist wondered about it harvesting she said without a blink hiking and camping are offlimits theres a fivehundreddollar fine she added for good measure well i sure do appreciate you letting us know dad cant we go to a hotel one of the boys asked one with a pool the other chimed in and a video arcade and a bed his wife murmured a real bed jim offered cal and libby a wink family gets a little cranky this time of day wait till you see that sun come up tomorrow gang itll all be worth it theres an easy trail to the west libby rose out of her seat to rest her hip on the side of the land rover do you see it yeah jim didnt like adjusting his itinerary but the five hundred had done the trick she was glad she could give them one with a gradual incline another oh threefour miles and theres a clearing makes a good campsite the views fabulous you shouldnt have any trouble making it before sundown we could give you a lift cal had noted the tired sulky look on the younger boys face the moment the offer was out it lifted into an engaging grin oh no no thanks all the same jim beamed that would be cheating wouldnt it maybe susie shifted her pack on her aching back but it might just save your life she nudged her husband aside and leaned toward cal mr hornblower if you drive us to that campsite you can name your price now susie shut up jim she grabbed a hunk of cals damp shirt please ive got four hundred and fiftyeight dollars worth of gear on my back its yours with a hearty laugh jim put a hand on his wifes arm now susie we agreed all bets are off her voice rose shrilly in an obvious effort to control it she drew a deep breath im dying here jim i think the boys might be traumatized for life you dont want to be responsible for that do you because she wasnt entirely sure of his answer she jerked away to tuck each boy under her arms you hike it she said but ive got blisters and i dont think ill ever regain the feeling in my left leg suze if id known you felt this way fine she wasnt willing to give him time to finish a single sentence now you do come on guys they crammed into the back of the land rover after a moment jim settled sadly in with them his youngest on his lap its ah beautiful country libby began as she directed cal along the trail youll probably appreciate it more after youve rested and eaten and a great deal more than that she was sure when susie discovered they had circled a couple of miles closer to big vista its certainly full of trees susie sighed at the luxury of moving without effort because she knew jim was sulking she patted his knee are you from around here originally confident that cal would find the way now she shifted to face their passengers cals from philadelphia really susie debated flexing her foot then decided not to risk it so are we is this your first time out here mr hornblower yes i guess you could say its my first time here ours too we wanted to show our sons a part of the country that was still unspoiled and we have she gave her husbands knee another squeeze resilient jim swung an arm over the back of the seat this is one trip they wont forget the boys exchanged looks and rolled their eyes but wisely kept silent there was still a chance for that hotel so youre from philadelphia what do you think of the phillies chances this year cautious cal tried to be noncommittal im always hopeful thats the ticket jim slapped cal on the shoulder if they tighten up the infield and beef up the pitching staff they might have a shot baseball cal realized with a grin at least that was something he could relate to its hard to say about this season but i figure well take our share of pennants in the next couple hundred years jim gave a bark of laughter thats taking the long view when they reached the clearing their passengers were all in a more cheerful state of mind the boys leaped out to chase after a rabbit susie stepped out more slowly still favoring her legs it is beautiful she looked out over the layers of mountains where the sun was hanging low i cant thank you enough both of you she glanced over to where her husband was already yelling at the boys to get busy and gather some firewood you saved my husbands life he looked in pretty good shape actually cal commented no i was going to kill him in his sleep she smiled as she eased the pack from her back now i wont have to at least for a couple of days jovial jim walked back to give his wife a hug she winced as he squeezed tender muscles i tell you suze a man can really breathe up here for the time being susie murmured not like philadelphia bless it why dont you two stay for supper nothing like eating under the sky youre very welcome to susie added on tonights menu are the everpopular beans with the addition of hot dogs if the cold pack worked and for dessert some delicious dehydrated apricots sounds great and part of him was tempted to stay just to sit and listen he thought the rankin family as entertaining as any daytime drama but weve got to get back libby offered her hand to susie and added a sympathetic pat if you follow the trail to the right itll take you back to big vista its a long hike but a pretty one and one that would take them in the opposite direction from the ship cant thank you enough jim dug into his backpack and pulled out a business card the gesture had libby smothering a chuckle you could take a boy out of the smog but give me a ring when you get back hornblower im sales manager at bison motors cut you and the little woman a good deal new or used ill keep it in mind they climbed back into the land rover offered a wave then left the rankins behind new or used what cal asked libby chapter cal thought quite a bit about the rankins he had asked libby if they were an average american family her response had been amused if there was such a phenomenon shed told him they probably fit it they interested him perhaps because he saw several parallels between them and his own family his father though no one would ever have confused him with big beaming jim rankin had always had a love of nature unspoiled land and family trips like the other boys cal and jacob had spent a good deal of time sulking whining and rolling their eyes and when the chips were down and the limit was reached it had always been cals mother who had laid down the law families it seemed were consistent over time it was a comforting thought they had had their fire and brandy when they had returned to the cabin then because libby was always one to organize they had gone up to her machine to finish the report they would need three copies the first for the capsule the second for the shipand caland the third for libby hed had to admire her style when hed read over what shed done there was no doubt in his mind that the scientists of his time would find libbys report both concise and fascinating the rest was largely technical and though he knew she couldnt understand the calculations he was feeding her she typed them out theyd spent hours over it refining perfecting taking long periods when she would question him on the social the political the cultural climate of his time she made him think about things he had taken for granted about others he had casually ignored yes there was still poverty but shelters and programs provided the very poor with a roof and a meal there was still conflict but allout war had been avoided for more than years politics were still argued over babies were still cuddled people complained that the skyways were too crowded as far as cal remembered there had been four or it might have been five women who had held the office of president the more questions he answered the more she thought of they fell asleep tangled together in bed in the middle of one of his answers they finished the time capsule late the next morning filling the airtight steel box libby had bought in town with what seemed most pertinent one copy of the report was wrapped in plastic before they set it inside libby added one of her mothers woven mats and a clay bowl her father had made when shed been a baby they added a newspaper a popular weekly magazine and at cals insistence a wooden spoon from the kitchen drawer she added one of the two pictures shed taken of his ship we need more libby muttered i wanted this he held up a tube of toothpaste and i was hoping for some of your underwear yes to the first no to the second its for science he reminded her not a chance we need a tool were always very pleased when we find a tool on a dig she rummaged through a drawer and came up with a screwdriver a small ball peen hammer and a pipe wrench take your pick he took the wrench how about a book terrific she dashed into the living room and began combing the shelves i want popular fiction something written in this era ah stephen king ive read him terrifying horror transcends time as well she brought it into the kitchen and placed it in the box if they do any tests theyll be able to date all of this material it will back up your story come on outside well take some pictures because he got to the camera before her cal claimed his right to take the first shots he snapped the cabin libby and the cabin libby beside the land rover in the land rover libby laughing at him and yelling at him do you know how much film youve used blowing out a breath she ripped open another pack this stuff averages a dollar a shot anthropologys a fascinating field but the pays lousy sorry he moved to the front of the cabin when she waved with the back of her hand i never thought to ask whats your credit rating i have no idea she took a shot of him standing thumbs hooked in the pockets of his borrowed jeans we dont do things that way now at least i think credit rating means something else now its a matter of what youre worth or what you make annual salary and that sort of thing she was enough her parents child that she rarely gave it much thought why dont you unstrap your cycle and sit on it in front of the cabin a nowandthen sort of thing he obliged libby i dont have any way to pay you back in your currency for all of this dont be silly it was only a joke theres a great deal more i cant pay you back for theres nothing to pay back she lowered the camera and weighed each word carefully dont think of it as an obligation please and dont look at me like that im not ready to be serious we dont have much time left i know she hadnt understood everything hed dictated to her the night before but she knew he would be gone before the sun rose the next day lets not spoil what we have she looked away to give herself a moment to regain her balance its a shame this model doesnt have a timer it would be nice to get a couple of pictures with both of us in them hold on he walked around the side of the building returning a few moments later with a garden hoe sit on the steps he told her then proceeded to strap the camera to the seat of his cycle he leaned over checking and adjusting until he had libby in frame got it pleased with himself he jogged over to sit beside her he wrapped an arm around her shoulders smile she already was he used the staff of the hoe to press the button grinning when he heard the shutter click the print slid out very inventive hornblower dont move he retrieved the first print settled back beside her and pressed again one for you one for the box he set both prints aside and one for me he tipped her face up to his with his finger and kissed her you forgot to take the picture she murmured many moments later oh yeah his lips curved against hers as he poked with the hoe she took the first print in her hand and studied it they looked happy she thought happy ordinary people it meant a great deal to her now and would mean even more to her later she continued to hold it as she rose wed better go bury the capsule they strapped it on the back of the cycle so that libby was sandwiched between it and cals back when they reached the stream he slipped off and frowned at the shovel she handed him this tool is very primitive are you sure theres no easier way not in this century hornblower she pointed down dig you can have the first turn thats all right she sat on the ground and tucked up her legs i wouldnt want to deprive you she watched him put his back into it what would he use she wondered to dig it up again how would he feel when he opened it he would be thinking of her she knew that and he would miss her she hoped he would sit in this same spot and read the letter she had tucked into the box shed made certain he hadnt seen her put it in it was only a page but shed put her heart on it she cupped her chin in her hand listened to the waters music and remembered every word cal when you read this youll be home i want you to know how happy i am for you i cant claim to understand what it was like for you to find yourself here away from everything familiar separated from your family and friends but i wanted you to know that in my heart i wanted you to be where you belonged i dont know if i can make you understand what the time ive had with you has meant to me i love you so much caleb it overwhelms me there wont be a day that goes by that i wont think of you but i wont be unhappy please dont think of me or remember me that way what you gave to me in these few days is more than i ever imagined all i ever needed whenever i look at the sky ill picture you ill still study the past to try to understand why man is what he is now having known you ill always have hope for what he can become be happy i want to know you are dont forget me i wanted to put a sprig of rosemary in the capsule but i was afraid it would only turn to dust find some and think of me pray love remember libby libby cal leaned against the shovel watching her yes where were you oh not very far away glancing down she lifted a brow well i knew a big strong man like you could dig a hole i think i have a blister aw she rose to kiss the tender skin between his thumb and forefinger lets put it in then you can watch while i cover it up good idea the moment the box was in he handed her the shovel libby eyed it then the pile of dirt that had to be replaced four women presidents he stretched his tired back might have been five with a nod libby began to shovel cal hmm he was giving serious consideration to a nice lazy nap the questions i asked before those were the big ones the sweeping ones i wondered if i could ask you something more personal probably would you tell me about your family what would you like to know who they are what theyre like she tossed dirt into the hole in a steady rhythm that cal enjoyed id like to imagine i knew them a little my fathers a research and development technician lab work all indoors and confining hes very dedicated dependable at home he likes to garden plants flowers from seed and works them all by hand as he drew in the scent of the freshly turned earth that libby worked cal could almost see his father cultivating his garden sometimes he paints really really bad landscapes and still lifes he even knows theyre bad but he claims art doesnt have to be good to be art hes always threatening to hang one of them in the house hes i dont know steady i doubt ive heard him raise his voice more than a dozen times in my life but you listen to him hes like the adhesive that kept the family centered he stretched out on the grass to watch the sky as he continued my mother is what was that term you used once wired shes packed with energy and a blazing intellect thats almost scary she intimidates a lot of people shes always amused by that i guess because inside shes soft as butter she raised her voice plenty but she always felt guilty about it jacob and i gave her a hell of a time in her free time she likes to readflashy novels or impossibly technical books shes chief counsel for the united ministry of nations so shes always poring over some sixinch pile of legal documents the united ministry of nations i guess youd call it an extension of the un it had to be expanded in hell i dont know when i think it was expanded because of the colonies and settlements it sounds like a very prestigious position libby discovered she was already intimidated yes she thrives on it on the work and the worry shes got a great laughone of those big filltheroom kind of laughs they met in dublin she was practicing law there and my father went over for a vacation they matched and ended up in philadelphia libby tamped down the dirt it had been impossible not to hear the affection in his voice impossible not to understand it what about your brother jacob hes intense is a good word he gets his brain from my mother and his temperament she claims from her grandfather youre never quite sure with jt whether hes going to grin at you or throw a punch he studied law and then when hed had his fill of it dived into astrophysics he collects problems so that he can pick them apart hes a sonofabitch cal said affectionately but he has my fathers unswerving immeasurable sense of loyalty do you like them when cal looked up she elaborated what i mean is most people love their family but they arent necessarily friends with them i wondered if you liked them yes i do he watched as she strapped the shovel back on the cycle theyd like you i could meet them if you took me with you she bit her lip the moment the words were out she couldnt turn around to look at him she couldnt have said just when the thought had hatched in her mind libby he was up and standing behind her his hands hovering over her shoulders ive studied the past she said quickly turning and gripping his forearms if you let me come with you it would give me the chance to study the future he framed her face with his hands there was a glint of tears in her eyes and your family theyd understand id leave them a letter try to explain theyd never believe you he said quietly theyd spend years looking for you wondering if you were still alive libby cant you see thats whats tearing me apart about my own they dont know where i am or whats happened to me i know by now theyre waiting to hear if im dead or alive ill make them understand she heard the desperation in her own voice and fought to steady it if they know im happy that im doing what i want to do theyll be satisfied with that maybe yes if they were sure but i cant take you libby she made her hands drop away and stepped back no of course not i dont know what i was thinking of i got caught up damn it dont grabbing her arms he hauled her against him dont think i dont want you because i do its not a choice of right or wrong libby if i could be sure if there were no risks involved i might toss you on the damn ship whether you wanted to go with me or not risks shed stiffened at the word and now she drew back what risks nothings foolproof dont treat me like a fool what risks he let out a long breath there was a calculation he hadnt given her the night before the probability factor for a successful time warp is she repeated it doesnt take a genius to figure out that leaves as the factor for failure what happens if you fail i dont know but he could make a good guess frying in the suns gravitational pull was one of the less painful possibilities and i wont take chances with you no matter how much i want you with me she wasnt going to panic because panic wouldnt help taking three deep breaths she felt some balance return caleb if you gave yourself a little more time do you think you could narrow the odds maybe probably he conceded libby im running out of time the ships already been in the open for two weeks it was blind luck that we headed off the rankins yesterday what do you think would happen to me to us if it were found if i were found the real season doesnt start for weeks we hardly get more than a dozen hikers in a year it only takes one he was right and she knew it theyd been living on borrowed time right from the start ill never know will i she traced a finger under the fading wound on his brow whether you made it im a good pilot trust me he kissed her fingers and itll be easier for me to concentrate if im not worried about you its hard to argue with common sense she worked up a smile i know you said you had a few last details to see to at the ship im just going to walk back to the cabin i wont be long take your time she needed some of her own ill fix a bon voyage supper she started off at an easy gait then called over her shoulder oh hornblower pick me some flowers he picked an armful it wasnt easy balancing them as he flew the cycle the path beneath him was strewn with white and pink and pale blue blossoms he thought they smelled like herfresh earthy exotic in the hours hed worked aboard ship one thought had run continually through his mind shed been willing to go with him to leave her home not just her home he corrected her life perhaps it had been impulse something that had been born of the moment reasons didnt matter he needed to hold on to that one sweet thought shed been willing to go with him he saw only the faintest light through the kitchen window that had him frowning as he stored his bike and retrieved a few of the fallen flowers perhaps shed decided to take a nap or was waiting for him in the front of the cabin by the fire he liked the idea of seeing her there curled up on the couch under one of her mothers exquisite throws shed be reading her eyes a little sleepy behind her glasses pleased with the image he opened the door and found a completely different and even more alluring one she was waiting for him but it was candlelight she was still lighting them dozens of them all pure white the table was set for two and a bottle of champagne sat nestled in a clear bucket the room smelled of candles of the spices shed used for cooking and of her she turned to smile at him and he felt the breath quite simply leave his body her hair was swept up off her neck so that he could see the long delicate curve she wore a dress the color of moonlight that glittered at the bodice as she moved it left her shoulders bare then slipped like a lover down her hips and thighs you remembered she crossed to him holding out her arms for the flowers he didnt move a muscle are they for me what yes like a man in a trance he offered them to her there were more when i started out this is more than enough she had a vase waiting and she filled it dinners almost ready i hope you like it you dazzle me liberty she turned back electrified by what she saw in his eyes i wanted to just once when he just continued to stare her shyness rose up and had her twisting her fingers i bought the champagne and the dress while i was in town yesterday i thought it would be nice to do something a little special tonight im afraid if i move youll vanish no she offered her hand and gripped hard when he took it ill stay right here why dont you open the bottle i want to kiss you first her heart went into her smile as she wound her arms around his neck ah right just once they ate but the trouble she had gone to over the meal was wasted they didnt know what they were tasting champagne was superfluous they were already drunk on each other the candles burned down low while they lingered they carried some up to the bedroom filling the room with the soft flickering light so that they could watch each other as they loved there was sweetness slow savoring sweetness there was urgency fevered racing urgency there was power and tenderness demand and generosity hour melted into hour but they never drew apart each tremble each sigh each heartbeat would be remembered the candles guttered out but they were still wrapped together then though the words were never spoken they knew it was the last time his hands seemed that much more gentle her lips that much softer when it was over the beauty left her weak and weepy in defense she curled against him and prayed for sleep she couldnt bear to watch him go he lay still wakeful until the first faint hints of light crept into the room he was grateful she slept he would never have been able to say goodbye when he rose it hurt a sharp sweet ache that rocked him moving quickly struggling to keep his mind blank he pulled on the jumpsuit shed set out for him afraid of waking her he touched only her hair then moved quietly out of the room libby opened her eyes only when she heard the soft click of the cabin door turning her face into the pillow she let the tears come the ship was secured and the calculations were plotted cal sat on the bridge and watched night fade it was important that he take off before sunrise he had the timing down to a millisecond there was little room for error his life depended on it but his thoughts kept drifting back to libby why hadnt he known it would hurt this badly to leave yet he had to leave his life his time werent here with hers there was no use going over again what he had already agonized over a dozen times still he sat while precious moments clicked away prepare for standard orbital flight yes he told the computer absently instruments began to hum in a way that was second nature to him cal prepared for take off he paused again staring at the viewscreen all systems ready ignition at your discretion right commence countdown commencing ten nine eight seven from the kitchen doorway libby heard the rumble impatient she rubbed tears from her eyes and strained to see there was a flash she thought she caught a quick glint of metal streaking across the lightening sky then it was gone the woods were quiet again she shivered she wished she could convince herself it was because the air was chill and she was wearing only her short blue robe be safe she murmured then gave in and allowed herself the luxury of a few more tears life went on she lectured herself the birds were beginning to sing the sun was nearly up she wanted to die that was nonsense shaking herself she set the kettle on to boil she was going to have a cup of tea wash the dishes theyd been too careless to notice the night before then she was going back to work she would work until she couldnt keep her eyes open and then she would sleep she would get up again and work again until her dissertation was complete it would be the best damn paper her colleagues had ever read and then shed travel and she would miss him until the day she died when the kettle boiled she poured her tea then sat with it at the kitchen table after a moment she shoved it aside laid her head on her folded hands and wept again libby she knocked the chair over as she rose he was there standing in the doorway fatigue all over his face and something something much more powerful in his eyes she rubbed hers he couldnt be there caleb why are you crying she heard him dazed she pressed a hand against her ear caleb she repeated but howi heard i sawyoure gone have you been crying since i left he stepped toward her but only touched a fingertip to her damp cheek his touch was real if she was mad she accepted it i dont understand how can you be here i have a question to ask you first he dropped his hands to his sides just one question are you in love with me ii need to sit down no he caught her arm and held her still i want an answer are you in love with me yes only an idiot would have to ask he smiled but his grip held firm why didnt you ever tell me because i didnt wanti knew you had to go dizzy she put a hand to her head let me sit he released her then watched her sink unsteadily into a chair i havent slept she murmured as if to herself i suppose i could be hallucinating he tilted her head back then planted a hard bruising kiss on her mouth before he could stop himself he dragged her halfway out of the chair is that real enough for you yes she said weakly yes but i dont understand how can you be here he let her go again i rode the cycle no i mean what did she mean i was standing at the door i heard you take off i even saw just a glimpse but i saw the ship in the sky i sent it back the computers at the helm you sent it back she repeated slowly oh my god caleb why only an idiot would have to ask her eyes filled and spilled over no not for me i cant bear it your family i left a disk for them i told them everything a great deal more than whats in the report i left on board where i was why i had to stay if the ship makes it back and it has as good a chance without me as it did with me theyll understand i cant ask you to do this you didnt he took her hand before she could turn away again you would have gone with me wouldnt you libby yes i might have taken you up on that if id been sure we would have lived through it listen to me he drew her to her feet id started countdown id convinced myself that my life was back there where id left it there were a dozen logical reasons why i had to go and there was one only one reason i had to stay i love you my life is here he tightened his grip brought her close i came through time for you libby dont ever ever think i made a mistake she shook her head im afraid youll think so time is time was time is past he murmured my time is in the past libby with you her eyes filmed over again i love you so much caleb ill make you happy im counting on it he picked her up pausing to capture her mouth in a long long kiss you need sleep he told her real sleep no i dont he laughed and the last vestige of tension fled he was exactly where he belonged well see later well talk about how were going to handle the rest of this rest the marriageandfamily part i can handle you havent asked me yet ill get around to it anyway im going to need new id then ive got to get a job something with aan annual salary right something you enjoy she corrected thats more important than salary and group hospitalization group what dont worry about it she nuzzled into his neck i suppose dad could give you some kind of position until you figure it all out i dont think i want to make tea suddenly inspired he stopped by the side of the bed tell me how do you go about getting a pilots license around here times change chapter he knew the risks he was a man who was willing to take them one misstep one bad call and it would all be over essentially before it had begun but he had always considered life a gamble oftenperhaps too oftenhe had allowed his impulses to rule and plunged recklessly into potentially dangerous situations in this case he had figured the odds painstakingly two years of his life had been spent calculating simulating constructing the most minute details had been considered computed and analyzed he was a very patient manwhen it came to his work he knew what could happen now it was time to discover what would more than a few of his associates believed he had crossed the line between genius and madness even those who were enthusiastic about his theories worried that hed gone too far popular opinion didnt concern him results did and results of this the greatest experience of his life would be personal very personal seated behind the wide curve of the control panel he looked more like a buccaneer at the helm of a ship than a scientist on the verge of discovery but science was his life and that made him as true an explorer as the ancient columbus and magellan he believed in chance in the purest sense of the wordthe unpredictable possibility of existence he was here now to prove it in addition to his calculations the technology at his command his knowledge and his computations he needed one element that any explorer required for success luck he was alone now in the vast silent sea of space beyond the traffic patterns beyond the last charted quadrant there was an intimacy here between man and his dreams that could never be achieved in a laboratory for the first time since his voyage had begun he smiled he had been in his laboratory too long the solitude was soothing even tempting hed almost forgotten what it was like to be truly alone with only his own thoughts for company if hed chosen he could have cruised along easing back on the throttle and taking the aloneness to heart for as long as it suited him up here at the edge of mans domain with his own planet a bright ball shrinking in the distance he had time and time was the key resisting temptation he logged his coordinatesspeed trajectory distanceall meticulously calculated his long agile fingers moved over dials and switches the control panel glowed green casting a mystic aura over his sharpfeatured face it was concentration rather than fear that narrowed his eyes and firmed his lips as he hurtled toward the sun he knew exactly what the results would be if his calculations were off by even the slightest margin the bright stars gravity would suck him in it would take only a heartbeat for his ship and its occupant to be vaporized the ultimate failure he thought as he stared at the luminous star that filled his viewing screen or the ultimate achievement it was a gorgeous sight this glowing swirling light that filled the cabin and dazzled his eyes even at this distance the sun held the power of life and death like a hot hungry woman it bewitched deliberately he lowered the shield on the viewing screen he pushed for more speed watching the dials as he neared the maximum the ship could handle a check of gauges showed him that the outside temperature was rising dramatically he waited knowing that beyond the protective screen the intensity of light would have seared his corneas a man shooting toward the sun risked blindness and destructionrisked never achieving his destiny he waited while the first warning bell sounded waited as the ship bucked and danced under the demands of velocity and gravity the calm voice of the computer droned on giving him speed position and most important time though he could hear his own blood pounding in his ears his hand was steady as it urged more speed from the laboring engines he streaked toward the sun faster than any man had ever been known to fly jaw clenched he shoved a lever home his ship shuddered rocked then tilted end over end it tumbledonce twice a third timebefore he could right it his fingers gripped the controls as the force slapped him back in the chair the cabin exploded with sound and light as he fought to hold his course for an instant his vision grayed and he thought fatalistically that instead of being burned up in the suns heat he would simply be crushed by her gravity then his ship sprang free like an arrow from a bow fighting for breath he adjusted the controls and hurtled toward his fate what impressed jacob most about the northwest was the space as far as he could see in any direction there was rock and wood and sky it was quiet not silent but quiet with small animals rustling in the underbrush and birds calling as they wheeled overhead tracks dimpling the blanket of snow around his ship told him that larger animals roamed here more importantly the snow itself told him that his calculations were off by at least a matter of months for the moment he had to be satisfied with being approximately where he wanted to be and with being alive always meticulous he returned to his ship to record the facts and his impressions he had seen pictures and videos of this place and time for the past year he had studied every scrap of information he could find on the late twentieth century clothes language sociopolitical atmosphere as a scientist hed been fascinated as a man hed been appalled and amused by turns and baffled when hed remembered that his brother had chosen to live here in this primitive time and place because of a woman jacob opened a compartment and took out a picture an example of twentiethcentury technology he mused as he turned the polaroid snapshot over in his hand he studied his brother first calebs easy grin was in place and he looked comfortable sitting on the steps of a small wooden structure dressed in baggy jeans and a sweater he had his arm around a woman the woman called libby jacob thought now she was unquestionably attractive as females went not as flashy as cals usual type but certainly inoffensive just what was there about her that had made cal give up his home his family and his freedom because he was prepared to dislike her jacob tossed the picture back in its compartment he would see this libby for himself judge for himself then he would give cal a swift kick and take him home first there were some precautions to take moving from the flight deck to his personal quarters jacob stripped off his flight suit the denim jeans and cotton sweater that had cost him more than he cared to remember were still in their plastic holder excellent reproductions he thought as he tugged the jeans over his long legs and to give the devil his due extremely comfortable when he was dressed he studied himself in the mirror if he ran into any inhabitants during his staya brief one he hopedhe wanted to blend in he had neither the time nor the inclination to attempt to explain himself to a people who were most assuredly slowwitted nor did he want any of the media coverage that was so popular in this time though he hated to admit it the gray sweater and the blue jeans suited him the fit was excellent and the material was smooth against his skin most importantly in them he looked like a twentieth century man his dark hair nearly skimmed his shoulders it was thick and it was always disheveled as he paid more attention to his work than to hairstyles still it was an excellent frame for his angular face his brows were often drawn together over dark green eyes and his mouth usually grim when he was poring over calculations had an unexpected and powerful charm when he relaxed enough to smile he wasnt smiling now he slung his bag over his shoulder and left the ship depending on the slant of the sun rather than on his watch jacob decided it was just past noon the sky was miraculously empty it was incredible to stand under the hard blue cup and see only the faint white trail of what he assumed was the vapor trail from an old continental transport they called them planes he remembered watching the stream lengthen how patient they must be he mused to sit cheerfully shoulder to shoulder with hundreds of other people hanging in the sky for hours just to get from one coast to another or from new york to paris then again they didnt know any better switching his gaze from sky to earth he began to walk it was fortunate that the sun was bright his preparations hadnt included a coat or any heavy outerwear the snow beneath his boots was soft but there was just enough of a wind to make the air uncomfortable until the hike warmed his muscles he was a scientist by vocation and he could lose himself for hours even days in equations and experiments but it wouldnt have occurred to him to neglect his body eitherit was as well toned and as disciplined as his mind he used his wrist unit to give him the bearings at least cals report had been fairly specific as to where his ship had gone down and where the cabin he had stayed in when he had met this libby was situated nearly three hundred years in the future jacob had visited the spot and had excavated the time capsule that his brother and the woman had buried jacob had left home in the year he had traveled through time and through space to find his brother and to take him home as he walked he saw no signs of man or of the posh resorts that would populate this area in another century or two there was simply space acres of it untrampled and untouched the sun cast blue shadows on the snow and the trees towered silent giants overhead despite the logic of what he had done the months of precise calculations the careful working of theory into fact he found himself chilled the enormity of what he had achieved where he had gone struck him he was standing on the ground beneath the sky of a planet that was more foreign to him than the moon he was filling his lungs with air he could watch it expel in white streams he could feel the cold on his face and his ungloved hands he could smell the pine and taste the crisp clear air as it blew around him and he had yet to be born had it been the same for his brother no jacob thought there would have been no elation not at first cal had been lost injured confused he hadnt set out to come here but had been a victim of fate and circumstance then vulnerable and alone he had been bewitched by a woman expression grim jacob continued to hike pausing at the stream he remembered a little more than two years agoand centuries in the futurehe had stood here it had been high summer and though the stream had changed its course over time this spot had been very much the same there had been grass rather than snow under his feet but the grass would grow again year after year summer after summer he had proof of that he was proof of that the stream would run fast where now it forced its way over rock and thick islands of ice a little dazed he crouched down and took a handful of snow in his ungloved hand he had been alone then too though there had been the steady drone of air traffic overhead and a huddle of mountain hotels only a few kilometers to the east when he had uncovered the box his brother had buried he had sat on the grass and wondered and now he stood and wondered if he dug for it he would come upon the same box the box that he had left with his parents only days before the box would exist here beneath his feet just as it existed in his own time as he existed if he dug it up now and carried it back to his ship it would not be there for him to find on that high summer day in the twentythird century and if that was true how could he be here in this time to dig it up at all an interesting puzzle jacob mused he left it to stew in his brain as he walked he saw the cabin and was fascinated no matter how many pictures how many films or simulations he had seen this was real there were patches of snow melting slowly on the roof the wood was still dark aged by mere decades on the glass of the windows sunlight sparkled as it streamed through the high trees smokehe could see it as well as smell itpuffed from the stone chimney and into the hard blue sky amazing he thought and for the first time in many hours his lips curved he felt like a child who had discovered a unique and wonderful present under the christmas tree it was his for the moment to explore to analyze to piece together and take apart until he understood it shifting his bag he walked up the snowcovered path to the steps they creaked under his weight and turned his smile into a grin he didnt bother to knock manners were easily lost in the haze of discovery pushing the door open he stepped into the cabin incredible absolutely incredible his quiet voice hung in the air wood genuine and rich gleamed around him stone the kind that was chipped and dug out of the earth merged with the wood in the form of a huge fireplace there was a fire burning in it crackling and hissing behind a mesh screen the scent was wonderful it was a small cramped room jammed with furniture yet it was appealing in its cheeriness and its oddities jacob could have spent hours in that room alone examining every inch of it but he wanted to see the rest muttering into his minirecorder he started up the stairs sunny yanked the wheel of the land rover and swore how could she actually have believed she wanted to spend a couple of months in the cabin peace and quiet who needed it she ground the gears as the land rover chugged up the hill the idea that a few solitary weeks would give her the opportunity to sort out her life and finally decide what she wanted to do with it was ridiculous she knew what she wanted to do with it something big something spectacular disgusted she blew out a long breath that sent her blond bangs dancing just because she hadnt decided exactly what that something was didnt matter shed know it when she saw it just as she always knew what it wasnt when she saw it it wasnt flying cargo planesor jumping out of them it wasnt ballet and it wasnt touring with a rock band it wasnt driving a truck and it wasnt writing haiku not everyone at twentythree could be so specific about where his ambitions didnt lie sunny reminded herself as she spun the land rover to a halt in front of the cabin using the process of elimination she should be well on her way to fame and success in another ten or twenty years fingers drumming against the steering wheel she studied the cabin it was squat and just homely enough not to be ugly an old rocker stood on the porch that skirted the front it had sat there year after year summer and winter for as long as she could remember there was she discovered something comforting in continuity and yet with the comfort came a restlessness for the new for the untouched and the unseen with a sigh she sat back ignoring the cold what was it that she wanted that wasnt here in this place or in any place shed been still when it had come time to question when it had come time to think she had come back here to the cabin she had been born in it had spent the first few years of her life inside it and running through the surrounding forest perhaps that was why she had come back when her life had seemed so pointless just to recapture some of that simplicity she loved it really oh not with the passion her sister libby did not with the deeprooted sentiment of their parents but fondly the way children often feel about an old eccentric aunt sunny couldnt imagine living there again the way libby and her new husband were day after day night after night without seeing another soul perhaps sunnys roots were in the forest but her heart belonged to the city with its bright lights and its possibilities just a vacation she told herself pulling off her woolen hat and running impatient fingers through her short hair she was entitled to one after all shed entered college at the tender age of sixteen too bright for her own good her father had said more than once after graduating just before her twentieth birthday she had plunged into endeavor after endeavor never finding satisfaction she tended to be good at whatever she did perhaps that was why shed taken lessons in everything from tap dancing to tole painting but being good at something didnt make it the right something so she moved on perennially restless feeling perennially guilty for leaving things halfdone now it was time to settle down so she had come here to think to decide to consider that was all it wasnt as if she were hidingjust because shed lost her last job no her last two jobs she told herself viciously in any case she had enough money to hold her for the rest of the winterparticularly since there was no place to spend any around here if she went with her instincts and caught the next plane to portland or seattleor anywhere something was happeningshed be flat broke in a week and shed be damned if shed go crawling back to her indulgent and exasperated parents you said you were going to stay she muttered as she pushed the door of the car open and youre going to stay until you figure out where sunny stone fits hauling out the two bags of groceries shed just purchased in town she trudged through the snow at the very least she thought a couple of months in the cabin would prove her selfsufficiency if she didnt die of boredom first inside she glanced toward the fire first satisfied that it was still burning well those few years in the girl scouts hadnt been wasted she dumped both bags on the kitchen counter she knew libby would have immediately set about putting everything in its place sunny figured it was a waste of time to store something when you were only going to have to get it out again sooner or later with the same disregard she tossed her coat over the back of a chair then kicked her boots into a corner digging a candy bar out of a bag she unwrapped it and wandered back into the living room what she needed was a long afternoon of research lately shed been toying with the idea of going back to school and trying for a law degree the idea of arguing for a living had a certain appeal along with her clothes her camera her sketch pad her tape recorder and her dance shoes she had packed two boxes of books on an assortment of professions during her first week in the cabin she had researched and discarded screenwriting as too unstable medicine as too terrifying and running a retro clothing store as too trendy but law had possibilities she could see herself as either the cold hardedged da or the dedicated overworked public defender it was worth looking into she decided as she mounted the stairs and the sooner she had her focus the sooner she could get back to where there was something more exciting to do than watch the melting snow run off the gutters the candy bar was halfway to her mouth when she stepped into the doorway and saw him he was standing by the bedher bedobviously engrossed in the fashion magazine shed tossed on the floor the night before it was in his hands now and his fingers seemed to stroke the glossy paper as if it were some exotic fabric though his back was to her she could see that he was tall he had two or three inches on her willowy fiveten his dark hair was long enough to fall over the collar of the sweater he wore and it looked as if hed ridden fast in an open car hardly daring to breathe she took his measure if he was a wayward hiker he was dressed neatly and sparely the jeans showed no signs of wear the boots he wore were unmarked expensive and unless she missed her guess custommade no she didnt think he was a hiker even a foolish one who would challenge the winter mountains he had a lean build though she couldnt be sure what the baggy sweater hid in the way of muscle if he was a thief he was a stupid one passing the time with a magazine rather than bundling up what passed for valuables in the cabin her gaze shot over to the dresser and her jewelry case her collection wasnt extensive but each piece had been selected with care and a disregard for expense and it was hers just as the cabin was hers just as the room hed invaded was hers furious she dropped the candy and snatched up the closest weapon an empty pop bottle and brandishing it lunged forward jacob heard the movement out of the corner of his eye he caught a red blur instinct had him turning shifting just as the bottle whizzed by his head and smashed against the nightstand glass exploded with a sound like a shot what the before he could utter another word his foot was kicked out from under him and he found himself flipped neatly and sprawled on his back he stared up at a tall slender woman with a shiny crop of blond hair and molten gray eyes she was crouched arms bent hands flexed in an ancient fighting stance dont even think about it she warned in a voice as smoky as her eyes i dont want to have to hurt you so get up slow then get yourself downstairs and out youve got thirty seconds keeping his eyes on hers he braced himself on one elbow when dealing with a member of a primitive culture it was wise to go slowly excuse me you heard me pal im a fourthdegree black belt mess with me and ill crush your skull like a walnut she smiled when she said it otherwise he might have offered her excuses and explanations then and there but she smiled and a challenge was a challenge without a word he sprang up to land lightly on the balls of his feet in a stance that mirrored hers he saw surprise in her eyesnot panic surprise he blocked her first blow but he still felt it reverberate from his forearm to his shoulder he shifted enough to prevent a wellaimed kick from connecting with his chin she was fast he noted fast and agile he parried her offensive moves staying on the defensive as he judged her fearless he thought with pure admiration a warrior in a world that still required them and if jacob had a weakness he would admit to it was the love of a good fight he didnt toy with her if he did he knew hed end up on the floor with her foot on his throat the kick that shot past his guard and into his rib cage was proof of that it was an even match he decided after five sweaty minutes except for the fact that he had the advantage in reach and weight deciding to put both to use he feinted blocked then caught her in a throw that sent her flying onto the bed before she could recover he spread himself over her cautiously gripping her wrists over her head she was out of breath but she wasnt out of fuel her eyes burning into his she put all her strength into one last move just in time he shifted his weight and avoided the knee to the groin some things never change he muttered and studied her while he waited for his labored breathing to slow she was stunningor perhaps it was the fight that made her seem so her skin was flushed now a rosy pink that enhanced the sunlight color of her hair its short almost severe cut played up the elegance of her bone structure she had sharp cheekbones warriorlike he thought again like a viking or a celt large longlidded gray eyes smoldered in frustration but not in defeat her nose was small and sharp and her mouth was full with the lower lip slightly prominent in a pout she smelled like the forestcool exotic and foreign youre very good he said and gave himself a moment to enjoy the way her body held firm and unyielding under his thanks she bit the word off but she didnt struggle she knew when to fight and when to plot he outweighed her and he had outfought her but she wasnt ready to discuss terms of surrender id appreciate it if you got the hell off me in a minute is it your custom to greet people by tossing them on the floor she arched one pale brow is it yours to break into peoples homes and poke around in their bedrooms the door was unlocked he pointed out then he frowned he was certain he was in the right place but this was not the woman called libby this is your home thats right its called private property she struggled not to fidget while he studied her as though she were a particularly interesting specimen in a petri dish ive already called the police she told him though the closest telephone was ten miles away if i were you id make tracks if i wanted to avoid the police it would be stupid to make tracks he tilted his head considering and you didnt call them maybe i did and maybe i didnt the pout became more pronounced what do you want theres nothing worth stealing in this place i didnt come to steal a quick panic purely feminine fluttered just below her heart fury banked it i wont make it easy for you all right he didnt bother to ask her what she meant who are you i think im entitled to ask you that question she countered and im not really interested her heart was beginning to thud thickly and she hoped he couldnt feel it they were sprawled across the unmade bed thigh to thigh as intimately as lovers his eyes green and intense stared into hers until she was breathless all over again he saw the panic now just a flicker of it and eased his grip on her wrists her pulse was beating rapidly there causing an unexpected reaction to race through him he could feel it singing through his blood as he shifted his gaze to her mouth what would it be like he wondered just a touch an experiment a mouth that soft that full was designed to tempt a man would she fight or would she yield either would prove rewarding annoyed by the distraction he looked into her eyes again he had a purpose one he didnt intend to detour from im sorry if i startled you or if i interfered with your privacy i was looking for someone theres no one here but she caught herself and swore under her breath who who are you looking for it was best to play it safe jacob decided if he had somehow miscalculated the time or if cals report had been faultyas they had sometimes been beforeit wouldnt be wise to be too specific a man i thought he lived here but perhaps my information is incorrect sunny blew her bangs out of her eyes who whats his name hornblower jacob said and used his smile for the first time his name is caleb hornblower the surprise in sunnys eyes was all he needed instinctively his fingers tightened on her wrists you know him ideas about her sisters somewhat mysterious husband sprang into her mind he was a spy a fugitive an eccentric millionaire on the run family loyalty ran deep and she would rather have had bamboo slivers under her fingernails than betray a loved one why should i you know him jacob insisted when her chin came up he let out a frustrated sigh ive come a long way to see him his lips curved at the understatement a very long way please can you tell me where he is when she felt herself softening she jutted her chin out again obviously hes not here is he all right jacob released her hands and gripped her shoulders has anything happened to him no the very real concern she heard in his voice had her putting a hand over his no of course not i didnt mean to she caught herself again if this was a trap she was falling neatly into it if you want any information from me youll have to tell me who you are and why you want it im his brother jacob sunnys eyes widened as she let out a long breath cals brother it was possible she supposed the coloring was similar and the shape of the face there was certainly more family resemblance between this man and her brotherinlaw than there was between herself and libby well she said after a brief debate with herself it really is a small world isnt it smaller than you can imagine you do know cal yes since he married my sister that makes you and me im not exactly sure what that makes us but i think wed be better off discussing it vertically he nodded but he didnt move who are you me she offered him a big bright smile oh im sunbeam still smiling she wrapped her fingers around his thumb now if you dont want this dislocated youll get the hell off my bed chapter hey moved apart warily two boxers retreating to their corners at the sound of the bell jacob wasnt entirely sure how to handle her much less the bombshell she had dropped his brother was married once they were standing a careful three feet apart he dipped his hands in the pockets of the comfortable jeans he noted that though her stance was easy she was still braced ready to counter any move he might attempt it would have been interesting to make one just to see what she would do and how she would do it but he had priorities wheres cal borneo i think its borneo might be bora bora libbys researching a paper she had time to study him objectively now yes there was a definite resemblance to cal in the way he stood in the rhythm of his speech but even though she accepted that she wasnt ready to trust him cal must have told you shes a cultural anthropologist he hesitated then brought out the smile again he wasnt nearly as concerned now with what cal had or had not told him in his report as with what his brother had told this woman named sunbeam sunbeam he thought distractedly was anyone really named sunbeam of course he lied smoothly and without compunction he didnt mention hed be away how long a few more weeks she tugged the red sweater down over her hips she could already feel bruises forming it didnt annoy her she had held her ownwell almost held her ownagainst him and she hoped shed get another shot its funny he never said you were coming he didnt know frustrated he looked out the window at the snow and the trees hed come so close so damn close only to wait i wasnt sure i could make it yeah with a lazy shrug she rocked back on her heels like you couldnt make it to the wedding we all thought it was odd that none of cals family showed up for the big day he turned back at that there was definite censoriousness in her voice he didnt care for ithe rarely tolerated itbut in this case it was almost amusing believe me if we could have been here we would have hmm well since weve finished wrestling we might as well go down and have some tea she started toward the door flicking a glance over him as she passed what degree black belt do you have seventh he cocked an eyebrow i didnt want to hurt you right more than a little miffed she started downstairs i didnt figure people like you would go in for martial arts people like me he spoke absently as he ran his palm over the smooth wood of the railing youre a physicist or something right or something he spotted a woven throw over the back of a chair in striking colors that challenged rather than blended though the look of it tugged at his memory he resisted the temptation to go over for a closer examination and you what are you nothing im working on it when sunny swung into the kitchen she went directly to the stove she didnt notice the blank astonishment on jacobs face like something out of an old video or reference book he thought as he scanned the room only this was much much better than any reproduction delightful he thought astonishment turning to pleasure absolutely delightful his hands itched to try out every dial and knob jacob what with her brows drawn together sunny stared at him an oddball she decided gorgeous certainly but an oddball and for the time being she was stuck with him i said were big on tea around here do you have a preference no he couldnt resist he simply couldnt as she turned to put the kettle on to boil he wandered over to the white enameled sink and turned a clunky chrome dial water hissed out of the widelipped faucet holding a finger under the running stream he discovered it was icecold when he touched the tip of his tongue to his damp finger he detected a faint metallic flavor completely unprocessed water he decided amazing they drank it exactly as it came out of the ground forgetting sunny he stuck his finger under again and found that the water had heated enough to make him jolt satisfied for the moment he turned the water off when he turned back he saw that sunny was still standing by the stove she was staring at him there was no use cursing himself he decided he was simply going to have to control his curiosity until he was alone its very nice he offered thanks clearing her throat she kept facing him as she reached behind for the mugs we call it a sink they do have sinks in philadelphia dont they yes he took a chance depending on his research ive never used one quite like this she relaxed a little well this place is a throwback i was thinking exactly the same thing as the kettle began to sputter she turned to make the tea as she worked she carelessly pushed her sweater up to her elbows long limber arms he noted deceptively fragile in appearance he rubbed his own forearm hed already had a sample of their strength maybe cal didnt tell you that my parents built this place in the sixties she poured steaming water into cups built it he repeated personally every stone and log she told him they were hippies the genuine article the s yes ive read about that era it was a counterculture movement youth against the establishment in a political and social revolution that involved a distrust of wealth government and the military spoken like a true scientist a weird one she added silently as she brought the mugs to the table its funny to hear someone who was born during that time talk about it as if it were as far removed as the ming dynasty following her lead he sat down times change yes frowning she watched as he rubbed a fingertip over the tables surface its called a table she said helpfully he caught himself and picked up the mug i was admiring the wood im pretty sure its oak my father built it which is why theres a matchbook under one of the legs at his blank look she laughed he went through a carpentry phase almost everything he built in this place wobbles he could barely imagine it oak split from an actual tree and formed into a piece of furniture only those with the highest credit rating could afford the luxury even then they were limited by law to a single piece and here he was sitting in a house made entirely of wood he would need samples it might be difficult with her watching him distrusting him but it wasnt impossible thinking it over he sipped the tea stopped then sipped again herbal delight sunny lifted her mug in salute right the first time we could hardly drink anything else without risking a family crisis with a shake of her head she studied him over the rim of her mug its my fathers company didnt cal tell you that either no baffled jacob stared into the dark golden tea in his mug herbal delight stone the company one of the richest and most expansive in the federation had been established by william stone the myths about his beginnings were as romanticized as those about the nineteenthcentury president who had been born in a log cabin no not a myth jacob thought as the fragrant steam rose from the cup reality just what did cal tell you jacob sipped again and struggled for patience he wanted to record all of this as soon as possible just that he hadflown off course and crashed your sister took care of him and they fell in love the old resentment welled up in him and he set down his mug and he chose to stay with her here you have a problem with that in a movement that mirrored his sunny set down her mug when they eyed each other now there was as much dislike as distrust in their looks is that why you didnt bother to show up at the wedding because you were annoyed that he decided to get married without clearing it with you his eyes shades darker as anger grew snapped to hers again no matter what or how i felt about his decision i would have been here if it had been possible thats big of you she shot up to snag a bag of cookies from the pile of groceries let me tell you something hornblower hes lucky to have my sister i wouldnt know i would sunny ripped the bag open and dug in shes beautiful and brilliant kind and unselfish she gestured with half a cookie and if its any of your businesswhich it isnttheyre happy together i have no way of knowing that either whose fault is that youve had plenty of time to see them togetherif it really mattered to you there was fury rash and dark in his eyes now time has been the problem he rose all i know is that my brother made a rash decision a lifealtering one and i intend to make certain it wasnt a mistake you intend sunny choked on a cookie and had to snatch up her mug and drink before she could speak again i dont know how things work in your family pal but in ours we dont make decisions by committee were each considered individuals with the right to choose for ourselves he didnt give a damn about her family he only cared about his own my brothers decision affects a great number of people yeah im sure his marrying libby is going to change the course of history disgusted she tossed the bag of cookies back on the counter if youre so worried why the hell has it taken you over a year to put in an appearance thats my business oh i see thats your business but my sisters marriage is also your business youre a real jerk hornblower i beg your pardon i said youre a jerk she tugged a hand through her hair well you go right ahead and talk to him when they get back but theres one thing you havent put in your calculations cal and libby love each other which means they belong together now if youll excuse me ive got things to do you can let yourself out she stormed off moments later jacob heard what he imagined was the sound of a primitive wooden door slamming shut an exasperating woman he thought interesting of course but exasperating he was going to have to find a way to deal with her since it was obvious hed have to extend his stay until cals return as a scientist he considered it a tremendous opportunity to study a primitive culture firsthand to talk facetoface with an ancestorof sorts he glanced up at the ceiling he doubted the volatile sunbeam would appreciate being considered an ancestor yes it was a tremendous opportunityscientifically personally he already considered his association with the primitive woman a trial she was rude argumentative and aggressive perhaps he had the same traits but he was after all superior being older by several centuries the first thing he was going to do when he returned to the ship was open the computer banks and look up what the word jerk meant when applied to a man in the twentieth century sunny would have been delighted to give him a concise definition in fact as she paced her room she thought of half a dozen more colorful descriptions of his character the nerve of the man to waltz in here more than a year after his brother and her sister married not to congratulate them she thought furiously not for a nice family reunion but to offer his halfbaked opinions as to whether libby was worthy of his brother creep jackass imbecile as she swung past the window she spotted him down below her hand was already on the window sash prepared to lift the glass so that she could shout the epithets at him her anger snapped off as quickly as it had ignited why in the world was he walking into the forest without a coat narrowing her eyes she watched him trudge through the snow toward the sheltering trees where the hell was he going there was nothing in that direction but more trees a question sprang into her mind that shed been too occupied to consider before how had he gotten here the cabin was miles from town and a good two hours drive from the nearest airport how the devil had he managed to pop up in her bedroom coatless hatless gloveless in the middle of winter there was no car no truck not even a snowmobile outside the cabin the idea of him hitchhiking from the highway was ludicrous a man didnt simply walk into the mountains in january at least not if he was sane with a shudder she stepped back from the window maybe that was the answer jacob hornblower wasnt just a jerk he was a deranged jerk that was an awfully big leap she told herself just because she didnt like him wasnt a good enough reason to assume he was crazy after all he was cals brother and over the past year sunny had become very fond of cal brother jacob might be an annoying interfering pain in the neck but that didnt mean he had loose screws and yet hadnt she thought he was weird hadnt he acted weird she looked out the window again but the only sign of him was the fresh tracks in the snow cal seemed normal enough she mused but what did any of them know about his family or his background next to nothing it had always seemed to sunny that her brotherinlaw was strangely closemouthed when it came to his family she glanced back toward the window again maybe he had his reasons the man had acted odd right from the start sunny decided the way hed come into the house unannounced to stand in her bedroom and pore over a copy of vogue as if it were the dead sea scrolls then there was his behavior in the kitchen playing with the faucet and staring it was as though hed never seen a stove or refrigerator before or hadnt seen one in a very long time her mind was jumping like a rabbit because hed been locked up she thought put away where he wasnt a danger to society catching her lip between her teeth she began to pace again her foot connected with his flight bag jolting backward sunny stared at it hed forgotten it that meant he would be coming back well she could handle it she could take care of herself rubbing her palms against her thighs she stared down at the bag but it wouldnt do any harm to take a few precautions going on impulse she knelt down invasion of privacy or not she was going to look through the bag it was odd itself no zipper or straps the velcro peeled apart almost soundlessly casting one guilty look over her shoulder she began to dig a change of clothes another sweater black this time no label the jeans were soft and obviously expensive though there was no designer name on the back pocket no label anywhere and they were new she would have sworn they had never been worn setting them aside she pushed deeper she found a vial marked fluoratyne that contained a clear liquid and a pair of hightop sneakers in supple leather no shaving gear she mused no mirror not even a toothbrush just a set of obviously new clothes and a vial that might very well contain some kind of drug her last discovery was the most puzzling of all an electronic device no bigger than the palm of her hand was tucked in the corner of the bag circular in shape it was hinged back when she opened it she saw a series of tiny buttons after touching the first she jumped back at the sound of jacobs voice as clear as a bell it came from the circle of metal in her hand he was reciting equations as far as she could tell neither the numbers nor the terms meant anything to her but the fact that they were emitted by the little disk opened up new realms of possibility he was a spy probably for the other side whatever the other side was and from his behavior it was natural to assume that he was an unbalanced spy imagination had never been sunnys weak point she could see it all perfectly he had been captured whatever techniques had been used to pull information from him had unhinged his mind cal had covered for him making up a story about his brother being an astrophysicist too deep in research to travel to the west coast when in reality he had been in some sort of federal institution and now hed escaped sunny pushed buttons at random until jacobs voice clicked off she would have to treat him carefully whatever her personal feelings he was family shed have to make absolutely certain he was a dangerous lunatic before she did anything about it a stupid often annoying person jacob scowled at the puff of smoke he saw through the last line of trees he didnt care for the definition of jerk being called annoying didnt bother him in the least but stupid did he would not tolerate some skinny woman who considered the combustion engine the height of technology calling him stupid hed gotten quite a bit done overnight his ship was well camouflaged and his records had been brought up to date including his infuriating encounter with sunbeam stone it hadnt been until sunrise that hed remembered his flight bag if she hadnt made him lose his temper he would never have left it behind not that it contained anything valuable it was the principle of the thing he was not absentminded by nature and he only forgot minor details when his mind was absorbed with larger ones and he resented thinking of her she had popped into his mind on and off as hed worked through the night a constant annoyancelike an itch on the shoulder blade that was just out of reach how shed crouched ready to fight chin up body braced how that body had felt under his tensed challenging how her hair glowed like her name furious he shook his head as if to dislodge her from his thoughts he didnt have time for women it wasnt that he didnt appreciate them but there was a time for pleasure this wasnt it and if it was pleasure he wanted sunbeam stone was not where he should look for it the more he thought about where he was when he was the more he was certain that cal needed to be brought to his senses and taken home some sort of space fever jacob decided his brother had suffered a shock and the womanas some women had throughout timehad taken advantage of him when he approached cal logically they would get into the ship and go home in the meantime he would take the opportunity to study and record at least this small section of the world at the edge of the forest he paused it was colder today and he sincerely regretted the lack of warmer clothing gray clouds plump with snow had drifted in to cover the sun in the gloomy light he watched sunny lifting logs from the woodpile at the rear of the cabin she was singing in a powerfully erotic voice about a man who had gotten away she didnt hear his approach and she continued to sing and stack wood in her arms excuse me with a yelp she jumped back sending the split logs flying one landed hard on her booted foot and she swore roundly and hopped up and down damn it damn damn damn whats wrong with you clasping her wounded foot with one hand she braced the other on the cabin wall nothing he couldnt help the grin i think theres something wrong with you does it hurt no it feels great i live for pain she gritted her teeth as she set her foot gingerly back on the ground where did you come from philadelphia she narrowed her eyes oh you mean now with a jerk of his thumb he said that way he paused to glance at the logs scattered in the snow want some help no favoring her foot she crouched down to retrieve the logs all the while she watched him carefully braced for any move he might make do you know why im here hornblower for peace and solitude she blew the hair out of her eyes as she looked up at him do you understand the concepts yes good turning she limped back into the cabin letting the door slam shut behind her after dumping the logs in the woodbox she came back to the kitchen and swore what now i left my bag he sniffed the air is something burning with a sound of disgust she darted to the toaster banging on it until the smoking blackened bread popped up this stupid thing sticks to get a better look at the fascinating little device he leaned over her shoulder doesnt look appetizing its fine to prove it she bit into the toast her scent drifted to him over the smoke his instant reaction annoyed him but pride had him resisting the instinctive move away are you always so stubborn yes and so unfriendly no she turned and was immediately made aware of the miscalculation he didnt move aside as she had expected instead he leaned forward resting his palms against the counter and casually caging her between his arms there was nothing she detested more than being outmaneuvered back off hornblower no he did shift but closer as on their first meeting their thighs rubbed but there was nothing loverlike in the connection you interest me sunbeam sunny she said automatically dont call me sunbeam you interest me he repeated do you consider yourself an average woman of your time baffled she shook her head what kind of a question is that she had dozens of shades in her hair from pale white to dark honey he was sorry he had noticed one that requires a simple answer do you no no one likes to be considered average now would you youre beautiful his gaze skimmed over her face deliberately a test of himself and his endurance but thats merely physical what do you think separates you from the average what are you doing a thesis she lifted a hand to shove him away and met the solid wall of his chest she could feel his heartbeat there slow and steady more or less he smiled he was disturbing her at a very basic level and he found it intensely satisfying it was his eyes sunny thought even if the man was unhinged he had the most incredibly hypnotic eyes i thought you dealt with planets and stars not with people people live on planets at least this one he smiled again at least you could consider this a personal interest she wanted to shift but realized that would only make the contact more intimate cursing him she kept her voice and her gaze level i dont want your personal interest jacob jt he felt the quick tremor from her body into his the family usually calls me jt all right she spoke slowly all too aware that her brain had turned to mush what she needed was some distance how about you get out of my way jt and i put together some breakfast if she didnt stop nibbling on her lip he was going to have to stop her in the most effective way he knew he hadnt realized that such a small nervous habit could be seductive is that an invitation her tongue slipped out to nurse her lip sure he leaned closer enjoying the way her eyes widened darkened steadied it wasnt easy to resist he was known for his brilliance his tenacity his temper but not for his control and he wanted to kiss her not scientifically not experimentally ruthlessly toast he murmured she let out a quick puff of air froot loops theyre great my favorite he eased back much more for his sake than for hers if he was going to spend the next few weeks around her he was going to have to work on that control because he had a plan i could use some breakfast fine telling herself it was a change of strategy not a retreat she darted across the kitchen to pluck two bowls from the cupboard with those and a colorful box in hand she walked to the table we could never have these as kids my mother wasisa health fiend her idea of cold cereal is hunks of roots and tree bark why would she choose to eat tree bark dont ask me sunny grabbed the milk from the fridge then dumped it over the piles of colorful circles anyway ever since i moved out ive been on a binge of junk food i figure since i ate healthy for the first twenty years i can poison myself for the next twenty poison he repeated giving the cereal a dubious look to the health fiend sugars poison dig in she added offering him a spoon burnt toast and cold cereal are my specialties she smiled charmingly she too had a plan because he wouldnt have put it past her to poison him he waited until she had begun to eat before he sampled the cereal soggy candy he decided and fairly appealing he considered the informal meal a good start if he wanted to ingratiate himself with her enough to pump her for information it was obvious that cal had told no one except libby about whereand whenhe had come from jacob gave him full marks for that it was better all around if the matter was kept quiet the repercussions would be well he had yet to calculate them but sunny might not have been far off when she had said that cals marrying her sister could change the course of history so he would play the game close and cautious and use the situation to his advantage use her to his advantage he thought with only a twinge of guilt he intended to pick her brain about her family her sister in particular her impressions of cal and he wanted her firsthand account of life in the twentieth century with a little luck he might be able to convince her to guide him into the nearest city where he could add to his data it wouldnt do to lose her temper with him sunny thought if she wanted to find out exactly who and what he was she would have to employ more tact it wasnt her strong point but she could learn she was as completely alone with him as it was possible to be and since she had no intention of packing up and leaving she would just have to exercise some caution and some diplomacy particularly if he was as loony as she believed it was too bad that he was crazy she thought smiling at him anyone that attractive that blatantly sexy deserved a solid working brain maybe it was only a temporary mental breakdown so she tapped her spoon against the side of her bowl what do you think of oregon so far its very bigand underpopulated thats how we like it she let the lull drag out did you fly into portland he wavered between a lie and the truth no my transportation brought me a bit closer do you live here with cal and your sister no i have a place in portland but im thinking of giving it up to what just giving it up she shot him a puzzled look then shrugged actually im toying with the idea of going east for a while new york to do what i havent decided he set his spoon aside you have no work automatically her shoulders squared im in between jobs i recently resigned from a managerial position in retail shed been fired from her job as assistant manager of the lingerie department of a midlevel department store im considering going back to school for a law degree law his eyes softened there was something so appealing about the look that she nearly smiled at him and meant it my mother is in law really i dont think cal mentioned it what kind of law does she practice because he thought it would be a bit difficult to explain his mothers position he asked what kind did you have in mind im leaning toward criminal law she started to elaborate then stopped herself she didnt want to talk about herself but about him its funny isnt it that my sister should be a scientist and cals brother should be one just what does an astrophysicist do theorizes experiments about stuff like interplanetary travel she tried not to smirk but didnt quite succeed you dont really believe all that stufflike people flying off to venus the way they fly to cleveland it was fortunate he was a cool hand at poker his face remained bland as he continued to eat yes she laughed indulgently i guess you have to but isnt it frustrating to go into all that knowing that even if it becomes possible it wont happen in your lifetime times relative in the early part of this century a flight to the moon was considered implausible but it has been done clumsily he thought but it had been done in the next century man goes to mars and beyond maybe she got up to take two bottles of soda from the refrigerator but it would be hard for me to devote my life to something id never see happen as jacob watched in fascination she took a small metal object out of a drawer applied it like a lever to the top of each bottle and dislodged the caps i guess i like to see results and see them now she admitted as she set the first bottle in front of him instant gratification which is why im twentythree and between jobs the bottle was glass jacob mused the same kind she had tried to strike him with the afternoon before lifting it he sipped he was pleasantly surprised by the familiar taste he enjoyed the same soft drink at home though it wasnt his habit to drink it for breakfast why did you decide to study space he glanced back at her he recognized a grilling when he heard one and he thought it would be entertaining to both humor and annoy her i like possibilities you must have studied a long time long enough he sipped again where where what she managed to keep the pleasant smile intact where did you study he thought of the kroliac institute on mars the birmington university in houston and his brief and intense year in the lespace space laboratory in the fordon quadrant here and there at the moment im attached to a small private facility outside of philadelphia she wondered if the staff of that private facility wore white coats i guess you find it fascinating only more so recently are you nervous why you keep tapping your foot she placed a hand on her knee to stop the movement restless i get restless if i stay in one place too long it was obvious painfully so that she wasnt going to get anywhere with him this way listen i really do have some things to her words trailed off as she glanced out the window she didnt know when the snow had begun but it was coming down in sheets terrific following her gaze jacob studied the thick white flakes looks like it means business yeah she let out her breath in a sigh maybe he did make her nervous but she wasnt a monster and its not the kind of weather suitable for camping in the woods fighting with her conscience she walked to the door back to the table then to the window look i know you dont have a place to stay i saw you walk into the forest yesterday i have all i need sure but i cant have you go trudging into the hills in a blizzard to sleep in a tent or something libby would never forgive me if you died of exposure thrusting her hands in her pockets she scowled at him you can stay here he considered the possibilities and smiled id love to chapter he stayed out of her way it seemed the best method of handling the situation for the moment shed stationed herself on the sofa by the fire books heaped beside her and was busily taking notes a portable radio sat on the table crackling with static and music and the occasional weather report absorbed in her research sunny ignored him taking advantage of the opportunity jacob explored his new quarters shed given him the room next to herslarger by a couple of meters with a pair of paned windows facing southeast the bed was a big boxy affair framed in wood with a springtype of mattress that creaked when he sat on the edge there was a shelf crowded with books novels and poetry of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries they were paperbacks for the most part with bright eyecatching covers he recognized one or two of the names he flipped through them with an interest that was more scientific than literary it was cal he thought who read for pleasure who had a talent for retaining little bits of prose and poetry it was rare for jacob to while away an hour of his time with fiction they were still using trees to make the pages of books he remembered with a kind of dazed fascination one side had cut them down to make room for housing and to make furniture and paper and fuel while the other side had scurried to replant them never quite catching up it had been an odd sort of game one of many that had led to incredible and complicated environmental problems then of course theyd saturated the air with carbon dioxide gleefully punching holes in the ozone then fluttering their hands when faced with the consequences he wondered what kind of people poisoned their own air and water he recalled with a shake of his head another game had been to throw whatever was no longer useful into the ocean as if the seas were a bottomless dumping ground it was fortunate that they had begun to get the picture before the damage had become irreparable turning from the window he wandered the room running a fingertip along the walls over the bedspread the bedposts certainly the textures were interesting and yet he paused when he spotted a picture framed in what appeared to be silver the frame itself would have caught his attention but it was the picture that drew him his brother smiling he was wearing a tuxedo and looking very pleased with himself his arm was around the woman called libby she had flowers in her hair and wore a white fullsleeved dress that laced to the throat a wedding dress jacob mused in his own time the ceremony was coming back into style after having fallen into disfavor in the latter part of the previous century couples were finding a new pleasure in the old traditions it had no basis in logic of course there was a contract to seal a marriage and a contract to end one each was as easily forged as the other but elaborate weddings were in fashion once more churches were once again the favored atmosphere for the exchange of rings and vows designers were frantically copying gowns from museums and old videos the gown libby wore would have drawn moans of envy from those who admired the fuss and bother of marriage rites he couldnt imagine it the entire business puzzled him and it would have amused him if not for the fact that it involved his brother not cal who had always been enamored of women in general but never of one in particular the idea of cal being matched was illogical and yet he was holding the proof in his hand it infuriated him to have left his family his home his world and for a woman jacob slammed the picture down on the dresser and turned away it had been madness there was no other explanation one woman couldnt change a life so drastically and what else was there here to tempt a man oh it was an interesting place certainly fascinating enough to warrant a few weeks of study and research he would undoubtedly write a series of papers on the experience when he returned to his own time but what was the ancient saying a nice place to visit but i wouldnt want to live there he would put caleb in his right mind again whatever the woman had done to him he would undo no one knew caleb hornblower better than his own brother they had been together not so long ago time was relative he thought again but without humor the last evening they had spent together had been in jacobs quarters at the university theyd played poker and drank venusian ruma particularly potent liquor manufactured on the neighboring planet cal had commandeered an entire case from his last run as jacob remembered cal had lost at cards cheerfully and elaborately as was his habit they had both gotten sloppy drunk when i get back from this run cal had said tipping back in his chair and yawning hugely im going to spend three weeks on the beachsouth of france i thinkwatching women and staying drunk three days jacob had told him hed swirled the coalblack liquor in his glass then youd go up again in the last ten years youve been in the air more than on the ground you dont fly enough with a grin cal had taken jacobs glass and downed the contents stuck in your lab little brother i tell you its a lot more fun to bounce around the planets than to study them point of view if i didnt study them you couldnt bounce around them he had slid down in his chair too lazy to pour himself more rum besides youre a better pilot than i am its the only thing you do better than i do cal had grinned again point of view he had tossed back ask linsy mccellan jacob had stirred himself enough to raise a brow that particular woman a dancer had generously shared her attributes with both menon separate occasions shes too easily entertained his smile had turned wicked in any case im here on the ground with her a great deal more than you are even linsy he lifted his glass bless her cant compete with flying with running cargo cal if youd stayed with the isf youd be a major by now cal had only shrugged ill leave the regimentation for you dr hornblower then he had sat up sluggish from drink but still eager jt why dont you give this place the shake for a few weeks and come with me theres this club in the brigston colony on mars that needs to be seen to be believed theres this mutant sax playeranyhow youve got to be there ive got work youve always got work cal had pointed out a couple of weeks jt fly up with me i can make the transport show you a few of the seedier parts of the colony then i can call in to base before we watch those women on the beach you just have to name the beach it had been tempting so tempting that jacob had nearly agreed the impulse had been there as always but so had the responsibilities cant heaving a sigh hed lunged for the bottle again i have to finish these equations before the first of the month he should have gone jacob thought now he should have said the hell with the equations with the responsibilities and jumped ship with cal maybe it wouldnt have happened if hed been along or if it had at least he would have been there with his brother the video report on cals wounded ship had shown exactly what cal had been through the black hole the panic the helplessness as hed been sucked toward the void and battered by its gravitational field that he had survived at all was a miracle and a tribute to his skill as a pilot but if hed had a scientist on board he might have avoided the rest and he would be home now they would both be home where they belonged calming himself he turned from the window in a few weeks they would be all he had to do was wait to pass the time he began to toy with the clunky computer sitting on the desk in the corner for an hour he amused himself with it dismantling the keyboard and putting it together again examining switches and circuits and chips for his own entertainment he slipped one of libbys disks into the drive it was a long involved report on some remote tribe in the south pacific despite himself jacob found himself caught up in the descriptions and theories she had a way of turning dry facts about a culture into a testament to the people who made it it was ironic that she had focused on the effects of modern tools and technology on what was to her a primitive society he had spent a great deal of time over the last year wondering what effect the technology he had at his fingertips would have on her time and place she was intelligent he admitted grudgingly she was obviously thorough and precise when it came to her work those were qualities he could admire but that didnt mean she could keep his brother shutting the machine down he went back downstairs sunny didnt bother to look up when she heard him come down the stairs she wanted to think shed forgotten he was there at all as shed pored over her law books but she hadnt she couldnt complain that he was noisy or made a nuisance of himself except that he did make a nuisance of himself just by being there because she wanted to be alone she told herself as she glanced up and watched him stroll into the kitchen that wasnt true she hated to be alone for long periods of time she liked people and conversation arguments and parties but he bothered her tapping her pen against her pad she studied the fire why that was the big question possibly loony she wrote on her pad then she grinned to herself actually it was more than possible that hed had a clearance sale on the top floor popping out of nowhere living in the forest playing with faucets possibly dangerous that turned her grin into a scowl there werent many men who could get past her guard the way he had but he hadnt hurt her and she had to admit hed had the opportunity still there was a difference between dangerous and violent forceful personality there was an intensity about him that couldnt be ignored even when he was quiet watchful in that strange way of his he seemed to be charged a live wire ready to shock then he would smile unexpectedly disarmingly and you were willing to risk the jolt wildly attractive sunny didnt like the phrase but it suited him too well for her not to use it there was something ruthless and untamed in his looksthe lean almost predatory face and the mane of dark hair and his eyes that deep dark green that seemed to look straight into you the heavy lids didnt give them a sleepy look but a brooding one heathcliff she thought and laughed at herself it was libby who was the romantic one libby would always look into a persons heart sunny would always be compelled to dissect the brain absently she sketched his face on a corner of the paper there was something different about him she mused as she penciled in the dark brows and the heavy lashes it bothered her that she couldnt put her finger on it he was evasive secretive eccentric she could accept all thatonce she discovered what he was evading was he in trouble had he done something that required him to pack up quickly and find a place a quiet remote place to hide or was it really as simple as he said he had come to see his brother and to get a firsthand look at his brothers wife no scowling down at the impromptu portrait sunny shook her head that might be the truth but it was no more than half of it jt hornblower was up to something and sooner or later she was going to find out what it was with a shrug she set her pad aside that was reason enough for her interest in jacob hornblower she only wanted to know what made the man tick with that in mind she rose and went into the kitchen what in the hell are you doing jacob glanced up spread all over the table in front of him were the various parts of the toaster and a carpet of crumbs hed found a screwdriver in a drawer and was having the time of his life it needs to be fixed yes but do you like your bread burned she narrowed her eyes his fingers long lean and clever skimmed over screws do you know what youre doing maybe he smiled wondering what she would say if he told her he could dismantle an x primary unit in under an hour dont you trust me no she turned to put on the kettle but i dont suppose you can make it any worse than it already is friendly she reminded herself she would be friendly and casual then move in for the kill want some tea sure with the screwdriver in his hand he watched her walk from stove to cupboard and back to stove grace he thought when combined with strength was an appealing combination she had a way of shifting her weight so that her whole body flowed into the movement yet there was a control about her the kind of discipline seen in athletes and dancers and it wasnt genderless but innately and completely female when the nerves at the back of her neck began to prickle she glanced over her shoulder problem no i like to watch you because she didnt have a ready response for that she poured the tea want a cupcake okay she tossed him a little chocolate cake wrapped in clear paper if you want something more elaborate for lunch youre on your own she brought the cups to the table then sat across from him how are you with plumbing excuse me the faucet in the tub leaks sunny tore the paper from her cupcake my solutions been to put a washrag on the drain to muffle the noise at night but if youre handy theres probably a wrench around somewhere she took the first bite closing her eyes to better enjoy the taste we could consider it a tradeoff for your meals i can take a look he was still holding the screwdriver but he was more interested in the way she gently licked icing from the cake it had never occurred to him that eating could be quite so sexy do you live alone she lifted a brow then nipped at the cake again obviously when youre not here most of the time she sucked chocolate from her finger and had his stomach clenching i like living alone not having to check with anyone if i want to eat at ten or go dancing at midnight do you what live alone yes my work takes up most of my time physics right too bad she settled back with her tea the idea of him being a spy was beginning to sound absurd and to give him his due she decided he wasnt as crazy as shed initially believed eccentric she thought if there was one thing sunny understood it was eccentricity shed lived with it all of her life so you really like splitting atoms or whatever it is you guys do something like that whats your stand on nuclear reactors he nearly laughed but then he remembered where he was nuclear fission is like trying to dispose of a mouse with a rocket launcher dangerous and unnecessary my mother would love you but that doesnt sound very physicistlike not all scientists agree knowing he was on unsteady ground he went back to the toaster tell me about your sister libby why i have an interest in her since she has my brother she isnt exactly holding him for ransom sunny said dryly in fact he rushed her down the aisle so fast she barely had time to say i do what aisle its a figure of speech jt she spoke slowly now and with a sigh when people get married they you know go down the aisle oh right he thought that over as he fiddled with the toaster youre saying that the marriage was cals idea i dont know whose idea it was if that matters but he was certainly enthusiastic her fingers began to drum as her annoyance grew i get the impression you think libby pushed cal into something here or that she i dont know used feminine wiles to trap him does she have them after she finished choking on her tea sunny took a long breath this may be tough for you to understand hornblower but cal and libby love each other youve heard of love havent you or doesnt it compute ive heard of the concept he said mildly enough it was intriguing to watch her temper riseas it did with very little provocation her eyes darkened her skin flushed her chin lifted attractive when composed she was simply devastating when aroused he wouldnt have been human if he hadnt considered how interesting it would be to arouse her in other more rewarding ways i havent experienced it myself but i have an open mind thats big of you she muttered rising she stuffed her hands in the back pockets of her jeans and stalked to the window lord he was a prize if she managed to keep from murdering him before cal and libby got back it would be a miracle have you have i what been in love he said running the staff of the screwdriver through his fingers she sent him a particularly vicious look keep out of my personal life im sorry he wasnt not a bit he was as determined to make her look like a fool as she was to make him sound like one its just that you sounded so knowledgeable on the subject i assumed youd had quite a bit of experience yet youre not matchedmarriedare you whether hed aimed or just shot from the hip hed hit the target deadon she hadnt been in love though shed tried to be several times selfdoubt only fanned the flames of anger just because a person hasnt been in love doesnt mean he or she cant appreciate its value she whirled back hating the fact that shed been put on the defensive and determined to turn the conversation around the fact that im not married is purely a personal choice i see the way he said it had her teeth snapping together and this has nothing to do with me were talking about libby and cal i thought we were talking about love as a concept talking about love with a heartless clod is a waste of time and i never waste mine she balled a hand on her hip but we both have an interest in libby and cal so well clear it up all right he tapped the screwdriver on the edge of the table he didnt need a computer to tell him what a clod was it was just one more thing she would have to pay for before this was over clear it up you automatically assume that my sister being a woman lured your brother being only a man into marriage what an incredibly outdated theory his fingers paused in the act of reattaching the toasters coil is it incredibly outdated chauvinistic and stupid the idea that all women want is marriage and a house with a picket fence went out with the poodle skirt though he wondered who in his right mind would put skirts on poodles there was something more important to touch on stupid he repeated idiotic legs spread jaw firm she baited him only a true idiot would be alive today with that kind of neanderthal attitude maybe the last few decades have passed you by pal but things have changed she was on a roll now a slender steamroller with right on her side women have choices today options alternatives an enlightened few even figure that because they do men benefit from the same expanding horizons except of course men like you who are mired in their own selfimportance he stood at that in a slow deliberate manner that would have tipped her off if she hadnt been so angry im not mired in anything youre up to your neck in it hornblower from the minute you got here youve been trying to find some way to turn your brothers marriage into a setup created by my sister she took one longlegged stride toward him ive got a flash for you only a fool gets tricked into marriage and cal doesnt strike me as a fool thats where the family resemblance fades a jerk a clod an idiot and now a fool yes he thought she was going to pay then why did he marry so quickly without even attempting to come home and see his family first youll just have to ask him she shot back it could be because he didnt want to be questioned or hounded or interrogated in my family we dont pressure the people we love and in the real world women get along just fine without setting snares for unwary men the fact is hornblower we dont need you this time it was he who took the step you dont no not for winning the bread or chopping the wood running the country or taking out the garbage oror fixing toasters she added with a wild gesture toward the mess on the table we can do everything we need to do just dandy on our own you left out something her chin lifted a fraction higher what his hand clamped quickly around the back of her neck sunny had time for a hiss of surprise before his mouth closed over hers when a woman was expecting a left to the jaw she had little defense against a heated embrace she murmured something he felt her lips move beneath his his name he thought as the whisper of sound and movement shuddered into him he was angrymore than angrybut his hairtrigger temper had never taken him so deep into trouble before and she was trouble hed known it from the first glimpse recklessly he ignored logic and consequences and dragged her closer her hands had shot out of her pockets and now they were clenched taut as wire on his shoulders neither resisting nor surrendering he wanted craved one or the other with an oath he nipped at her full seductive lower up until her gasp of pleasure shocked the air shed been right about the highpowered voltage that ran through him her system was jolted again and again as he held her closer tighter harder she didnt struggle for while her body was charged with the current that raced from him into her her mind emptied thoughts streaming away like colored chalk in the rain she felt his muscles tense under her fingers heard his sharp intake of breath as she pressed herself more fully against him she could taste the passion riper darker than any she had ever known but she couldnt be sure if it was his or her own it was as if she had come alive in his arms he felt her go from rigid shock to molten aggression in the space of a heartbeat of all the women he had pleasured or been pleasured by he had never known one who matched him so perfectly passion to passion demand to demand he ran his hands through her short cap of hair warm silk down the slender curve of her throat hot satin with his tongue he sampled the potent flavors of her mouth and then he groaned as she drew him deeper into her never had need spun so quickly out of control risen so high above the tolerable he hurt and he had never hurt before not from wanting he reeled the way a man might stagger from lack of food or sleep and he knew feara sharp and sudden terror that his own destiny had been removed neatly from his hands it was that which had him yanking her away his fingers biting into her arms as he held her back his breath came fast and shallow as if he had raced to the top of a cliff indeed staring at her he thought he could see the drop spread below him like a vision of jagged rocks and boiling seas she said nothing just stared with eyes that were huge and dark in the milky winter light her skin was pale and clear like a statue she stood utterly still utterly silent then she began to tremble jacob snatched his hands away as if hed been burned i suppose because her voice was weak sunny took a long cleansing breath i suppose that was your way of proving a point he pushed his hands into his pockets and felt exactly like what she had called him a fool it was a choice between that and a left jab either way hed scored a knockout steadier now she nodded if youre going to stay here for the time being were going to have to establish some rules she recovered quickly he thought with a bitterness that surprised him yours i suppose yes she wanted to sit down badly but forced herself to face him eyetoeye we can argue all you like in fact i enjoy a good argument youre seductive when you argue she opened her mouth then closed it again no one had ever accused her of that i guess youll just have to learn how to control yourself its not my strong suit or take a hike in whats already over a foot of snow he glanced toward the window ill work on it fair enough she took another long breath though its obvious we dont like each other very much we can try to be civil as long as were stuck with each other nicely put he wanted to trace a finger down her cheek but wisely resisted the temptation can i ask you a question all right do you usually respond so radically to men you dont like thats none of your business temper brought a flattering tinge of color to her cheeks i thought it was a very civil question then he smiled and changed tactics but ill retract it because if we argue again so soon well just end up in bed of all the are you willing to chance it he said quietly he gave a slow satisfied nod when she subsided i thought not if it makes you feel any better neither am i so saying he sat and picked up the tools again why dont we just cross the whole business off as poor judgment you were the one who yes he looked up his gaze carefully neutral i was it was pride that had her stalking toward the table when she would have preferred to slink away and nurse her wounds and i suppose its asking too much to expect an apology i dont need one he said easily she snatched up a toaster part and flung it youre the one who did the manhandling hornblower with difficulty he checked himself if he touched her again now they would both regret it all right im sorry i kissed you sunny there was an edge to his voice as his eyes whipped up to hers i cant begin to tell you how sorry she spun around and stormed out of the room the apology hadnt mollified her in fact it had only inflated an angry hurt she picked up the heaviest book she could find and flung it across the room she kicked the sofa swore then streaked up the steps it didnt help none of it helped the fury was still roiling inside her and worse much worse was the need the rawedged need that tangled with it hed done that she thought slamming the door deliberately too she was sure of it hed managed to make her so angry to push her so close to the edge that shed responded irrationally when hed kissed her it wouldnt happen againthat she promised herself humiliation was nearly as bad as being outmaneuvered and hed managed to do both in a matter of hours he was going to have to pay for it throwing herself down on the bed she decided to spend the rest of the afternoon devising ways to make jacob hornblowers life a living hell chapter he never should have touched her jacob cursed himself then he found that it was much more convenient and much more satisfying to curse her shed started it after all hed known right from the start that she would make trouble for him there were some people in this worldin any world he thought bitterlywho were just born to complicate other peoples lives sunbeam stone was one of them in her looks in her voice in her gestures in her personality she had everything a woman needed to distract a man to aggravate him to the edge of reason and beyond she challenged him at every meeting those cool smiles that hot temper it was a combination he couldnt resist and he was sure she knew it when hed kissed herand god knew he hadnt meant toit had been like being shot into hyperspace without a ship how could he have known that damn sulky mouth of hers would be so potent hed never been attracted to passive women but what difference did that make he had no intention of being attracted to sunny he couldnt be he damn well wouldnt be no matter what tricks she pulled out of her twentiethcentury hat what had happened was completely her fault he decided shed taunted and tempted him shed wanted to confuse him gritting his teeth he admitted that shed done a brilliant job of it after she had and hed reacted as any normal man would shed looked at him with those big gorgeous eyes full of panic and passion oh she was a case all right his study of the twentieth century should have warned him that women had been much more bewildering back then and craftier hands in pockets he paced to the window to watch the swirling snow oh she was a bright one he mused sharp as venusian crystal and twice as deadly she knew something wasnt quite right about his story and she was determined to find out just what he was holding back and he was just as determined to keep her in the dark in a battle of wits he had every confidence his would prevail how much effort would it take to outwit a twentiethcentury woman after all he was more than two hundred years ahead of her on the evolutionary scale it was a pity she was so intriguing and so primitively attractive but he was a scientist and he had already calculated that any kind of involvement with her would shoot his equations to hell still she was right about one thing he decided they were stuck with each other the whole damn mountain was practically empty but for the two of them the way the snow was falling it was painfully obvious that they would be in each others way for days however irritating it might be for the time being he needed her he had to get around her or through her to get to his brother whatever it took he would get to cal turning he made a long slow study of the kitchen the first thing to be faced was that the cabin was too small for them to avoid each other he could go back to his ship but he preferred being here recording firsthand observations it would be easier to fight whatever attraction cal felt for this time and place if he understood it and his innate curiosity would never be satisfied on the ship so he would stay and if that made the pretty sunbeam uncomfortable so much the better his own discomfortand the kiss had caused him plentywould just have to be dealt with he was after all superior feeling more calm he went back to the table to reassemble the toaster as he worked he could hear the ceiling creak and groan above his head he smiled to himself when he realized that she was pacing on the second floor he bothered her and that was just fine maybe she would keep her distanceor at least stop daring him to do something they would both regret it was illogical to desire someone he didnt even like to fantasize about someone he could barely tolerate to ache for someone who annoyed him so consistently when the screwdriver slipped and mashed his thumb he cursed her again he wasnt going to get away with it she paced from wall to wall from window to door trying to work off steam the nerve of the man to grab her as if she were some mindless bimbo then reject her just as callously did he think did he really think he could vent his his sexual frustrations on her without compunction she had news for him no one absolutely no one treated her in that manner and lived to tell the tale shed been taking care of herself for too long men might pressure she pushed them aside they might seduce she resisted effortlessly they might beg she her smile bloomed beautifully at the image of jacob hornblower begging oh that would be a triumph she thought the enigmatic dr hornblower on his knees at her feet with a sigh she began pacing again it was a shame a damn shame that her standards didnt permit teasing or clichвђљd feminine ploys no matter how much of a jerk he was she had her ethics she was a modern woman one who stood on her own with or without a man one who thought her own thoughts and fought her own fights she was no delilah to use sex as a weapon but she wished and how she wished that once just this once she could ignore those ingrained principles and seduce him into a pitiful puddle of pleading hed used sex she thought kicking a shoe out of her path and wasnt that just like a man they liked to claim that it was women who lured and teased and taunted incensed she gave the hapless shoe a second vicious kick men the entire bloody species preferred to play the innocent bystander entrapped by the femme fatale hah if anyone dared to call sunny stone a femme fatale shed punch him right in the face hed forced himself on her well her stiffnecked honesty pushed her to admit that he hadnt used force for more than a fraction of a secondif at all before hed kissed her senseless she hated that the fact that shed melted like some weakkneed romantic heroine shed kissed him back too what was the word wantonly it made her wince one lousy kiss and shed been plastered all over him so she owed him for that as well the best way to pay him back she realized was to shoot straight for the ego as far as she could tell that was the biggest target a man offered a woman hiding in her room would only make him think heand what had happened between themmattered to her so she would go about her business and act as though nothing had happened he was still in the kitchen when she came down sunny turned on the stereo and adjusted the volume if it was loud enough conversation would be difficult if not impossible after adding a log to the fire she settled on the sofa with her books over an hour passed before he came out and went upstairs she studiously ignored him more from boredom than from appetite she went into the kitchen and fixed herself an enormous sandwich under other circumstances she would have offered to make one for her guest but the idea of him going hungry just made her own meal that much more palatable content she bundled into coat and boots to go outside and fill the bird feeder the short trip brought home to her the fact that her unwelcome company would be in her way for several days the snow was blinding falling in swirling sheets that covered her tracks almost as quickly as she made them there was wind behind it a nasty wind that raced keening through the trees and sent the pines roaring with snow up to the tops of her boots she lugged the bag of feed back to the shed catching her breath she let the storm blow around her she could see nothing but the power of it the anger of it it was magnificent annoyance faded all dark thoughts vanished as she stood with the wind battering her the snow slapping wet on her cheeks she felt the excitement and the peace that she rarely felt elsewhere though she never stayed in the mountains long though she always became restless and went off in search of noise and crowds there was no place she would rather be in a storm winter snow or summer thunder it was here alone that the force the energy the mystery could be appreciated a city covered with snow would soon dig itself out but the mountains were patient they would wait for sun and time as she stood with the wind wrapped around her like a wild relentless lover she wished she could take some piece of this with her wherever she went from the window he watched her she stood like some kind of winter goddess in the whirling snow hatless her coat flapping open she remained still heedless as the snow covered her hair and she was smiling cold colored her cheeks she seemed more than beautiful now she seemed untouchable and invincible he wondered as he looked down on her why he wanted her more at that moment than he had when she had been hot and passionate in his arms then she looked up as if she knew he was watching through the blowing curtain of snow their eyes met his hands balled into fists fists identical to the one that clenched in his gut she was no longer smiling despite the distance he felt the power ricochet back to him buckling his knees if he could have reached out for her then he would have taken her regardless of the consequences in that one look past present and future merged into one he saw his destiny then she shifted shaking the snow from her hair and the spell shattered he told himself she was only a woman a foolish one walking in a storm she would have no lasting effect on him but it was a long time after he heard her come inside before he went downstairs again she was sleeping on the sofa books piled at her feet and on the floor one of the exquisite throws was tossed over her despite the volume of the stereo she slept deeply nearby the fire blazed she didnt look invincible now jacob decided she looked disconcertingly serene he supposed it was foolish to notice how long her lashes were as they shadowed her cheeks how soft her mouth was when relaxed in sleep how her hair mussed from the wind shone in the firelight they were only physical attributes and in his time physical appearance could be altered simply and safely it made life more pleasant certainly to look at a beautiful woman but it was superficial totally superficial still he looked for a long time sunny woke like a shot when the music cut off the abrupt silence had her leaping out of sleep with eyes wide and curses on her tongue disoriented and irritable as she always was upon waking she stared around the darkened room the fire had burned down to a soft glow and shed little light though she didnt think she had slept long night had fallen and so she realized had a power line with a sigh she pushed herself from the sofa and groped her way across the room looking for matches with a candle in one hand and a pack of matches in the other she turned and walked into jacob at her quick squeal he brought his hands to her arms both to steady and to reassure its only me i know who it is she snapped infuriated that shed jolted what are you doing before or after the lights went out she could see him well enough silhouetted by the firelight to make out the smile its the storm what about it the muscles in her arms were tensed he had to resist the urge to slip his hands up the sleeves of her sweater and soothe them and stroke her skin it knocked out the power he hadnt let her go hed told himself to but his hands hadnt listened would you like me to fix it her laugh was quick and a bit unsteady she wished she could blame the power failure for her nerves but shed never been afraid of the dark until now its a little more complicated than a toaster the power company will get to it when they can he was sure he could juryrig something but he didnt mind the dark all right all right she thought letting out a long breath in the meantime she was alone with him added to the fact that she wasnt sure about his mental balance was the very real problem of being attracted to him one thing at a time she told herself and took a deliberate step back we have plenty of candles to prove it she lit the one she held in her hand it helped her confidence when she saw the flame hold steady and plenty of wood if youll put a couple of logs on the fire ill deal with getting us more light he watched the way the small flame flickered in her eyes she was nervous he realized and wished that didnt make her even more seductive sure sunny gathered every candle she could put her hands on too late she realized that one or two would have seemed rustic the dozen she had scattered through the room only added an impossibly romantic atmosphere stuffing the matches in her pocket she reminded herself that she wasnt affected by things like atmosphere you wouldnt know what time it is would you she asked him not exactly around six she sat on the arm of the sofa nearest the fire i slept longer than i thought now she was going to have to make the best of a bad situation so did you entertain yourself this afternoon i fixed the faucet it had taken more time and given him more trouble than hed anticipated but hed managed youre a regular harry homemaker arent you because it sounded sarcastic she smiled they really did only have each other at this point and alienating him wouldnt be wise i could fix some sandwiches she rose willing to be gracious if it kept her busy want a beer yeah thanks sunny took two of the candles into the kitchen and nearly relaxed before she realized hed followed her in i can manage this by myself she opened the refrigerator and swore when she remembered that the light wouldnt come on saying nothing jacob handed her a candle she shoved two beers at him he remembered how she had dealt with the bottles that morning and he was delighted when he found the same tool and popped the tops switch on the radio will you what the radio she repeated on the windowsill we might get a weather report he found a small plastic box he was grinning at it as he found the dial and turned on static mess with the tuner she advised him he was contemplating borrowing it and taking it back home mess with it you know fool with it see if you can come up with a station he stared at the little portable for a moment wondering how one fooled an inanimate object making sure sunnys back was to him he took the radio off the windowsill and shook it because that seemed stupid he began to turn dials the static faded in and out mustard or mayo what on your sandwich she said striving for patience do you want mustard or mayo it doesnt matter whatever youre having he found some tinny music that was almost audible how did people tolerate such unreliable equipment he wondered at home he had a portable unit that could give him the weather in paris a playbyplay of a ball game a traffic report from mars and a passable cup of coffee simultaneously this antique childs toy wasnt coming up with anything more than what sounded like a banjo playing in a wind tunnel let me try setting the sandwiches aside sunny snatched the radio from him in moments there was a blast of music its temperamental she explained its a machine he reminded her miffed a temperamental one satisfied she set it back on the counter then carried her sandwich and her beer to the table weather reports not much use anyway she applied herself to the sandwich i already know its snowing jacob picked up one of the potato chips she had piled beside the bread more to the point is to know when its going to stop speculation she shrugged as he joined her no matter how many satellites they put up there its still guesswork he opened his mouth to contradict her but thought better of it and bit into his sandwich instead does it bother you what being what phrase would she use being cut off not reallyat least not for a day or two after that i start to go crazy she winced wondering if that was the best choice of words how about you i dont like being closed in he said simply he had to smile when he heard the light tap of her foot on the floor he was making her nervous again he took an experimental swig of beer this is good he glanced around when a voice broke into the music to announce the weather the cheerful painfully breezy announcer carried on for several moments before getting to the mountains and you people way up in the klamath might as well snuggle up hope youve got your main squeeze with you cause it looks like youre in for a big one the white stuffs going to keep right on falling through tomorrow night expect about three feet you hardy souls with winds gusting up to thirty miles an hour brrr temperatures down to fifteen tonight not counting old mr wind chill bundle up baby and let looove keep you warm not very scientific jacob murmured sunny made a rude noise and scowled at the radio however its presented it means the same thing id better bring in some more wood ill get it i dont need you made the sandwiches he pointed out sipping more beer ill get the wood when were finished fine she didnt want him to do her any favors she ate in silence for a time watching him youd have been better off to wait until spring for what to come to see cal he took another bite of his sandwich he wasnt sure what it was but it was terrific apparently actually id planned to be here sooner almost a year sooner but it didnt work out its a shame your parents couldnt come with you you know to visit she saw something in his eyes then regret frustration anger she couldnt be sure it wasnt possible she refused absolutely to feel sorry for him my parents couldnt stand not seeing libby or me for so long the disapproval in her voice rubbed an already raw wound you have no conception of how the separation from cal has affected my family sorry but she moved her shoulders to show that she wasnt id just think if they were anxious to see him theyd have made the effort to do so the choice was his he pushed back from the table ill get the wood touchy touchy she thought as he started toward the door hey he rounded on her ready to fight what you cant go out without a coat its freezing i dont have one with me are all scientists so softheaded she muttered rising she went into a long cupboard i cant think of anything so stupid as to come into the mountains in january without a coat jacob took a deep breath and then said calmly if you keep calling me stupid im going to have to hit you she gave him a bland look im shaking here she tossed him a worn pea coat put that on the last thing i want is to have to treat you for frostbite as an afterthought she threw him a pair of gloves and a dark stocking cap you do have winters in philadelphia dont you his teeth gritted jacob struggled into the coat it wasnt cold when i left home he dragged the hat down over his ears oh well that certainly explains it she gave a snort of laughter when he slammed the door behind him he wasnt really crazy she thought a little dim maybe and so much fun to aggravate and if she aggravated him enough sunny mused she might just get some more information out of him she heard him cursing and didnt bother to muffle a laugh unless she missed her guess hed just dropped at least one log on his foot perhaps she should have offered him a flashlight but he deserved it wiping the grin from her face she went to the door to open it for him he was already coated with snow it was even clinging to his eyebrows giving him a fiercely surprised expression she bit down hard on her tongue and let him stomp across the kitchen his arms loaded with wood at the sound of logs crashing into the box she cleared her throat then calmly picked up her beer and his before joining him in the living room ill get the next load she told him solicitously you bet you will his foot was throbbing his fingers were numb and his temper was already lost how does anybody live like this like what she asked innocently here he was at his wits end he threw out his arms in a gesture that encompassed not only the cabin but also the world at large you have no power no conveniences no decent transportation no nothing if you want heat you have to burn wood wood for gods sake if you want light you have to rely on unstable electricity as for communication its a joke a bad one sunny was a city girl at heart but nobody insulted her family home her chin came up listen pal if i hadnt taken you in youd be up in the woods freezing like a popsicle and no one would have found you until the spring thaw so watch it overly sensitive he decided lifting a brow you cant tell me that you actually like it here her hands fisted and landed on her hips i like it here just fine if you dont weve got two doors take your pick his little excursion to the woodpile had convinced him that he didnt care to brave the elements neither did he care to swallow his pride he stood for a moment considering his choices without a word he picked up his beer sat and drank since sunny considered it a victory she joined him but she wasnt ready to give him a break youre awfully finicky for a guy who pops up on the doorstep without so much as a toothbrush excuse me i said youre awfully how do you know i dont have a toothbrush hed read about them now with fire glinting in his eyes he turned to her its an expression sunny said evading his question i simply meant that i wouldnt think that a man who travels with one change of clothes should be complaining about the accommodations how would you know what ive gotunless youve been going through my things you havent got any things sunny muttered knowing that once again shed opened her mouth before shed finetuned her brain she started to rise but he clamped a hand on her shoulder look i only went through your bag to seejust to see thats all she turned deciding a level look was the best defense how could i be sure you were who you said you were and not some maniac he kept his grip painfully firm and are you sure now he caught the quick flicker in her eyes and decided to exploit it there wasnt anything in my bag to tell you one way or the other was there maybe not she tried to shrug his hand off when it remained she balled one of her own into a fist and waited so for all you know i am a maniac he leaned closer until his face was an inch from hers until her eyes saw only his eyes until his breath mingled with her breath and there are all kinds of maniacs arent there sunny yes she had trouble getting the word past her lips it wasnt fear she wished it were it was something much more complicated much more dangerous than fear for a moment with the firelight flickering beside them the candles wavering the wind beating soft fists on the window she didnt care who he was all that mattered was that he was going to kiss her and more the fact that he would do more was in his eyes the image of rolling on the floor with him sprang into her mind a wild willful tangle of bodies a free frantic burst of passion it would be that way with him the first time and every time raging rivers quaking earth exploding planets such would love be with him and after the first time there would be no turning back she was certain as she had never been certain of anything that if there was a first time she would want him she would crave him as long as there was breath in her body his lips brushed hers it could hardly be called a kiss yet the potency of it sent shock waves streaking through her system and had warning bells screaming in her head she did the only thing a sensible woman could do under the circumstances she drove her clenched hand into his stomach his breath pushed out in a huff of pained surprise as he doubled over nearly falling in her lap she slipped to one side and sprang to her feet she was braced and ready for his next move youre the maniac he managed after hed wheezed some air into his lungs i have never in my life met anyone like you thanks she was nibbling on her lip again but she let her tensed arms drop to her sides you deserved that jt she held her ground as he slowly lifted his head and sent her a long killing look you were trying to intimidate me it had started out that way he was forced to admit but in the end when he had leaned toward her smelled her hair felt the soft silk of her lips it had had nothing to do with intimidation and everything to do with seduction his it wouldnt be hard he said after a moment to learn to detest you no i guess not because he was taking it better than shed anticipated she smiled at him i tell you whatsince we are family so to speak i do believe you by the way that youre cals brother i mean thanks finally he managed to straighten up thanks a lot dont mention it as i was saying since were sort of family why dont we call a truce its like thisif the weather keeps up were going to be trapped here together for several days now whos trying to intimidate whom she laughed then and decided to be friendly just laying my cards on the table if we keep throwing punches at each other were only going to get bruised i figure its not worth it he had to think about that and think hard i wouldnt mind going for two out of three youre a tough nut jt since he didnt know what to make of that description he kept silent i still vote for the truce at least until the snow stops i dont hit you anymore and you dont try to kiss me again deal he liked the part about her not hitting him anymore and hed already decided he wouldnt try to kiss her again he would damn well do it whenever he chose to he nodded deal excellent well celebrate the truce with another beer and some popcorn weve got an old popper in the kitchen we can make it over the fire sunny she paused candle in hand in the doorway he couldnt help but resent the way the flickering light flattered her im still not sure i like you thats okay she smiled im not sure i like you either chapter she might have called it rustic he might have called it primitive but there was something soothing peaceful and calming about popping corn over an open fire she seemed to have the hang of it he thought as she shook the longhandled box over the flames the scent was enough to make his mouth water as the kernels began to pop and batter the screened metal lid though he could have explained scientifically how the hard seeds exploded into fluffy white pieces it was more fun just to watch wed always make popcorn this way here she murmured watching the flames even in the summer when we were sweltering mom or dad would build a fire and wed fight over who got to hold the popper her lips curved at the memory you were happy here sure i probably would have gone on being happy here but i discovered the world what do you think of the world jt which one with a laugh she gave the popper an extra shake i should have known better than to ask an astrowhatever your minds probably in space half the time at least she sat crosslegged on the floor the firelight glowing on her face and hair that face he thought with its exquisite bones and angles was perfectly relaxed she was obviously taking the truce seriously rambling on as friendly as a longtime friend about whatever came to mind he sipped his beer and listened though he knew next to nothing about the movies and music she spoke of or the books some of the titles were vaguely familiar but he had spent very little of his time reading fiction hed touched on some twentiethcentury entertainment in his research but not enough to make him an expert in the areas sunny seemed so well versed in you dont like movies she asked at length i didnt say that you havent seen any of the flicks ive mentioned that have been popular in the last eighteen months he wondered what shed say if he told her that the last video hed seen had been produced in its just that ive been busy in the lab for quite a while she felt a tug of sympathy for him sunny didnt mind working and working hard but she expected plenty of time for fun dont they ever give you a break who the people you work for she switched hands and continued to shake the popper that made nun smile a little since for the past five years he had been in the position of calling his own shots and hiring his own people its more a matter of me being obsessed with the project ive been working on which is he waited a beat then decided that the truth couldnt hurt in fact he wanted to see her reaction time travel she laughed but then she saw his face and cleared her throat youre not joking no he glanced at the popper i think youre burning it oh she jerked it out of the flames and set it down on the hearth you really mean time travel like h g wells not precisely he stretched out his legs so that the fire warmed the soles of his feet time and space are relativein simple terms its a matter of finding the proper equations and implementing them sure e equals mc squared but really jt bopping around through time she shook her head obviously amused like mr peabody and sherman in the wayback machine who you obviously had a deprived childhood its a cartoon you know and this dog scientist he held up a hand his eyes narrowed to green slits a dog was a scientist in the cartoon she said patiently and he had this boy sherman never mind she added when she saw his expression its just that they would set the dates on this big machine the wayback exactly then they would travel back like to neros rome or arthurs britain fascinating entertaining it was a cartoon jt you cant really believe it he sent her a slow enigmatic smile do you only believe what you can see no she frowned using a hot pad to remove the lid from the popper i guess not then she laughed and sampled the popcorn maybe i do im a realist we really needed one in the family even a realist has to accept certain possibilities i suppose she took another handful and decided to get into the spirit of things okay so were in mr peabodys wayback machine where would you goor when i suppose i should say when would you go if you really could he looked at her sitting in the firelight laughter still in her eyes the possibilities are endless what about you i wonder she held the beer loosely in her hand as she considered i imagine libby would have a dozen places to go back to the aztecs the incas the mayans dad would probably want to see tombstone or dodge city and my mother well shed go where my father went to keep an eye on him he dipped into the popcorn i asked about you id go forward id want to see what was coming he didnt speak only stared into the fire a hundred maybe two hundred years in the future after all you can read history books and get a pretty good idea of what things were like before but after it seems to me it would be much more exciting to see just what weve made out of things the idea made her laugh up at him do they actually pay you to work on stuff like that i mean wouldnt it make more sense to figure out how to travel across town in say manhattan in under forty minutes during rush hour im free to choose my own projects must be nice she was mellow now relaxed and happy enough with his company it seems ive spent most of my life trying to figure out what i wanted to do im a terrible employee she admitted with a sigh its something about rules and authority im argumentative really she didnt mind his grin really but im so often right you see that its really hard to admit when im wrong sometimes i wish i was more flexible why the worlds full of people who give in maybe theyre happier she murmured its a shame the word compromise is so hard to swallow you dont like to be wrong either i make sure im not she laughed and stretched out on the rug maybe i do like you were going to have to tend this fire all night unless we want to freeze well take shifts she yawned and pillowed her head over her hands wake me up in a couple of hours and ill take over when he was certain she was asleep jacob covered her with the colorful blanket then left her by the fire upstairs it took him less than ten minutes to make some adjustments to the desktop computer and tie it in so that it would run off his mini unit the mini didnt have the memory banks of his ship model but it would be enough to make his report and answer the few questions he had engage computer a quiet neutral voice answered him engaged report hornblower jacob current date is january th a winter storm has caused me to remain in the cabin the structure runs off electric power typically unreliable in this era apparently the power is transmitted through overhead lines that are vulnerable during storms at approximately hours the power was cut off estimated time of repair working incomplete data i was afraid of that he paused for a moment thinking sunbeam stone is resourceful candleswax candlesare used for light wood is burned for heat it is of course insufficient and only accommodates a small area it is however he searched for a word pleasant it creates a certain soothing ambiance annoyed he cut himself off he didnt want to think of the way she had looked in the firelight as reported earlier stone is a difficult and aggressive female prone to bursts of temper she is also disarmingly generous sporadically friendly and the word desirable was on the tip of his tongue jacob bit it intriguing he decided further study is necessary however i do not believe she is an average woman of this time he paused again drumming his fingers on the desk computer what are the typical attitudes of women toward mating in this era working as soon as he had asked jacob opened his mouth to disengage but the computer was quick most typically physical attraction sometimes referred to as chemistry is required emotional attachment ranging from affection to love is preferred by percent of females single encounters often called onenight stands were no longer fashionable in this part of the twentieth century subjects preferred commitment from sexual partners romance was widely accepted and desired define romance working to influence by personal attention flattery or gifts also synonymous with love love affair an attachment between male and female typified by the atmosphere of dim lighting quiet music flowers accepted romantic gestures include thats enough jacob rubbed his hands over his face and wondered if he was going crazy he had no business wasting time asking the computer such unscientific questions he had less business contemplating a totally unscientific relationship with sunny stone he had only two purposes for being where he was the first and most important was to find his brother the second was to gather as much data as possible about this era sunny stone was data and she couldnt be anything else but he wanted her it was unscientific but it was very real it was also illogical how could he want to be with a woman who annoyed him as much as she amused him why should he care about a woman he had so little in common with centuries separated them her world while fascinating in a clinical sense frustrated the hell out of him she frustrated the hell out of him the best thing to do was to get back to his ship program his computers and go home if it werent for cal he would do so he wanted to think it was only cal that stopped him meticulously he disengaged the computer and pocketed his mini when he returned downstairs she was still sleeping moving quietly he put another log on the fire then sat on the floor beside her hours passed but he didnt bother to wake her he was used to functioning on little or no sleep for more than a year his average workday had run eighteen hours the closer he had come to the final equations for time travel the more he had pushed and he had succeeded he thought as he watched the flames eat the wood he was here of course even with his meticulous computations he had come several months too late cal was married of all things and if sunny was to be believed he was happy and settled it would be that much more difficult for jacob to make him see reason but he would make him see it he had to see it jacob told himself it was as clear as glass a man belonged in his own time there were reasons purposes beyond what science could do there was a pattern if a man chose to break that pattern the ripple effects on the rest of the universe couldnt be calculated so he would take his brother back to where they both belonged and cal would soon forget the woman called libby just as jacob was determined to forget sunbeam stone she stirred then with a soft sighing sound that tingled along his skin despite his better judgment he looked down and watched her wake her lashes fluttered open and closed as exotic as butterfly wings in the shadowed light her eyes dazed with sleep were huge and dark she didnt see him but stared blindly into the flickering flame as she slowly stretched her long lean body muscle by muscle the bulky purple sweater shifted over her curves his mouth went dry his heartbeat accelerated he would have cursed her but he lacked the strength at that moment she was so outrageously beautiful that he could only sit tensed and pray for sanity she let out a little moan he winced she shifted onto her back lifting her arms over her head then up to the ceiling for the first time in his life he actively wished for a drink at last she turned her head and focused on him why didnt you wake me her voice was low throaty jacob was certain he could feel his blood drain to the soles of his feet i it was ridiculous but he could barely speak i wasnt tired thats not the point she sat up and said crankily were in this together so he didnt think later when he had time to analyze he would tell himself it was reflexthe same involuntary reflex that makes a man swallow when water is poured down his throat it was not deliberate it was not planned it was certainly not wise he pulled her against him dragging one hand through her hair before closing his mouth over hers she bucked both surprise and anger giving her strength but he only tightened his hold it was desperation this time a sensation he could not remember ever having felt for a woman it was taste her or die she struggled to cling to her anger as dozens of sensations fought for control of her delight desire delirium she tried to curse him but managed only a moan of pleasure then her hands were in his hair clenching and her heart was pounding in one quick movement he drew her onto his lap and drove her beyond his breath was ragged as was hers his mouth frantic his hands quick left without choice she answered as insistent as insatiable as he a log broke apart sparks flew to dance on stone the wind gusted pushing a puff of smoke into the room she heard only the urgent groan that slipped from his mouth into hers was this what she had been searching for the excitement the challenge the glory heedlessly she gave herself to it let the power swamp her the taste of her seemed to explode inside him over and over hot pungent lusty it wasnt enough the more he took the more he needed dragging her head back he found her throat the long slender line of it enticing him the warm seductive flavor of it bewitching him he skimmed his lips over the curve of it letting his tongue and his teeth toy with her skin it was still not enough as the firelight played over her face he slipped his hands under the bulky sweater to find her her skin brought him images of rose petals of heated satin there was trembling as his hand closed over her breast from her from him with his eyes on hers and shadows dancing between them he lowered his mouth once more it was like sinking into a dream not a soft misty one but one full of sound and color and as he sank deeper she wrapped herself around him her hands searched as his did under his sweater along the ridges of muscles as his lips began to roam over her face she let her eyes close once again and her heart always so strong and valiant was lost love poured into her like a revelation it left her gasping and clinging it had her lips heating against his her body liquefying her hands always capable slid helplessly down his arms helplessly it was that which had her stiffening against him pulling back resisting this couldnt be love it was absurd and dangerous to think it could be jacob stop stop he closed his teeth none too gently over her chin yes stop he could feel the change the frustrating withdrawal of her while his body was still humming why because i in a calculated movement he skimmed his fingers down her spine playing them over vulnerable nerves he watched as her eyes glazed and her head fell back limp i want you sunny and you want me yes what was he doing to her she lifted a hand in protest then dropped it weakly and let it rest against his chest no dont do that do what whatever youre doing she was trembling now shuddering completely vulnerable he cursed himself it was a shock to realize that when she was defenseless he was hampered by ethics fine he grasped her hips and set her back on the floor shaken she hugged her knees to her chest she felt as though shed been plucked out of a furnace and tossed into ice this shouldnt be happening and it certainly shouldnt be happening so fast it is happening he told her and its foolish to pretend otherwise she glanced up as he rose to feed the fire the heat still pumped out of the logs a few of the candles they had left lit were guttering out outside the window there was a lessening of the darkness so dawn had to be breaking beyond the storm the wind still whooshed at the windows she had forgotten all that all that and more when she had been in his arms there had been no storm except the one raging inside her there had been no fire but her own passions the one promise she had made herself never to lose control over a man had been broken its easy for you isnt it she said with a bitterness that surprised her he looked back to study her no it wasnt easy for him it should be but it wasnt and he was baffled by it why should it be complicated the question was as much for himself as for her i dont make love with strangers she sprang to her feet with a fierce wish for coffee and solitude leaving him she marched into the kitchen and plucked a soft drink from the refrigerator shed take her caffeine cold he waited a moment going over what the computer had told him the physical attraction was certainly there and as much as he detested the idea his emotions were involved it did no good to be angry she was obviously reacting normally given the situation and it was he who was out of step it was a sobering thought but one that had to be faced but he still wanted her and now he intended to pursue her logically his success factor would increase if he pursued her in a manner she would expect from a typical twentiethcentury man jacob blew out a long breath he didnt know precisely what that might entail but he thought he understood the first step it was doubtful that much had changed in any millennium when he walked into the kitchen she was staring out the window at the monotonously falling snow sunny oh it went against the grain i apologize i dont want your apology jacob cast his eyes at the ceiling and prayed for patience what do you want nothing it amazed her that she was on the brink of tears she never cried she hated it considered it a weak embarrassing experience sunny always preferred a screaming rage to tears but she felt tears burning behind her eyes now and stubbornly fought them back just forget it forget what happened or forget the fact that im attracted to you either or both she turned then though her eyes were dry they were overbright and they made him acutely uncomfortable it doesnt matter obviously it does it shouldnt but there seemed to be nothing he could do to change it if she kept looking at him like that he would have to touch her again in selfdefense he stuffed his hands in his pockets maybe weve gotten our codes mixed hurt was temporarily blocked by bafflement i dontdo you mean we got our signals crossed i suppose tired all over again she dragged a hand through her hair i doubt it well just call it a temporary lapse and do what she wished she knew look jt were both adults all we have to do is act like it i thought we were he tried a smile im sorry i upset you it wasnt completely your fault she managed to smile back at him circumstances were alone here the powers out candle and firelight she shrugged and felt miserable anybody could get carried away if you say so he took a step forward she took a step back the pursuit jacob decided was going to require strategy but i am attracted to you even without candlelight she started to speak discovered she didnt know what she wanted to say and dragged her hands through her hair again you should get some sleep im going for more wood all right sunbeam she turned back shooting him a look of amusement and exasperation at his use of her full name i enjoyed kissing you he told her very much muttering under her breath she bundled into her coat and escaped outside the day passed slowly sunny might have wished he would sleep longer but it hardly mattered awake or asleep he was there as long as he was he intruded at times though she tried to bury herself in her books she was so painfully aware of him that she nearly groaned he readvoraciously sunny thoughtnovel after novel from the bookshelf activity was almost completely confined to the living room and the warmth of the fire which they took turns feeding at lunchtime they fell back on cold sandwiches though she did manage to boil water over the fire for tea they spoke to each other only when it was impossible not to by evening they were both wildly restless edgy from confinement and from the fact that both of them wondered what the day would have been like if they had spent it under a blanket together rather than at opposite ends of the room he paced to one window she paced to another she poked at the fire he leafed through yet another book she went for a bag of cookies he went for fresh candles have you ever read this sunny glanced over it was the first word they had spoken to each other in an hour what jane eyre oh sure it was a relief to have a conversation again she handed him the bag of cookies as a peace offering what did you think of it i always like reading about the mannerisms of an earlier century they were so stringent and puritanical back then with all that passion boiling underneath the civilized veneer he had to smile do you think so sure and of course its beautifully written and wonderfully romantic she sat with her legs hooked over the arm of a chair her eyes a little sleepy and her scentdamn hereverywhere the plain penniless girl capturing the heart of the bold brooding hero he gave her a puzzled look thats romantic of course then theres windswept moors and painful tragedy sacrifice they did a terrific production of it on pbs a few years ago did you see it no he set the book aside still puzzled my mother has a copy at home she loves to read novels thats probably because she needs to relax after being in court all day probably what does your father do this and that suddenly his family seemed incredibly far away he likes to garden so does mine herbs naturally she gestured toward her empty tea cup but he putters around with flowers too when we were little he grew vegetables right outside the kitchen its practically all we ate which is why i avoid them now he tried to imagine it and simply couldnt what was it like growing up here it seemed natural she rose idly to poke at the fire then sat on the couch beside him forgetting for a moment how restless the storm was making her i guess i thought everyone lived like we did until we went to the city and i saw the lights the crowds the buildings for me it was as if someone had broken open a kaleidoscope and handed me all the colors we would always come back here and that was fine with a half yawn she sank back into the cushions but i always wanted to get back to all that noise nothing changes much here and thats nice because you can always depend on it but theres always something new in the city i guess i like progress but youre here now a selfimposed penance in a way for what she moved her shoulders its a long story what about you are you a city boy yearning for the peace of the country he glanced deliberately out the window no she laughed and patted his hand so here we are two city dwellers stuck in the wilds of the northwest want to play cards his mood brightened instantly poker youre on they rose at the same time bumped brushed he took her arm automatically then held on he tensed as she did it wasnt possible to do otherwise it was possible barely to prevent himself from lifting his other hand to her face shed done nothing to enhance it today there was no trace of cosmetics her mouth full pouty exciting was naked with an effort he brought his eyes from it and to hers youre very beautiful sunbeam it hurt to breathe she was terrified to move i told you not to call me that sometimes it fits ive always thought beauty was just an accident of genes or something accomplished through skill you make me wonder youre a very strange man hornblower he smiled a little you dont know the half of it he stepped back wed better play cards good idea she let out a quiet relieved breath as she took the deck from a drawer if she had a little time alone she might just figure out what it was about him that jolted her system poker by firelight she dropped onto the floor now thats romance he sat opposite her is it prepare to lose but he won consistently continually until she began to watch him through narrowed eyes for lack of anything else they were playing for cookies and his pile of chocolate chips kept growing you eat all those youre going to get fat he merely smiled no i wont i have an excellent metabolism yeah i just bet you do with a body like that hed have to two pair queens and fours mmm he set his cards down full house tens over fives sonofa she broke off scowling as he raked in the chips look i dont want to sound like a sore loser but youve won ten out of twelve hands must be my lucky night he picked up the cards and riffled them or something he merely lifted a brow at her tone poker is as much a science as physics she snatched up a cookie just deal hornblower are you going to eat your ante miffed she tossed it into the pot if i dont eat several times a day i get cranky is that whats wrong with you im basically a very nice person no youre not he grinned as he dealt the cards but i like you anyway i am nice she insisted keeping her face carefully bland when she spotted two aces in her hand ask anybodyexcept my last two supervisors open for two jacob obliged her by adding his two cookies to the pot he liked her this waywarily friendly competitive relaxed but ready to pounce on any infraction he supposed it didnt hurt that the firelight painted interesting shadows that played over those fabulous cheekbones he checked himselfand his hand this seemed as good a time as any to find out more about her what did you do before you came here to decide to be a lawyer she made a face then drew three cards i sold underwear ladies lingerie to be specific she glanced up waiting for the disdain and was mollified when she didnt see it i have a drawerful of great stuff i got on discount oh really he thought about that for a moment wondering just what her idea of great stuff consisted of yeah she was delighted to see that shed drawn another ace but she kept her voice even the problem was this particular supervisor wanted you to take the money box the silks and keep your mouth shuteven when the customer was making an obvious mistake he tried to imagine her keeping her mouth shut he couldnt such as such as the pleasantly plump lady who was going to torture herself in a size eight merry widow bet three and raise it two what happened well you open your mouth to make a gentle suggestion and before you know it youve got a pink slip youd look nice in pink she giggled and raised him two more no a pink slip the boot the ax canned when he still looked puzzled she elaborated your services are no longer required oh terminated right his term seemed to describe the injustice of it perfectly who needs it you dont she smiled at him thanks three aces pal read em and weep straight flush he countered and had her sputtering while he piled up more cookies you dont have the temperament to work for someone else so ive been told she muttered several times she was down to her last five cookies her luck sunny thought had been on the down side too long but if its a matter of learning how to adjust or learning how not to eat im going to have to go with the first i dont like being poor i imagine you could do whatever you wanted to do if you really wanted to do it maybe and that had always been the problem she had no idea what she wanted she dealt the hand and deciding to be reckless went for an inside straight and ended up with trash a bluff was always better than a fold she thought pushing her miserly pile of cookies into the pot he cleaned her out with a pair of deuces here because winning always put him in a good mood he offered her a cookie have one on me thanks a lot she bit into it your luck seems to be on tonight apparently he was feeling a bit reckless himself she looked a great deal more appetizing than the cookies we could play one more hand for what if i win you make love with me surprised but determined to keep her poker face intact she swallowed the bite of cookie and if i win i make love with you popping the rest of the cookie into her mouth she studied him as she chewed it would almost be worth it she mused to see his face if she took him up on it almost worth it she reminded herself either way she would win and she would lose i think ill pass she said lightly rising she walked over to the sofa spread herself out on it and went to sleep chapter a blast of music ripped sunny out of a dead sleep and had her rearing up when lights blinded her she groaned and tossed a hand over her eyes in selfdefense who ordered the party she asked as tina turner roared out rock at top volume jacob who had dozed off in front of the fire simply pulled the blanket over his head whenever he slept he preferred to do it like the dead swearing she pushed herself up off the couch she had stumbled halfway to the stereo before it dawned on her power she shouted then immediately raced over to sit on jacob she heard a muffled grunt from under the blanket and bounced gleefully up and down weve got power jt lights music hot food when he only grunted again she poked him wake up you slug dont you know you can be shot for sleeping on sentry duty i wasnt sleeping i was bored into catatonia well snap out of it pal were back on the circuit she yanked the cover off his face and grinned when he scowled at her you need a shave she observed then in her delight she gave him a loud smacking kiss between the eyes how about a hamburger he got a bleary look at her face all smiles and mussed hair to his disgust he felt his body responding it cant be more than six in the morning so what im starving make mine rare he pulled the blanket over his face again uhuh you have to help ruthlessly she ripped the blanket off him again up and at em soldier this time he opened only one eye up and at what its an expression hornblower she shook her head just how long were you in that lab not long enough or entirely too long if all it took to arouse him was a skinny woman sitting on his chest i cant get up when youre sitting on me besides i think you broke my ribs nonsense im ten pounds underweight you wouldnt think so from here too cheerful to be annoyed she scrambled up took a firm grip on his forearm and after some pulling and tugging dragged him to his feet you can make the french fries i can sure to demonstrate her confidence in him she kept her hand in his and pulled him into the kitchen everythings in the freezer god its cold in here she rubbed the bottom of one stockinged foot on the top of the other here she tossed him a bag of frozen fries over her shoulder you just dump some on a cookie sheet and stick them in the oven right he thought he could figure out the workings of the oven but he hadnt a clue as to what a cookie sheet might look like pans are down there she gestured vaguely in the direction of a cabinet while she contemplated the package of hamburger the meats frozen he pointed out yeah well well have sloppy joes which are delicious she assured him whistling along with the music she began to rattle pots cooking was far down on her list of favorite pastimes but when push came to shove she was willing to give it her best shot here use this she handed him a long thin piece of metal blackened by heat the cookie sheet jacob surmised he went to work i dont suppose theres a possibility of coffee sure i keep a stash still whistling she dumped the chunk of frozen meat in a pot and set it on low in moments she had water on to boil and cups waiting heat hot water real food she did a quick little tap dance before digging into a bag of potato chips you dont appreciate the little things until you cant have them she said with her mouth full i dont know how people managed before electricity imagine having to heat water over an open fire it must have taken forever jacob was watching the electric ring slowly turn red under the kettle amazing he agreed and contemplated just eating the coffee grounds dry those fries wont cook unless you put them in the oven yeah he wished she wouldnt watch him as he studied the dials the bake setting seemed safe enoughunless they were supposed to be broiled he would have given a year of his life for the nutritional center in his lab spend much time in the kitchen sunny asked from behind him no who would have guessed with a cluck of her tongue she turned the oven on then popped the tray inside takes about ten maybe fifteen seconds i love an optimist minutes because she understood what it was like to wake up ready to chew glass she patted his cheek why dont you go have a shower youll feel better most of this should come together by the time youre finished thanks as he made his way upstairs he figured it was the nicest thing shed done for him so far he spent a great deal of time cursing the ridiculously archaic workings of her shower but she was right he did feel better when hed accomplished it using his ultrasound he rid himself of his beard then he took his daily dose of fluoratyne for his teeth and curious poked inside the mirrored cabinet over the sink it was a scientific treasure trove lotions potions creams powders a glance at the safety razor made him shudder the toothbrush made him grin he saw little puffs of white that appeared to be cotton thin brushes tiny pots filled with vividly colored powder there was a cream with an exotic name when he opened the top and sniffed it was as if sunny had joined him in the small steamy room he made quick work of putting it back on the shelf there were pills a cursory glance showed him that she had them for headaches body aches head colds chest colds he would make a note to take back a few samples there was a small plastic case that held a circle of tiny pills that werent marked at all since they were half gone he assumed they were something she took regularly that concerned him he didnt like to think that she was ill replacing them he wondered how he might ask her about her medication he started downstairs then simply followed the scents he didnt know what she could have done with the hunk of frozen meat but it smelled like heaven and there was coffee no perfume could have been sweeter she handed him a cup as he walked in the door thanks its okay i know how it feels he sipped giving her a clinical study over the rim her eyes were clear and her color was good she looked perfectly healthy in fact he couldnt remember ever having seen anyone healthier or more alluring when you look at me like that i feel like a germ under a microscope sorry i was just going to ask how you felt a little stiff a lot hungry but basically okay she tilted her head how about you fine i had a headache he said suddenly inspired i took some of your pills okay the ones in the little blue case werent marked her eyes widened rolled then filled with laughter i dont think theyd do you much good but you need them this time she closed her eyes and shook her head and he calls himself a scientist yeah you could say i need them better safe than sorry right baffled but losing ground he nodded right then lets eat she had plates by the range with buns open on them using a generous hand she scooped the saucy meat into them tossed a heap of fries beside it and was done she didnt speak again until shed worked her way through half the meal he watched her dump a stream of white crystal from a pottery tube on her potatoes he shook some on his own experimentally salt he discovered the real thing though the taste was wonderful he resisted the temptation to use more and wondered about her blood pressure if he could have figured a way he would have popped her into the medilab on the ship for a checkup i guess were going to live he wasnt sure what he was eating but she was right again it was delicious it stopped snowing yeah i noticed listen i hate to say it but im glad you were here id have hated to be here alone the last couple of days youre pretty selfsufficient but its better when you have somebody to fight with i never asked do you plan to hang around until cal and libby get back it could be weeks i came to see him ill wait she nodded wishing his answer hadnt relieved her she was getting entirely too used to his company i guess you must be in a position to take as much time off as you like you could say that time is exactly what i do have how long are you staying im not sure its too late to get into school this semester i thought i might write to some colleges maybe ill try the east coast it would be a change she sent him a quick hesitant smile how would i like philadelphia i think you would he wondered how to describe it to her so that she would understand its beautiful the historic district is very well preserved the liberty bell ben franklin all that yes some things last no matter what else changes though it had never mattered much to him before the parks are very green and shady in the summer theyre full of children and students the traffics miserable but thats all part of it from the top of some of the buildings you can see the entire city the movement the old and the new you miss it yes more than id imagined but he was looking at her seeing only her id like to show it to you id like that too maybe we can talk cal and libby into flying out you could have a real family reunion she saw his expression change and instinctively laid a hand over his did i say something wrong no youre angry with him sunny murmured its personal but she wasnt going to be put off he wasnt the snarling idiot she had first assumed him to be he was just confused if there was one trait she shared equally with her sister it was the inability to turn away a stray jt you must see how unfair it is to resent cal for falling in love and getting married for starting a life here its not that simple of course it is this time she promised herself she would not lose her temper theyre both adults and theyre certainly able to make up their own minds besides well theyre wonderful together he sent her a silent cynical look that infuriated her they are ive seen them with each other you havent no he nodded i havent thats nobodys fault but she caught herself ground her teeth and went on more calmly what im trying to say is that i might not have known cal before he became part of the family but i know when someones happy and he is as for libbyhe does something for her no one else ever has shes always been so shy so easily pushed into the background but with cal she just glows maybe its not the easiest thing to accept that someone else is the best thing that ever happened to a person you lovebut you have to accept it when its true i dont have anything against your sister or if he did he intended to keep it to himself for the time being but i intend to talk to cal about the change hes made in his life you really are bullheaded he considered the description and decided it was apt enough yes he smiled at her delighted by the sulky mouth the lifted chin id say we both are at least i dont go around poking my nose into other peoples affairs not even pleasantly plump women who want to torture themselves into what was ita merry widow that was entirely different with a sniff she pushed her plate away i may be cynical but even i believe in love i never said i didnt oh really her lips curved because she was sure she had backed him into a corner then you wont interfere if you see that cal and libby are in love if they are i hardly could could i and if theyre not he gestured palm up then well see she steepled her fingers measured him i could always send you back into the forest let you freeze in your sleeping bag but you wont he toasted her with his coffee cup because underneath the prickly hide youre basically kindhearted i could change no you couldnt people dont as a rule abruptly intense he leaned forward to take her hand it was a gesture he didnt make often and one that he couldnt resist at that moment sunny i dont want to hurt your sister or you but you will if were in your way yes he turned her hand over thoughtfully it was narrow and surprisingly soft and delicate for one that packed such a punch you have strong family feelings so do i my parents theyve tried to understand cals decision but its difficult for them very difficult but theyve only to see him for themselves to understand i cant explain he shifted his eyes from their joined hands to hers i wish i could more than i can tell you are you in trouble she blurted out what are you in trouble she repeated tightening her fingers on his with the law or something interested he kept his hand in hers her eyes were huge and drenched with concern for him he couldnt remember ever being more touched why would you think so the way youve come here i guess the way you havent come before and you act i dont know how to explain you just seem so out of place maybe i am it should have been amusing but he didnt smile if he hadnt been so sure he would regret it he would have pulled her into his arms and just held on im not in trouble sunny not the way you mean and you havent been she searched for the most delicate way to approach the subject ill ill baffled he studied her the light dawned slowly you think ive been now he did smile and surprised them both by bringing her hand to his lips no i havent been ill physically or otherwise ive just been busy when she tried to draw her hand away he held on are you afraid of me pride had always been her strongest suit why should i be good question you wondered if i was he gestured again unbalanced but you let me stay you even fed me the uncharacteristic gentleness in his voice made her uncomfortable id probably have done the same for a sick dog its no big deal i think it is when she pushed away from the table he rose with her sunbeam i told you not to there are times when its irresistible thank you she was more than uncomfortable now she was unnerved its okay forget it i dont think so gently his thumb stroked over her knuckles tell me if i had said i was in trouble would you have helped she tossed her head carelessly i dont know it would depend i think you would he took both her hands and held them until she was still simple kindness especially to someone away from home is very precious and very rare i wont forget she didnt want to feel close to him to be drawn to him but when he looked at her like this with such quiet tenderness she went weak there was nothing more frightening than weakness fine fighting panic she shook her hands free then you can return the favor and do the dishes im going for a walk ill go with you i dont you said you werent afraid of me im not she let out a longsuffering breath all right then come on the moment she opened the door the cold stole her breath the wind had died down and the sun was fighting through the layers of high clouds but the air was like brittle ice it would clear her head sunny told herself for a moment in the kitchen with him looking so intently into her eyes shed felt as though she didnt know what shed felt she didnt want to it was enough to be free to walk though the snow was up to her knees another hour of confinement and shed have gone mad perhaps that was what had happened to her in there with him a moment of madness its wild isnt it she stood in what had been the backyard and looked out on acres of solid white the dying wind moaned through the trees and sent powdery snow drifting ive always liked it best in the winter because if youre going to be alone you might as well be completely alone i forgot the bird food hang on she turned wading through the snow he thought she moved more like a dancer now than an athlete graceful despite the encumbrances it worried him to realize that hed been content to watch her for hours in a moment she was trudging back dragging an enormous burlap sack what are you doing going to feed the birds she was out of breath but still moving this time of year they need all the help they can get he shook his head let me do it im very strong yes i know let me do it anyway he took the sack braced put his back into it and began to haul it across the snow it gathered snowand weightwith every step i thought you werent a nature lover that doesnt mean id let them starve and shed promised libby he hauled the bag another foot couldnt you just dump it out if a things worth doing its worth doing well yeah ive heard that one she stopped by a tree and standing on a stump began to fill a big woodandglass house with seed from the sack there we go she brushed seed from her hands want me to carry it back ill do it why any selfrespecting bird would want to hang around here in the middle of nowhere i cant understand were here she called out as he hauled the sack across the snow i cant understand that either she grinned at his back and then not being one to waste an opportunity she began to ball snow she had a goodsize pile of ammunition when he came out again and she sent the first one sailing smack into his forehead bullseye he wiped snow out of his eyes youve already lost at one game that was poker she picked up another ball weighed it this is war and war takes skill not luck he dodged the next throw swearing when he nearly overbalanced then caught the next one in the chest dead center i should tell you i was the top pitcher on my softball team in college i still hold the record for strikeouts the next one smacked into his shoulder but he was prepared in a move she had to admire he came up with a stinging fastball that zoomed in right on the letters hed pitched a few himself but he didnt think he would mention that hed been captain of the intergalactic softball team three years running not bad hornblower she sent out two catching him with the second on the dodge she had a mean curve and she was pleased to note that she hadnt lost her touch snow splattered all over his coat one particularly wellthrown ball nearly took off his hat before her pile began to dwindle she had him at eight hits to two and was getting cocky it didnt occur to her that he had closed half the distance between them when he took one full in the face she doubled over with laughter then she shrieked when he caught her under the arms and lifted her off her feet good aim bad strategy he commented before he dropped her face first in the snow she rolled over spitting out snow i still won not from where im standing with a goodnatured shrug she held out a hand he hesitated she smiled the moment he clasped her hand she threw her weight back and had him flying into the drift beside her what does it look like now handtohand he grasped her by the shoulders they only sank deeper snow worked its way cold and wet down the collar of his borrowed coat he found it and the way her body twisted and turned against his impossibly stimulating she was laughing kicking up snow as she tried to pin him on the icy mat breathless she managed a half nelson and she nearly had the call when she felt herself flying over his shoulder she landed with a thump half buried and lay there for a second dragging in air nice move she panted then she dived at him again she scissored dipped and managed to slither out of his hold working fast she twisted until she was halfsitting halflying on his back using her weight she dunked his face in the snow say uncle he said something a great deal ruder and she laughed so hard she nearly lost her grip come on jt a real man admits it when hes licked he could have beaten her he thought in disgust as his face numbed but twice when hed tried for a hold his hand had skimmed over particularly interesting curves it had broken his concentration two out of three he mumbled if we try for two out of three well freeze to death taking his grunt for agreement she helped him turn over not bad for a scientist if we took it indoors you wouldnt have a chance but he was winded the point is i came out on top he lifted a brow in a manner of speaking she only grinned i wish you could see your face even your eyelashes are white so are yours he lifted a gloved hand that was already coated with snow and rubbed it on her face cheat whatever works exhausted he let his hand drop again he didnt know the last time hed been takenor when hed enjoyed it so much wed better get some more wood she braced a hand to get up slipped and landed with a thump on his chest sorry its all right ive got a few ribs left his arms had come around her his face was close it was a mistake she knew to stay this way even for a moment but she didnt move and then she didnt think it was the most natural thing in the world for her to lower her lips to his they were cool and firm and everything she wanted kissing him was like diving headfirst into a cold mountain lake thrilling exhilarating and risky she heard her own sound of pleasure quick and quiet before she threw what was left of caution to the winds and deepened the kiss she winded him weakened him loss of control meant nothing control was meant to be given up in passion but this this was different as her lips heated his he felt both will and strength drain away there was a mist in his brain as thick and as white as the snow they lay in and he could think of nothing and no one but her the women who had come before her were nothing shadows phantoms when her mouth slid agilely over his he understood that there would be no women after her she had in one heady instant taken over his life surrounded it invaded it consumed it shaken he brought his hands to her shoulders prepared determined to hurl her aside but his fingers only tightened and his need only grew it was like a rage in him she could feel it it was building in her as well a fury a driving hunger and his mouth his mouth alone was dragging her over the rocky border between heaven and hell so close she thought that she could feel the flames licking at her skin tempting her to tumble recklessly into the fire for it would be all brimstone and heat with him and she was afraid very afraid that she would never be satisfied with less she lifted her head an inch then two she was amazed to find her mind spinning and her breath uneven it had only been a kiss she reminded herself a kiss however passionate didnt alter lives still she wanted distance and quickly so that she could convince herself she was the same person she had been before it we really have to get that wood she managed suddenly she was terrified that she wouldnt be able to stand it wouldnt do her ego a bit of good to have to crawl back to the house cautiously she rolled away from him then using every ounce of will she possessed she dragged herself to her feet she made a production out of brushing the snow from her coat and wished he would say something anything look wary she turned but he was only pointing to the feeder where a few hardy birds were enjoying breakfast it helped her relax a little well ive done my duty by them because she was suddenly and brutally aware of the cold she gave herself a quick shake im going in she waded across the snow they didnt speak again as they gathered wood as they tromped snow from their boots or as they carried the logs to the woodbox sunny banked down an urge for a steaming cup of tea she wanted to be alone she wanted to think im going up for a shower feeling miserably awkward she watched him toss logs on the fire fine she made a face at his back fine he waited until he heard her climb the stairs before he straightened the woman was scrambling his brain he decided it was highly probable that he was still disoriented from the trip that was why she was having such a profound effect on him all he needed was a little more time to adjust data or no data it would be best if he took that time aboard ship he took a long thoughtful look at the cabin still hed promised to do the dishes it would be an interesting experience to try his hand at it upstairs sunny stripped off layers of clothes letting each item fall carelessly to the floor naked she turned the shower on letting it run until the hot water was steaming she winced as she stepped under it then let out a long lazy sigh better she told herself it was certainly a better way of getting her blood moving than kissing jacob no it wasnt she laid her forehead against the wall of the shower and with her eyes closed let the water rain over her maybe shed been a little crazy when shed kissed him but shed never felt more alive she couldnt blame him not this time she had made the move she had looked into his eyes and known he was the one yet how could he be she barely knew him was far from convinced she trusted him half the time she was sure she disliked him but but she thought again the other half of the time she was afraid she was falling in love with him it was completely irrational undeniably foolish and totally genuine all she had to do was figure out what to do about it pouring shampoo into her palm she tried to think she was a practical woman as far back as her memory took her she had been able to take care of herself problems even emotional ones were meant to be surmounted if she was falling in love she would deal with it the trick was not to do anything rash caution common sense and control sunny decided she lathered her skin lavishly she would keep a practical distance from jacob until she got to know him better until she was more certain of her feelings it made perfect sense more confident now she turned under the spray and let the water sluice the suds from her once she had determined her own feelings she would work on his there was no denying he was a strange sort of man interesting certainly but different in ways she had yet to fully figure out she could handle him after turning off the water she slicked a hand down her hair she had always been able to handle men very satisfactorily in this case she just had to handle herself first satisfied she kicked her clothes out of the way dry she wrapped a towel around her and stepped out into the hall hed enjoyed doing the dishes it was just the sort of mindless chore hed needed to relax his mind and his body the plastic squeeze bottle marked dishwashing liquid claimed to contain real lemon juice he took a sniff of his hands and found the lingering scent pleasant as soon as he got back to the ship he was going to make a report on it and the task had given him time to put his reaction to sunny in perspective being attracted to her was natural even elemental but he was intelligent enough to control certain primal urges particularly when acting on them would cause incredible complications she was beautiful desirable but she was also impossible the idea of pursuit had been a bad one he was well aware now that a physical encounter with her would not be simple it could only be problematic he would solve the problem for both of them by gathering up his things and spending the bulk of his time on his ship when cal came back he would convince his brother that he had made a mistake then they would go home where they belonged and that would be the end of it it should have been perhaps it would have been but he came to the top of the stairs just as sunny stepped out of the bath she held a towel at her breasts with both hands he gripped the rail so hard that he wondered the wood didnt crumble under his fingers bad timing the thought went through both of their heads or perhaps it was perfect timing chapter we crossed to her slowly soundlessly inevitably in his eyes she saw mirrored her own needs a reflection of desires raw and ready that she had refused to acknowledge even now faced with them she wanted to deny that they existed not with this power not with this potency she could have held up a hand said one simple word no perhaps it would have stopped him perhaps not but her hands remained clutched on the towel and she said nothing at all at her back she could feel the steam from the shower still rising or was it anticipation that heated her skin her fingers were balled tight lodged in the subtle valley between her breasts her eyes were steady on his but her pulse scrambled erratically as if she had just crossed the finish line of a long arduous race he didnt touch her not at first he already knew that once he did the time to turn back would be lost for both of them a part of him wished desperately that he could simply walk back turn away and continue on the route he already had mapped out she was a detour a dangerous combination of curves that would only lead him astray but looking at her his eyes dark and intent on her face he knew that his bridges were already smoking behind him he touched her face took it in his hands cupped it molding his fingers to the angles as if to mold the shape of it in his mind to remember her always as she was in this one instant to remember her through all the centuries that would keep them apart he heard her breath catch then release felt the faint almost delicate tremblings of passion still restrained all the while he watched her measuring that look in her eyes part panic part challenge resisting her would be as impossible as stopping his own heartbeat at will slowly deliberately he spread his fingers skimming them up so that his palms slid over her jawline her cheekbones her temples until his hands were caught in her wet sleek hair he took one fistful of it then two her gaze never faltered from his she wouldnt permit it to but she couldnt prevent a quick soft gasp as he drew her head back her lips parted in both invitation and acceptance as he leaned closer only the thinning mist from the bath wound between them with his mouth a breath away from hers he stopped waited it had nothing to do with hesitation there was as much challenge in his eyes as in hers to meet it she moved forward the slight sway of her body closing the narrow distance between them yes she said and lifted her mouth to his no single word could have lit the fires so quickly no practiced seduction could have broken the last chains on his control his fingers tightened in her hair and his mouth swooped down on hers the glory of it he felt hunger answer hunger desperation ply desperation her mouth was like an oasis offering the last cool drop of life to a dying man who knew he must stumble back into the sun she appeased even as she incited promised even as she demanded there was honey for the taking rich and thick but always at the risk of being stung the risk made the reward all the sweeter he had never known a woman could make him suffer and make him relish the pain all from a meeting of lips her hands were trapped between their bodies they flexed impatient not for release but to take as he was taking she spread them flat on his chest fretting for freedom but her murmur of protest was lost in his assault on her mouth before it merged with a groan of pleasure his teeth nipped and nibbled and then his tongue plunged deep greedily deaf and blind to all else she dived in as recklessly as he her hands were free for an instant before she could clutch at him her world seemed to tilt and she was swept up in his arms swept off her feet she thought giddily no man before him had ever dared to attempt it no man before him would have succeeded with muscles like iron he caught her hard against him closing the distance to the bedroom in a few longlegged strides even as she tugged at his sweater they were tumbling onto the bed with one frantic stroke he ripped the towel from her then gripped her seeking hands in his fingers interlacing locking so that he could look his fill the thin winter light seeped through the window to lie loverlike on her skin her struggle to free her hands stopped for a moment she thought her breathing had as well he knew his had it wasnt air that rushed through him but a desire so acute it left him reeling she was pale as moonlight long limbed with the finetoned muscles of a dancer or an athlete the strength was there and the femininity as he looked and looked and looked she began to tremble her hair was dark wet and slicked back from her face now as they had earlier with anger her eyes had deepened to smoke and they watched him with her hands still caught in his he lowered his mouth she arched as greedy as he for the contact even as the kiss pumped through her like a drug she tried to tug her hands free but he was relentless as if he knew that once he released her the power would be taken from him not to dominate but only to pleasure he kept her prisoner she moaned as the soft cotton of his sweater brushed her skin she wanted his flesh against hers she wanted her hands on him and his on her but he used his mouth only his mouth to drive her to the edge of reason rapidly almost savagely he moved his lips over herher face her neck her shoulders she spoke his name writhing frantically beneath him but he moved restlessly on with openmouthed kisses he circled her breasts tormenting himself as much as her then he drew the point into his mouth to nip to suck to stroke with the rough edge of his tongue he had known the flavor of women but hers was new so exclusively hers mat he knew that if he supped of ten times ten thousand others he would never be satisfied never had he known so keen or so perfect a match the ache to claim all of her sprinted inside him jacob his name was like a prayer that was transformed into a frantic moan let me but the words ended on a stunned suffocated cry as he shot her over a towering airless peak she flew thoughts and feelings tangling and breaking apart still his hands were locked with hers gasping giddy she closed her eyes as her tensed muscles went lax if this was pleasure she had never tasted it before if this was passion she understood for the first time why a woman would die for it dazed she opened her eyes the fierce triumph in his had her heart pounding against her ribs again i canti havent you can and you will again and he watched ravenous as he sent her soaring shudders racked her each movement of her body beneath his pushed her closer to the edge of reason freed her hands slid bonelessly to the rumpled sheets there was a mist in front of her eyes as his hands joined his mouth in plundering her she wondered that she didnt simply float up and away into it touch me she wasnt certain if he spoke the words or if his need merely echoed in her head through layers of drugged pleasure she lifted her arms brought him close and found his mouth with hers strength raced back into her edgier more potent from the weakness a new level of desperation had her dragging his sweater over his head twin gasps of pleasure speared the quiet as her hands found him warm firm hers she stroked and explored as thoroughly as mercilessly as he catapulted by a hunger grown insatiable she rolled with him on the bed her mouth fused to his tearing at his jeans with frantic fingers until heated flesh met heated flesh he had thought he knew what delights a woman could bring when she touched a man but she had never touched him before all he had known all he had experienced before paled and meant nothing he was filled with her body mind and soul she was everything hed dreamed of without knowing he was dreaming everything hed wished for without knowing he was wishing as her lips ran over him small hungry sounds rising in her throat desire built to a rage over and over they rolled on the bed legs tangling as they pushed each other from brink to brink the war they fought was punctuated by searing kisses bruising strokes driven beyond reason he gripped her hips but she was already rising to meet him to take him in sheathed inside her he felt the first shudders hers his rip through them her legs locked around him his fingers dug into the sheets reason shattered rhythms matched and he was rocketing through space through time all he knew was that she was with him she lay crossways on the bed one arm flung out the other hand still clutched in jacobs hair his body was as limp as hers as he sprawled over her his head resting between her breasts his first thought was that her heart thudding under his ear matched the pace of his own before reason could set in he slid a hand over the warm tangle of sheets and covered hers he knew he would never be able to describe the sensation mat rippled through him as her fingers curled against his he was heavy she didnt care it seemed perfectly feasible that she could spend the rest of her life lying just so listening to his breathing and to the quiet sound of snow melting from the eaves in the sun so this was what it was to love she mused she hadnt known shed waited all her life to feel like this it had always seemed possible to her to live her life alone independent content with the freedom to do as she pleased when she pleased the idea of sharing a bed with a man you cared for respected understood had seemed practical and certainly human enough but the idea of sharing a lifeor needing to share it because you couldnt imagine living without one personhad always struck her as romantic nonsense no more and he was such a beautiful man strong and smart stubborn and opinionated exactly she realized the kind of man she needed without any one of those qualities her personality would have driven her to run right over him making both of them miserable because he had them she would run into him often bruising them both and shed be wildly happy smiling she caught herself stroking his hair after letting out a careful breath she made herself stop what did a woman like her do with these tender feelings she understood passion at least she understood it now but what about this soft yielding sensation this dependence this need to nurture and cherish and simply love how would a man like jacob hornblower react to this sudden gush of emotion hed sneer at her closing her eyes she admitted that she would have sneered herself only hours before but everything had changed for her sunny reminded herself if she was honest she would accept the fact that shed started falling the moment shed faced him ready to fight in this very same room but jacob she herself had called him a tough nut cracking him discovering whether there was indeed a soft center capable of gentler emotions would be a difficult task it would take effort she thought that was no problem it would take patience that was oblivious of where her thoughts were headed he turned his head enough to brush a kiss to the curve of her breast your taste he murmured hmm it keeps me hungry he scraped his teeth along her skin then smiled when he felt her heart skip a beat i like you here best he propped himself up to study her face lazily naked and in bed a typical male attitude deliberately she danced her fingers down his hip and watched his eyes darken but then i think i prefer you in the same state its convenient that we finally agree about something he shifted so that he could trace her lips with the tip of his tongue i like your mouth sunbeam its stubborn and sexy i could say the same about yours we agree again a new record she caught his lower lip between her teeth we could push our luck what else do you like your his smile spread slowly energy another winner with a laugh he deepened the kiss she was just as sweet and just as potent as the first time your body he decided i definitely like your body she sighed into his mouth were on a roll jt dont stop now he shifted his attention to her earlobe this is a nice spot he murmured nuzzling until they were both dizzy but i suppose under the circumstances i can confess that i find your mind intriguing intriguing she repeated as shudder after delicious shudder passed through her an interesting choice of words it seemed more apt than infuriating at the moment and i his words trailed off when he spotted a line of faint bruises on her shoulder he placed the tips of his fingers on them experimentally ive marked your skin he said surprised and a bit appalled if he had bruised her during a fight he wouldnt have given it a second thought but in bed while loving that was a different matter im sorry she twisted her head to glance at them she certainly hadnt felt them are you he looked back to see her lips curved in what he considered a typically female smile no i suppose im not under the circumstances she supplied right he started to speak again to make some joke but found himself suddenly and totally at a loss for words something in her smile in her halfhooded eyes in the tilt of that damnyou chin turned his brain to mush ridiculous he told himself as he continued to stare at her absolutely and completely ridiculous whatever he was feeling it couldnt be lovenot the kind of love that caused men to make foolish and lifealtering decisions it was affection he told himself attraction desire and passion tempered with a certain amount of caring perhaps but love he had no room for it and no time time reality struck him like a blow time was the biggest obstacle of all he started to push himself away to put some distance between them until he could think clearly again still smiling she wrapped arms and legs around him going somewhere i must be heavy you are she continued to smile then traced her lips with her tongue her hips moved gently sinuously against his thrilled she watched his eyes cloud as he grew inside her i was hoping we could do a little experiment he shook his head but failed to clear it experiment physics she trailed a single fingertip down his back you know about physics dont you jt he used to thats dr hornblower to you he muttered and buried his face in her throat well doc isnt there this theory about an object in motion remaining in motion his breath was ragged in her ear let me show you she ached all over and shed never felt better in her life bleary eyed she winced at the intruding sunlight morning again she realized she wouldnt have believed it was possible to spend the better part of a day and all of a night in bed with only snatches of sleep with a grumbling sigh she tried to roll over and met the solid wall of jacobs body hed been busy since dawn she mused busy working her over to the edge of the bed now he took up ninety percent of the mattress along with all of the sheets and blankets the only thing saving her from sliding onto the floor was the weight of the leg he had hooked around her hips and the arm stretched carelessly and certainly not amorously over her throat she shifted again met the unmoving line of resistance and narrowed her eyes okay pal she said under her breath were going to begin as i mean to go on and i dont mean to roll onto the floor every night for the rest of my life she gave him an unloverlike nudge in the stomach with her elbow he swore and shoved her another inch toward the edge tactics sunny decided she changed hers by sliding a hand intimately over his hip and thigh jt she whispered trailing a line of kisses down his cheek honey hmm she nibbled delicately at his ear jacob sweetheart he made another vague sound and cupped her breast sunnys brow lifted his movement had cost her another precious fraction of an inch baby she added figuring she was running out of endearments wake up sugar theres something i want to do gently seductively she brushed her lips down to his shoulder something i really need as his lips curved she bit him hard ow his eyes flew open temper and bafflement warring in them what the hell was that for so i could get back my share of the bed satisfied she snuggled into the pillow hed just vacated she opened one eye and was gratified to see that he was scowling at her anyone ever tell you youre a bed hog and a blanket thief she snatched the loose cover and rolled into it youre the first one to complain she only smiled she was counting on being the last frowning he rubbed the wound on his shoulder there were shadows under her eyes they made her look vulnerable the faint throbbing where her teeth had connected reminded him that she was anything but inside that angular body was a whirlwind of energy all wells of passion that he was sureeven with the marathon theyd put each other throughhad yet to be tapped shed taken nun places he hadnt believed existed places he was already yearning to return to in the deepest part of the night she had been insatiable and impossibly generous hed had only to touch her to have her respond shed had only to touch him to cause the need to chum now in the full light of morning she was wrapped in the blankets with only her tousled cap of hair and half of her face in view and he wanted her what was he going to do about her with her for her he hadnt a clue he wondered how she would react if he told her everything shed go back to thinking he was unbalanced he could prove it to her and once he had they would both have to face the fact that whatever had happened between them during the last spin of the earth on its axis was transient he wasnt ready for that for once in his life he wanted to delude himself to pretend they would have only a few weeks together at best more than other men he had firsthand knowledge of how fickle time could be so now he would use it and take what he had with her but how could he sitting up he rubbed his hands over his face it wasnt fair to her it was grossly unfair particularly if his instincts were correct and her feelings were involved not telling her would hurt her when it ended telling her would hurt her before it had really begun and maybe that was best going somewhere she asked him he was reminded of when she had used the same phrase before and where it had ended now he thought of how he could tell her just how far away he was going she was an intelligent woman he had only to give her the facts sunny yes she ran a hand up his arm then feeling repentant she rose long enough to kiss his shoulder where she had bitten it maybe this shouldnt have happened he saw by the way her smile faded that hed begun badly i see no you dont annoyed with himself he made a grab for her before she could roll out of bed dont worry about it she said stiffly when youve been fired as often as i have you get used to rejection if youre sorry about what happened im not he cut her off with a brisk shake that turned the glazed hurt in her eyes to smoke dont ever do that again im not sorry he said struggling for calm i damn well should be but im not i cant be because all i can think about is making love with you again she blew her hair out of her eyes and swore to herself that she would be calm i dont know what youre trying to say neither do i he released her to tug his fingers through his hair it mattered he blurted out it wasnt what hed meant to say but it too was a fact being with you mattered to me i didnt think it would the ice she had deliberately formed around her heart melted a little are you upset because it was more than sex im upset because it was a hell of a lot more than sex and he was a coward he realized because he couldnt tell her that what they had now would end before either of them was ready i dont know how to handle it she was silent for a moment he looked so angrywith himself and as confused as she was by what had grownno by what had exploded into lifebetween them how about one day at a time he shifted his gaze to hers he wanted to believe it could be that simple needed to and what happens when i leave the ice had definitely melted because she felt the first slash in her heart then well deal with it she chose her words carefully jacob i dont think either of us wanted to get involved but it happened i wouldnt want to take it back be sure she lifted a hand to his cheek i am afraid she would say too much too soon she bundled back under the covers now that thats settled its your turn to make breakfast you can yell up the stairs when its ready he said nothing the thought of what might tumble from his heart to his lips unnerved him if it was a choice between saying too much and saying too little he had to choose the latter he rose tugged on what clothes came to hand and left her alone she turned her face into the pillow it smelled of him letting out a long weary sigh she willed her body to relax she had lied rejections wounded her deeply left her miserable and aching and full of selfloathing a rejection from him would hurt so much more than the loss of a job rubbing her cheek on the pillowcase she watched the slant of sunlight what would she do if he ended it she would recover she needed to believe that but she knew that if he turned away from her recovery would take a lifetime so she couldnt let him turn away it was important not to push sunny was very aware that she demanded too much from the people close to her too much love too much attention too much patience too much faith this time it would be different she would be patient she would have faith it would be easier she knew because he was as unsteady as she who wouldnt be with the velocity and force with which they had come together if they could progress so far in such a short time how much further could they go in the weeks ahead all they needed was a little time to get to know each other better to work on those rough edges forget the rough edges she thought gazing at the ceiling those would take a couple of lifetimes at least in any case she rather liked them but time she was certain she had that right time was what they needed to get used to what had happened to accept that it was going to keep right on happening she smiled at that her confidence building again and if that didnt work shed browbeat him into it she knew exactly what she wanted and that was a first she wanted jacob t hornblower if after he had seen and spoken with cal he packed his pitiful little bag and headed back east she would just go after him what was a few thousand miles between friends or lovers oh no he wasnt going to shake her off without a fight and fighting was what she did best if she wanted himand she was certain she didthen he didnt have a chance she had as much right to call things off as he did and she was far from ready maybe if he was lucky shed let him off the hook in fifty or sixty years in the meantime he was just going to have to deal with it and with her sunny this stuff is in the bowls and i cant find the damn coffee she grinned ah the sweet sound of her lovers voice carrying on the morning air like music like the trilling of birds i said i cant find the damn coffee like the roar of a wounded mule madly in love she tossed the heap of blankets aside its in the cupboard over the stove dummy ill be right down chapter another week of quiet serenity and nature in the rough would drive sunny mad shed already accepted that even love wasnt enough of a buffer against hour after hour of solitude punctuated only by the occasional call of a hardy bird and the monotonous drip drip drip of snow melting from the roof for variety she could always listen to the wind blow through the trees when she had stooped that low she realized that she would gladly trade all of her worldly possessions for the good grinding noise of rushhour traffic in any major city a girl might be born in the woods she thought but that didnt mean you could keep her there jacob was certainly a distraction an exciting one but as the days passed it became clear that being snowbound in a log cabin in the middle of nowhere was no more his definition of a good time than it was hers the fact that she found that a relief didnt ease the boredom they managed to occupy their time arguing in bed and out two restless personalities stuck in the same space were bound to strike sparks but their minds were as restless as their bodies and needed stimulation sunny compensated by hibernating her reasoning was she couldnt be bored if she was asleep so she developed the habit of taking long naps at odd hours when he was certain she was asleep jacob would slip out taking advantage of the bonus hed found in the shed cals aircycle with that he would make a quick trip to his ship and input new data into the main computer he told himself that he wasnt deceiving her he was simply performing part of the task he had come to her time to accomplish and if it was deceit it couldnt be helped hed nearly convinced himself that what she didnt know couldnt hurt her at least for the time being though he was as restless as she he found himself storing up memories images moments the way she looked when she wokesleepyeyed and irritable as a child the way shed laughed the sun shining on her hair when theyd built a house of snow under the pine trees the way she felt passion humming under her skin when they made love in front of the fire he would need them those memories those remembrances of each conversation or spat each time he returned to the ship he was reminded of just how much he would need them he told himself he was only preparing to go on with his life and so was she she had written inquiries to the handful of universities shed selected but the weather had so far prevented her from venturing out as far as medford to mail them she had read lost to jacob at poker even dragged out her sketchbook in desperation when she tired of drawing the view of snow and pine trees from the windows she sketched the interior of the cabin bored she resorted to drawing caricatures jacob read incessantly and hed taken to scribbling in a spiral notebook hed dug out of some drawer when sunny asked him if he was preparing for an experiment he made noncommittal noises when she pressed him he simply pulled her into his lap and made her forget to ask questions they lost power twice and they made love as frequently as they argued which was often sunny was certain when she caught herself making the bed for lack of anything better to occupy her time that if they didnt do something they would both find themselves in a home for the gently deranged leaving the bed halfmade she sprinted to the top of the stairs jt he was currently trying to keep himself sane by building a city of cards what lets drive to portland jacobs attention was fixed on a particularly intricate arrangement he thought the structure was beginning to resemble the skyline on omega ii jt yeah with fingers that were rocksteady he added another card i guess its too late sunny murmured and sat down to the west of the city hes already gone around the bend do we have any more of these she sighed at his dwindling stack of cards nope i was thinking of a bridge think shock therapy or maybe a skybelt a what he caught himself and put another card in place nothing my mind was wandering she snickered whats left of it you were saying i was saying lets get out of dodge i thought medford was the closest town she opened her mouth closed it again sometimes she said at last im not sure if you belong on the same planet with the rest of us its the right planet a portion of his pasteboard roof fluttered breathe the other way will you jacob if you could spare a moment of your valuable time he glanced up then and he had to smile you have the sexiest pout ive ever seen i dont pout when she caught herself doing just that she hissed between her teeth and blew down a building youve just murdered thousands of innocent people theres only one person im going to murder desperate she grabbed a handful of his sweater jt if i dont get out of here im going to start bouncing off the walls can you do that just watch me she leaned closer portland people traffic restaurants when do you want to leave with a huff she sat back again you were listening of course i was listening i always listen when do you want to leave a week ago now i can be ready in ten minutes she sprang up though jacob winced when his city collapsed he rose with her what about the snow it hasnt snowed for three days besides we have fourwheel drive if we can get to route were home free the thought of getting out nearly made him forget his priorities and if cal comes back she was all but dancing with impatience theyre not due back for a couple of weeks anyway they live here carelessly she stepped on his demolished city jt think carefully do you really want to see a grown woman turn into a raving lunatic maybe taking her by the hips he pulled her intimately close i like it when you rave then prepare to enjoy yourself i am he dragged her to the floor she arguedbriefly im going she said undoing the buttons of her flannel shut okay i mean it right he tugged the plain white undershirt over her head she struggled but couldnt prevent her lips from curving giving up she helped him off with his sweater and so are you as soon as youre finished raving he promised then closed his mouth over hers sunny threw a small bag into the back of the land rover shed taken time to grab a toothbrush a hairbrush her favorite camisole and a lipstick in case we have to stop on the way she explained why would we i dont know how long its going to take us to get out of the mountains she settled in the drivers seat its about five hours after that five hours it took them five hours to get from one part of a single state to another for the past few days hed nearly forgotten how different things were she shot him a look eyes bright lips curved ready sure it was difficult not to stare as she turned a small key and sent the combustion engine roaring he could feel the vibration through the floorboards a few small adjustments he mused and even an archaic vehicle could be made to run smoothly and quietly jacob was on the brink of pointing this out to her when she shoved the land rover in gear and sent snow spitting out from under the tires all right is it this baby rides like a tank she said happily as they lumbered away from the cabin apparently he braced himself finding it incongruous that he should worry about life and limb here when he had taken countless trips at warp speed i suppose you know what youre doing of course i know what im doing i learned how to drive in a jeep they labored up an incline where snow had melted and refrozen into a slick surface jacob judged the height and breadth of the trees he could only trust that she knew how to avoid them you look a little green she had to chuckle as they plowed then fishtailed then plowed again making erratic but definite progress havent you ever ridden in one of these he had an image of driving his own lsa vehicleland sea or air it was smooth and quiet and as fast as a comet no actually i havent then youre in for a treat the land rover bumped over rocks hidden under the snow i bet they forged through the drifts he nearly relaxed by all indications she knew how to handle the vehicle such as it was after the first twenty minutes the heater began to hum how about some tunes his brow creased fine he said cautiously youre in charge of what of the tunes she navigated carefully down an incline the radio he eyed a particularly large tree at their current rate and angle he estimated thirty seconds to impact we didnt bring it the car radio jt she missed the tree by six or eight inches pick a station shed taken her hand from the wheel for an instant to gesture at the dashboard eyes narrowed jacob studied it trusting luck he turned a dial it works better if you turn it on before you try to tune in a station biting back an oath he tried another dial and was greeted by a blast of earpopping static after adjusting the volume he applied himself to the tuner his first stop was an instrumental melody loaded with strings that made him cringe still he glanced over at sunny if thats your choice well have to reassess our relationship immediately sound faded in and out as he played with the tuner he hit on some gritty rock not too dissimiliar from what might have sounded over the airwaves in his own time good choice she turned her head briefly to smile at him whos your favorite musician mozart he answered because it was partially true and undeniably safe youre going to like my mother when i was a kid she used to weave to his clarinet concerto in a minor with the radio still rocking she hummed a few bars for the purity of sound shed always say moms always been big on pureno additives no preservatives how did you keep food fresh without preservatives thats what i say whats life without a little msg anyway then dad would switch on bob dylan she laughed more relieved than she wanted to admit when they turned onto the first plowed road one of my earliest memories of him is watching him weed his garden with his hair down to his shoulders and this scratchy dylan record playing on a little portable turntable come gather round people wherever you roam all he was wearingdad not dylanwas bellbottoms and love beads jacob got an uncomfortable flash of his own father dressed in his tidy gardening clothes blue shirt blue slacks his hair carefully trimmed under a stiff peaked cap his face quiet as he handpruned his roses and listened to brahms on his personal entertainment unit and of his mother sitting in the shade of a tree on a lazy sunday afternoon reading a novel while he and cal had tossed a baseball and argued over strike zones i think youll like him dragged back jacob blinked at her what my father she repeated i think youll like him he battled down the anger that had risen up inside him it was simple enough to put two and two together your parents live in portland thats right about twenty minutes from my place she let out a quiet satisfied breath as they turned onto route and headed north theyll be glad to meet you especially since cals family has been so shrouded in mystery the friendly smile she offered him faded when she saw his expression when her hands clenched on the wheel it had nothing to do with anger and everything to do with despair meeting my parents is not synonymous with a lifetime commitment her voice was stiff and cold if he hadnt been so lost in his own unhappiness he would have heard the hurt beneath it you didnt mention visiting your parents the fact was he didnt want to meet them or to think of them as people i didnt think it was necessary her clutch foot began to tap on the floorboards i realize your idea of family differs from mine but i wouldnt think of coming back to town and not seeing them bitterness rose like bile in his throat you have no idea what family means to me no she gave a quick moody shrug lets just say i can surmise that you dont have a problem cutting certain members of it out of your life for extended periods your business she said before he could retort and youre certainly not obligated to come with me when i go to see my family her fingers began to tap in time with her foot in fact ill be happy not to even mention your name he was careful not to speak again if he did too much of what he was feeling would pour out leaving too much to be explained she didnt know how he felt it was all so easy so straightforward for her all she had to do was hop into this excuse for transportation and spend a few hours on what passed for a roadway and she could see her family by using the current system of communication she could speak with them over relatively long distances even if she decided to travel to the other side of the planet some element of twentiethcentury technology would provide a link she knew nothing of separation of losing a part of yourself and not knowing why how would she react if she found herself faced with the possibility of never seeing her sister again she wouldnt be so damn smug then for the next hour or so jacob amused himself by sneering at the other vehicles on the road ridiculously clumsy slow and absurdly inefficient carbon monoxide pumping into the atmosphere gleefully poisoning their own air they had no respect he thought for themselves their resources their descendants and she thought he was insensitive he wondered what would happen if he strolled into what passed for a research lab in this age and showed them the procedure for fusion theyd probably sacrifice a lamb and make him a god he sat back arms crossed theyd just have to figure it out for themselves right now his biggest problem was keeping warm with all the cold air blowing off of sunny he frowned when she pulled out onto a ramp he hadnt been paying close attention but he was certain they hadnt driven for five hours what are you doing im going to get something to eat and put gas in the car she snapped the words off without a glance at him hugging her resentment to her she pulled into a gas station got out and slammed the door behind her as she reset the selfservice pump she muttered under her breath shed forgotten how his mind worked obviously he was deluding himself into believing that she was luring him into some sort of trap i want you to meet my parents how do you feel about a doublering ceremony sunny ground her teeth it was insulting maybe she was in love with himand that was a situation she dearly hoped could be reversedbut she hadnt done one single thing to pressure him or to lead him to believe that her heart was all aflutter at waiting for him to get down on one knee if he thought shed intended to flaunt him in front of her parents like so much matrimonial beefcake he had another think coming the jerk jacob sat a moment then decided to get out to stretch his legs and get a look at his surroundings so this was a refueling station he mused studying the gas pumps sunny had stuck the nozzle end of a hose into a compartment on the side of the land rover from her expression she didnt look too happy about standing out in the cold with her hand on the switch behind her the pumpthe gasoline pump he elaboratedclicked as numbers turned over the odor of fuel was strong other cars crowded the pump islands some waited in their vehicles for a man in a cap to come out and go through the procedure sunny was doing for herself others did as she was and shivered in the cold he watched a woman bundle a trio of children around the side of a building that was set farther off the road the children were arguing and whining and the woman was snatching at arms he had to grin at least that much hadnt changed over time on the road cars chugged by jacob wrinkled his nose at the stench of exhaust a sixteenwheeler roared by leaving a stream of displaced air in its wake there were plenty of buildings such as they were tall ones squat ones all huddled together as if they were afraid to leave too much room between them he found the style uninspired then less than a block down the street he spotted something that brought him a pang of homesickness a pair of high golden arches at least they werent completely uncivilized he thought he was grinning when he turned back to sunny she didnt respond ignoring him she screwed the gas cap in place and hung up the hose silent treatment or not he told himself he would not apologize for something that was so clearly her fault still he followed her into the building and was distracted by rows of candy bars shelves of soft drinks and the prevalent scent of crude oil when she took out paper money jacob had to stick his hands in his pockets to keep himself from reaching out to touch it the man in the cap ran grimy fingers over the keys of a machine red numbers appeared in a viewbox the paper was exchanged and sunny was given metal disks that was money too jacob reminded himself coins they were called he was frustrated when she dumped them in her bag before he could get a close look he wondered how he could approach her for some samples the woman hed seen earlier herded the three children inside and the room was immediately filled with noise all three fell greedily on the rows of candy bars just one the woman said an edge to her voice i mean it she was digging in her purse as she spoke the children bundled in coats and hats set up an arguing din that ended in a shoving match the smallest went down on her bottom with a thump and a wail jacob bent automatically to set her on her feet then handed her the smashed candy bar her bottom lip was quivering and her eyes big and round and blue were filled to overflowing hes always pushing me she complained youll be as big as they are pretty soon he told her then they wont be able to push you around sorry sighing the woman picked her daughter up its been a long trip scotty youre going to sit on your hands for the next ten miles when jacob turned to leave the little girl was smiling at him and so he noted was sunny are you talking to me again he asked as they walked back to the car no she tugged on her gloves as she sat in the drivers seat it would have been easier to go on hating him if he hadnt been so sweet with the little girl im a great deal harder to charm than a threeyearold we could try a neutral subject she turned on the engine we dont have any neutral subjects she had him there he lapsed into silence again as she merged with traffic but he could have kissed her when she turned into those golden arches she followed a sign that said drivethru and stopped at a board that listed the restaurants delicacies what do you want he started to ask for a mcgalaxy burger and a large order of laser rings but he didnt see either on the menu once again he put his fate in her hands two of whatever youre having because he couldnt resist he toyed with the hair at the back of her neck annoyed she shook his fingers off she spoke into the intercom listened for the total then joined the line of cars waiting to be served well make better time if we eat while we drive they inched forward are we in a hurry i dont like to waste time neither did he and he wasnt sure how much more they had together sunny no response i love you her foot slipped off the clutch her other slammed the brake pedal when the land rover stalled the car was still rocking as she turned to gape at him what i said i love you it didnt hurt as much as hed thought it would in fact it felt good very good i figured we might as well have it out in the open oh as responses went it wasnt her best but she was staring straight ahead into the rear window of the car in front there was a stuffed cat suctioncupped to the glass it was grinning at her the car behind her gave an impatient beep of the horn and had her fumbling with the ignition key rattled she pulled up to the service window is that all you can say annoyance colored his tone as she turned to blink at him just oh i im not sure what thatll be the boy shouted through the window as he held out white paper bags what he rolled his eyes its come on lady sorry she took the bags dumped them in jacobs lap even as he swore at her she dug out a twenty and passed it to the boy without waiting for her change she pulled into the first available parking space and stopped the car i think you singed my sorry she snapped cutting him off because she felt like a fool she rounded on him its your own fault mr romance dropping something like that on me while im stuck in a line of cars at a fastfood drivein what did you expect me to do throw myself in your arms while they were adding on the pickles i never know what the hell to expect from you he reached into the bag brought out a foilwrapped burger and tossed it to her from me she unwrapped the burger and took a huge bite it did nothing to ease the fluttering of her stomach from me youre the one who started this hornblower one minute youre snapping my head off the next youre telling me you love me and then youre throwing me a cheeseburger just shut up and eat he shoved a paper cup into her hand hed bite off his tongue before hed say it to her again he didnt know what had come over him gasoline fumes undoubtedly no man in his right mind could fall in love with such an obstinate woman andno help from herhe was still in his right mind a few minutes ago you were begging me to talk to you she pointed out sucking on her straw i never beg she turned then eyes smoky you would if i wanted you to he could have strangled her then for saying what he realized was no more than the truth i thought we were going to drive while we ate i changed my mind she said tightly the way her insides were shaking she wasnt sure she could navigate ten feet shed be damned if shed let him know it since it wasnt possible to kick him due to their position she simply turned and stared through the windshield she continued eating mechanically and cursed him for spoiling her appetite imagine telling her that he loved her while they were waiting for hamburgers what style what finesse she tapped her fingers on the wheel and bit back a sigh how incredibly sweet cautious she cast a sidelong look at him his profile was set his eyes were steely she had seen him angrier she supposed but it was a close call something about the way he fumed in frustrated silence made her feel incredibly sentimental twenty years from now she would look back and smile over the way he had said those magic words the very first time she scrambled onto her knees and threw her arms around him he gasped as cold liquid splashed on his knees damn it sunny youve spilled it all over me he squirmed then stilled when her mouth found his he tasted her laughter on the tip of her tongue hampered by the gearshift he struggled to drag her closer did you mean it she demanded shoving what was left of their lunch aside no way was he going to let her off that easily mean what what you said he settled her awkwardly in his lap making sure her bottom came in direct contact with his wet knees which time her breath came out in a huff but she curled her arms around his neck you said you loved me did you mean it i might have he worked his hands up under her coat but had to be content with the flannel of her shirt or i might have been trying to start a conversation she bit his lip last chance hornblower did you mean it yes god help them both want to fight about it again no she rested her cheek against his no i dont want to fight not right now he felt her sigh move through her body it scared me that makes two of us after pressing a kiss to his throat she drew back it gets even scarier i love you too hed known it and yetand yet hearing her say it seeing her eyes as she spoke watching her lips form the words nothing could have prepared him for the force of feeling that poured into him a waterfall of emotion tumbling through it he pulled her mouth to his he couldnt bring her close enough it didnt seem odd that they were huddled inside a car in a parking lot beside a busy street in broad daylight much odder was the fact that he was here at all that he had found her despite the centuries when he lived she couldnt go when she lived he couldnt stay and yet in this small space of time they were together time was passing i dont know what were going to do about this he murmured there had to be a way some equation some theory but what computer could analyze data that was so purely emotional one day at a time remember she drew back smiling weve got plenty of time she hugged him close and she didnt see the trouble come into his eyes speaking of which weve got almost two hours before portland too long she chuckled then squirmed back into her seat i was thinking the same thing she zoomed out of the lot keeping her eyes peeled with a grin of satisfaction she pulled into the first motel she spotted i think we can use a break after snatching up her bag she strolled into the office to register this time she used a plastic cardsomething much less foreign to him with little trouble and less conversation she secured a key from the clerk how long have we got jacob asked as he swung an arm over her shoulder she shot him a look it may be a motel she said steering them toward a door marked but i dont think this particular chain rents rooms by the hour so she turned the key in the lock weve got the rest of the dayand all nightif we want we want he caught her the moment she stepped inside then wheeling her around he used their joined bodies to slam the door closed because his hands were already occupied sunny reached behind her to secure the chain jt wait why id really prefer it if we drew the drapes first he ran the palm of one hand over the wall searching for a button while he tugged at her coat with the other what are you doing looking for the switch she chuckled into his throat at thirtyfive a night you have to close the curtains by hand she wiggled away to deal with it id love to see the kind of motels youre used to the light became dim and soft with a thin bright slit in the center where the drapes met she was standing just there with the light like a spear behind her and she enchanted him theres this place on an island off maine he shrugged out of the borrowed coat then sat down to pry off his boots the rooms are built on a promontory so that they hang over the sea waves crash up beneath beside in front the windows are how to explain it theyre made out of a special material so that you can see out as far as the horizon but no one can see inso that beyond one entire wall theres nothing but rock and ocean the tubs are huge and sunken and the water steams with perfume he rose slowly picturing it picturing her there with him you can have music just by wishing for it if you want moonlight or the sound of rain youve only to touch a switch the beds are big and soft so that when a man reaches for his woman she all but floats to him over it while youre there time stops for as long as you believe it aroused she let out a shaky breath youre making this up he shook his head id take you there if i could i have a good imagination she said as he pushed the coat from her shoulders she shuddered when he ran his hands down her well pretend were there but i dont think theres moonlight smiling he eased her down and pulled off her boots one by one what then thunder her breath shivered out when he trailed his fingers up her calf and lightning thats what i feel when you touch me there was a storm in him he saw the power of it reflected in her eyes she rose so that her body skimmed up his inch by tormenting inch before he could take her lips she was pressing them already hot to his throat the pulse that hammered there excited her the taste inflamed her wanting more freedom she pushed his sweater up and up then let it fall to the floor in a heap with a lingering sound of pleasure she traced her lips over his chest absorbing the texture the intimate flavor of his skin it was soft dreamily soft over the hard ridges of muscles his scent earthy and male delighted her there was thunder she could feel it when she let her mouth loiter over his heart it beat for her there was lightning she saw the flash of power when she looked into his eyes he was surprised he could still stand what she was doing was making him dizzy and desperate those long lovely fingers already knew his body well but every time they explored they found new secrets and her mouth he gripped her shoulders as she took her lips on a lazy journey down his chest over the quivering muscles of his stomach her tongue left a moist trail her throaty laugh echoed in his head he felt her fingers on the snap of his jeans and the denim as it slid from waist to hipbone pleasure arrowed into him its point jagged time didnt stand still it reeled backward until he was as primitive as the men who had forged weapons from stone with an oath he dragged her up into his arms his mouth branding hers all fire and force then she was under him on the bed her body as taut as wire her breath heaved seemed to tear out of her lungs as his hands raced over her possessed she could hear him speak but the roaring in her head masked the words driven he ripped her shirt down the front sending buttons flying wild to touch her he hooked his fingers in the collar of the thin cotton beneath it and tore it aside she called out his name stunned elated terrified by the violence she had brought out in him then she could only gasp fighting for air for sanity as the first climax rocketed through her but there was no weakness this time energized she reared up enfolding him so that they were half sprawled half kneeling on the bed torso to torso hip to hip with her head thrown back she let him take his mouth over her pleasuring receiving pleasure like a madman he tore pulled dragged at her jeans until her body was as naked as his her hands slid off his slick skin as she tried to draw him to her it was then that she realized that he was shuddering his body vibrating with a need even she hadnt guessed at she started to speak his name but he was inside her filling her firing her his muscles were taut as he braced her against him letting her frenzy drive them both faster deeper as she soared over wave after wave passion became abandonment as her body bowed back tempting his eager mouth to feast on her sensation layered over sensation until they were all one torrid maze of light and color and sound as he pulled her back his body thrust inside hers she no longer knew where she began and he stopped she forgot to care chapter sunny unlocked the door to her apartment ignoring the faint creak behind her that meant mrs morgenstern had cracked her own door to watch the comings and goings on the third floor she had chosen the third floor despite the vagaries of the elevator and the nosiness of the neighbors because the tiny apartment boasted what passed for a balcony on it there was just room enough for a chair if she angled it so that she sat with her ankles resting on the rail it overlooked the parking lot it was good enough for her this is it she announced a bit surprised by the surge of nostalgia that filled her at the sight of her own things jacob stepped in behind her sunlight poured through the skinny terrace doors to his right pictures marched along the wallsphotographs sketches oil paintings and posters even in her own rooms sunny preferred company piles of vibrantly colored pillows were heaped on a sagging sunfaded sofa in front of it was a table piled with magazines books and mailopened and unopened in the corner a waisthigh urn held dusty peacock feathers across the room was another table that jacob recognized as a product of expert workmanship from an even earlier century there was a fine film of dust on it along with a pair of ballet shoes a scattering of blue ribbons and a broken teapot a collection of record albums were stuffed into a wooden crate and on a high wicker stool stood a shiny china parrot interesting well its home most of the time she shoved the paper bag she was carrying into his arms it contained the fresh supply of cookies and soft drinks theyd picked up along the way put these in the kitchen will you i want to check my machine right where through there she gestured then disappeared through another door he had another moments pause in the kitchen it wasnt just the appliances this time he was growing used to them it was the teapots they were everywhere covering every available surface lining a trio of shelves on the walls sitting cheek by jowl on top of the refrigerator every color every shape from the tacky to the elegant was represented it had never occurred to him that she was a collector of anything shed always seemed too restless and unrooted to take the time to clutter her life with things strangely he found it endearing to realize that she had pockets of sentimentality curious he studied one of her teapots a particularly florid example of late twentiethcenturyhe couldnt bring himself to call it art it was squat fashioned out of inferior china with a bird of some kind on the lid and huge ugly daisies painted all over the bowl as a collectors item he decided it had a long way to go he set it aside and went to explore the blue ribbons were prizes he discovered for swimming fencing riding it seemed sunny had spent a lifetime scattering her talents her name was signedscrawled reallyon some of the pictures on the walls sketches of cities paintings of crowded beaches he imagined many of the photographs were hers as well there was more talent there showing a clear eye and a sharp wit if she ever settled on any one thing she was bound to shoot right to the top oddly enough he preferred her just as she was scattering those talents experimenting digging for new knowledge he didnt want her to change but she had changed him it wasnt easy to accept it but being with her caring for her had altered some of his basic beliefs he could be content with one person compromises didnt always mean surrender love didnt mean losing part of yourself it meant gaining that much more and she had made him wonder how he was going to face the rest of his life without her turning toward the bedroom he went to find her she was standing in what he first took for a closet then when he saw the bed he realized it was the entire room though it was no more than eight by eight she had crammed something into every nook and cranny more books a stuffed bear in a virulent orange ice skates a set of skis hung on the wall like sabers the dresser was crowded with bottles at least twenty different brands of scent and lotion there was also a photograph of her family he found it difficult to concentrate on it as she was standing by the bed stripped to the waist she had taken off his sweater hed been forced to loan it to her for the remainder of the trip as hed destroyed her shirt with one ear cocked toward the unit by her bed that served as radio alarm clock and message machine she rooted through her closet for another top hey babe the voice on the machine was cajoling and very male the moment he heard it jacob despised it its pete youre not still steamed are you doll come on sunny forgive and forget right give me a call and well go dancing i miss that pretty face of yours sunny gave a quick snort and dragged out a sweatshirt whos pete whoa she put a hand between her breasts you scared me whos pete he repeated just a guy she tugged the sweatshirt on i was hoping youd bring in one of those sodas she sat on the bed to pull off her boots sunny this time the voice on the phone was smooth and feminine we got a postcard from libby and cal let us know when you get back in town my mother sunny explained wriggling her toes grinning she passed him the sweater you can have this back now not entirely sure what he was feeling he took off his coat beneath it his chest was bare as he started to pull the sweater over his head the machine announced the next message hey sunny its marco where the hell are you sweet thing ive been calling for a week give me a buzz when you get back there was a sound like a big smacking kiss before the beep whos marco jacob asked deadly calm another guy her brows rose when he took her arm and pulled her to her feet how many are there messages men sunny bob here i thought you might like to deliberately sunny shut off the machine i havent kept track she said evenly do you want to compare past lives jt he didnt answer because he found he couldnt releasing her he walked away jealousy it filled him and how he detested it he didnt consider himself a reasonable man but he was certainly an intelligent one he knew she hadnt begun to live the moment he had walked into her life a woman like her beautiful bright fascinating would attract men many men and if it had been possible he would have murdered each and every one of them for touching what was his and not his he swore and spun around to see her watching him from the doorway are we going to fight he ached just looking at her he ached for what was and for what could never be no okay i dont want them near you he blurted out dont be a jerk he reached her in three strides i mean it she tugged her arms free and glared at him so do i damn it do you think any of them could mean anything to me after you if you dont her words sunk in and stopped him lifting his hands palms out he stepped back she stepped forward if i dont what if you think you can give me orders pal youve got another thing coming i dont have to no you dont he cut her off taking her balled fist in his hand not his he reminded himself he was going to have to start getting used to that im not handling this well ive never been in love before the fighting light died from her eyes neither have i not like this no not like this he brought her fingertips to his lips just review the rest of your communications later will you amused by his phrasing she grinned sure listen help yourself to whatevers in the kitchen the tvs in the bedroom the stereos out here ill be back in a couple of hours where are you going she picked up a pair of discarded sneakers and tugged them on im going to go see my parents if youre up to it later maybe we can have a real dinner out and go dancing or something sunny he took her hand as she picked up her coat id like to go with you solemn eyed she studied him you dont have to jacob really i know id like to she kissed his cheek go get your coat william stone stalked to the door of his elegant tudor home in bare feet his sweatshirt bagged on his long skinny frame the knees of his jeans had worn through but he refused to give them up in one hand he carried a portable phone in the other a banana look preston i want the new ad campaign to be subtle no dancing tea bags no heavymetal music no talking teddy bears on a sound of frustration he yanked the door open yes that includes waltzing rabbits for gods sake i want he spotted his daughter and grinned from ear to ear deal with it preston he ordered and broke the connection hi brat he spread his arms and caught her on a leap sunny gave him a noisy kiss then stole his banana the tycoon speaks william grimaced at the portable phone such pretensions embarrassed him i was just his words trailed off when he spotted jacob on the threshold he searched his mind for a name sunny often brought men to the housefriends and companions william refused to think of his little girl having lovers though this one looked familiar he couldnt place the name this is jt sunny said between bites of banana she had her arm around her fathers waist two peas in a pod jacob thought pleased that hed been able to dig up the expression the same coloring the same bone structure the same frank measuring looks taking the initiative jacob stepped forward and offered a hand mr stone since one arm was still holding his daughtera bit possessivelywilliam stuck the phone in the back pocket of his jeans before he shook jacobs hand hornblower sunny continued enjoying herself jacob hornblower cals brother no kidding the handshake became more enthusiastic the smile more friendly well its nice to see you we were beginning to think cal had made up his family come on in caros around somewhere he released jacob but kept a firm hold on sunny as he led the way through the foyer into the living room jacob got the impression of bold colors mixed with pastels and again elegant a simple timeless elegance a few pieces of glittery crystal gleaming antiques and of course what he now realized was caroline stones stunning art if jacob was surprised to find her woven masterpieces so casually displayed on the walls he was speechless to see another spread on the floor as a rug have a seat william was saying as he walked thoughtlessly over what jacob considered a priceless work of art how about a drink no nothing thank you he was staring at an ornamental lemon tree in the window his own father nurtured the same type of plant youll have to have tea sunny said patting jacobs hand as she sat on the sofa beside him if you dont youll hurt daddys feelings of course he glanced up at william again and caught his narrowedeyed speculative look the phone in williams back pocket rang he ignored it recognizing the gleam in her fathers eye and wanting to delay the questions for the time being sunny dropped the banana peel in his hand id just love some daddy how about oriental ecstasy fine ill take care of it he disappeared through a doorway the phone still shrilling in his pocket sunny chuckled and put her hand on jacobs again i suppose i should warn you she tilted her head curious jacob was gawkingshe couldnt think of another word for his expressionat one of her mothers wall hangings jt would you like to tune in yes what i was going to warn you my fathers nosy hell ask you all kinds of questions most of them personal he cant help it all right he couldnt resist rising he walked over to the rectangle of cloth and ran his fingers over the soft material and bleeding colors beautiful isnt it yes its very beautiful she got up to stand beside him shes become a very well respected artist respected was a mild word for caroline stone her work was found behind glass in museums it was studied and revered by art students throughout the settled universe and he was here running his fingers over an exquisite piece of it she used to sell blankets and things for grocery money thats a myth i beg your pardon nothing he dropped his hand shoved it into his pocket for the first time since he had stepped off the ship he felt totally disoriented these were people he had learned about from study disks historical figures yet he was here in their home he was in love with their daughter how could he be in love with a woman who had lived and died centuries before he had been born panic he tasted it turning he gripped her arms reality solid and warm he was holding it in his hands sunny whats wrong he was so pale and his eyes were so dark what is it he just shook his head there was nothing he could say no words he knew to explain it instead he brought his mouth down on hers and let her flavor chase away the fear i love you i know moved by the desperation in his voice she lifted a hand to his cheek the urge to soothe and ease was still new to her well both get used to it eventually hello they drew apart to see caroline standing in the doorway her dark straight hair skimmed her shoulders beaded columns swung at her ears there was a small smile on her face a quietly lovely face that was animated by large amused eyes she was wearing a baggy mans shirt trim denim pants and beaded moccasins in her arms she held a gurgling baby mom sunny dashed across the room to hug both woman and child she was taller than caroline and had to bend slightly to give her the same enthusiastic kiss she had given her father laughing she took the baby then holding him above her head she began to turn in a circle hi sam hows it going oh youre getting so big he has his sisters appetite caroline pointed out grinning sunny planted the giggling baby on her hip jt this is my mother caroline and my brother king samuel jt carolines artists eyes had already seen the resemblance and made the connection you must be cals brother yes the sense of unreality came back as she crossed the room rather than offering a hand she kissed him we were hoping wed finally meet some of cals family hes very proud of you is he a trace of resentment came through in his tone caroline noticed it let it pass yes did your parents make the trip with you no they werent able to come oh the disappointment in her eyes was brief but sincere well i hope we can get together one day wheres will she asked sunny making tea of course please sit down youre an astrophysicist thats right he settled back on the sofa with caroline stone opposite him and sunny on the floor with the baby jts into time travel at the moment time travel caroline smiled and crossed her slender legs willll go crazy though i think parallel universes are his current interest what happened to reincarnation hes still a staunch disciple hes convinced he was a member of the first continental congress always the revolutionary sunny tickled her brothers belly as she smiled up at jacob my father likes to pick controversial subjects so he can argue about them oh look sams crawling a newly acquired skill with two parts pride and one part wonder caroline watched her chubby towheaded son pull himself across the rug wills already taken a easeful of videos im entitled william said as he wheeled in a tea cart as i remember sunny went from crawl to walk to run so fast we hardly had time to blink and you recorded it all on that secondhand movie camera caroline rose stepped over her son and kissed will before she helped him with the tea so william had already gone over his list of questions in the kitchen did you just get into portland this afternoon jacob told him and accepted his cup of tea you were looking for cal when you tracked down sunny thats right he sipped trying to resolve himself to the fact that he was drinking herbal delight with the man who had invented it hed given me the coordinates nearly slipped out directions to the cabin the cabin the teacup paused on the way to williams lips youve been to the cabinwith sunny we had a hell of a snowstorm last week sunny laid a hand lightly on her fathers knee lost power for a couple of days together she managed to keep her expression bland its hard to lose it separately in a space as small as the cabin amused caroline watched her son crawl over jacobs feet its a shame you missed cal and libby i hope you plan to wait until they get back the baby was chewing on his pant leg after setting his teacup aside jacob reached down to set sam in his lap ill wait where william wanted to know sunny dug her fingers into her fathers knee did you know that jts experimenting with time travel time travel fascination warred with paternity paternity won just how long were you two together in the mountains jacob let sam gnaw on his index finger a couple of weeks really his eyes narrowed and he laid a proprietary hand on sunnys shoulder i suppose the snow kept you from making more suitable arrangements sunny rolled her eyes caroline sighed jacob ran a hand over sams fine pale hair the arrangement suited me well enough ill bet it did william leaned forward then hissed as sunny dug again shooting for the worn denim at his knees did you know jt that my father absconded she liked the word enjoyed rolling it off of her tongue with my mother when she was sixteen seventeen william corrected not quite this from caroline as she sipped her tea he shot her a look you were only a couple months shy and that was entirely different naturally sunny agreed it was the times william muttered it was the sixties sunny kissed his sore knee that explains everything you had to be there besides we wouldnt have had to elope if caros father hadnt been so interfering and unreasonable im sure youre right sunny fluttered her lashes at him theres nothing worse than a father who pokes his nose in where it doesnt belong he caught her nose between his two fingers and twisted watch it she just grinned tell me is granddad speaking to you yet barely except when they make fools of themselves over sam caroline put in hes almost forgiven us for the fact that you and libby werent around for him to spoil when you were babies would you like me to take sam jt no hes fine the baby was playing with jacobs fingers gurgling to them and sampling one occasionally he looks like you he murmured turning to sunny her lips curved she couldnt have explained how it made her feel to watch him cuddle a baby on his lap i like to think so william drummed his fingers on the arm of his chair the hornblower boys seemed to have some kind of charm that worked on his daughters though hed decided cal was nearly good enough for libby he was reserving judgment on this one so youre a scientist william had a great deal of respect for scientists but that didnt mean he was ready to accept the picture of his daughter snuggled up with one in his cabin without any electricity yes talkative son of a gun william thought and prodded deeper astrophysics thats right where did you study maybe youd like his grade point average sunny muttered shut up william patted her head ive always been fascinated with space you see this time his smile was cautiously friendly so im interested if this was the game jacob decided he could play it i got my law degree from princeton law sunny said you never told me you didnt ask his eyes dipped to her then zeroed in on her father again physics started out as a hobby an unusual one william mused yes jacob smiled like growing herbs william had to laugh about time travel take a break will caroline advised him you can grill the man more later your son needs to be changed and its my turn william unfolded his long legs he crossed to jacob his heart turning to mush as sam lifted up his chubby arms theres my boy have some more tea he told jacob well talk about those experiments of yours later ill come with you sunny pushed herself up off the floor you can show me all the toys you bought him since last month wait till you see this train he said as they walked out will likes to pretend the toys are for sam caroline smiled as she rose to fill jacobs cup again i hope youre not too annoyed by what the spanish inquisition she moved back to sit on the arm of her chair she reminded him of sunny actually it was pretty mild compared to what he put cal through apparently cal passed we love him very much nothing would have made will happier than to bring him into the business but cal has to fly as im sure you know he never wanted anything else it shows it was the same with libby she always knew what she wanted its more difficult for sunny i wonder sometimes if all that energy and intelligence hasnt given her too many choices youd understand that at his questioning look she continued from a law degree from princeton to astrophysics thats quite a leap with a brief turn at professional boxing in between he shrugged it takes some of us longer to make up our minds and those kind of people usually jump in with both feet sunny does she was subtler than her husband jacob thought and more difficult to put off shes the most fascinating woman ive ever met and he is in love with her caroline reflected not happy about it but in love sunnys like a tapestry woven in bold colors some of the threads are incredibly strong and durable others are impossibly delicate the result is admirable but a work of art needs love as well as admiration she lifted her hands shed hate to know i described her that way his gaze shifted to the vivid blending colors of the wall hanging she wouldnt care for the delicate no caroline felt a tug of regret and of relief so he knew her younger daughter and he understood her its oldfashioned i suppose but all will and i really want is to know that shes happy its not oldfashioned his mother had said almost the same words to him about cal before hed left home with a sigh caroline turned to glance at the wall hanging he was studying thats one of my older pieces i made that while i was pregnant with sunny i sold most of my work back then but for some reason i held on to this one its beautiful on impulse she rose to take it down from the wall her fingers slid over it she remembered sitting at her handmade loom watching the sunlight play on the colors as she chose them blended them with will in the garden libby sleeping on a blanket spread on the grass and a child moving in her womb the image was all the sweeter for the time that had passed between id like you to have it if she had offered him a rembrandt or an okeeffe he would have been no more stunned i couldnt why not its priceless she laughed at that oh my agent puts prices on my work ridiculous prices for the most part id hate to think that my pieces will only end up in art galleries or museums she folded it it would mean a lot more if i knew some of them were being enjoyed by my family when he said nothing she held it out my daughter took your brothers name that makes us family he didnt want to feel like family he needed to hold on to his resentment to go on thinking of caroline and william stone as names in history but he found himself reaching out and taking the soft cloth thank you the nursery was painted a soft green an antique iron crib in white was draped with a blanket caroline had woven in pastels the room was full of toys many of which sam would have no interest in for years but there were dozens of stuffed animals ranging from elephants to the traditional teddy bear picking one up sunny waited until her father laid sam on the changing table youre pathetic maybe you dont remember the punishment for sass will said mildly as he unsnapped sams overalls im a little too big for you to make me sit in a chair until i apologize he shot her a look dont bet on it dad sighing she set the bear aside from the time i turned thirteen youve interrogated every male ive brought into the house i like to know who my daughters seeing socially theres no crime in that there is the way you do it sam gurgled and kicked his feet as will freed him of his diaper will dusted powder on him enjoying the scent i liked you better when you were this size tough she walked over to rest her elbow on his shoulder even at her most rebellious shed never been able to do anything but love him i suppose youre going to grill the girls sam brings home when he starts dating of course im not sexist neither was he stupid do you want to tell me that you and jt have been spending a few platonic days in the cabin no i didnt think so he fastened a fresh diaper on his son life had been so simple he thought when all hed had to worry about was diaper rash and teething sunny you havent known the man more than a few weeks she stuck her tongue in her cheek does this mean youve changed your views on free love the sexual revolution is over he snapped sams overalls again for several very good reasons she held up a hand before you start listing them why dont i tell you i agree with you that took some of the wind out of his sails sunny had come by her argumentative nature honestly good then we understand each other that promiscuity is neither morally or ethically correct or physically wise absolutely ive never been promiscuous im relieved to hear it seeing sams eyes droop will took him to the crib after winding up a mobile of circus animals he laid his son down i didnt say i was a virgin will wincedhe hated to think of himself as a fusty prudethen sighed i guess i suspected as much want to make me sit in a chair until i apologize his lips quirked i dont think it would do much good at this point its not that i dont trust your judgment sunbeam shed never been able to resist him moving closer she took his face in her hands and kissed him but your judgment is so much better naturally he grinned and patted her bottom its one of the few advantages of hitting forty youll never be forty she managed to keep her lips from curving dad i might as well confess i have been with a man before not that weasely carl lommins she made a face give me some credit and dont interruptim making a point when i was with someone it was because i was fond of him because there was mutual respect and there was responsibility you taught me that you and mom so youre telling me im not supposed to worry about your relationship with jt no im not telling you not to worry but i am telling you im not fond of him well then im in love with him he studied her eyes when a man had been in love passionately with the same woman for most of his life he recognized the signs it was time to accept that he had seen those signs on his daughters face the moment she had walked in the door and and what she countered what are you going to do about it im going to marry him the statement surprised her enough to make her laugh he doesnt know it yet because i just figured it out myself when he goes back east im going with him and if he objects her chin came up hell have to learn to live with it i guess the problem is youre too much like me she put her arms around his neck to hug him close i wont like being so far away but hes what i want if he makes you happy william drew her away he damn well better make you happy i dont intend to give him a choice chapter itll be fun sunny navigated into a narrow parking space under a brightly lit sign that aggressively flashed club rendezvous jacob studied the winking colored lights with some doubt and she patted his hand trust me pal we need this if you say so i do besides if i find out you cant dance i want to be able to dump you now and save time she just laughed when he twisted her ear and you owe me why is that she flipped down the visor and gave what she could see of her face a quick check in the mirror on impulse she pulled out a lipstick and painted her mouth a vivid red because if i hadnt been so quick with the excuses youd be eating dinner at my parents i liked your parents touched she leaned over to kiss his cheek seeing shed left the imprint of her lips there she rubbed at it with her thumb damn it hold still a minute she complained when he backed away ive just about got it satisfied she dropped the tube of lipstick back in her bag i know you like my parents so do i but youd never have gotten nachos and margaritas at will and caros she lowered her voice my mother cooks taking no chances he rubbed at his cheek himself is that a crime in this state she cooks things like alfalfa fondue oh once hed managed to imagine it hed decided he much preferred the spicy mexican meal they had shared a short time before i guess i do owe you your very life she agreed opening her door she squeezed herself through the narrow opening between it and the neighboring car the flashing lights danced over her making her look exactly as she wasexciting and exotic and after a couple of weeks in natures bosom i figure we could both use some live musicthe louder the bettera rowdy crowd and some air clogged with cigarette smoke sounds like paradise he managed with some effort to push himself out the other door sunny i dont feel right about you exchanging all your currency she lifted both brows halfamused halfpuzzled by his phrasing you exchange currency when you go into a foreign country what ive been doing is called spending money whatever i dont have any with me to spend she thought it was a pity that a man so obviously intelligent and dedicated should earn a small salary dont worry about it shed only started counting pennies herself since shed become selfsupporting so far she hadnt shown much of a knack for it if i get to philadelphia you can pick up the tab well talk about it later he needed to change the subject and he found the answer close at hand i wanted to ask you what you call that outfit youre wearing this she glanced down at the snug short and strapless red leather dress under her winter coat sexy she decided running a tongue over her teeth what do you call it well talk about that later too with her arm through his she crossed the broken sidewalk the swatch of formfitting leather didnt provide much protection against the wind but it felt good to wear something other than jeans it felt even better to note how often jacobs gaze skimmed over her legs the cold was forgotten when she opened the door to a blast of heat and music ah civilization he saw only a dim room dazzled by intermittent flashes of light the music was every bit as loud as shed promised pulsing with bass blaring with horns he could smell smoke and liquor sweat and perfume through it all was the constant din of voices and laughter while he took it in she passed their coats to the checker on duty and slipped the stub in her bag she was right hed needed itnot just the sensory stimulation not just the anonymous crowd but also the firsthand look at twentiethcentury socializing overall there was very little difference from what he might have found in his own time people then and then tended to gather together for their entertainment they wanted music and company food and drink times might change but peoples needs were basically the same come on she was dragging him through the crowd to where tables were crammed together on two levels on the first was a long bar there was a man rather than a synthetic behind it serving drink and setting out bowls filled with some kind of finger food people crowded there hip to hip on the second level was a half circle of stage where the musicians performed jacob counted eight of them in various kinds of dress holding instruments that pitched a wall of sound that roared out of tall boxes on either corner of the stage in front of them on a small square of floor tangles of arms and legs and bodies twisted in various ways to the beat he noted the costumes they chose and saw that there was no standard snug pants and baggy ones long skirts and brief ones vivid colors and unrelieved black women wore shoes flat to the floor or like sunny shoes with slender spikes at the back he imagined this meant those particular women wanted to be taller but it had the side effect of making it very pleasant to look at their legs he appreciated the style of nonconformity the healthy expression of individual tastes he knew there had been a space of time between this and his own when society in general had accepted a uniform a brief period jacob mused but it must have been a miserably dull one as he stood and observed waitresses in short skirts bustled on both levels balancing trays and scribbling the orders shouted at them inefficient he thought but interesting it was simpler to press a button on an order box and receive your requirements from a speedy droid but it was a bit friendlier this way with her hand in his sunny led him up a short flight of curving stairs and began to scout around for an empty table i forgot it was saturday night she shouted at him its always a madhouse on saturdays why date night pal she said and laughed dont worry well squeeze in somewhere but she abandoned her search to smile at him what do you think he lifted a hand to toy with the trio of balls that hung from slender chains at her ears i like it the marauders are good the band she gestured as the sax player went into a screaming solo theyre very hot out here in here he corrected its hot in here no i mean never mind someone bumped her from behind taking it in stride she wound her arms around jacobs neck i guess this is our first date he ignored the crowd and kissed her hows it going so far just dandy taking that to mean good he kissed her again her satisfied sigh set off a chain reaction inside him we could always just stand here he said directly in her ear i dont think anyone would notice you were right she said on another sigh it is hot in here maybe we should just sunny someone caught her by the waist spun her around and ending on a dip pressed a hard wet kiss to her mouth baby youre back marco whats left of me ive been pining away for weeks he slung a friendly arm around her shoulders whered you disappear to the mountains she smiled pleased to see him he was skinny unpretentious and harmless despite the dramatic kiss they had decided years before not to complicate their friendship with romance hows the real world dogeatdog love thank god he glanced over her shoulder and found himself being burned alive by a pair of direct green eyes ah whos your friend jt she laid a hand on jacobs arm this is marco an old poker buddy you dont want to play with jt marco hes murder marco didnt have to be told twice how ya doing he didnt offer his hand because he wanted to keep it all right jacob measured him he figured if the man kissed sunny again it would be simple enough to break his skinny neck jt happens to be the brother of my sisters husband small world jacob didnt bat an eye smaller than you think right if marco had been wearing a tie he would have loosened it but with his collar already open he didnt have a clue how to ease the constriction in his throat listen do you guys need a table absolutely we pulled some together back there if you want to climb in okay she looked up at jacob okay sure he was already annoyed with himself the jealousy had been an emotional rather than an intellectual reaction he watched sunnys long legs as she walked between the tables and an entirely justified reaction maybe men had progressed but they had always been would always be territorial half a dozen people greeted sunny by name as they stopped at the table because most of the introductions were lost in the roar of the music jacob only nodded as he took his seat this rounds on me marco announced when he finally managed to flag down a waitress same thing he told her plus a glass of chardonnay for the lady and he lifted a brow at jacob a beer thanks no problem i sold three cars today good for you sunny leaned over a bit easily pitching her voice above the noise as she elaborated for jacobs benefit marcos a car dealer jacob got the image of marco shuffling automobiles then passing them around a poker table congratulations seemed the safest possible comment i do okay just let me know if youre in the market we got in a shipment of real honeys this week jacob spared a glance at the brunette on his other side as she rubbed her arm against his ill do that relieved that sunnys new friend no longer looked as though he wanted to rearrange his face marco shifted his chair a little closer so what do you drive jt there was a universal moan around the table marco accepted it with a goodnatured shrug and popped a handful of peanuts into his mouth hey its my job like taking little old ladies for test drives is a job someone joked its a living marco grinned none of us are rocket scientists jt is sunny said are you the brunette scooted her chair closer she had big brown eyes jacob noted eyes that just brimmed with invitations in a manner of speaking oh i just love brainy men amused jacob picked up the beer the waitress set in front of him he caught the look sunny shot across the table he recognized it jealousy it appeared was contagious nothing could have pleased him more he took a long swig and tolerated the smoke the brunette blew in his direction it was no use telling her that she was endangering her very attractively packaged lungs do you she kept her eyes on his as she slowly crushed out the cigarette oh yes im very attracted to intelligence lets dance sunny shoved back her chair and snagged jacobs sleeve nice try sheila she muttered and dragged jacob onto the dance floor is that her name sheila she turned to him into him and tilted her chin upward who wants to know dont you want me to be nice to your friends he settled his hands on her hips with her heels her eyes were level with his and her body fit his perfectly no her mouth moved into a pout as she twined her arms around his neck at least not the stacked ones curious he looked back at the table is she stacked as if you didnt notice unfortunately her iq measures the same as her bustline i like your iq better good thinking grinning she brushed a kiss over his mouth i cant blame her for giving it her best shot youre awfully cute small dogs are cute he muttered babies are cute you like babies yes why not she toyed with the ends of his hair just checking anyway you are cute and sexy she took a playful nip at his bottom lip and brainy she settled her cheek against his as he drew her closer and mine she thought all mine what does the t stand for she murmured which j in jt nothing it has to stand for something she let out a sound of pleasure you dance very well the sax was playing again crying the blues this time sunnys eyes dipped closed as jacob molded her against him they were hardly moving in the press of bodies surrounding them as his hands roamed over her back and his lips down her throat she didnt care if they ever moved again her thighs brushed against his the leather fitted her like a second skin one he was already imagining peeling away from her as he turned her in his arms slowly sinuously he shifted to taste the bare flesh of her shoulder even over the echoing music he could hear her skin humming lazily he trailed his lips back to toy with hers you smell incredible like spring in the desert hot with some lingering trace of flowers gone wild unable to resist she deepened the kiss until her head swam jt yes im not sure but i think we could get arrested for this it would be worth it she opened her eyes met his lets go home i dont like crowds the way i used to they stayed a week so that she could drag him to movies malls more clubs she attributed his constant fascination to the fact that hed never been in the northwest before each time they went out it was as though he were seeing things for the first time because of that she enjoyed the hours and the errands more than she ever had when they were alone when she trembled in his arms she realized that it didnt matter where they were they were together and if with each passing moment she fell more deeply in love she did so freely and with absolute joy for the first time in her life she began to think of a future with a man one man she imagined passing through the years with himnot always content but always satisfied she thought of a home and if white picket fences and car pools didnt enter the fantasy children did she could picture the arguments the noise and the laughter before much longer she thought they would talk about it they would plan he allowed himself the week a handful of days meant so little in the vastness of time and meant so much to him he recorded everything he could and branded the rest on his memory he didnt mean to forget not an instant yet he worried about how he could tell her where he had to travel when he left her so that it would hurt the least more he worried because he was no longer sure he had the courage to live without her when they left to go back to the cabin he told himself that it was the beginning of the end if it had to endand he saw no alternativeit would end honestly he would tell her everything youre so quiet she said as they turned up the long bumpy road that led to the cabin i was thinking well thats fine but you havent picked one fight in five hours im worried about you i dont want to fight with you now im really worried shed known that something was on his mind something that caused her palms to sweat deliberately she made her voice light and cheerful well be back in a few minutes once youre trapped inside the cabin hauling wood and eating out of a can youll be your old cranky self sunny we have to talk she moistened her lips all right her nerves began to hum as she stopped the car in front of the cabin before or after we unload now it had to be now he took her hand and said the first words that came to mind i love you so much the little fist of fear in her stomach unclenched were never going to fight if you keep talking like that she shifted closer to kiss his cheek it was then that she noticed the smoke pumping out of the chimney jacob someones here what in the cabin she saw the front door open libby with a laugh she shoved the car door open and bounded out libby you scared me to death as jacob watched she threw her arms around a slim brunette look at you youre so tanned theres a lot of sun in bora bora libby kissed her sisters cheeks when we got back last night we thought youd skipped out on us just a quick trip into the real world to recharge libbys laugh was smooth and easy she knew her sister very well thats what i told cal all your books were still here suddenly she gripped both of sunnys hands oh sunny im so glad youre back i cant wait to tell you i a movement caught her eye glancing over she saw jacob as he climbed out of the land rover as their eyes met her half smile of greeting faded and her fingers tightened on sunnys what what is it oh smiling sunny turned guess who dropped in this is jacob cals brother i know libby felt as though the ground had vanished from under her feet shed seen his face before in the picture cal had kept on his ship but this was no picture it was a fleshandblood man a furious one as they stared at each other in silence the blood seeped slowly out of her face hes come for cal she thought and had to bite back the scream of protest that rose into her throat shes terrified he realized something moved inside him that he stubbornly ignored he wouldnt feel for her he wouldnt think of her as anything but the obstacle preventing his brother from returning home jt instinctively sunny put a protective arm around libbys shoulders there was something here she realized and she was the only one not in on the secret libby youre shivering you shouldnt be standing out here without a coat lets go inside she tossed a look back over her shoulder lets all go inside im all right shaken libby walked inside to the fire and tried to warm her icy hands no amount of heat could warm her trembling heart she wouldnt look at him again not until she had herself under some kind of control in the back of her mind the little germ of fear had lived someday they would come for him but she hadnt believed it would be so soon theyd had so little time time she thought bitterly it was a word she could learn to hate sunny stood between them baffled the tension was so thick in the small room that she could smell it as easily as the woodsmoke all right she looked from libbys rigid back to jacobs stony face without any idea who she should go to would either of you like to tell me whats going on hey libby if that was that sexy sister of yours i want to tell her barefoot his sweatshirt torn cal strode in from the kitchen everyone turned toward him it was like a slow deliberate ballet his easy grin froze all motion stopped jt his voice was hardly more than a whisper as joy and disbelief flooded through him jt he said again then with a whoop he was across the room grabbing his brother in a hard hug oh god jacob its really you libby watched them until tears blurred her vision and she turned away sunny beamed the two brothers held each other in a fierce embrace she could see the emotions run over jacobs face and found them beautiful i cant believe it cal murmured pulling his brother back to study to devour his face youre really here how he kept his hands on cals arms needing the simple and tangible contact the same way as you but with more finesse you look good somehow hed expected to find cal pale and thin and tired from coping with the twentieth century instead his brother was tanned alert and obviously happy you too his smile faded a bit mom dad theyre fine cal nodded it was a hurt he had learned to live with you got my message i couldnt be sure we received it jacob said dully youve met libby then regret vanished turning he held a hand out for his wife she didnt move weve met jacob inclined his head and waited she could take the first step youll both have a lot to talk about using every ounce of effort she managed to keep her voice steady libby her name was a murmur as cal crossed to her he laid a hand on her cheek until she lifted her eyes to his he saw the love and the fear in them dont im fine calling up more strength she squeezed his hand i have some things to do upstairs you two should catch up she shifted her glance to jacob i know youve missed each other turning she fled up the stairs sunny shifted her gaze from her sisters retreating back to cals unsmiling face and then to jacobs angry eyes what the hell is going on here go up with her will you cal laid a hand on her shoulder but continued to look after his wife i dont want her to be alone all right she could already see just by looking at the two of them that shed get no explanations here shed damn well get one from libby cal waited until sunny had climbed the stairs facing his brother again he recognized the fury the passion and the hurt in him we have to talk yes not here he thought of his wife no jacob thought of sunny well go to my ship sunny paused outside the bedroom door taking a deep breath she pushed it open libby sat on the edge of the bed hands folded there were no tears tears would have been less heartbreaking than the despair on her face honey what is it libby felt as though she were in a dream looking up she focused on the reality of her sister how long has he been here about three weeks sunny sat on the bed to take libbys hand in hers talk to me i thought youd be happy to finally meet cals brother i amfor him hoping that much was true she pressed a hand to her jittery stomach did he explain to you why hes here where hes from of course puzzled sunny gave her a little shake come on libby snap out of it jts a little rough around the edges but he isnt a monster hes just concerned about cal and maybe a little hurt that he chose you and settled here oh god unable to sit libby rose to pace to the window she heard the hum of an engine and saw the land rover disappear into the forest i would have let him go she said quietly and closed her eyes back then i was prepared to i couldnt have asked him to give up his family his life but now i cant let him go i wont where would he go libby rested her head on the cool glass of the window back she laughed a little forward jacob must have told you how impossibly complicated it all is rising sunny walked over to lay her hands on libbys shoulders they were taut like bundles of wire automatically she worked to relax them cals a grown man libby and staying here was his choice jts just going to have to accept that but will he when he first got here jt was angry and resentful he just wasnt able to understand cals feelings but things have changed for both of us slowly libby turned what was in her sisters heart was clearly written in her eyes libby felt a lurch of panic oh sunny hey dont look at me like that she grinned im in love not terminally ill but what are you going to do im going to go back with him with an inarticulate cry libby threw her arms around sunnys neck she clung rocking for lords sake libby youre as bad as jacob its only philadelphia youre acting like im going to set up housekeeping on pluto there arent any settled colonies on pluto with a strangled laugh sunny pulled away well i guess that leaves that out well have to make do with a condo in philly libby studied sunnys face and her expression gradually changed the tears that had dampened her eyes dried you dont understand do you i understand that i love jt and he loves me we havent talked about life commitments yet but its only a matter of time she stopped wary libby why are you looking at me as though you want to wring my neck not yours libbys voice had firmed she might be the quieter of the two but when those she loved were threatened she could put an amazon queen to shame the bastard i beg your pardon i said hes a bastard sisterly love notwithstanding sunnys hackles were rising now look libby she shook her head she wasnt about to be stopped now did he tell you he loved you nearly out of patience sunny snapped off an oath then yes and youve gone to bed with him sunnys eyes narrowed have you been taking lessons from dad of course youve gone to bed with him libby muttered pacing the room hes made you fall in love with him taken you to bed and hasnt had the decency to tell you sunnys foot was tapping a rapid tattoo tell me what that he and cal are from the twentythird century sunnys foot stopped in the sudden silence she gaped at libby all that sun she thought her poor sister had had her brain fried in bora bora slowly she crossed the room lib i want you to lie down while i get you a cold cloth no still fueled by fury libby shook her head you sit down while i go get you a brandy trust me youre going to need it when cal stepped onto the bridge of the ship the wave of nostalgia rolled over him like warm water the cargo planes he piloted in the life hed chosen satisfied his need to fly but they werent much of a challenge unable to resist he ran his hands over the command console shes a beauty jt new model yes i thought it best to have it designed specifically for this trip we made some adjustments for heat and maneuverability cal couldnt prevent his hand from gripping the throttle id like to take her up see what she can do be my guest cal laughed wed be spotted in the first thousand miles and find ourselves on the front page of the national enquirer which is you have to see some things for yourself reluctantly he turned away from the console and temptation again he studied jacobs face feature by feature god its good to see you how could you do it cal blowing out a long breath he sat in the pilots chair its a long story i read the report cal gave him a long steady look some things dont come through in reports youve seen her yes ive seen her i love her jt i couldnt begin to tell you how much jacob felt a spark of empathy and banked it down he couldnt think of sunny now we thought you were dead almost six months im sorry are you jacob swung to the viewscreen to stare out at the snow five months and twentythree days after you were reported lost your ship crash landed about sixty kilometers from the mcdowell base in the baja empty we had your reports his gaze flashed back to his brother and i had to watch mom and dad grieve all over again i wanted you to know where i was and why jt i didnt plan this you saw the log i saw it his jaw set you should be dead i calculated the probability factor of you pulling out of that void in one piece there was none for the first time he smiled youve always been a hell of a pilot cal yeah but you cant input fate into computer banks hed thought about that long and hard over the past months i was meant for libby jt you can calculate into the next millennium and that wont change as much as i love you i cant leave her and go back in silence jt studied him he hated most of all that he understood weeks before only weeks he would have argued shouted he would have locked cal in a cabin and taken off for home without giving him a choice does she love you as much a ghost of a smile played on cals lips she never asked me to stay in fact she did everything she could to help me prepare for the return trip she even asked to go with me she would have given up everything instead you stayed here you gave up everything do you think it was easy for me to make the choice cal demanded he pushed himself out of the chair driven by fury and frustration it was the hardest thing ive ever done damn it there was no choice i didnt know if the ship would make it back and i couldnt risk her life i was prepared to risk my own but not hers if i had left her i would have been right back in the void again and i wouldnt have cared jacob didnt want to understand but he did ive spent two years working on perfecting this timetravel procedure having this ship designed finetuning all the equations im not saying that more work more study isnt necessary but i made it without any major problems the success factor is come home cal and bring her with you cal stared at the viewscreen hed learned a great deal over the past year the most important lesson was that life was not simple the choices to be made could not be made lightly theres another piece of data you havent considered jt libbys pregnant chapter she didnt speak in the past thirty minutes sunny had gone from believing her sister had a wicked case of sunstroke to wondering if she herself had gone quietly mad without noticing it the twentythird century black holes spaceships sunny had finally lapsed into silence as libby had recounted a story about a mission to marsdear lord marsand cals fateful encounter with an uncharted black hole which through a combination of luck skill and the mysterious hand of destiny had shot him backward from the middle of the twentythird century to the spring of last year the confused cal an intergalactic cargo pilot with an affection for flying and poetry had become a time traveler time travel oh god she thought time travel she remembered clearly the faint smile on jacobs face when he had told her of his current experiments but that didnt meanno she took a steadying breath determined to control her wandering imagination it had to be some sort of joke people did not accidentally or otherwise zoom through time and fall in love jacob was from philadelphia she reminded herself as she gulped down brandy he was a scientist with a bad attitude and that was all you dont believe me libby said with a sigh care and patience sunny told herself as she dragged a hand through her hair her sister needed care and patience honey lets just take this slow you think im making it up im not sure what i think she took a cleansing breath okay youre trying to tell me that cal a former captain inwhat was it the international space force right that he crashed his spaceship in the forest after being sent through time by an encounter with a black hole shed hoped that when she said it herself when libby heard it repeated her sister would come out of whatever spell she was in but libby just nodded thats fairly accurate fairly accurate sunny tried again and now jacob going about it through more organized methods followed the same route so he could visit with his brother he wants to take him back i could see it by the way he looked at me the misery on libbys face had sunny reaching out a hand cal loves you nothing jt did or didnt do could change that i no but sunny cant you see he didnt pop up here on impulse he must have worked for months even years to find the way if a mans obsessed with something all right she interrupted he didnt pop up here on impulse for reasons ive never fully understood hes angry that cal married you and decided to live in oregon not just oregon libby shot back twentiethcentury oregon now take it slow honey i know youre upset but upset libby countered damn right im upset the man traveled over two hundred years and hes not going to want to go back without cal at a loss sunny flopped back on the bed libby youve got to get ahold of yourself youre the sensible one remember you have to know this is all nonsense okay deciding on a different tack she took a deep breath can you tell me honestly tell me that you havent noticed something odd about jt she held up a hand before sunny could answer not just eccentric not just endearingly different but downright odd well i ah taking her sisters hesitation for agreement she pressed on how did he get here i dont know what you mean i mean did he drive up in a car i didnt notice one no he didnt come in a car at least she rubbed her suddenly damp hands on her thighs he walked out of the woods walked out of the woods libby nodded grimly in the middle of winter lib ill concede that jts a little unusual the way he seems fascinated or puzzled by ordinary objects she remembered the kitchen faucet well yes the way he doesnt always understand colloquialisms or phrases that too butlibby just because the man acts a little odd occasionally and has a hard time with slang doesnt mean hes an alien from outer space not an alien libby said patiently hes as human as you or i hes just from the twentythird century oh is that all maybe theres a simpler way to convince you she rose and took sunnys hand whatever happens between cal and me well work it out together but you have to understand it all of it im only doing this because you have a right to know what youre walking into she nodded she didnt dare speak because too much of what libby had told her made a horrible kind of sense and she was afraid very afraid with competent movements libby took what seemed to be a watch from the deep drawer of her desk while sunny looked on she attached a line of clear wire from the stem of the watch to the computer after booting up the machine she gestured come on over cautious sunny joined her what is that thing its cals wrist unit computer working sunny jumped back a foot at the sound of the mechanical voice and sent a chair tumbling how did you do that with a mix of twentiethcentury and twentythirdcentury technology but but but you havent seen anything yet libby warned and faced the screen again computer relate file information on jacob hornblower hornblower jacob born philadelphia june astrophysicist currently head of ap department at durnam science laboratory philadelphia graduated princeton university magna cum laude earned degree in law status aaa doctorate in astrophysics from obannion named mvp intergalactic softball league position pitcher era sunny bit back a hysterical giggle stop the computer went silent on rubbery legs sunny stepped back until she collided with the bed its true isnt it yes take a few deep breaths libby advised her it takes a while to absorb it he told me he was experimenting with time travel she felt the laughter bubble up again hot and uncontrollable thats a good one she squeezed her eyes shut it was a dream she told herself just a ridiculous dream but when she opened her eyes again everything was the same looks like the jokes on me she heard the door slam on the floor below instantly she was on her feet im going to have this out with him right now why dont you libby cut herself off when sunny rounded on her never mind she sunk back on the bed as sunny charged down the stairs but it was cal she ran into not jacob where is he she demanded hes ah out is libby upstairs yes feet spread eyes challenging she blocked the stairs shes upset she neednt be because what she saw in his eyes answered some of her questions she relaxed im glad you realize what a lucky jerk you are caleb i love you too she relented enough to kiss him later she decided later she would think all this through and probably go insane but for now she had a job to do i want to know where your creep of a brother is and dont try to put me off libby told me but he was still cautious told you what she tilted her head is it too late to welcome you to the twentieth century a new smile tugged at his mouth no jts out in his ship its about five kilometers northeast just follow the tracks he caught her arm before she could rush off hes going through a bad time sunny ive hurt him not nearly as much as im going to he started to speak again but he remembered that jacob had always been able to take care of himself he went upstairs to his wife she was still sitting on the bed staring at but not out of the window her face was composed her hands folded in her lap so that they pressed lightly against the life growing in her looking at her caleb felt a single stunning wave of love hi she jolted struggled to smile hi busy day before he could speak she sprang up ive got a dozen things to do i havent finished unpacking and i really ought to fix something special for dinner tonight wait a minute he took her arms before she could walk by then simply brought her into his i love you libby i know with her head on his shoulder she held on no i dont think you do gently he pulled her away to study her face even after all this time i dont think you do how could you think i would leave then or now she just shook her head sit down he murmured caleb i dont know what to say to you she sat twining her nervous fingers together i can only imagine how you must feel having your brother here when you thought youd never see him again being reminded of everything you gave up and the people you left behind are you finished her only answer was a miserable shrug jt gave me a copy of a letter he found when he dug up our time capsule he pulled her fingers apart to link them with his as he sat beside her he didnt read it he continued it was still in the envelope how did he copy it if it was still in she caught herself and managed a small laugh stupid question you put it in the capsule so id be able to read it when i got back he took it out of his pocket libby frowned at it it looked precisely as it had when shed slipped it into the box and yet the paper was different she realized when she touched it thicker stronger and she added to herself probably not paper at all at least not as she thought of paper i stopped on the way back from the ship to read it he spread the letter in his lap if i had been crazy enough to leave you this would have brought me back somehow it wasnt meant to do that i know he took her hand kissed it what it means is a great deal to me do you remember what you wrote some of it this part he looked down at the letter i wanted you to know that in my heart i wanted you to be where you belonged he set the letter aside did you mean that yes then youll be happy to know that im exactly where i belong with long slow kisses he eased her back on the bed and so are you sunny didnt have any trouble finding the tracks there were only two sets both from the land rover one leading away from the cabin and one leading back her face grim she kept her hands firm on the wheel and her mind empty she wouldnt think not yet once she had begun to think it would probably send her screaming off a cliff true shed always had an affection for the unusual but this this was going a bit too far when she saw the ship nestled comfortably on a blanket of snow she hit the brakes too hard and sent the land rover skidding sideways it looked as big as a house she imagined it was half the size of the cargo ship cal had piloted probably sleeker jazzier its smooth white finish gleamed in the sunlight she saw what appeared to be a window that banded around the bow as she gaped jacob stepped up to it and looked out at her the sight of him inside it inside of something that shouldnt even exist turned her blank astonishment back into fury abandoning the land rover she leaped out and stormed over to the ship he released the hatch the door slid silently open and a set of stairs flowed out she mounted them moving a little slower now going over the speech hed planned jacob reached out to take her hand and help her through the entranceway sunny i whatever he had planned to say was interrupted when her fisted hand connected solidly with his jaw off balance and seeing stars he stumbled back and landed hard on the deck she loomed over him righteous fury glowing in her eyes get up you miserable coward so i can hit you again he sat where he was for a moment rubbing a hand over his jaw he didnt mind the blow so much he knew hed had it coming but he didnt care to be called a coward under the circumstances though it was best to let her get it all out of her system youre upset upset the word hissed out between her teeth ill show you upset because he obviously wasnt going to get up she dived onto nun she knocked the wind out of him with another punch as he grappled for her hands damn it sunny stop im going to have to hurt you hurt me blind with anger she struck out as he struggled to roll on top of her this time her knee slipped by his guard and landed dead on as the air whistled out of his lungs he collapsed on top of her get off me you creep he couldnt have moved if his life had depended on it the pain deserved or not was like a silvery shimmer from crotch to brain his only defense was his weight as he sprawled breathlessly over her sunny he dragged air into his lungs and saw a new constellation your match he conceded the fight had drained out of her she didnt want him to know how weak and helpless she felt with her jaw tensed she prayed her voice wouldnt tremble i said get off me as soon as im sure im still intact if you let me get my wind back we can go another round he managed to lift his head she was crying huge silent tears welled up in her eyes and slid down her cheeks more stunned by them than by the blow he shook his head dont he brushed the tears away but more fell to replace them damn it sunny stop it let go of me he rolled aside determined to leave her alone until she composed herself before he realized it he was gathering her close dragging her onto his lap stroking her hair dont touch me her body was rigid anger and humiliation battled inside her i dont want you to touch me i know i have to you lied to me yeah he pressed his lips to her hair im sorry you used me no his arms tightened no you know better than that i dont know you at all she tried to arch away but he only cradled her closer abruptly she threw her arms around him burying her face against his throat i hate you ill hate you as long as i live the tears were no longer silent they poured out in hard racking sobs as she clung to him he said nothing had nothing to say the woman who had knocked him flat with a right hook he understood the one who clawed and spit and fought he knew how to handle this one this soft weeping bundle in his arms was a mystery defenseless heartbroken fragile and he fell in love with this sunny as well she clung to him hating herself she wanted to strike out to make him pay for breaking her heart but she could only hold on taking the comfort he offered carefully he rose with her in his arms he needed to soothe to protect to love he wanted to stroke her until her tears dried hold her until her body calmed again most of all he wanted to show her that of all the things hed done falling in love with her was the most important she couldnt stop though she despised every tear she couldnt fight him now at her weakest point now she could only hold on to him let the storm rage and find some small comfort in the gentle way he held her he took her into his cabin where the light was dim the bed was watersoft covered with pale blue sheets the walls were blue as well a quiet restful color still holding her he lay with her on the bed while her tears dampened his cheek when her sobs began to lessen he trailed his lips down her temple to her mouth her lips were wet and they were still trembling as his touched them she pulled away to roll onto her side sunny feeling awkward he touched her shoulder please talk to me she didnt bother to jerk his hand away she just stared at the pale blue wall i feel like such a fool crying over you he didnt know if any woman had ever done that before certainly none had ever cried in his arms i never wanted to hurt you being lied to always hurts i didnt lie i just didnt tell you the truth he could see the logic of it needed to but he doubted she could i was going to tell you everything today she nearly laughed do they still use that old chestnut in the twentythird century she had said it out loud the twentythird century and she was in what could only be called a spaceship with a man who wouldnt be born until she was long dead shed have preferred to believe it was all a dream but the pain was too real i came for my brother he told her i never planned to become involved with you to fall in love with you it happened too fast i was there remember look at me she shook her head lets just forget it jt a man like you probably thinks hes entitled to have a woman in every century i said look at me patience gone he pulled her back holding her by the shoulders so that she was forced to meet his eyes i love you the words seeped into her and weakened her resolve her only defense was heat apparently the definition of love has changed dont lose any sleep over it ill be fine will you listen to me it doesnt matter what you say then it wont hurt to listen she shook her head fiercely now that the tears were over she was ready to lash out again you never intended to stay with me to build a life with me it was just a temporary arrangement for you but i cant blame you for that you never promised you only implied and you never used the old candlelightandwine routine to romance stars into my eyes but the stars had been there she thought shed been blinded by them in any case im responsible for my own feelings but i can blame you and i can detest you for not being honest it was too complicated i didnt know how you would react i thought scientists were supposed to experiment you are a scientist arent you yes all right the fact is i just didnt want to think about anything but you when i was with you when she struggled to turn away again he held her still you wanted honesty so listen to it whatever i did it was because i couldnt stop myself i didnt want to stop myself if that was wrong it was because i stopped thinking with my head if i handled it badly it was because i didnt know how to approach you here now i didnt feel i could tell you about all of this and then i was falling in love and didnt know how to deal with it didnt know how you would expect me to frustrated he stroked her cheek sunny i didnt think it was possible to tell you the truth and i didnt know how he stopped swore if it had been possible i would have shown you more romance but i didnt have a gift for you a gift shed really believed she was too weary to become annoyed again shed been wrong what the hell are you talking about romance he repeated more than a little embarrassed attention flattery the giving of gifts thats the stupidest thing ive ever heard romance is that your superior species definition of romance she pushed his hands away idiot romance has nothing to do with presents or flattery it has to do with caring and compassion with sharing your hopes and your dreams it means being honest this is honest he lowered his mouth to hers she prepared to resist to hold him off with icy disdain but for the first time his mouth wasnt hungry it wasnt passionate it wasnt desperate it was instead infinitely tender the beauty of it shimmered through her like liquid sunlight her defensive front of disinterest melted away like snow in the spring he looked at her was there confusion in his eyes she wondered it couldnt matter she told herself she couldnt allow herself to care so much a second time but he laid a soothing hand on her cheek and touched his lips experimentally to hers he hadnt known being gentle could be so weakening or so fulfilling there had always been power when hed touched her bolts of power now there was only warmth a quiet river of it running through him he wanted to share it with her to show her how precious she was and would always be i love you he murmured when she tried to shake her head he only repeated the words again and again as his mouth whispered over hers she couldnt fight him like this not when the fog had rolled in over her brain and her body was sinking in some thick syrupy darkness her breath shook as she tried to say his name he covered her trembling lips with his own patient so patient as hers warmed and moved beneath his time he thought as he slowly deepened the kiss they would take all they needed and when the time had ended she would know that he would never love again as he had loved her he undressed her though his fingers shook from the pull of his own emotions they didnt hurry button by button he loosened her shirt pressing his lips lightly to each new opening softly sweetly he trailed his fingers over her flesh parting the material there was no greed now only an aching bittersweet tenderness surrendering she eased his sweater up over his shoulders so that she could feel the warmth of his skin against hers if she only had today she would forget all the yesterdays all the tomorrows as his mouth met hers again it was as though it were the first time they had kissed the first time they had loved this she would remember the heady flavor of his lips those quiet lovely words he spoke against her mouth not promises there could be no promises but there was the depthless green of his eyes to drown in there was the impossible gentleness of his hands to be lost in he slipped her jeans over her hips following the route with his mouth down her thigh over her knee and her calf in the dim silent room there was no day or night and a heart so filled with love could not break she enchanted him until he believed they would always be here together alone with only the soft sigh of the bed shifting yielding beneath the pressure of their bodies alone with only the soothing stroke of her fingers over his skin with only her drifting tenuous scent swimming in his brain and the love he felt pulsed through his blood seeped into his bones until he knew he would never be free of it there was joy in that she would be with him despite all distances he slipped into her with a yearning that was deep she enfolded him with an unquestioning generosity as they moved together time stood beautifully still she woke blinking in the darkness and afraid beside her the bed was cool he was gone panic snatched at her throat and had her rearing up she bit back the cry and steadied herself he wasnt goneor at least he hadnt gone far for she was still on the ship in his bed with her heart pounding she lay back and tried to think the way he had loved her had been so sweet so kind so patient and so much like goodbye she couldnt cry again sunny promised herself as she squeezed back tears crying solved nothing if she loved him and she did the only thing she could do for him was to be strong she dressed in the dark then went to look for him the ship confused her there was another cabin smaller than jacobs but painted in the same pale blues she passed through another area she assumed was the galley only because there was an empty carton of some sort of drink on a smooth narrow counter and a metal door built into the wall that after a critical study she decided was some sort of oven she found him on the flight deck sitting at the command console his wore only his jeans the viewing screen showed a panorama of forest and the shadow of distant ridges he was staring through it as he spoke to the computer set coordinates for hours affirmative preferred destination as close as possible to original departure data time and position understood estimate approximate flight time from liftoff to time warp working estimate three hours twentytwo minutes from liftoff to orbit of sun is closer calculation desired no jacob he spun in his chair swore under his breath disengage the computer screen went blank i thought you were sleeping i was accusations threats pleas sprang to her lips she bit them back she had promised herself she would be strong youre going back i have to he rose to cross to her sunny ive tried to find another way there is none but do you love your parents yes of course and i love mine he took her hand weighed it in his i cant begin to explain what we went through when we thought cal was dead my mother shes very strong but when the news came that he was lost presumed dead she was ill with grief days weeks im sorry she said quietly i can only imagine how you must have felt he shook his head those days were still difficult to speak of and then when we learned the truth they both tried to accept he was alive and that meant everything but to know that they would never see him again never know he broke off in frustration maybe they can accept especially when i explain to them that hes happy here when i tell them about the child what child calslibbys carrying a child didnt she tell you no shaken sunny pressed a hand to her temple everything was so confused and i libbys pregnant with a little laugh she dropped her hand how about that were going to have a niece or nephew it seemed right only right that when her world was at its darkest there should be that tiny glimmer of life and of hope in the future yet it was that same future she was losing him to having a baby only takes nine months she began trying to sound casual i dont suppose youd consider hanging around to see whether we should buy blue or pink balloons it was so easy to see beyond her smile into her eyes where the sadness hovered i cant take a chance on leaving the ship here so longand ive already overstayed my projected equations sunny my parents have a right a need to know about cals life about the child their grandchild of course if i could stay theres nothing there that means as much to me as what ive found with you you have to believe that she struggled to remain calm while her world silently fell apart i believe that you love me i do but if i dont go back if i dont give them that much i could never live with myself she turned away because she understood too well once when i was nine or ten i wandered off we were at the cabin for the summer and i wanted to explore i thought i knew the forest so well but i got lost i spent a night under a tree when mom and dad found me the next afternoon they were frantic ive never seen my father cry not like that then you know why i cant just turn my back on them yes of course she managed to smile as she faced him im sorry i caused such a scene before dont no really i am i didnt have any right to say the things i said but try as she might she couldnt apologize for decking him i cant begin to understand what it must have been like for you all these weeks trying to fit in and bide your time until cal came back it wasnt so hard i had you yes she lifted a hand to his cheek let it fall away im glad you did i want you to know that sunny so when do you go deliberately she moved out of reach if he touched her however gently she might shatter tomorrow she had to lock her knees to keep them from buckling so soon i thought it best for everyone she wondered that her smile didnt crack her face im sure youre right but youll want to spend a little more time with cal youve come a long way ill talk to him in the morning and to libby he added i want to set things right with her now the smile came more easily theyre good for each other you see that dont you id have to be blind not to science and logic aside sometimes emotions are the most accurate equations feeling stronger she held out her hand id like to stay the night here with you he brought her close struggling not to crush her against him ill come back when she shook her head he pulled her away the passion was in his eyes again and the anger i will i swear it i need a little more time to test i managed to work it out this far in only two years with another two i can make it smoother until its as basic as a shuttle to mars a shuttle to mars she repeated just trust me he told her drawing her back when i work it all out well have more time together more time she murmured and shut her eyes chapter she left before he awakened it seemed the best way she hadnt slept at all she had lain awake during the night trying to find the best way he had put music on something dreamy and beautiful by a composer she hadnt heard of because he had yet to be born he had adjusted the lights so that the cabin had been washed with simulated moonbeams to add romance she understood that now loved him for it he had wanted to give her everything it was possible for him to give her on that last night and he had given her everything but what she wanted most a future it occurred to her as she thought over the twist her life had taken that up until this point all her decisions had been blackandwhite a choice was either right or wrong but this time this most important time there were dozens of shades in between she drove back to the cabin slowly how could she have said goodbye again some pains could not be endured a second time sunny could only hope he would understand what she was doing she hoped she understood it she parked in back of the cabin and sat for a little while studying the way the glaze of ice on the tree limbs glittered in the morning sun listening to the sound the sound of almost perfect silence tasting the hint of coming snow in the air slowly fighting back the grief she walked to the cabin and entered the kitchen quietly libby had left a light in the window the sight of the old kerosene lamp burning dully in the morning light brought the hateful tears to her eyes again she swallowed them then sat at the table to run her fingers over the wood as jacob had only weeks before youre up early sunny lifted her eyes and met her sisters hi her lips curved mom instinctively libby laid a hand on her stomach jacob told you i wanted to great news is great news whatever the source she rose to gather her sister close there was joy here and she clung to it no morning sickness no ive never felt better cal better be spoiling you rotten libby drew back to brush at sunnys fringe of bangs her sisters eyes were shadowed and sad how are you im okay because her legs felt unsteady again she turned back to sit at the table im sorry i ran out the way i did that doesnt matter libby was dressed in a baggy sweater and cords her favored outfit for the mountains studying her sunny thought her sister had never been more beautiful she wondered if she would ever carry a child feel that love growing inside her i flattened him good libby said with a nod of approval movements automatic she filled the teakettle with water then set it on the burner want some breakfast later maybe sunny im so sorry dont be sunny reached behind her to close a hand over the one libby had laid on her shoulder really its all right you really love him yes i love him wishing she could find a way to grant her sister the happiness she felt herself libby rested a cheek on sunnys hair cal says jts planning to do some more work on the equations for the time travel to hone it down to make it safer and more practical if that word can apply yes he told me hes brilliant sunny really brilliant its not just cals bragging i read the rest of his file and the fact that he was able to make this trip after only two years of work is proof of it once he finishes his testing hell come back i hope he can she closed her eyes i really hope he can then with a laugh she buried her face in her hands listen to us were here talking about all of this as if it were the most natural thing in the world i must still be in shock after more than a year i still wake up some mornings wondering if i imagined it all but you have cal sunny murmured letting her hands fall into her lap hes right there to prove its real sunny if i she broke off when cal walked into the room she lifted her shoulders let them fall is there anything i can do no im handling it i promise you that im going to get some fresh air libby announced cal take care of the tea will you a look passed between them sure sunny knew them both well enough to understand that theyd planned this little bit of business so that cal could speak to her alone what do you want he asked when libby had shut the door behind her froot loops or burnt toast jt fixed the toaster oh yeah he gave it a casual glance hes always liked to fiddle with things the kettle began to boil giving him another moment to think through what he wanted to say sunny i think well get snow before nightfall cal why dont you relax as tempting as it was i didnt murder him i wasnt worried about that he poured hot water into two cups not too much anyway its more a matter of wanting to explain that your brothers a jerk i know that hes also sensitive she could still be amused that was a relief are we talking about the same man hornblower jacob astrophysicist the one with the bull head and the nasty temper an apt description he thought yeah i dont mean like he cries at vidmovies he remembered or that he takes it to heart when you call him names hes sensitive where other people are concerned family not certain he was handling the situation correctly he brought the tea to the table half the time when hed get into fights it was because someone had said something about me it used to annoy me because i wanted to take care of it myself but hed always plow right in before i had the chance and my parents i cant think of a single time hed forget a birthday or mothers day they still have mothers day sure cal absently she stirred sugar into her tea how did you decide to stay i didnt decide he told her what i mean is i dont think decide is the word it implies choice i couldnt leave libby i tried but ive never stopped thinking about my family whether you consider you had a choice or not it had to be difficult for me it was pretty cutanddried i couldnt even be sure if id make it back i sent the ship and the reports because if there was a chance i could let them know i was alive safe i had to he laid a hand over hers with jt its different he knows he can make it back and if he didnt go hed be leaving them without hope he couldnt do that no he couldnt do that she lifted her head its been hard for you this has been the best year of my life but the adjustments the separation if id been tossed back another five hundred years it wouldnt have mattered as long as id found libby shes lucky to have you i like to think so he grinned then sobered he loves you sunny something flickered in her eyes before she lowered them did he tell you that yes but he didnt have to i saw it the first time he said your name i guess what i wanted to tell you was that hes never felt about anyone the way he feels about you will you help me cal i left before he woke up she pressed her lips together to keep them from trembling i cant say goodbye libby stood by the stream watching the water fight its way around the ice in her mind she saw it as it had been in the spring when the water had gurgled lazily over the rocks and the song of birds had been everywhere the grass had been soft and green it was there that she and cal had buried the time capsule and there they had made love while her heart had broken at the picture of him unearthing it again in some springtime hundreds of years ahead instead he had stayed and it was his brother who had taken out the box they had placed there now it was her sisters heart that was breaking whatever comfort she offered sunny wouldnt be enough it seemed wrong that she should have everything while sunny lost she had cal and the home they loved the life they were building she had the child with a soft smile she pressed a hand to her stomach the child who would come at summers end and bind them even closer together sunny would have only memories and there was nothing libby could do about it she turned her head slightly and saw jacob he was only a few feet away she hadnt heard his approach in the muffling snow in the shadows cast by the trees she saw how much he resembled cal the same build the same coloring the same sharp facial bones there was a measuring look in his eyes that made her wonder how long he had been standing and watching her in silence she didnt approach him though he posed no threat to herand she admitted that she had been foolish and overemotional ever to believe he couldhe had taken her sisters heart and broken it cals inside her voice was cool and clipped she made no attempt to be friendly she showed her anger differently from sunny he mused sunny exploded with hers went straight on the attack apparently libby let hers bubble and brew inside he wondered if she realized it was just as volatile i wanted to talk to you she had never enjoyed confrontations but she braced for this one theres nothing you can say to me that would make me influence cal to leave with you the choice is his whether you believe it or not just as it was before i know he moved slowly across the snow until he stood beside her it isnt something i thought i would understand or accept but i do our parents will it will mean a great deal to them when i tell them about you about the child he misses them her voice was thick as she battled the tide of emotion they should know that they will why didnt you tell her she demanded how could you have let her fall in love with you when you knew you were going to leave his hands fisted as he plunged them into the pockets of his pea coat i spent two years working inching my way here for one reason only one to find my brother and take him home her eyes smoldered at that you cant have him no he nearly smiled perhaps she was more like sunny than he had originally thought and i cant have sunny either i have to live with that she isnt the only one who fell in love she isnt the only one to lose but you knew what you were doing vibrating with frustration he faced her for the first time she saw that his eyes were haunted and miserable you thought cal would leave did it stop you from loving him or him from loving you no with a little sigh she put a hand on his arm no it didnt shes strong he said his control had slipped a few notches when hed heard the understanding in her voice she wont allow herself to hurt for long if i cant come back the pain ripped through him forcing him to take a slow deep breath if i cant come back shell go on do you really believe that i have to he dragged an unsteady hand through his hair with the ache rippling through him he told her what he hadnt been able to tell sunny what he hadnt wanted to face himself i havent perfected the procedure this time i was months off the next time if there is one i may be years off she may have started a new life i have to accept that she smiled at him i study people when you make it a profession you learn more than tradition and social mores you learn that real love lasting love is very rare it should never be simply accepted jt it should be cherished he gazed across the white world he was just beginning to understand ill think of her every day for the rest of my life have you never heard the word compromise im not very good at it if i could find one id learn to be good at it i can only tell you that everything i do from the moment i get back will be geared toward finding a way to return here within a day within an hour of the time i left moved she leaned up and kissed his cheek it surprised her when his arms came around her held her without hesitating she returned the embrace take care of them both of them i will she tightened her hold briefly then smiled when she saw cal walking toward them kissing jacob again she released him before she held out a hand for cals why dont i go make some breakfast thanks cals fingers squeezed hers i love you with a quick smile she headed back to the cabin is sunny inside cal turned back to his brother she came back early he put a hand on jacobs arm to restrain him jt she asked me to tell you that she wishes you a safe trip but she cant say goodbye again the hell with that jacob cal shifted to block his brothers path she needs to do it this way believe me it wont help her if you try to see her again just cut it off clean jacob pulled out of cals hold as simple as that i didnt say it was simple theres no one who knows better how you feel than i do if you love her he continued let her have her way in this holding up his hands jacob whirled and strode a few paces off pain roiled inside him pain edged with resentment she wouldnt even see him one last time already she was just a memory perhaps it was best he told himself best that he could believe she was already getting on with her life if he could do nothing else for her he could honor this last request all right tell her he trailed off swearing he would never be able to find the words for what he was feeling even if hed had cals knack for poetry the phrases would have fallen short she knows cal told him come on inside in the afternoon they drove him to the ship he wondered if sunny was watching from a window as they disappeared into the forest but when he looked back searching the sun was glaring on the glass and he could see nothing cal talked constantly trying to fill the void with chatter jacob saw that he reached for libbys hand held it tight and he was denied even that he thought even one last touch cursing sunny he climbed out of the car ill tell mom and dad everything cal nodded get back to the lab i want to know that youll come back and bring them for a visit ill be back he embraced his brother i love you jt letting out a long breath he broke away to turn to libby tell your sister im going to find a way im counting on it libby blinked back tears as she handed him an envelope she asked me to give this to you but to make you promise you wont open it until you get back to your own time he reached out but she pulled it back your word cal tells me you take promises seriously i wont open it until im gone he folded it carefully before slipping it in his pocket he kissed her one cheek the other then her mouth keep well sister the first tear overflowed and you she turned her face into cals shoulder as jacob stepped through the hatch hell be back libby he lifted a hand in farewell then let it fall smiling he pressed a kiss to her hair as she wept its only a matter of time inside jacob cleared his mind and went to work the procedure for liftoff was basic but he went through the routine as meticulously as a firstyear pilot he didnt want to think couldnt afford to he had known it would hurt but he had never imagined this kind of dull gnawing pain it made his fingers stiff on the switches the lights hummed as he set the controls for ignition through the viewscreen he saw that cal had moved libby back out of harms way for the last time he searched the forest for signs of sunny there was nothing he threw the last switch the ship rose gently almost silently he knew he couldnt afford to linger but he kept the speed down until his brother was only a speck in the sea of white and green with an oath he jammed the throttle and shot through the atmosphere space was soothing the dark silence of it he didnt want to be soothed it would be best if he held on to his anger his frustration his jaw set he engaged his computer implement coordinates to sun coordinates implemented seen through the viewscreen the world was only a pretty colored ball mechanically he navigated compensating for a small shower of meteors it was very simple really he thought now there was no traffic commercial or private no route patrol ships to communicate with no checkpoints he hit the switch and bulleted into hyperspace as before his eyes narrowed his muscles tensed as he hurtled toward the sun he watched dispassionately as the gauges registered the increase in outside temperature with the viewscreen lowered he flew blind expertly but without the passion that had fueled him on his last voyage working with the computer he increased the speed adjusted the angle meticulous and mechanical his fingers moved over the command console though he was prepared the gs slammed him back in his chair holding course he swore filling the cockpit with his anger and his hopelessness now though his heart was thousands of miles below there was no turning back like a bullet from a gun he shot through space and time and away from his heart he was breathless when the procedure was complete a line of sweat rolled down his back a glance at his gauges told him he had been successful successful he thought miserably rubbing his hands over his eyes raising the viewscreen he looked out on his own time it looked so similar the stars the planets the inky darkness there were more satellites and in the distance he saw a blip of light he knew was a research lab in less than thirty minutes he would join the traffic patterns he would no longer be alone leaning back he closed his eyes in quiet desperation she was gone fate had brought him to her then had torn him away fate he thought and his own intellect he would use that intellect if it took a lifetime he would find a way to bring their lives together again perhaps he would suffer over the months or years it took him to complete the necessary tests that would take him back safely close to the time of his liftoff but he would get back and he would calculate so minutely that she would barely realize hed ever been gone slowly he took the letter out of his pocket it was all he had left of her some message he thought a few words of love and remembrance it wouldnt be enough he thought furiously and ripped it open there was only one word surprise baffled he stared at it surprise he thought just surprise what kind of last message was that so damn typical of her he decided balling the paper up in his fist then relenting willing to settle for even as little as this he smoothed it out again at a faint sound he whirled in the chair she was standing at the doorway to the flight deck she was deathly pale and her eyes were glassy but as he watched dumbfounded her lips moved into a smile so you got my message sunny he whispered her name at first wondering if he was hallucinating it was only one of the potential side effects of time travel he would have to remember to make a note of it but he could not only see her hear her he could smell her he catapulted out of the chair to grab her close to devour her mouth like a starving man then it struck him terrified him what are you doing here he demanded shaking her what the hell have you done what had to be done when she swayed he cursed her again yell at me later she said calmly i think im going to pass out no youre not though he was infuriated he lifted her as though she were fragile glass and carried her to a chair then he was all business youre lightheaded yes she put her hand on her temple it was a hell of a trip nauseous some he pressed a round black button and a small compartment opened he pulled out a square box from it he took a tiny paperthin pill let this dissolve on your tongue idiot he said even as she obeyed you arent prepped for traveling at warp speed the relief was instant she took a long breath pleased that she wasnt going to disgrace herself ignoring him for the moment she turned to the viewscreen the galaxy was spread out before her oh my god the color that had come back into her cheeks fled again its incredible is thatis that earth yes his palms were damp if his stomach didnt settle hed have to resort to a pill himself sunny do you have any idea what youve done how fast are we going damn it sunny yes i know what ive done she swiveled in the chair to rest her hands on his knees her eyes when they met his were dark and clear ive passed through time with you jacob you have to be out of your mind he wanted to shake her until her bones rattled he wanted to hold her against him until they melted how could you have pulled off a ridiculous stunt like this cal and libby helped me they helped you they knew youd planned this yes when she felt her hands begin to tremble she sat back and folded them in her lap she didnt want him to know how frightened she was i decided last night you decided he repeated thats right her chin lifted and she gave him a long level look i talked to cal this morning told him what i wanted to do calmer now she turned to the viewscreen again there were lights in the sky stars instead of looking up at them she looked out as incredible as it was she was hurtling through space with the only man she had ever loved would ever love someone had to be sensible someone had to be calm but he wasnt sure it could be him sunny i dont think you understand what youve done i understand perfectly she looked back at him yes she was calm again she realized calm with her mind clear and her heart content cal made a token protestmore for libbys sake than mine really but when i spoke with her she understood she brought me to the ship herself this afternoon when you were busy with cal your parents would want me to be happy there was a pang a deep one when she thought of them libby and cal will explain everything to them because she was sure her legs were steady again she rose to walk around the flight deck im not saying they wont be sad or that they wont miss me if it isnt possible to go back but i think my fatherparticularly my fatherwill get a tremendous charge when he thinks of where i am she laughed when i am she turned back still smiling neither of us is good at compromising jt with us its all or nothing thats why well get along so well i would have come back he covered his face with his hands then dragged them back through his hair damn it sunny i told you id come back a year maybe two or three i didnt want to wait that long you idiot if i had managed to perfect it id have been back five minutes after id left in your time her time it struck him so hard so deep that he wasnt sure he could speak you had no right to make a decision like this without discussing it with me its my decision riled she stalked back to him if you dont want me then ill just find some nice appreciative companions maybe on mars i can take care of myself pal just consider that ive hitched a ride it has nothing to do with what i want its whats best for you i know whats best for me she rapped a fist on his chest i thought it was you but ive made one or two mistakes before she spun away and took two steps before he grabbed her where are you going to go he demanded theres still a few thousand kilometers before we hit breathable atmosphere its a big ship sit down i dont i said sit down he gave her a nonetoogentle shove that sent her sprawling into the chair and shut up i have something to say to you when she braced her hands on the arms of the chair he lifted a fist if you get up i swear im going to belt you seething she sat back thats one term that appears to have survived the centuries if id known what you were planning id have used that term before there were risks involved here that you have no conception of if id made a mistake a miscalculation even the slightest but you didnt thats not the point what is the point hornblower you shouldnt have done this she let out an impatient breath well its no use belaboring that point because i have done it why dont we move on to the next step he found he had to sit himself you may never be able to get back i know ive accepted that if you change your mind jacob sighing she rose only to kneel beside him i cant change my mind unless i change my heart and thats just not possible he reached out to touch her hair i wouldnt have asked this of you i know and if i had asked to come with you you would have given me half a dozen very logical reasons why i couldnt she turned her face into his palm and youd have been wrong what i couldnt do is live without you sunny look at it this way ive always felt that i was ahead of my time kind of placed in the wrong era maybe ill do better in yours this was a stupid thing to do then he pulled her up into his lap thank god you did it then youre not mad he showed her just how mad he was when his mouth took hers when you wouldnt see me today it was as if youd cut out my heart it didnt matter because id wanted to leave it with you tears rushed to her eyes but she forced them back she wanted only to smile at him thats almost poetic dont get used to it still holding her he leaned forward to make some adjustments on the control panel can you teach me how to drive this he slanted her a look she was here really here and his forever im already terrified of the idea of you at the controls of a cruise rider im a quick study thats what im afraid of he drew her back until she was settled in the curve of his arm im not sure even my worlds ready for you but you are he kissed her again gently ive been ready all my life with a sigh she teased his mouth until the passion simmered i dont suppose we could put this thing on automatic pilot or whatever not at this point we did make it back didnt we he inclined his head toward the screen weve got a little way to go yet no i mean back what year is it he gestured toward the dials the enormity of it made her giddy his arms made her trust so that makes me years old she cocked a brow how do you feel about older women im crazy about them remember that when i bit three hundred and things start to sag she kissed him lightly i plan to frustrate you annoy you and generally make your life chaos for a long time im counting on it together they watched the bluegreen sphere that was home draw closer epilogue i he sound of crashing waves seemed to fill the room the clear wall opened the suite to the passion of the lightningsplit sky and the boiling sea the scent of jasmine rich and sultry rose on the air low pulsing music echoed over the roar of waves and the violent boom of thunder i was right sunny murmured jacob shifted on the cloud bed to draw her closer about whatthis time the storm her body still vibrated from passion just released i knew it wasnt a night for moonlight or tropical sunsets she had been right but he hated to admit it the atmosphere didnt make that much difference she rolled all but floated to lie across him is that why you brought me here to the place you once described to me i brought you here for a few days of relaxation so thats what you brought me here for when are we going to relax she grinned before she bent down to press kisses on his chest see youre already tensing up again he skimmed a hand over her hair how long have we been married lazily she touched a button on the side of the bed the time flashed the numbers suspended in the air then blinked off five hours and twenty minutes i figure well relax in about fifty years his hand wandered to her bare shoulder do you like it being married that too but i mean this place he was so sweet she thought the way he didnt want her to think he was too sentimental i love it and since were newlyweds and allowed to be mushy ill tell you that bringing me here was the most romantic thing youve ever done i thought you might prefer paris or the intimacy resort on mars we can always go to mars she said and giggled im almost getting used to saying things like that i told you i was a quick study youve been here six months you are a tough nut she slid down him to rest her cheek on his chest six months she repeated it took you long enough to marry me id have had it over with in six minutes if you and my father hadnt gotten together over with she raised her head her eyes dangerous income tax reports are things you want to get over with income tax reports he repeated blankly i forgot unpleasant tasks she said thats what you want to get over with if marrying me was so unpleasant why did you bother because you would have nagged me he winced when she pinched him because i thought it was the least i could do this time he laughed rolling onto her as she dug her nails into his arms because youre gorgeous not good enough and marginally intelligent keep trying because loving you has scrambled my circuits i guess thatll do happy she linked her arms around his neck maybe it was a lot of fuss and bother but it was a beautiful wedding im glad your father talked us into something traditional it was all right as ceremonies go and when hed seen her start down the aisle on his fathers arm draped in shimmering white hed been struck dumb i like your parents theyve made me feel very much at home with her tongue in her cheek she looked at him again especially when they let me in on deep dark family secrets such as the t in jt when he grimaced she really began to enjoy herself it seems you were so rotten so undisciplined so i was just a curious child so hardheaded she continued without missing a beat that your father used to say trouble was your middle name and the t stuck aptly you havent seen trouble yet she slid up again to nip his lip im hoping i will after a quick kiss he slid out of bed the silky sheets pooled at her waist as she sat up where do you think youre going i havent finished with you yet i forgot something he hadnt forgotten at all hed been waiting for the right moment he adjusted the lights so that they flickered like the flames of a dozen candles moments later he returned with a box its a gift why because ive never given you one he set it in her hands are you going to open it or just stare at it i was enjoying the moment with her tongue caught between her teeth she opened the box inside was a teapot squat of cheap china with a bird on the lid and huge ugly daisies painted on the bowl oh god i wanted you to have something from your time he felt a little foolish not ready to admit that he had spent months scouring antique shops when i saw this it was well like fate dont cry i have to she sniffled then raised her drenched eyes to his it survived all this time the best things do jacob she made a helpless gesture then hugged the pot theres nothing you could have given me that would have meant more theres something else he sat beside her after taking the teapot he set it aside would you like to see your family for christmas for a moment she couldnt speak are you sure im nearly there sunbeam he brushed away a tear let it shimmer on his fingertip just trust me a little while longer fighting tears she put her arms around him take all the time you need weve got forever the end
