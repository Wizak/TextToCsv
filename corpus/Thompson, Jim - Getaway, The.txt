the getaway by jim thompson copyright carter doc mccoy had left a morning call for six oclock and he was reaching for the telephone the moment the night clerk rang he had always awakened easily and pleasantly a man with not a regret for the past and completely confident and selfassured as he faced each new day twelve years of prison routine had merely molded his natural tendencies into habit why i slept fine charlie he said in his amiably sincere voice dont suppose i should ask you the same question eh haha got my breakfast on the way have you fine attaboy youre a gentleman and a scholar charlie doc mccoy hung up the receiver yawned and stretched agreeably and sat up in the big oldfashioned bed tipping the shade of the sidestreet window a little he glanced at the allnight lunchroom a block away a negro busboy was just emerging from the place a tray covered with a white cloth balanced on one hand he came up the street at the slow but sullenly steady pace of one who is performing an unavoidable and unfairly imposed task doc grinned sympathetically it was the boys own fault of course he should have known better than to boast to charlie about the handsome tip mr kramer had given him known that charlie would relieve him of delivering the tray from then on still doc went into the bathroom and began to wash fair was fair and a boy in a job like that probably needed every nickel he could get you know how it is charlie he explained ingratiatingly when the clerk arrived with his breakfast now with people like you and me a few bucks either way doesnt make any difference but mind giving him this fivespot for me tell him ill drop around and thank him personally when i get back in town the clerk beamed him and mr kramer people like them hed have given the five to that dish jockey even if mr kramer hadnt fixed it so that he just about had to his face fell suddenly as the full import of docs words registered on him wwhen you get back you mean youre leavin just for twothree days charlie a little business matter that cant wait you bet im coming back and im going to tack this timeout onto the end of my vacation well the clerk was almost weak with relief we i i guess you know were sure glad to have you mr kramer but believe me i sure wouldnt be spending no vacation in this place if i was fixed like if i was you id be cuttin it up out in las vegas or no no i dont think you would charlie youre too sensible youd get fed up mighty fast just like i did so youd pick out a nice town where you could just laze around and take things easy and meet some real people for a change he nodded earnestly then pressed a bill into the clerks hand youll look after everything for me while im gone charlie i dont think ill be taking anything more than a briefcase you bet but gosh mr kramer you dont need to give me twenty dollars just for but you need it to keep up with those beautiful babes youve got on the string doc urged him genially toward the door thought i wasnt wise to you hah didnt figure id know you were the town ladykiller haha well take it easy charlie charlie was eager to learn the basis for mr kramers flattering conclusions but he found that somehow he had gotten out in the hall and mr kramers door had closed in his face dreamily beaming he went back downstairs to the desk several signals were flashing on the tiny switchboard charlie answered them deliberately stonily unapologetic in the face of inquiries as to whether hed dropped dead or been on a vacation everyone ought to know by this time that he was the only night employee of the beacon city hotel he had the whole shooting match to take care of from nine peeyem until nine ayem so he had plenty to do besides just stick around the desk and any time anyone got griped too much about it they could go to another hotel the nearest of which was twenty miles away charlie had told a number of gripers where they could head in mr farley the owner had told him to the way farley the stingy old jerk figured it hardly anyone stayed at the beacon city hotel unless they had to and he couldnt sell any more rooms with two night employees than he could with one charlie yawned sleepily and glanced at the oakcased wall clock going behind the key rack he doused his face at the dingy lavatory and dried on one of the cleaner sections of a soiled roller towel ladykiller he thought studying his pimpled reflection in the mirror oh you beautiful babes offhand he could remember seeing only two or three girls in beacon city who might even remotely qualify as truly beautiful babes and none of these as the saying is had been able to see him at all but well maybe he just hadnt been lookin sharp enough he hadnt gone about things right because that mr kramer was one mightee shrewd hombre and if he had a fella sized up in a certain way leaving the desk charlie took up a position before the lobby window hands folded behind him rocking back and forth on the balls of his feet the glass was so dusty and flyspecked as to serve inadequately as a mirror and in it he was only mildly unappetizing rose hip the chinese laundrymans lovely daughter tripped by on her way to busines college charlie winked at her and she stuck out her tongue at him charlie smirked knowingly there just wasnt much of anything stirring after that as charlie put it you could have fired a machine gun down main street without hitting a soul it was due to the recent changeover to daylight saving time charlie thought folks hadnt got used to it yet maybe the clock said it was getting kind of late seventeen minutes of eight but it still wasnt seven to the people charlie started to turn away from the window then hesitantly hearing a familiar creak of cartwheels he faced it again the woman was old crazy cvec the town scavenger her wobbly cart was piled high with cardboard cartons rags and bottles she was dressed in a ragged mother hubbard an ancient picture hat and toeless tennis shoes a frayed cigar butt protruded from the corner of her sunkenin mouth when charlie winked at her her gums parted in an insane cackle and the butt dropped down the front of her gown this sent her into another paroxysm of crazy cackling which she concluded by gripping the handle of the cart and kicking friskily backward with both feet charlie giggled lewdly lifting a foot he shook his leg in the manner of a man who has got a bee up his trousers then well ill be damned said a jeering voice yes sir i will be damned it was mack wingate bank guard and longtime resident of the hotel mack wingate dressed in his crisp grayblue uniform and cap his plump face twisted in a look of acid astonishment so thats your girl friend he said you and crazy cvec well iguess youre gettin the best of the bargain at that now llisten you the clerk was scarletfaced tremulously furious you better not go on and fill your inkwells clean out the spittoons spect youre feeling pretty proud hey charlie me now i like em kind of machure myself and you sure got to admit old crazys matured hard to tell which stinks the ripest her or the yah said charlie desperately i guess you know dont you you know all about her dont you mack now dont you worry boy i know a real love match when i see it and i aint gonna come between you dang you mack you he searched wildly for some effective threat you im warning you for the last time mack no more cooking in your room you do it just once more and wingate belched emanating an odor of dayold rolls and coffee but youre goin to let me bake your weddin cake aint you charlie or was you figurin on crazy pickin one up from the garbage charlie made a strangled sound his shoulders slumped helplessly he just wasnt any match for the bank guard no one in the town was anything you said to him why he just ignored it and kept coming at you harder than ever and he never got off of you until he got someone better to ride which would be a darned long time in this case the guard gripped one of his inert hands and shook it warmly want to be the first to congratulate you charlie youre really gettin something when you get crazy wouldnt say what it is exactly but gget out of here charlie whispered yyou tell anyone about this an ill sure now sure youre kind of up in the air said mack wingate with hideous sympathy it aint every day in the week that a man gets hisself engaged so dont you worry about sendin out no announcements ill see to it that everyone charlie turned abruptly and went behind the desk mack laughed snorted wonderingly and started across the street on the opposite side he stood poised for a moment hand on the butt of his gun and looked deliberately from left to right some two blocks away a car was slowly rounding the corner no one was immediately nearby except a storekeeper sweeping off his walk and a farmer driving a springseat wagon and both were well known to him mack turned and unlocked the bank door reaching quickly inside he shut off the automatic alarm he stepped up to and across the threshold and then as it appeared to charlie at least mack tripped over his own feet and went sprawling into the darkened interior the clerk hugged himself delightedly he wanted to see the expression on macks face when he stuck his head out the door for a quick look around before locking it again after a stupid tumble like that hed be a cinch to look out charlie figured hed be scared to death that someoned seen him and would say something about it a bank guard that couldnt do any better than that and you could just bet that someone was going to if mack said anything about something else unfortunately charlie couldnt go on watching the door because just thenmr kramers light flashed on the switchboard and he was one person charlie never kept waiting and mr kramer that prince of men would be the first to say so it was doubtful whether rudy torrento had ever enjoyed a good nights sleep in his life he was afraid of the dark early in his infancy the night and the sleep that was normal to it had become indelibly associated with terror with being stumbled over smothered under a drunken mountain of flesh with being yanked up by the hair held helpless by one meaty hand while the other beat him into insensibility he was afraid to sleep and equally fearful of awakening from the dawn of his memory the days had also been identified with terror in the latter case however his fear was of a different kind a cornered rat might feel as rudy torrento felt on coming into full consciousness or a snake with its head caught beneath a forked stick it was an insanely aggressive outrageously furious fear a selffrightening selfpoisoning emotion gnawing acidly at the man whose existence depended upon it he was paranoid incredibly sharp of instinct filled with animal cunning he was also very vain on the one hand then he was confident that doc mccoy intended to kill him as soon as he had served docs purposes and on the other he could not admit it doc was too smart to tangle with rudy torrento hed know that no one pulled a cross on rudy when the first gray streaks of daylight seeped through the boardedup windows of the old farmhouse rudy sat up groaning eyes still closed and began a frantic pummeling and massaging of his ribs they had all been broken and rebroken before he was old enough to run by now they had long since grown together in a twisted mass of cartilage bone and scar tissue which ached horribly when he became chilled or when he lay long in one position having pounded and rubbed them into a degree of comfort he fumbled among his blankets until he found whiskey cigarettes and matches he took a long drink of the liquor lighted and inhaled deeply on acigaretteand suddenly with planned suddenness opened his eyes the punk jackson was staring at him being a little slow on the trigger compared with rudy at least he continued to stare for a moment longer torrento beamed at him with sinister joviality got a mug like a piece of pie aint i kid a chunk with a big end down huh what the kid suddenly came alive uh aint that funny guess i mustve been sittin here asleep with my eyes wide open rudys lips parted in a wolfish humorless grin he said yes sir it was funny as all hell but not nearly so funny of course as the way he himself looked my maws doctor did that for me jackie boy the one that took care of her when i was born i had a pretty big noggin on me ysee so just to make things nice and easy for her he kinda sloped it off to a point thats how i got the handle piehead torrento didnt know i had a real first name for a long time maybe youd like to call me piehead too huh jackie boy the kid jerked his head nervously even in the twobit underworld of window smashers and jackrollers which had been his recruited ground rudys sensitivity about his appearance was a legend you didnt call him piehead any more than youdve called benny siegel buggsy the mere mention of pie in his presence was apt to inspire him to murderous fury you need some coffee rudy the kid said mannishly some good hot coffee and a couple of them snazzy sandwiches i bought last night i asked you a question thats right thats right all right the kid murmered vaguely and he poured a steaming cup of coffee from the vacuum bottle diffidently extended it with a sandwich toward the gangster for a moment rudy remained motionless staring at him out of fixed toobright eyes then abruptly he burst into laughter for he had remembered something very funny the kind of thing that would amuse him when nothing else would you got a lot of guts jackson he said snorting and choking over the words a real gutsy ginzo thats you well the punk said modestly i wouldnt want to say so myself but most anyone that knows me will tell you that when it comes to a showdown why uh uhhuh well well see jackson well see what you got inside of you again rudy was convulsed and then with one of his mercurial changes of mood he was overwhelmed with pity for the kid eat up jackie he said catch onto some of that coffee and chow yourself they ate over second cups of coffee rudy passed cigarettes and held a light for the boy jackson felt encouraged to ask questions and for once the gangster did not reply with insults or order him to shut up well doc didnt just happen to pick this beacon city jog he said doc never just happens to do anything he has this plan see so he goes looking for exactly the right place to fit into it probably scouted around for twothree months traveled over half a dozen counties before he settled on beacon city first he looks for a bank that aint a member of the federal reserve system then huh rudy frowned at the interruption well why the hell do you think anyway oh oh i see the kid said quickly the feds dont come in on the case right rudy right the talk is that theyre fixin to cut themselves in on any bank robbery but they aint got around to it yet well so anyway he checks that angle and then he checks on interest rates if a banks paying little or nothing on savings ysee it means they got a lot more dough than they can loan out so that tips doc off on the most likely prospects and all he has to do then is check their statements of condition youve seen them printed in the newspapers havent you how much dough theyve got on hand and so on ive seen em but they never made any sense to me i mean well it always looks to me like they got just enough to pay their bills with they aint got any more at the end of the year than they had in the beginning rudy chuckled im with you jackie but they mean plenty to doc he can read them things like they was funny books plenty foxy huh a real brain the kid shook his head admiringly not noticing rudys sudden scowl but how come were goin so far out of our way to skim out rudy why go all the way up and across the country when were only a few hundred miles from the border here you dont like it said rudy you stupid sap theyd be expecting us to travel in a beeline sure sure jackson mumbled hastily what about that place were holing up in they really cant extradite us from there not no way you got nothing to worry about rudy told him and again for the moment he was pitying theres this one old geezer el rey that means the king yknow in mex well him and his family his sons and grandsons and nephews and so on they run the place the state or province or what the hell ever its called they really run it know what i mean theyre the cops and the judges and the prosecutors and everything else so long as you pay off and dont make no trouble with the locals youre sittin pretty the kid whistled appreciatively but look whats to keep em from grabbing a guys loot and knocking him off i mean uh well i guess that wouldnt be so smart would it the word would get around and they wouldnt get no more customers just about one like you and they wouldnt want any more rudy grunted youd spread them idiot germs around an the whole population would turn stupid im sorry i didnt mean nothin and you dont a big fat zero thats you rudy said and that was the end of his pity they had shaved late the night before and they managed a wash by tipping the water jug over one anothers hands they combed their hair brushed their clothes thoroughly with a whisk broom and then completely dressed checked each others appearance they wore dark suits white shirts and hats of a semihomburg type except for their shoulderholstered guns and their briefcases they took nothing with them when they went out the back door to their car the briefcases were large much larger than they looked and bore a boldletter office of state above an equally boldstamped bank examiner the car with its immensely soupedup motor appeared to be just another black lowpriced sedan jackson climbed in with the briefcases swung open the door on the drivers side and started the motor rudy peered around the corner of the abandoned house a truck had just passed on the way into beacon city there was nothing else in sight rudy leaped into the car gunned the motor and sent it rocketing down the weedbordered lane to the highway he whipped it onto the highway wheels skidding he relaxed slowing its speed taking a long deep breath maybe it wouldnt have mattered if someone had seen them coming out of the lane they could have turned into it accidentally or maybe to fix a tire on the buggy still that was maybe and maybes were bad stuff a very small one one that hadnt seemed big enough to kick out of the way had tumbled rudy the piehead into alcatraz for a tenyear fall he kept one eye on his wristwatch as he drove they entered town on schedule to the minute and rudy spoke to the kid in a tight quiet voice now this is going to be all right he said doc knows his job i know mine youre green but it dont make any difference all you got to do is just what youre told just follow my lead and well roll through it like smoke through a chimney i im not afraid rudy be afraid what the hell just keep a cork on it at the corner two blocks above the bank rudy slowed the car to a crawl swinging a little wide so that he could see down the main street they were on schedule but mack wingate the bank guard wasnt automatically rudy killed the motor then began to fumble futilely with the starter the kid turned to him whitefaced rrudy wwhats the easy easy jackie boy rudy said the words quiet his nerves screaming murder guards a little late see but it dont mean a thing if he doesnt show fast well circle again and the guard came out of the hotel then started briskly across the street rudy stalled a few seconds longer and then smoothly started the motor and rounded the corner in little more than a minute after the guard had entered the bank rudy was parking in front of it he and jackson got out of the car on opposite sides the boy lingering a step or so behind him crossing the walk their briefcases turned to display the official stamp on themrudy gave a curtly pleasant nod to the storekeeper and received a vacant stare in return leaning on his broom the man continued to stare as rudy rapped on the bank door the kid was panting heavily crowding on rudys heels the gangster called hey wingate hurry it up and then turned a flat steady gaze on the storekeeper yes he said something wrong mister just about to ask you the same the man said pertly bank aint in no trouble is she very slowly his eyes hardening rudy looked him over from head to foot the banks not in any trouble he said you trying to make some for it me the mans head waggled in anxious protest i was just makin talk you know just joking theres a law against that kind of joke rudy told him maybe youd better get a new one huh the storekeeper nodded feebly he turned and tottered into his establishment and rudy and the kid entered the bank rudy snatched the key from the floor and relocked the door the kid let out a croak of amazement one finger pointing shakily to the guards sprawled body lookit it ilooks like hed had a ppencil pushed through his head what are you the coroner rudy blazed get his cap on peel out of your jacket and put on his that fellow outside rudy ddo you suppose hell torrento gave him a stinging backhanded slap then as the kid reeled he caught his lapels and yanked him up to within an inch of his face theres just two people you got to worry about know what i mean just you and me and you keep on playin the jerk therell only be one of us rudy gave him a hard bearingdown shake you got that think you can remember it the glaze drained out of jacksons eyes he nodded spoke quite calmly im all right now rudy youll see he put on the guards jacket and cap pulling the bill low over his forehead then since rudy was afraid that the dead man might panic the other employees into hysteria they pitched his body into the railedoff desk area and pulled a rug over it back in the lobby proper again rudy put the kid through the final rehearsal he wasnt supposed to peek out the door of course make like he was by rattling the shade a little but not really do it and when he opened the door he wasnt to show nothing of himself but his jacket sleeve and maybe the bill of his cap you dont need to sell em see they dont know anythings wrong or if they do theres nothing we can do about it now rudy tapped on the glass top of one of the high marblepedestaled customers desks now heres the code again heres how youll know its one of the wage slaves and not some johnnyaheadoftime wanting change for a quarter therell be a knockknockknock like that see then a knock and another knock three and two i get it jackson nodded i remember rudy some code huh must have took doc two or three minutes to figure out with a pair of binoculars but just the three employees will use the code theyll show between now and eightthirty the big cheese gets here about a quarter of and he dont knock just rattles the door latch and says wingate wingate rudy glanced at the clock gestured they took up positions on opposite sides of the door rudy drew his gun and there was a knockknockknock and a knock knock the kid hesitated freezing for a split second then as rudy nodded to him gravely encouraging his nerve returned and he opened the door four months before when it was certain that doc was getting a pardon on his second and last jolt his wife carol had quarreled violently with him while visiting the prison she announced that she was suing him for divorce and had actually started proceedings against him leaving them in abeyance ostensibly until she could acquire the money to carry them through soon afterward with the announced intention of changing her name and making a new start in life she boarded a train for new york coachclass unreserved seat and that seemed to be that except that she did not go to new york did not and had never meant to get a divorce and had in fact never for a moment entertained the slightest desire for any life other than the one she had back in the beginning perhaps she had had some conscienceimpelled notion of reforming doc but she could not think of that now without a downward quirk of her small mouth a wince born more of bewilderment than embarrassment at the preposterousness of her onetime viewpoint reform change why and to what the terms were meaningless doc had opened a door for her and she had entered into adopted and been adopted by a new world and it was difficult to believe now that any other had ever existed docs amoral outlook had become hers in a sense she had become more like doc than doc himself more engagingly persuasive when she chose to be harder when hardness seemed necessary doc had teased her about this a time or two until he saw that it annoyed her a little more of that he would say and well send you back to the bookstacks and carol wasnt angered by his funning it was almost impossible to be angry with doc neither did she appreciate it it gave her a vague feeling of indecency of being unfairly exposed she had felt much the same way when her parents persisted in exhibiting one of her baby pictures a trite display of infant nudity sprawled on a woolly white rug it was her picture all right and yet it really wasnt her so why not forget it forget also that more than two decades after the picture was taken she was just about as dishwaterdull dumb and generally undesirable as a young woman could be she had been working as a librarian then living with her stodgy middleaged parents and daily settling deeper into the pattern of spinsterhood she had no life but the lifeless one of her job and home she was finefeatured her small body beautifully full but people saw only the dowdy sensible clothes and the primness of manner and thought of her as plain and even homely then doc had come along still on parole he was already doing research on another job and he had instantly seen the woman that she really was and with his easy smile his amiable persuasiveness his inoffensive persistence he had pulled that woman right out of her shell oh it hadnt been a matter of minutes of course oreven days she had been pretty skittish as a matter of fact snubbing and glaring at him putting him in what she thought of as his place but somehow you just couldnt do things like that with doc somehow they seemed to hurt you worse than they did him so she had relented just a little and the next minute seemingly she was through that marvelous door and kicking it firmly shut behind her her parents had washed their hands of her some parents she thought comtemptuously she had lost her friends her position in the community some friends some position she had acquired a police record carol mccoy no alias photo and fprints reclaimed by court order three arrests no trial or convictions susp of complicity in murder armed robbery bank robbery in consort with husb doc mccoy may work as steno general office may appear attractive or unattractive very friendly or unfriendly five feet two in lbs grey to green eyes brown black red or light blonde hair age approach with caution carol smiled to herself winked at her reflection in the cars rearview mirror some record it had more holes in it than their little fat heads since her ostensible departure for new york she had been working as a restaurant night cashier in a city some five hundred miles away under a different name of course and looking not at all like she looked now yesterday morning she had quit her job slept all day taken delivery on a new car and started driving toward beacon city at eight oclock in the morning she was within sixty miles of the town after breakfasting on the rolls and coffee she had brought with her and a quick wash in a filling station she felt quite rested and highspirited despite the long hours at the wheel her rollneck cashmere sweater snugly emphasized her narrowness of waist the flaring fullness below it and the rich contours above a longbilled airmans cap was cocked pertly on her head and her hair tawny brown now flounced out from beneath it in a jaunty ponytail her bobbysocked ankles tapered up into a pair of slacks which were really much less than skintight although they did seem pretty well filled to capacity in at least one area she looked heartbreakingly young and gay she looked well what was wrong with the word sexy tingling pleasantly carol decided there was nothing at all wrong with it she had not seen doc since their phony quarrel at the prison their only contact had been through brief cautious and emotionally unsatisfying longdistance phone calls that was the way it had to be and carol like doc being so much a part of doc did not quarrel with what had to be still that did not keep her from being almost deliriously happy that the long months of their separation were over doc would be very pleased with her she knew with the way she looked with everything she had done the car was a flashy yellow convertible stacked along with the baggage on the rear seat and floor were golf clubs fishing rods tennis rackets and other vacation impedimenta the bags were bright with the stickers of assorted hotels and tourist courts one of them contained a cap similar to her own sunglasses and a gaudy sports jacket that was all it held since it was meant to accommodate the loot from the bank they would be very conspicuous as they traveled and the conspicuousness would give them safetythe more obvious and out in the open a thing was doc had taught her the less likely it was to attract attention she began to drive slower to glance more and more frequently at the dashboard clock and the speedometers mileage indicator at nine she saw a puff of black smoke spout up in the distance then a billowing oily cloud of it carol nodded approvingly doc was right on schedule as always the smoke signaled the successful accomplishment of the second half of his part in the robbery which meant since one part was dependent upon the other that he had also pulled off the first one she took another look at the clock drove still more slowly at the crest of a hill she stopped the car and began raising the canvas top a truck and two cars went past the driver of one slowing as though to offer help carol waved him on in a way that let him know that she meant it then slid back behind the wheel she lighted a cigarette flipped it away after a puff or two and stared narrowly through the windshield ninefifteen no it was almost ninetwenty and she hadnt got the signal yet the winking left headlight true one of those distant oncoming cars had suddenly disappeared from the highway there went another one right now but that didnt mean anything there were many turnoffs up through treelined farm lanes or cutting between one farm and another in any event doc never made any lastminute changes in plans if changes seemed indicated he simply dropped the job either permanently or until a later date so since he had said there would be a signal carol started the car she took a gun out of the glove compartment shoved it into the waistband of her slacks and pulled her sweater over it then she drove on fast doc mccoys breakfast had cooled before he could get rid of charlie the night clerk but he ate it with an enjoyment which may or may not have been as real as was apparent it was hard to tell with doc to know whether he actually did like something or someone as well as he seemed to nor is it likely that doc himself knew agreeability was his stock in trade he had soaked up so much of it that everything he touched seemed roseately transformed docs beaming good nature and the compelling personality that was its outgrowth were largely owing to his father the widowed sheriff of a small downsouth county to compensate for the loss of his wife the elder mccoy kept his house filled with company liking his job and knowing that he would never get another half as good he made sure of keeping it he had never been known to say no even to a mobs request for a prisoner he was ready at all times to fiddle for a wedding or weep at a wake no poker session cockfight or stag party was considered complete without his presence yet he was a steadfast church communicant and the everpresent guest at the most genteel social gatherings inevitably he came to be the bestliked man in the county the one man whom everyone honestly regarded as a friend he also was the grossest incompetent and the most costly ornament in the countys body politic but the only person who had ever faulted him an opposition candidate had barely escaped a wrathful lynching party doc then was born popular into a world where he was instantly liked and constantly reassured of his welcome everyone smiled everyone was friendly everyone was anxious to please him without being spoiled his fathers strictly male household took care of that he acquired an unshakable belief in his own merit a conviction that he not only would be but should be liked wherever he went and holding such a conviction he inevitably acquired the pleasant traits and personality to justify it rudy torrento planned to kill doc but he was resentfully drawn to him doc intended to kill rudy but he by no means disliked torrento he only liked him less than he did certain other people his breakfast finished doc stacked the dishes neatly on the tray and set it outside his door the maid was vacuuming the hall and doc told her of his impending departure and that she need not bother with his room until he had left he inquired into the health of her rheumatic husband complimented her on her new shoes gave her a fivedollar tip and smilingly closed the door he bathed shaved and began to dress he was five feet ten and onehalf inches tall and he weighed roughly one hundred and seventy pounds his face was a little long his mouth wide and a trifle thinlipped his eyes gray and wideset his graying sandcolored hair was very thin on top in one of his sloping unostentatiously powerful shoulders were two bullet scars aside from that there was nothing to distinguish him from any number of fortyyearold men the stock and barrel of a rifle were slung on loops inside his topcoat doc took them out hung the coat back in the closet and began to assemble them the stock was from an ordinary twentytwo rifle the barrel as well as the rest of the gun proper had either been made or made over by doc its most distinctive feature was a weldedon cylinder fitted at one end with a plunger it looked like and was a small air pump doc slid a twentytwo slug into the breech closed and locked it and rocked the slug into place he began to pump pumping harder as the resistance inside the air chamber grew when he could no longer depress the plunger he gave it several quick turns sealing the end of the cylinder he smoked a cigarette and scanned the morning newspaper which charlie had brought with his breakfast pausing now and then to pick idly at an incipient hangnail he reweighed his decision to dispose of rudy and could see no reason to change it no reason at least of sufficient importance when they reached the west coast they would need to hole up temporarily to reconnoiter switch cars and break trail generally before jumping into mexico it was wise to do that at any rate even though it might not be absolutely necessary and rudy had lined up a place where they could take temporary sanctuary it was a small tourist court owned by some distant relatives of his they were naturalized citizens an almost painfully honest elderly couple but they had an unreasoning fear of the police brought with them from the old country and they were even more terrified of rudy so reluctantly they had submitted to his demands on this occasion and several others doc was confident that he could handle them quite well without rudy he was confident that they would be even more rather than less cooperative if they knew that he had disposed of their fearsome kinsman glancing at his watch doc lighted another cigarette and picked up the rifle standing back in the concealing shadows of the room he took aim through the window one eye squinted against the smoke from the dangling cigarette the bank guard was due any minute now he there was a knock on the door doc hesitated for a split second then crossed the room in two long strides and opened the door a few inches the maid thrust a handful of towels at him sorry to bother you mr kramer thought you might be needin these why thats very thoughtful of you doc said just a moment and ill now thats all right mr kramer you given me too much already but i insist doc said pleasantly you wait right here rosie leaving the door ajar he wheeled back across the room and raised the rifle sighting it as he moved mack wingate was just stepping across the banks threshold had almost disappeared into its dark interior doc triggered the gun and there was a sharp sighing sound like the sudden emission of breath he didnt wait to see the guard fall when doc shot at something he hit it with a more powerful rifle his aim would have been just as accurate at five hundred yards as it had been at fifty he gave the maid a dollar bill again thanking her for her courtesy closing and relocking the door he got the clerk on the phone charlie does that train into the city leave at ninetwenty or ninethirty fine thats what i thought no no cab thanks i can use a little walk he hung up the phone reloaded the rifle and again pumped up the pressure he unfastened the stock locked it up in his briefcase and put the rest back in the loops of the topcoat he lifted the coat out draped it loosely over one arm he walked back and forth with it for a moment then nodded with satisfaction and hung it back in the closet rudy wouldnt expect him to have the rifle it would come as a complete surprise to him but just in case it didnt ill think of something doc assured himself and went to work on a more immediate problem his luggage contained an unusual number of toiletries bath salts hair tonics and the like more accurately it contained the containers of these items which were filled not with what their labels indicated but such oddly assorted things as naphtha crude oil a gauzewrapped quarterstick of dynamite and the movements from two watches they formed the ingredients of two incendiary smoke bombs doc began to assemble them first spreading the newspaper out on the bed to protect its coverings a few fine beads of sweat formed on his forehead the movements of his fingers were sure but extremely delicate the dynamite itself which he sliced into two pieces he regarded as safe and a mere quarterstick of it as virtually harmless even if exploded no dynamite was all right dinah was easygoing tolerating almost anything short of outrage the danger lay in that cute little black cap she wore when being readied for action they the percussion caps were about the size of an afterdinner mint and their behavior was anything but good and tiny as they were one of them was more than enough to remove a mans hand doc was glad when his job was finished glad that he would never again have to take on a similar job the bombs could have been purchased readymade of course but doc distrusted the purveyors of such items they might talk besides they lacked the incentive to turn out topgrade merchandise anything less than which was apt to prove fatal to the purchaser doc put the bombs in his wastebasket and crumpled the soiled newspaper over them he scrubbed his hands in the bathroom and turned down the turnedup cuffs of his shirt for no conscious reason he sighed hed been on tougher jobs than this one but never one where so much depended on its success everything he had was on the line here everything that he and carol had he was pushing fortyone she was almost fourteen years younger so one more fall one more prison stretch and and that would be that the thoughts stirred muddily in the bottom of his mind unrecognized and unadmitted manifested only in an unconscious sigh he had not taken another look at the bank since seeing that rudy and the kid had gotten in all right hed had work to do and thered been no point in looking if there was trouble hed be able to hear it now however he looked again and was just in time to see the bank president enter its door the door closed abruptly almost catching the heel of his shoe doc winced and shook his head unconsciously as he had sighed it was ten minutes of nine doc adjusted his tie and put on his suit jacket now it was five minutes of he picked up the wastebasket and stepped out into the hall he went down the faded red carpet to the end of the hall then turned right into a short side corridor a metal trash can stood between the back stairs and the sidestreet window doc poked the papers into the can idly glancing up and down the street his luck was far better than he could have hoped for a flatbed farm truck was parked rear end first at the curb next to it was a sedan its windows rolled up tightly but next to them parked to windward of them was another truck loaded almost to the level of the hotels secondfloor windows and what it was loaded with was baled hay doc gave the street another quick up and down glance then he tossed the bombs lofting one between the trucks cab and bed the other onto the load of hay he picked up the wastebasket and returned to his room it was two minutes of nine now two minutes before the bombs were set to explode and three or four people were gathered in front of the bank waiting for it to open doc completed his arrangements for leaving slowly counting off the seconds the time lock on the banks vault was set for eightfifty slightly more than ten minutes later rudy and jackson had cleared it of cash dollar bills and coins excepted and several thick packages of negotiable securities the banker lay sprawled on the floor halfdead from rudys pistolwhipping stumbling over his unconscious body rudy gave him a savage kick in the face turned halfcrazed eyes upon the kid the fear had filled him now the furious outraged fear of a cornered rat it would simmer down in time solidify into the murderous triggerquick wiliness which had guided him in and out of so many tight places which forced him to survive long after the withered inner man had cried out for the peace of death now however there was nothing but the raging fear and he had to strike out at something at anything you hear anything out there he jerked his head toward the streetwell did you hear anything wwhat the bombs you longeared jerk any commotion huhuh but i dont guess we could could we rudy i mean there in the vault we nno ddont the kid strangled on a scream he tried to claw the gun from his belt then he toppled forward clutching at his halfdisemboweled abdomen at the guts which torrento had mockingly credited him with having rudy giggled he made a sound that was strangely akin to a sob then he wiped his knife on a blotter returned it to his pocket and picked up the two briefcases he carried them to the bank door set them down again he turned and looked meditatively at the banks three employees they were scattered about the lobby floor their mouths sealed with tape their wrists and ankles bound with more tape they looked at him their eyes rolling to show the whites and rudy hesitantly fingered his knife theyd have him tabbed for the robbery for killing the kid and if things broke wrong doc would doubtless manage to tag him with the guards death trust doc to keep himself in the clear him and his smart little sneak of a wife but anyway these yokels could finger him pick his wedgeshaped map out of a million mug shots so as long as he couldnt be fried or have his neck popped but once anyhow why not he took the knife out again he went from employee to employee slashing the bonds of their ankles kicking and cursing and yanking them to their feet shoving them ahead of him he herded them back inside the vault he swung the door shut on them gave the knob a few spins thered been no point in killing them hed been seen coming into the joint and he was a cinch to be seen leaving there was a hell of a racket outside and it was growing by the second and even in here you could get a whiff of smoke but still someone a lot of someones would see him leave the best he could hope for was that none of em would try to do anything about it none of em did doc had figured right they had too much else to be interested in to pay any attention to him and after all what was so funny about a guy coming out of a bank during banking hours the side street was jammed with people surging back toward the walks occasionally when the winddriven smoke threatened to envelop them sparks showered upward from the burning hay a gas tank exploded sending a speckled fountain of fire into the air the crowd roared jamming back into the intersection and the people in the intersection tried to push forward several men in red helmets were scurrying about shouting and gesturing futilely other redhelmeted men were lunging up the street dragging a twowheel hose cart behind them the bell in the courthouse cupola tolled steadily rudy loaded the briefcases into the car he made a uturn honking for a couple of yokels to get out of the way and headed out of town a block away doc stepped down from the walk to the street and climbed in with him they rode on rudy grinning meanly to himself as he noted the careless caution with which doc handled his coat mccoy asked him how they had made out two hundred in bonds maybe a hundred and forty in cash a hundred and forty docs eyes flicked at him i see mustve been a lot of ones and silver so maybe theres more dammit you think i figured it up on an addin machine now rudy doc said soothingly no offense how did it go with the youngster what dyou mean howd it go howd you plan it to go of course too bad doc said vaguely i always feel bad when something like that is necessary rudy snorted he jammed a cigarette into his mouth put his left hand in his jacket pocket ostensibly seeking a match it came out with a heavy automatic which he leveled across his lap get rid of the rifle doc toss it out in the ditch might as well doc didnt appear to notice the automatic doesnt look like were going to need it he lifted the rifle muzzle first and dropped it out the window rudy let out another snort doesnt look like were gonna need it he mocked well you aint going to need that rod in your jacket either doc so don t move for it just take the jacket off and toss it in the back seat listen rudy do it doc did it rudy made him lean forward then backward swiftly scanning his trousers he nodded gave doc permission to light a cigarette doc turned a little in the seat eyes sorrowful beneath the brim of his hat this doesnt make sense rudy not if its what i think it is thats what it is exactly what youd figured for me youre wrong rudy i shouldnt have to tell you that how would i get by at golies without you theyre your relatives and if carol and i pulled in there by ourselves theyd probably give you a gold watch rudy said sourly dont kid me doc you think im stupid or something in this case yes perhaps we might get along as well without you but as well youd be a hell of a lot better off and you know it i dont agree with you but let it go youll need us rudy carol and me huhuh just a different car and some other duds yeah and your share of the take thats all doc hesitated looked through the windshield he glanced at the speedometer too fast rudy were liable to pick up a cop you mean were ahead of schedule rudy grinned thats what you mean aint it give carol the signal at least shell think theres trouble if you dont might even lam out on us not on you rudys laugh was enviously angry shell know you was going to bump me and no rudy how and shell figure you got caught in a snarl so shell move right on in and try to get you out of it doc didnt argue the point in fact he ceased to argue at all he simply shrugged turned around in the seat and was silent coming so quickly his apparent resignation bothered rudy not because he was afraid doc had a fast one up his sleeve obviously he couldnt have the feeling came from something else the irksome deeply rooted need to justify himself look doc he blurted irritably i wasnt burned over what you was going to do to me youdve been a sap to do anything else and id be a sap to do anything else so whats there to cry about i didnt realize i was crying and you got no right to rudy said doggedly look a hundred and forty in cash maybe a hundred and twentyfive out of the bonds call it a quarter of a million all together that aint no dough in a threeway split not when its the last youre going to get and you got to hole up with the king all your life he doesnt put out anything without cash on the line and plenty of it exactly doc smiled witheringly so it would be an excellent idea not to simply live up your cash wouldnt it to use it in such a way that youd be sure of a generous income as long as you lived how you mean rudy waited like startin a tamale parlor huh he jeered or maybe a gambling casino he waited again youre goin to run competition with the king doc laughed softly the laugh of an adult at a small childs antics really rudy in your case id suggest a circus you could be your own clown rudy scowled and licked his lips uncertainly he started to speak stopped himself he cleared his throat and made another attempt uh whatd you have in mind doc dope maybe smuggling i figured them things was sewed up but ah to hell with you doc im holding aces and youre trying to buy out with hot air fine so why dont we let it go at that doc said easily rudys foot eased up on the gas two emotions warred within him ingrained suspicion and inherent terror of being in want doc was conning him or was he would a smoothie like doc go out on a limb unless he saw a better one to grab and and what did a guy do when he ran out of dough and he couldnt take it away from someone else you aint got a thing doc he mumbled you got something what you got to lose by telling me about it very little but what would you have to gain take such a simple matter as mexicos foreign policy its relations i should say on a global basis as compared to those of its latinamerican neighbors the situation isnt going to change any or if it does it will be to a still more favorable position its tied directly to the monetary market the foreign exchange rate to use the more popular term and with inflationary tendencies being what they are and with gold staked at thirtyfive dollars an ounce the potential for the right kind of operator is doc let his voice trail away never mind rudy he said pleasantly it seems simple enough to me but i didnt really expect you to understand its something thats confused a great many highly intelligent people men who were very successful in their own particular professions like doubletalk maybe rudy scoffed but he said it rather feebly there were certain words phrases that rang a bell in his mind foreign exchange inflationary tendencies monetary market the terms were identified with news stories which he invariably skipped over but he guessed they probably meant heavy sugar to a lot of people like doubletalk doc was saying yes thats exactly the way it would sound to you and i cant say that i blame you a bit it would probably sound the same way to me if i hadnt spent most of my last fouryear stretch reading up on it well no its no use rudy doc said firmly i wish i could its a good deal and a perfectly legitimate one and youd have been just the right man to hold down one end of it but i cant make it any clearer than i have so theres nothing more to be said rudy was not a fast thinker if the weird processes of his mind could be called thinking but when he made a decision he made it fast abruptly he dropped the gun into his pocket and said all right doc im not buying just yet but ill take an option doc nodded he didnt trust himself to speak im keeping your gun rudy went on im taking any iron that carol has when she shows we stop at night you two get tied up we stop for grub or something during the day one of you stays with me either one of you tries anything thatll be it know what i mean okay i know exactly what you mean doc purred and naturally its okay they crossed a bridge over a small creek immediately on the other side rudy turned the car straight down the roads embankment then down the bank of the creek the wheels bounced high in the air the steering wheel jerked and spun in his hands rudy fought it around to his left heading the car up the rocky bed of the stream with its shallow trickles of water a couple of hundred yards farther on beneath a cloaking arbor of trees he brought it to a stop doc took a handkerchief from his pocket mopped at his forehead he said mildly that he was afraid his neck was broken rudy laughed doc got out of the car and removed his hat continuing the mopping process as rudy climbed out you kill me yknow doc rudy was still snorting over the joke you really slay me sometimes i so whats wrong with that doc said and as rudy burst into renewed laughter he took a gun from his hat and fired got him right through the heart doc told carol one of those very rare instances where a man actually died laughing just so he died carol grimaced thats one character could never feel easy around i always had a feeling that he was just about ready to jump at me from the one side i wasnt watching alas poor rudy doc murmured but how have you been my dear to move from the ridiculous to the sublime weel carol slanted a sultry glance at him i think ill be a lot better tomorrow you know after i get a good nights sleep tut tut said doc i see youre still a very wicked young woman they had driven through beacon city commenting wonderingly on the smoke looking curiously at the milling throngs and now they were far down the highway on the other side of town doc was driving since carol had driven all night she sat sidewise in the seat facing him her legs curled under her their eyes kept meeting they kept smiling at each other doc patted one of her small round flanks and she held his hand for a moment gripping it almost fiercely what are you worried about doc worried i can always tell is it golies you think that if rudy isnt with us doc shook his head no trouble there i wouldnt say i was worried about anything just puzzled in a troubled sort of way about our friend beynon oh said carol oh yeah beynon was an attorney the chairman of the pardon and parole board docs pardon had been bought from him and there was still fifteen thousand dollars due on the purchase price he owned a tiny ranch up in the far corner of the state a bachelor he lived on it when he was not occupied with some legal case or his official duties they were going there now doc carol was staring through the windshield lets make a switch head right into mexico from here we couldnt do it baby its too obvious were too close but you havent been connected with the job with any kind of break at all itll be days before you are that doesnt help much not when the jobs this big and this close to the border theyll have road blocks up fifty miles this side of el paso everyonell get a shakedown anyone trying to cross over had better be strictly clean and able to prove it or hes in the soup well but the other way doc beynon is miles off of our route and if you think he may be up to something why why skip him doc gave her a thoughtful look is that what you were going to suggest carol why not what could he do about it doc smiled wryly almost irritated with her leave beynon holding the sack for his fifteen thousand a man with his connections who knew as much about them as he did it was too preposterous to discuss they were due at his ranch just as quickly as they could get there from beacon city and they had damned well better not daily along the way what could he do carol repeated stubbornly why pay him off if hes going to make trouble anyway i dont know that he is if hes planning to however and if i cant talk him out of it doc left the sentence unfinished his shrewd eyes thoughtful behind the obscuring sunglasses beynon hadnt run according to form what he had done was completely out of character and having acted in such a way he must have a motive which did not appear on the surface doc stroked his jaw shook his head absently how did he add up to you carol he asked i mean aside from the fact that hes an ambitious man with plenty of uses for money did he do or say anything that would indicate why he would go for a deal like this one carol didnt answer him doc was about to repeat the question when he saw that she was asleep doc went to new york the spring that he graduated from high school a few weeks after his fathers death he was too young to hold political office and there were no worthwhile jobs in the town on the other hand he was convincedas were his countless friends that he would be virtually able to pick and choose from the many opportunities available in a large city things didnt work out that way he had no difficulty in getting jobs even in those times of economic depression but he held none of them more than a few weeks he was a disrupting influence throwing any establishment he went into out of kilter other employees tended to gather around him leaving their work undone minor supervisors coddled and favored him to the detriment of morale as an upperechelon executive he would have been invaluable to any company but he qualified neither in years nor experience for anything but the lowliest jobs and in that capacity he was simply a nuisance working briefly and rarely he lived largely on credit and small loans he worried about these obligations and he readily acquiesced when a bar ownercreditor offered to wipe the slate clean and even gift him with a small bonus in return for a little favor the favor was done the barkeep collected on his burglary insurance a few days later he introduced doc to the proprietor of a floating crap game a man who needed big money in a hurry and could not depend on gambling to get it doc was glad to cooperate with him he stuck up the game with some subtle assistance from the proprietor and they split the proceeds later on the gambler having introduced him to some right boys doc stuck up one of his games again without prearrangement and without splitting nor did this in any way violate his fathers code about friendship on the contrary the elder mccoy had believed that a mans best friend is himself that a nonfriend was anyone who ceased to be useful and that it was more or less a moral obligation to cash in any persons in this category whenever it could be done safely and with no chance of a kickback doc was made for crime the truly big operations which he rapidly moved into no one could get on the inside of a job as easily as he no one could plan so shrewdly no one was so imperturbable and coolheaded he liked his work beginning a stiff prison sentence at age twentyfive he still remained loyally committed to it his take for the last five years had been more than a hundred thousand a year for that kind of money a man could afford to sit it out for a while he could use his enforced leisure to relax make new contacts improve his criminal knowledge and plan new jobs docs ensuing eight years behind bars were entirely comfortable and often highly enjoyable after all a prison cannot function without the cooperation of its inmates it cannot do so satisfactorily at least or for very long so a man who can lead his fellow prisoners who can deliver their cooperation or withhold it can get almost anything he asks for and about the only deprivation doc suffered was the loss of his income given the same circumstances he could have taken his second and last prison sentence as lightly as he had the first but the circumstances differed crucially he was married and to a woman almost fourteen years his junior and he was thirtysix years old doc didnt fret about the situation he never missed a meal nor a nights sleep nor spent a moment in futile regret he had just one problem to get out before getting out became pointless very well then if that was what had to be done he would do it he had left sixty thousand dollars on the outside with carol with that and a topflight criminal lawyer he managed to get his twentyyear sentence reduced to ten it was a long step on the road to freedom barring upsets he would qualify for parole in approximately seven years but that wasnt good enough for doc the seven years might as well be seventy as he saw it and he wanted no more paroles trying to operate while on parole was what had put him where he was there were four members of the pardon and parole board in addition to its chairman beynon exercising his unusual privileges doc approached them one by one the middleaged woman member fell for him he was able to buy her with conversation the three men members were open to a cash proposition unfortunately doc had run very very low on money he didnt have nearly the amount needed for the threeman buy and his lawyer who was usually open to a good proposition himself refused to play banker not that i dont trust you doc he explained i know id get mine right off the top of your first job the point is there wouldnt be any job because there aint going to be any pardon youdve talked this over with me in the first place idve told you you were wasting your time but id have four members a majority of the board majority schmority three of em are crooks and the gals a wellmeaning imbecile beynon would veto them if they tried to crowd him hed start swinging kick up such a stink that youd probably have to do the rest of your time in the hole turn it around then if they cant push him can he push them he could he could make em do a skirt dance on the capitol steps if he took a notion but lay off doc he didnt get that way by going for the fast dollar good for him the better the reputation the less the risk yeah the lawyer smiled bitterly like to meet a guy that almost got disbarred for offering beynon a cigar well shake hands doc wasnt convinced hed dealt with honest johns before and theyd never turned out as pure as they were supposed to be so he arranged to see beynon alone and that was about all he didjust saw him and excused himself as quickly as he could he was too shrewd too able an interpreter of a mans expression the tone of his voice his overall attitude to do anything else beynon obviously wanted him to make the bribe attempt it was also obvious that he had some very unpleasant plans for doc as soon as it was made so ill have to think of something else doc told carol on her next visit i dont know what it will be but beynons definitely out maybe not we cant be sure unless we try im sure beynon wont take you mean he never has carol persisted he wont take from you or the lawyer ordinarily he wouldnt take from me but suppose id broken up with you doc that it looked like i had then hed have a double out for himself in case anyone got nasty if i were through with you then naturally i wouldnt be giving him a bribe and when a mans wife quits him its supposed to be punishment dont you see doc i wouldnt have any reason to bribe him and he would have a reason for giving you a break it sounded pretty flimsy to doc but carol wanted to try and it was pressing four years since he had entered the penitentiary so he told her to go ahead two months passed before he saw her again no one could have been more surprised than he when she reported success beynon would sell him a pardon the price five thousand cash fifteen thousand within ninety days news of the robbery had been on the air since tenthirty that morning carol and doc listened to it the radio tuned to a whisper as they ate lunch at a roadside drivein rudy had been identified from rogues gallery photographs except forjackson whom he had killed there was no mention of a confederate rudy had robbed the bank rudy had driven boldly out of town with more than three hundred thousand dollars in swag the authorities were puzzled as to how he had gained entry into the bank to kill the guard but no one raised the question as to whether he had shot wingate that would happen in about two days doc mused as he turned the car back into the highway the trajectory of the bullet and the bullet itself would instigate inquiries about an unnamed businessman who had been vacationing in beacon city and in two or three more days the businessman would be named along with his business but by that time it wouldnt matter the news broadcast ended gave way to a disc jockey carol started to doze again and doc leaned over to switch off the radio then abruptly he turned it up he and carol listened silently tensely to a late news bulletin it was over in a moment carol turned the switch turned slowly wideeyed toward doc doc doc hesitated then shook his head firmly huhuh after all it happened almost sixty miles away from beacon city it couldnt have anything to do with why couldnt it who else would do a thing like that anyone could have some drunk that lost his head some gunhappy teenager you dont really believe that doc i know you dont carol said you didnt kill him rudys still alive aimed straight at the heart docs bullet felled rudy torrento like a streak of lightning he stopped breathing all conscious movement his eyes glazed his wedgeshaped face became a foolish frozen mask and he crumpled silently backward an idiot doll cast aside by its master the back of his head struck against a rock in the bed of the stream the impact deepened and extended his deathlike state so far from giving him a second bullet doc mccoy hardly gave him a second glance and less than thirty minutes after docs departure rudy came to life again his head ached horribly and his first move was to roll on his stomach and batter the offending rock with his fists then memory returned and terror surged through him and he hurled himself to his feet clawing clawing off his coat and holster ripping open his shirt and undershirt ripping aside their bloody mess and seeing and feeling seeingf eeling the scarlet frightfulness of his flesh he snarled whimpered whined all silently his vocal cords constricted he threw back his head and let out a long silent howl the shivering heartbreaking cry of a dying animal that was taken care of then the last ceremony which instinct demanded now he could begin the actual business of dying he breathed more and more rapidly feverish poisonfilled air rushed into his lungs his heart raced and stuttered and his body began to jerk and stiffen i knew it he thought dully almost with his last thoughts back there years ago back when i was just a kid back as far as i can remember i knew itd be like this everything gettin colder and colder and the darkness getting deeper and deeper an i knew i knew knew the word drummed through his mind sending a signal back through the years through thousands of miles through the grim gray walls and chilledsteel cages of a maximum security prison and back through time and distance came a voice which told rudy the piehead one of the nations top ten public enemies that he was a foolish little child who knew nothing whatsoever rudy blinked and a little color came back into his fishgray face max he whispered hopefully you you here max but of course i am where else would i be when my leetle poy rudy is in trouble now do vot i tell you instanter rudy did so he was quite alone needless to say alone with the whispering halfdry stream and the deep shadows of the arching trees and the saltsweet smell of his own blood but in his mind he was not alone with him was the one person he had ever loved or been loved by little max herr doktor max max vonderscheid md phd psych d abortionist physician to criminals a man who had never been able to say no to a need regardless of laws and professional ethics he and rudy had been cellmates for three years those years in a socalled tough jug had given the piehead the only true happiness he had ever known one does not forget such things or such a man each of his actions his words becomes a thing to treasure rudy stretched out flat on the ground closed his eyes relaxed as completely as he could and held his breath for a moment then he began to count slowly one two three exhaling and inhaling in time with the count when he had counted to ten three times his breathing was near normal and his heart had ceased its wild palpitating he kept his eyes shut waiting and the voice spoke to him again he had done well oh but werry goot he had remembered that shock was the big killer shock first infection second if one gave way to shock even a very minor wound could prove fatal but max rudy knew a momentary return of panic it aint minor he wasnt ten feet away and he shot me straight through the rudy sat up a hoarse laugh welled in his throat shot through the ticker why hell if that had happened he wouldnt be alive he examined his torso again wondering just what had happened and how the riddle remained one to an extent rather it had a bit of miracle mixed up in it the metalsheathed tip of the holster had obviously deflected the bullet ever so slightly while it had been further deflected by the ironhard botch of broken bones and cartilage that formed his rib cage but still he was very lucky to be alive and the wound was still nothing to laugh off extending from a point immediately over his heart the flesh had been furrowed bonedeep across his chest and halfway around the left side of his body probably because of the way he had fallen his chest arching against his clothes and holster strap he had bled relatively little much less at any rate than he normally would have but movement had opened the wound wide now and he was losing blood at a dangerous rate he made a bandage with his undershirt binding it tight with his belt and holster strap that helped but not much nor did it help much more when he added his socks and handkerchief to the bandage he had one thing left two things rather readily available for putting over the wound the two thick sheafs of bills he had sequestered from the bank loot but if he used them got them bloody and they probably wouldnt do a damned bit of good anyway huhuh he had to keep that dough as long as he had dough and a gun and a car but above all the dough well he had a chance to live to catch up with doc and carol beyond that catching up with and killing them he couldnt think at the moment it seemed both a means and an end to him in their deaths somehow he would find life for himself he climbed weakly into the car and gunned the motor sending the vehicle roaring up and out of the creek bed and onto the road in a skidding series of jumps and jounces it was the way it had to be he lacked the strength for reconnoitering the strength and the time all he could do was come up fast and hope for the best his luck held no one was passing on the road luck continued with him as he skirted beacon citys outer streets and took to the highway again on the other side then swiftly with his blood it began to flow away he fumbled in the glove compartment of the car took out a halffilled pint of whiskey he took a cautious drink then feeling warmed and stronger a bigger one he capped the bottle with one hand dug cigarettes from his pocket he found one that was still usable and lit up drawing the smoke deep into his lungs suddenly for no reason except that he was drunk he guffawed laughing he took another drink another long puff on the cigarette abruptly the bottle fell from his hand and the car swerved crazily toward the ditch the cigarette saved him as he fought to avoid the ditch he jammed the burning butt between his palm and the steering wheel and the pain screamed his mind awake gave it the complete alertness that it needed but it began to fade almost as soon as it came he was conscious then surely swiftly he was losing consciousness again foolish rudy so little blood he has and he mixes that with alcohol rudy brought the car to a weaving stop awkwardly gasping with weakness he raised and turned himself in the seat reached down onto the rear floor his fingers found what they were seeking closing them with shaky tightness he flopped down into the seat again the two sandwiches were dry and stale the coffee in the vacuum bottle was cold and tasted sour but rudy consumed all of it and all of the food had to eat when you were losing blood had to pack the chow down to come off a jag had to had to had to get to a doctor he was driving again he could not remember starting up but the wind was whipping into his face and the highway was leaping madly beneath the car ddoctor he mumbled drowsily got tuh hurryn see a see doc an awareness flooded over him again he cursed savagely bitterly his dark face contorting into a baffled scowl how could he go to a doctor thered be other people around patients a nurse maybe the guys wife and even if he could take care of them and get treated then what so sure hed bump off the sawbones as soon as the job was done but that wouldnt help doctors were busy guys people were always calling on them dropping in on them and not necessarily my poy not with a certain kind of doctor oh perhaps he vould haf calls but they would be relatively few and the callers being under no such dire necessity as would prevail in rudy brushed the sweat from his eyes he began to slacken his speed to study the occasional rfd mailboxes at the side of the highway country doctor was that it huhuh country docs didnt live in the country right in town sames any other kind and if one of em was killed or missing the heatd be on fast faster than fast this close to that bank job wouldnt take no eddie hoover to figure out that that the highway began to blur everything began to blur to sink into a kind of gray fuzziness he crouched forward over the wheel brushing constantly at his eyesjust before he lost consciousness completely he turned into a side road he could remember doing nothing after that yet he did a great deal as much as he would have if he had been fully aware of his reactions the frightful present no longer existed he was reborn free of all fear and the hideous savagery which festered in it for little max was with him max vonderscheid of the leonine head and the dwarfed hunchbacked body and he was laughing in a way he had never laughed before or since aw haw haw now youre kidding me again you little old dutch bugger you but vot iss so funny my poor paranoid friend you should read jonathan svift it viii gif you a better perspective vy not der schooling has many parallels even it might be said that he must know much more of medicine and anatomy than your proud md the basic difference only that der patients are usually more deserfing and inwariably less demanding rudy came back into consciousness as quickly as he had gone out of it he was awake and considerably refreshed the moment the other car turned into the side road he had crouched down on the floorboards before passing out lying on the seat from the waist up thus he could not be seen unless someone peered directly into the car and now he remained hidden making no move except to firm the grip on the gun he had kept in his hand no move was necessary he had already done everything that could be done in just such an emergency both windows on the left side were rolled down the right wheels were parked on the edge of the roadside ditch the rearview mirror was twisted to an angle which permitted him to see without raising his head it was a blackandwhite patrol car there were two men in it one young one middleaged apparently a rookie and a regular they got out on opposite sides of the vehicle and started forward that way hands on gun butts they kept well apart from one another moving up on the suspect objective from different directions this of course was and is the proper procedure never to be deviated from under any circumstances due to the way the car was parked however it would have been bothersome if not impossible to carry it through and since the vehicle was obviously empty it seemed unnecessary so after a moments pause one of them shrugged and the other laughed and they came on together almost shoulder to shoulder just that once they violated regulations and a split second after rudy reared up over the seat both of them were dead he took their guns and ammunition he whipped his car around in a uturn running partly over the older mans body and took to the highway again he knew what he had todo now and the knowledge gave him strength it also amused him and he laughed as he had when max vonderscheid gave him the tip which he was now about to use now wasnt that somethin though whod ever think of a dodge like that getting yourself fixed up by a vet a horse doctor doc mccoys greatest vice and major virtue was his sureness he had been right so often and so long that he could not conceive the possibility of being anything else genially he might charge himself with error goodnaturedly accept the blame for anothers mistake but that was just doc part of his masquerade in his heart he was never wrong never that is about anything that really mattered and to have a doubt raised as to whether he had actually killed rudy a thing at once simple yet vital made him as near to angry as he ever came ill tell you carol he said a trace of fiddlestring tightness in his voice i dont know who shot those two cops i dont care all i know is that it was not done by rudy torrento well if you say so doc but look at it this way i wasnt a great deal farther from rudy than i am from you suppose i decided to plug you right now do you think id kill you or not carol laughed uneasily he was smiling at her joking of course no one knew better than she how much doc thought of her the lengths he was willing to go to for her sake but if she hadnt known if she hadnt been sure that doc wanted and needed her just as much after the bank robbery as before the thought nettled her she spoke in a tone a manner that was almost an identical match for his suppose i decided to plug you right now she said smiling playful steadyeyed do you think id kill you or not im sorry doc said warmly to answer your question i wouldnt blame you if you did exactly like that i dont like being shut up doc i dont intend to be and youre quite right my dear so dont talk to me that way again never ever understand i know you didnt mean it like it sounded but doc turned the car off onto a country road stopping just over the crest of a little hill he turned silently and took his wife into his arms he kissed her drew her more and more tightly to him he kissed her again his sure hands pressing and caressing her small hardsoft body and afterward as they drove on they were again one with each other each an extension of the other their brief flareup was forgotten there was no more mention of rudy carol was glad to be convinced to be sure that rudy was dead mostly they were silent happy and content merely to be together but as the sun sank lower in the sky there was more talk of beynon the man his motives rather still bothered doc it was difficult to believe that the parole chief meant to grab all the bank loot instead of the relatively small share he had agreed to accept to think that such a man would commit murder as he would have to for any amount of money was nothing short of ridiculous on the other hand was it any more ridiculous than his ostensible sellout at the risk of his career and reputation for a mere pittance carol was of little help with the riddle she seemed indifferent to its answer a little bored dully withdrawn then a few miles from beynons place she brightened turned almost gaily to her husband ive got an idea doc let me take beynon his fifteen grand you doc gave her a quick glance without me you mean yes you take the money satchel and and just where would i take it to where would i wait at the side of the road or at one of these little inland villages some wide place in the road where every stranger gets the bigeye and maybe an interview by the town clown we can work it out please doc what do you say that i cant believe youre serious said doc evenly i appreciate your concern for me of course but he shook his head it just wouldnt do lamb as i mentioned before if beynon is planning something weve got to know about it now weve got to get it settled now i could settle it but he wouldnt bring things to a showdown if you were by yourself in any event the kind of settlement if one is necessary is something id want to decide on myself carol started to say something else then shrugged and lapsed into silence doc lighted a cigarette and extended the package and she shook her head wordlessly they skirted a small village its church spires poking up through a grove of trees doc slowed the car to make a quick study of the road map then resumed his former speed a few miles farther on he turned into a narrow dirt road which stretched ribbonlike up through the hills it was less than an hour before sunset now and a chill southwesterly wind was stirring back in the hills doc got an occasional glimpse of a ranch house or an outbuilding he didnt like that in this isolated area their car could be seen for a very long ways and one as conspicuous as theirs was certain to be remembered the trail met with another at the rutted intersection two mailboxes stood catercornered to each other on one of them crudely printed in black paint was the name beynon doc stopped the car and looked carefully around the lonely rolling terrain apparently the intersection was not visible from either of the two houses which must be nearby he considered this fact murmuring absently that beynons place should be just over the next hill to their right carol responded with a murmur of agreement doc scratched his cheek thoughtfully then reached into the back of the car and lifted the money satchel into the front seat he opened it sorted out fifteen thousand dollars and put it in the inside pocket of his coat then as long as it was something that needed to be done anyway he gave carol a few hundred dollars in small bills stuffed his wallet with a few hundred more and assembled a third sheaf totaling perhaps a thousand this was scat money dough to be kept readily available doc fastened it together with two of the banks paper money bands laid it in right at the top of the suitcase and closed and locked it again then he got out unlocked the trunk and put the suitcase inside he did not lower the trunk lid immediately instead catching carols eye in the rearview mirror he gave her a grin and a wink that idea of yours he smiled if you dont mind a variation of it along with a little cramping carols face lit up she hopped out of the car and came around to the rear pulling the gun from her belt she checked its chamber with two crisp metallic clicks before shoving it back into place the action sent a frown flickering through docs eyes he laid a hand on her arm as she started to climb into the trunk she was to take it very easy he cautioned to do nothing without his lead beynon was not a killer he was a very prominent man and they she and doc had a long way to travel carol nodded that she understood she climbed into the trunk and doc lowered the lid leaving the lock off the latch as he had supposed beynons place was only a few hundred yards away just over the crest of the nearest hill the house was one of those oldfashioned ranch dwellings twostoried and painted white with a long veranda or gallery extending across the front down the slope to the rear of the house was a large red barn now partitioned down one side to provide a garage for beynons car adjoining it was a plank corral which opened at the far end into a lushly grassed pasture grazing in it were a couple of riding horses and a few head of whitefaced cattle beynon kept no employees the ranch if it could be called that was merely a hobby with him when business affairs took him away a neighbor looked after his small amount of livestock doc parked the car in the yard beneath a gnarled cottonwood tree he got out casually brushing at his clothes and looked around it was very quiet the big old house with its shadowblack windows seemed never to have been occupied beynons car a threeyearold model was in the garage but there was no sign of him doc strolled across the yard whistling tunelessly softly he stepped up on the porch the front door was open through the screen he called beynon and stood waiting listening there was no answer no sound but that in itself the nosound the complete silence was an answer doc opened the screen he slammed it again from the outside then he stepped down from the porch and strode silently around the house to the back door it also stood open and the screen was unlatched he peered in eyes squinting against the shadows with a soft sigh he walked in beynon sat at the long kitchen table his head pillowed in his arms on the checkered oilcloth in front of him was a tippedover glass and a halfempty quart bottle of whiskey drunk doc thought with less tolerance than was customary to him the great man had troubles so he got drunk picking up a glass from the sink he walked around the table and sat down opposite the parole chief he poured himself a drink took a sip of it and lighted a cigarette deliberately he spewed smoke at the man across from him it was probably the least startling way of any to wake him up beynons head with its wild mass of black hair jerked irritably then abruptly he sat up except for a very faint thickness of speech he seemed quite sober either he had spilled much more of the whiskey than he had drunk or he had slept it off his burning black eyes were clear they were as contemptuous as knowing of doc as they had been back at the prison doc smiled made a small gesture with his glass i hope you dont mind its been a rather trying day wheres your wife beynon said were traveling in different cars shell be along in an hour or so how nice of her beynon said in his rich musical voice how very very nice of her to come to see me he poured himself a drink threw it down at a gulp or perhaps she isnt he said perhaps her comings and goings have ceased for all time doc shrugged idly if youre inferring that i killed her wheres rudy mccoy wheres your friend torrento hes in another car too yes and neither he nor the car is moving in case youre interested i thought youd be primarily interested in knowing that i have the bank money in my car this was bait beynon didnt rise to it doc waved it at him again youve received five thousand dollars from me from my wife rather i agreed to pay fifteen thousand more frankly doc turned on his sincerest look frankly i dont think thats enough mr beynon we didnt get as much out of this job as we hoped to but thats no fault of yours and three people have been killed so far mccoy whose fault would you say that was oh now doc spread his hands you mustnt feel car your wife told me that no one would be killed she swore to it im sorry i imagine she was simply trying to spare your feelings but getting back to the subject its still murder mccoy how many more will there be before all this is over if it is ever all over how many more lives will i have on my hands doc hesitated started to attempt some soothing comment then he leaned forward a little spoke with abrupt bluntness beynon he said had best stop fretting about others he hador would have plenty to worry about on his own account its just a matter of time until the beacon city job is pinned on me when it is the man responsible for my pardon you in other words will have some very tough questions to answer and theres just one answer for them that im a murderer and a thief beynon looked at him strangely a dully wondering look so you did anticipate it you knew exactly what it would cost me my career disgrace disbarment maybe a long stretch in prison myself you knew all that and yet yet now youre exaggerating the situation doc cut in smoothly youll have an uncomfortable time of it but it wont be nearly as bad as that youve got a lot of friends a simonpure reputation its an accepted fact that youve never taken a dishonest dime in your life under the never a dime mccoy beynon laughed thickly you wouldnt say id taken about thirty of them i was saying doc said that under the circumstances you should come through this fine about the worst you can be charged with is gross bad judgment he paused frowning slightly as beynon laughed again faintly almost lost in the night breeze he heard a metallic squeak the opening or perhaps the closing of the cars trunk bad judgment he repeated his eyes holding the parole chiefs now thats not so terrible is it it shouldnt be so hard to face considering that instead of fifteen thousand more youregetting well twentyseven and a half twentyseven and a half eh beynon nodded gravely twentyseven thousand five hundred just for facing that and how much do you think i should have mccoy for facing myself nothing doc said not a damn penny he was tired weary of coddling beynon he saw no reason to the man wasnt going to do anything rash he wasnt going to do anything period he simply wanted to whine make a big display of the conscience which had been conveniently asleep at the time he had sold out his office youre a crook doc went on a particularly rotten kind now stop fighting the factjust accept it and make the most of it believe me you wont find it so bad i see a skulls grin wreathed beynons haggard face you see us as two of a kind is that it no doc said equably youre much worse than i am you knew the kind of man i was and ive never pretended to be any other kind you knew if youre not a complete idiot that i play rough when i think its necessary you didnt have to give me a pardon no one twisted your arm you did it for money and damned little of it at that the kind of money that yes beynons grin had widened he said softly now arent you mistaken about that mccoy wasnt there another factor involved and did i have a choice i dont know what it would be no beynon nodded slowly no you really dont do you i was certain that you did that it was a putup job i was convinced of it despite some very wishful thinking to the contrary but now a small drink mr mccoy or no i think the circumstances call for a large one with grave courtesy he slopped whiskey into docs glass then he filled his own pursing his lips sympathetically as doc brushed the drink aside i dont blame you a bit sir oh believe me i understand your feelings you might say they were identical with my own at one time im in a hurry doc snapped what are you talking about you still dont see it well perhaps it will help if i mention the word blackmail blackmail what a highly original kind mr mccoy almost an attractive kind to elaborate one is forced to go along with the wishes of the blackmailer whether or no but the mailed fist or should i say the muddy fist also contains a prize something delectable indeed one is even allowed to sample it generously by way of making sure that it is worth the cooperation which one is forced to extend he let his voice trail away he waited deliberately prolonging the delicate torture deepening the sickish hearttightening suspense then although nothing more needed to be said he resumed talking he spelled the thing out speaking with a false sympathy that was worse than any hatred speaking with lewdly gleaming eyes his wide mouth salaciously wet hes drunk doc thought hes lying hes sore so hes striking back digging at the one spot where it will hurt in the whispering twilight there was a minutely exploratory movement of the screen door his attention riveted on beynon doc didnt hear it take it a little at a time beynon was saying approach the matter from all sides one he held up a finger waggled it in pseudocourtroom fashion one we have an extremely attractive woman one who has thoroughly demonstrated her desirability two he put up a second finger we have the womans husband probably the most skillful bank robber in the country who is serving a long prison sentence three another finger we have a powerful politician a man who is in a position to free the robber husband why should he be freed well naturally to rob a bank thus leaving the woman and the politicion comfortably fixed for life the ill winds peculiar to public office notwithstanding secondly would you care to guess at a second but by no means the lesser motive mr mccoy no very well then his voice purred on pushing and twisting the knife moving doc mccoy off balance hacking away at the one thing he had trusted and believed in consider mr mccoy our robber is notoriously ingenious and deadly he is also devoted to his wife if he lost her to another man he would quite likely kill both of them at the soonest opportunity at the end of his prison sentence that is this didnt appeal to them at all of course yet unless they gave each other up and resigned themselves to a life of modest or no comforts there was only one alternative to free the bank robber let him make them wealthy and then having lured him to an isolated spot such as this beynon leaned forward his voice dropping to a harsh conspiratorial whisper then mr mccoy when he is off guard when he is no longer sure of where he stands whether he is captured or captor when being sure he still would not dare to move then mr mccoy kill him doc heard the screen at last heard it close firmly with no attempt at silence out of the corner of his eye he saw carol move out of the shadows and he saw the gun held very steady in her hand was it pointed at him if he moved would it be pointed at him blasting him into oblivion before his move could be completed it would he was sure carol was practical she could be as merciless as he undoubtedly she had heard much if not all that beynon had said if she thought that he doc believed the man and was he so hard to believe mustnt there be a great deal of truth in what he said if she thought that he believed beynon and was about to act accordingly he didnt know what to do with extreme cleverness or with drunken consciencestricken truthfulness beynon had so fixed things that any move or no move could be fatal this this is stupid he said his voice amused but deeply sincere making the words at once a statement and a plea did you really think id fall for a sucker pitch like that a trick question beynon pointed out promptly you dont know whether it is or isnt a sucker pitch to be fair neither do i obviously i believed little carol our carol shall i say at one time but with three men killed in spite of her promise that there would be none well was just that one promise of hers a lie or were all of them another thing thats enough doc broke in it was a good try beynon but another thing beynon raised his voice she may have been entirely sincere and truthful with me it may be that she just didnt know there would be three murders in addition of course to your own but seeing my dismay at the killings and fearful that i might be a frail reed to tie to it was wicked cruel and still he wasnt through beaming falsely he drove home the final nail in docs cross of doubt carol sweetheart beynon pushed back his chair and stood up extended one arm in an embracing gesture i hope you wont think ill of her mr mccoy after all you were locked up for a long time your first separation since your marriage wasnt it and shes a healthy vigorous young woman with perhaps more than her share of carol let out a low moan she came at him with a rush and jammed the gun into his stomach and the room rocked with its stuttering explosions beynon shrieked wildly it sounded strangely like laughter he doubled at the waist in the attitude of a man slapping his knees then collapsed dead riddled with bullets before his body completed its somersault the gun dropped from carols fingers she stood very straight eyes squeezed shut and wept helplessly hehe was lying doc the mean hhateful dirty i wish i could kill him again there there now dont let it throw you doc held her in his arms caressed her with hands that were still damp with sweat ill get you a drink of the booze here and he was lying doc yyou believe me dont you there wasnt anything at all like like he said of course there wasnt doc said warmly i never thought for a moment that there was i i was just friendly ijust pretended to be i couldnt help it i had to be nice make him want to know me or he wouldnt have it was a moment before doc realized that she was talking about only the one facet of beynon s story her supposed or actual infidelity that was all that bothered her all that she was denying which must mean there was nothing else to deny it was a comforting thought and he hugged her to him fiercely with a kind of shamed ardor then he realized that if the undisputed part of the story was false the other must be true and he had to fight to keep from shoving her away tthats why i didnt want to come here doc i i was afraid hed say something rnmake up a lot of lies just to get even with me and doc sat down on a chair and pulled her onto his lap smiling lovingly he got her to take a drink gently dried her tears with his handkerchief now lets look at it this way he said you wanted to get me out the only way you could do it was to compromise him so wait now there had to be something between you after all if you didnt have a club to swing over his head how he broke off the look in her eyes stopped him he forced a laugh which sounded reasonably genuine then stood up lifting her in his arms a very clever man he smiled its hard not to admire him but i think weve let his gag bother us enough so suppose we forget it carol brightened a little then you do believe me doc believe you doc said warmly now why wouldnt i believe you my dear he carried her upstairs and laid her down on a bed she clung to his hand when he started to straighten made him sit down at her side while she told him how she had compromised beynon it sounded reasonable doc seemed satisfied urging carol to try to rest he went back downstairs and lugged beynons body down into the basement it was the work of a few minutes to bury the corpse in the coal bin afterward he stood at the corner sink scrubbing his hands and arms with gritty mechanics soap drying them on a handful of waste cloth then lost in thought he remained where he was a brooding shadow in the near blackness of the basement carol why couldnt he accept her explanation beynon was a hard drinker at times carol had had to call at his apartment to talk to him so playing upon his weakness she had got him so drunk that he passed out and he was still dead to the world early the next morning when she slipped out of the place that was all she had had to do except of course to make sure that she was seen coming and going by the elevator operator and desk clerk that was all more than enough for a man of beynons prominence the head of the states pardon and parole board to have the wife of a notorious criminal in his apartment for an allnight stay nothing else was necessary so doubtless nothing else had taken place as for the bribe money well as long as beynon was stuck there was no point in refusing a bit of salve it all fitted doc thought yet piece by piece item by item he could knock it apart his mind moved around and around in a circle disbelieving each time it was on the point of believing he was ready to admit that his shaky faith was a personal thing as a professional criminal he had schooled himself against placing complete trust in anyone and as a criminal he had learned to link infidelity with treachery it revealed either a dangerous flaw in character or an equally dangerous shift in loyalties in any case the woman was a bad risk in a game where no risk could be tolerated so abruptly doc broke the agonizing circle of his thoughts he stood off from himself standing this fretful teetering creature that he was now alongside the suave sure and unshakable doc mccoy and the comparison made him squirm now no more of this he lectured himself he smiled softly no more either now or later carol had mopped up the kitchen now she was at the oil stove measuring coffee into an enamel pot doc walked over to her and put his arms around her she turned hesitantly a little fearfully and looked up into his face doc kissed her enthusiastically he said mockseriously madam were you aware that you had a damn fool for a husband oh doc doc honey she clung to him burying her face against his chest its my fault i wanted to tell you the truth right back in the beginning but but you were afraid id react exactly the way i did doc said that coffee smells good how about some sandwiches to go with it all right but shouldnt we be beating it out of here doc well doc grinned wryly of course i wouldnt recommend an indefinite stay but theres no great rush that i can see he sauntered over to the refrigerator peered inside and lifted out a butt of baked ham beynon wouldnt have known exactly when wed show up therefore hed have made sure that no one else dropped in on him tonight i guess i shouldnt have killed him should i doc its going to make things tough for us doc laid plates and silver on the table he set out butter and bread he said that beynons death was regrettable but unavoidable when an accessory to a crime collapsed so completely there was nothing to do but kill him i dont know just how tough itll make things for us maybe not at all but it certainly forces us to change our plans carol nodded and lifted the coffee from the stove want to put the cream on for me honey she said then just how will it change them well heres the way i add it up doc sat down at the table and carved meat onto their plates our car must have been spotted on the way up here at least we have to assume that it was still playing it safe we cant rule out the possibility that someone got a look at us maybe some kid stalking a rabbit near the road or a nosy housewife with time on her hands and a pair of binoculars it could happen carol agreed we change out of these duds then leave our car here and take beynons right we try to make it appear that the three of us have gone off somewhere together and that well be coming back but doc took a sip of his coffee heres where the rub comes in we dont know what beynons plans were his appointments for all we know he may have been due to see or call someone tomorrow morning or someone may have been scheduled to see or call him here then theres the livestock thats the real tipoff when beynon shows up missing without having notified his parttime hired hand doc shook his head well have to get off the road we cant risk it a moment longer than we absolutely have to no we cant can we carol frowned we hole up with someone then what gave you that idea who would we hole up with well ijust thought that if werent you supposed to have a good friend out this way somewhere near mexico i mean you know that old woman ma santis doc said regretfully that he didnt have ma santis was on the other side of mexico the southern california side at least it had been rumored that she was there although no one seemed to know where i dont know that shes even alive but its my guess that she probably isnt when you get as well known as ma santis and her boys people have you cropping up around the country for years after youre dead well if theres no place for us to hole up i think wed better be moving doc pushed back his plate and stood up we can talk about it while were getting ready they cleared up the dishes and put them away they changed into conservative clothes as for talk a discussion of their plans there was very little the decision was made for them one saw it as readily as the other they had to travel far faster than they had planned and it was unsafe to use the highways so there was only one thing they could do aside from putting the kitchen to rights and smoothing out the upstairs bed they did nothing to expunge the signs of their brief presence in the house doc did suggest that they wipe everything off to remove their fingerprints but that was a joke and carol grinned dutifully criminals are not nearly so cautious about fingerprints as is popularly supposed not at least the bigtime operators who treat crime as a highly skilled profession they know that an expert fingerprint man might work all day in his own home without picking up an identifiable set of his own prints they also know that fingerprints are normally only corroborative evidence that they will probably be tabbed for a certain crime and the alarm set to ringing for themlong before they are tied to the job by fingerprints if they ever are doc filled beynons car with gasoline from a drum in the garage also filling two fivegallon cans which he put in the rear of the car he drove the car out into the yard and carol drove the convertible inside and then they were on their way a couple of hours driving got them off of the country roads and back onto the highway they paused there briefly to consult their road maps picking out the most practical route to kansas city the town was far to the north farther rather than nearer their ultimate destination but that of course was its advantage it was the last place they would be expected to go as a jumpingoff place it offered no clue as to what their destination might be their plan was to abandon the car at kansas city and take a train westward it was not they knew an ideal one you are confined on a train you are part of a relatively small group and thus more easily singled out still there was only one alternative to go by plane and a train was by far the best bet the night was chill and speeding north it grew colder in the heaterless car carol shivered and snuggled close to her husband he patted her protectively remarked that it was a shame they had had to give up the convertible it was a nice car i imagine you put a lot of thought into picking it out didnt you oh well carols small shoulder shrugged against his it was nice of you to say that doc she added even to think about me being disappointed or uncomfortable at a time like this doc said it was nothing at all it came perfectly natural to anyone as generally splendid as he carol reproved him with a delicate pinch they rode cozily shoulder to shoulder and somehow despite the dropping temperature the car seemed to grow warmer carol was comfortably pert doc was doc tender amusing restful exuding the contagious good humor of complete selfconfidence so it had been on nights past the good nights before docs prison stretch just what broke the spell carol could not have said but gradually she found herself withdrawing moving over to her own side of the seat gradually she began to study docs words the tone of his voice the play of expression over his homelyhandsome face doc may or may not have noticed the change may or may not have without knowing which was the case characteristically and up to a point he did not always allow himself to know what he thought or what he felt he had come to a decision decided on a certain course of conduct if an obstacle could not be circumvented ignore it as long as it could be or until a better course suggested itself a couple of hours before dawn he refueled the car from the two gas cans driving on again he at last asked carol if something was troubling her if ive done or said anything you havent she said suppose that thats well never mind dont pay any attention to me doc now of course ill pay attention to you doc said genially now and at all other times so lets get this thing straightened out whatever it is well its really nothing but she hesitated laughed with nervous apology i guess it just occurred to me that if you if you felt a certain way i probably wouldnt know it yes his voice tilted upward im not sure i understand im talking about beynon beynon he gave her a curious look but whats there to say about him you explained everything i believed you its all settled silence closed over the car again they raced through the headlighttunneled night and the black walls slapped shut behind them time and space were the immediate moment behind and beyond it there was only the darkness doc shifted in the seat and got cigarettes out of his pocket he lighted two of them and passed one to her and after a time after it was finished she drew close to him again he drew her a trifle closer he pulled the tail of his topcoat from beneath him and tucked it over her knees better he asked softly better she nodded because it was it was warmer friend or foe there was at least someone with her and anything was better than the utter loneliness i understood what you were talking about he went on quietly i simply didnt know how to reply to it or what to do about it i know doc it leaves me without a corner to go to if im agreeable its pretense if im not that also is cause for alarm you see my dear you just cant think that way its foolish and its dangerous and you do see that dont you i see it she nodded and then desperately with what was almost a cry then it is all right doc honestly youre not sore or suspicious about anything everythings just like it always was i said so ive done everything i could to show you but you might do that anyway you might act just as sweet as pie and all the time youd be planning tto to carol said doc soothingly my poor darling little girl and she sobbed harshly sighed and fell asleep against his shoulder it was early afternoon when doc let carol out at kansas citys union railroad terminal being much the cooler of the two of them much less likely to be identified she kept the money satchel with her while doc drove away to dispose of the car she entered the station and headed for the coach ticket windows at one of them she bought a oneway ticket to los angeles at another far removed she bought a second one then hesitantly with a look at the lobby clock she again picked up the money bag and her overnight case it was almost an hour until train time doc had previously checked the schedule by telephone he wouldnt be showing up until the next to last minute so she had almost an hour to kill and to remain in sole custody of approximately two hundred and fifty thousand very hot very bloody dollars she had never faced such nervewracking responsibility before it had had to be hers but still with part of her mind she was resentful that it had been thrust upon her she looked around the vaulted lobby then lurching a little from the weight of the bag she started for the womens rest room after a dozen steps or so she set the bag down started to shift it to her other hand and in a blur of movement in her fear and nervousness it seemed a blur she saw it snatched up from the floor it was a redcap one of several who had so far proffered their services but at the moment he had no identity for carol he was just a hand an arm a halfturned back a something that was about to make off with the bag taking in her expression he said hope i didnt startle you maam just thought id you give that here with a wild grab she recovered the satchel you hear me you give kind of looks like you already got it maam he grinned at her pleasantly aint that so now how about letting me check it for you no she backed away from him i mean i dont want it checked i jjust put it on the train for you then mighty heavy bag for a little lady like you to carry no and youd better get away from me or ill ill well yes maam he said coldly yessiree maam regaining some control of herself she mumbled a grimacing word of apology very conscious that his eyes were following her she hurried down the vaulted lobby her arm ached she was panting sweating from exertion she had a feeling that everyone in the place was watching her wondering about her at long last after hours miles seemingly she got out of the waiting room proper and into a wing of the building she paused there gratefully setting the bag against the wall and resting the toe of one shoe against it her breath came back she patted the sweat from her face became cooler calmer in a halfresentful way she felt ashamed of herself there had been no reason for her panic the bag looked like any other bag if the police had been alerted there wasnt a chance in ten thousand theyd be able to spot her all she had to do was follow docs instructions stay in the crowd keep the bag with her at all times carry it onto the train herself it was simple enough it was what she knew she should do without being told by doc but no buts it was what she had to do checkroom attendants were always losing things handing them out to the wrong people banging bags around until they flew open there were similar risks in dealing with redcaps baggage porters nothing ever happened naturally to a twodollar suitcase with a few bucks worth of clothes in it but let the bag contain something hot money or jewelry or narcotics or part of a dismembered corpse and sure as shootin there was a foulup it happened all the time you needed only to read the newspapers to know that it did doc had been fearful that the bag would be too heavy for her she had lifted it assured him that she could manage it she had also assured him and pretty shortly at that that her nerves were equally up to the job but that had been then and somehow everything had changed since then the sureness which she had felt with him had melted away and suddenly with a spur of panic she knew why not only had she never faced any such responsibililty as this before she had never faced any that remotely approached it nothing of doordie importance nothing without doc to guide her and work with her she had thought that she had doc had tactfully let her think so but invariably they had been a team the one thing she had swung on her own was the beynon deal and that obviously and regardless of the consequences was something that would have been better left unswung actually she hadnt been around very much she was virtually untraveled until she met doc shed never been out of her hometown since then thered been considerable travel by car but shed made only one train trip in her life she wasnt used to railroad stations even without the money bag she would have felt some unsureness which id damn well better get over she thought grimly if doc caught me acting like this standing off in a corner by myself he wouldnt like it far too much had already happened that he didnt like resolutely she picked up the bag and started back to the waiting room the resolution lasted for a few steps and then she began to slow to hesitate if only she could get rid of the thing for a few minutes long enough to make sure that she hadnt been spotted to get a drink to clean up a little the drink particularly she needed a good stiff jolt to pull her together again and she heard a dull clang of metal against metal jumped a little her eyes swerving toward it but it was only someone slamming the door of a baggage locker she started to move on toward the waiting room and then her heart did a little skipjump of relief and she swung almost gaily toward the row of lockers on the other side of the wing she would be taking no chance in leaving the bag in a private locker doc couldnt object to it in fact he didnt even need to know about it she could recover the bag before he showed up at the station she crossed the marblepaved foyer set down the satchel and overnight case she got a quarter out of her purse and stooped in front of an empty locker frowning she sought in vain for the coin slot straightening again she had started to read the metal instruction plate when a young man sauntered by a youngoldish man with a small brown mustache and prematurely greying hair he was neatly dressed engaging of manner he would have been handsome except for the slight sharpness of his features kind of a chinese puzzle isnt it he said well heres how you work it before carol could object to the intrusion he had taken the quarter from her hand inserted it in the elusive slot and swung open the door imagine you want to keep the dressing case with you right he smiled well in we go with the big boy then now he slammed and rattled the door well just test this to make sure that its locked maybe youd better test it too carol tested it he handed her a yellowflanged locker key courteously brushed aside her thanks and sauntered off toward the waiting room in the stations barandgrill ladies room carol touched up her makeup and allowed her suit to be brushed off by the attendant then going out to the bar she ordered and drank two double martinis she wanted a third not the drink itself so much as the excuse it would provide for remaining there just to stay there a little longer where it was cool and shadowed and quiet and feel the strength and the confidence spread through her to feel safe but the hands of the cloek pointed forbiddingly it was barely ten minutes until train time draining the last drop from her glass she hurried out of the bar she located her locker inserted the key and turned it or tried to it wouldnt turn it didnt fit her stomach cramped convulsively and the two drinks rose up in her throat swallowing nauseously she removed the key and examined it read the number with bewildered disbelief that couldnt be right she knew that the bag had gone into this locker the one here on the end but according to this key she located the other locker the one numbered to correspond with the key hands shaking she opened it and of course it was empty a voice boomed and echoed over the public address system last call for the california umtumm the california somethingorother departing from gate three in exacklum fiminutts passengers will kinely take their seats on the california five minutes feverishly she returned to the first locker fought again to unlock it again as on the first occasion the effort was futile the drinks struggled upward again the heat after the airconditioned bar beat and pounded through her brain she weaved a little foolishly because there was nothing else to do she started back toward the second locker the one the key fitted and then she stopped dead in her tracks up near the entrance hat pulled low over his eyes doc was watching her watching and then coming toward her a few steps away he faced up to the locker bank fumbling in his pocket as though seeking a coin his terse whisper whipped at her from the corner of his mouth simmer down and talk fast what happened i i dont know doc i put the bag in that locker back there but ive got the key to to another locker one thats empty right what did he look like he what do you will you in the name of all hell hurry someone helped you put the bag in for you then switched keys on you its one of the oldest con gags in the country but well how was i to know she lashed out you leave me to do everything easy babe easy im not blaming you his voice became a purring calm the intense calm above a raging subterranean storm how long since you left the bag when you first came in maybe an hour no not more that thirty minutes but good hed expect you to leave it longer than that if he operates on form hell try to hit several times before he pulls out he stepped back from the locker jerked his head move go ahead of me if you spot him give me the office but doc you shouldnt theres a lot of things that shouldnt have been done his tone was a whip again now move she started off at a fast walk then broke into a faster one as his long stride kept him almost on her heels at what was almost a trot she reached the waiting room swept it with an anxious glance prodded by an urgent cough from doc she made a hasty survey of the adjacent areas then and now she was really trotting she headed for the train gates the jarring of her high heels shot fire up her ankles a button of her blouse became undone and she ran clutching at the gap with one hand frantically she raced down the corridor a notorious criminal on the trail of a quarter of a million stolen and restolen dollars and somewhere within her the child she had been the child that she was in this baffling and fearful moment wept with sullen selfpity it it wasnt fair she was tired and sick and she didnt want to play any more shed never wanted to play in the first place and it was all so useless the man would be gone now no matter what doc said he had the money and hed keep it and they theyd have nothing the whole nation looking for them and no means of escape no money but the relatively little that they were carrying she tripped and almost fell she caught herself halfturned in pain and anger on doc and then she saw him the thief he was at a row of lockers near the train gates no more than twenty feet away from the uniformed station attendant who stood at gate three their gate consulting his watch smiling engagingly he was opening the locker for a welldressed elderly woman placing two expensive cowhide bags inside he slammed the door tested it he handed her a key and picked up the money satchel tipping his hat he turned away and suddenly he saw carol his expression never changed he took a step straight toward her smiling apparently on the point ofcallinga hello and then with a movement that was at once abrupt and casual he disappeared behind the lockers doc carol gestured feebly but doc had already spotted the satchel identified the thief for what he was he strode past her and after a moments indecision she followed him by the time she had gotten behind the lockers neither doc nor the thief was in sight they had disappeared as quickly and completely as though the floor had opened and swallowed them up she turned started to retrace her steps and if she had she would have seen the thief hasten through the train gate with doc following in brisk pursuit instead however she continued along the row of lockers turned into the aisle formed by another row and thence on to the end of that before coming out into the open again by which time of course doc and the thief were long since gone from view she stood there in the corridor looking this way and that seeming to shrink to grow smaller and smaller in its lofty vastness she had never felt so bewilderedso lost so alone doc where had he gone how could she find him what would happen if she couldnt reason told her that he must have followed the thief onto the train but and here reason questioned its own statement would a smart thief choose the train as an escape route and would doc have followed without a word or sign to her hed have been in a hurry of course he would doubtless assume that she was heeling him even as he was heeling the thief but suppose she was wrong suppose the pursuit had led back up into the station she wouldnt know that he wasnt on the train until she had looked and by that time she shivered at the thought herself on the train and doc here the two of them separated in a hostile and watchful world he wouldnt dare to make inquiries to look for her even to wait around the station for her return for that matter he could not be sure that she hadnt taken a powder on him after last night that drunken hateful talk of beynons maybe doc had run out on her maybe hed recovered the money and abandoned her he was sore she thought more accurately suspicious she needed him but he did not need her and when doc no longer needed a person the trainman looked at her sharply then with a final glance at his watch he slipped it into his pocket and started through the gate mister carol hurried toward himdid a couple of men go through here just now a rather tall older man and a man with a a couple of men the trainman was irritably amused lady theres probably been a hundred i cant but this was just in the last minute or so the one in front would have had grey hair and a little mustache were they catching the train for california i i dont know i mean i think they were but well if they were they went through here if they werent they didnt he fidgeted impatiently with the gate what about you you taking the train i dont know carol almost wailed i mean im not sure whether i should or not cant you remember no i cant he cut her off shortly kind of seems like they did but i wouldnt say for sure but its so important if youd just lady his voice rose i told you i wasnt sure whether i saw em or not and thats all i can tell you and if youre taking the train youll have to do it right now its already two minutes late pulling out but make up your mind lady whats it going to be carol looked at him helplessly i guess she said i guess i really should shouldnt yes he snapped well scowling he waited a second or two more then as she remained undecided he slammed the gate and went down the ramp the barn was pleasantly cool clean and sweetsmelling with the aroma of fresh straw and new hay in one of the rear stalls a swaybacked horse nickered contentedly from a partitionedoff kennel also in the rear came the happy yappings of a litter of puppies there were two box stalls at the front small floored rooms open at the aisle end rudy torrento was in one propped up on a cot while the veterinarian worked over him opposite him in the other was the doctors wife the docs name was harold clinton so she of course was mrs clinton fran her husband called her when he wasnt addressing her sweetishly as hon or pet or lambie but rudy didnt think of her by any of those handles hed seen this babe before her many counterparts that is he knew her kin distant and near all her mamas sisters aunts cousins and what have you and he knew the name was lowdown with a capital l he wasnt at all surprised to find her in a setup like this not after encountering her as a wardens sisterinlaw the assistant treasurer of a country bank and a supervisor of paroles this babe got around she was the original squarepluginaroundhole kid but she never changed any she had that good old lowdown blood in her and the right guy could bring it out seated on a high stool with her bare milkwhite legs crossed and her chin cupped demurely in the palm of her hand she watched moistlipped as her husband completed his work she wore an expensivelooking plaid skirt somewhat in need of cleaning and pressing and a tight white sweater of what appeared to be cashmere her shoes were scuffed their spike heels slightly run over but her corncolored hair was impeccably coiffured and her nails glistened with bright red polish shed do rudy decided yes sir miss lowdown would do just fine but that red polish would have to go even if her eensieteensie pinkies went right along with it he caught her eye and winked at her she frowned primly then lowered her lashes and smoothed the sweater a degree tighter rudy laughed out loud feeling better eh the doctor straightened beamed down at him professionally thats the glucose nothing like a good intravenous feeding of glucose to pull a man together fast aint it the truth rudy grinned bet you didnt know that did you mrs clinton she murmered inaudibly then tittered that she couldnt even spell glucose rudy told her that her husband was a plenty smart man plenty he repeated ive been tinkered over by high class mds that didnt know half the medicine your old man does well uh thank you clintons thin face flushed with pleasure i only wish that the people around here uh shared your high opinion yeah you mean to say they dont well they dont his wife cut in curtly they think hes a dope clinton blinked at her from behind his glasses he was either unoffended or resigned to such offenses doubtless the last rudy decided now uh fran he said mildly i dont believe id put it quite that way its just that theyre rather set in their ways and uh a young man like me someone probably more interested in the theory of disease than actual practice why so the sun dont rise and set here rudy said if the people arent smart enough to appreciate you why not go someplace where they are where where they are the doctor hesitated im afraid i dont know uh where how rudy let it lay for the moment he asked how his condition appeared to the doctor and clinton replied that it was excellent you have a wonderful constitution mr torrento might even say haha that you had the constitution of a horse haha said fran clinton thats really good harold its a riot rudy said but what about the bandages clint the wound how often should i have it looked after well a couple of times a day perhaps thats barring any unusual developments how you mean unusual well uh fever any signs of gangrene or putrefaction but im sure there wont be any just have it cleaned and rebandaged a couple of times a day for the next couple of days and and his voice died suddenly he went on again his eyes evading rudys on second thought it might be wiser if you didnt have it tended at all might just irritate the wound you know keep it from healing it might rudy nodded i wouldnt know you wouldnt maybe be kidding me would you clint old boy kkidding you why would i because you want to get rid of me pronto and you figure that if i need any taking care of youll be elected to do it rudy pulled the heavy from his belt twirled it by the trigger guard and let the butt smack into his palm grinning savagely he took aim at the doctors stomach now maybe youd better have a good third thought he said just think real careful and give me the truth will i need more lookin after or wont i yyoull yyy it was as far as the doctor could get ill need it huh rudy flipped the gun again and shoved it back into his belt well thats all i wanted to know just shoot square with me and you got no more trouble than a flea in a dog pound now he added casually i guess you want me to clear out of here clinton nodded weakly apologetic as he sagged down onto a canvas camp stool oh well you did promise mr torrento you said that and ill keep my promise rudy lied if thats the way you want it ill leave and youll call the cops and nno no we wont mr torrento i and then maybe tonight maybe five years from now youd have a visitor itd probably be me because i got quite a rep for breaking out of tight spots but if i didnt make it some pal of mine would anyway youd have a visitor like the guy that fingered willie sutton had one and you know what hed do to you clint to you and the little lady here before he did you a big favor and killed you he told them threatened them with what would happen lips wolfishly drawn back from his teeth eyes holding them with an unwinking reptilian gaze he finished the discourse and the sudden silence was like a scream a drop of sweat rolled shinily down the veterinarians nose his wife gulped and clapped a hand to her mouth spoke through the lattice of her fingers we he wont call any cops she said whitely he even looks like hes going to and ill murder him myself well now maybe hed feel that he had to rudy said im hot as a threedollar pistol i need medical attention say ive got a three to one chance of getting away and youre giving me the best of it wouldnt you figure it that way clint clinton cleared his throat he opened his mouth to speak then closed it again rudy beamed at him falsely kind of one of those hellif youdoordont propositions aint it clint you holler copper and you and frannie get your clocks fixed you dont do it and youre still in the soup they got enough on me to fry me six times thatd bring you and fran in on accessory raps for forty or fifty years aaccessories the doctor stammered but how would they know that id tell them rudy said cheerfully id name you as accessories bbut but why after wed helped because id figure you were boobs rudy said and boobs i got a very low boiling point for clinton shook his head in bewilderment helplessly hopefully he looked at his wife there was some indefinable change in her expression something that carried a chill shock and yet seemed entirely natural to her he had a feeling that he had never seen her before that she was at once a stranger to him and an old friend of torrentos what she said is the proposition rudy what do you think that you and clinty boy go along with me and i fork up for a new car i pay all expenses and me i wouldnt kick on a little expense like a mink jacket you get anything you want as soon as were where were safe to buy it you cross the country firstclass and when we hit california therell be a tengrand bonus her eyes gleamed softly that sounds good she murmured that sounds real good rudy good hell rudy said its perfect big dough for you a new car and a swell trip and not a chance in the world of getting caught clint bandages me up so that no one can see what i look like i been in a bad accident see then i wont do it clinton had found his voice at last we are not going with you mr torrento you shut up his wife glared at him fiercely i guess ive got something to say about what were going to do now take it easy rudy said whats wrong with the deal clint i thought it added up good for you but maybe i could sweeten it a little whats wrong with it the doctor waved his hands wildly why why everthings wrong im a respected citizen a professional man i cant just throw everything i am overboard and go gallivanting across the country with a uh i couldnt do it for any amount of money why couldnt you rudy asked interestedly well uh because i just got through telling you the respected citizen gimmick but you aint going to be one remember you wont be very long anyway unless you figure on being a dead one with a hide full of broken bones and a pound of raw hamburger for a face hes already dead his wife snapped contemptuously then her manner changing she slid off the stool crossed the aisle and knelt at clintons side now harold hon she coaxed why do you want to act like this dont you love me any more dont you want me to be happy we could have such a wonderful life together hon not having to worry and fret about money all the time and people respecting and looking up to you instead of laughing and joking like but fran the doctor squirmed i you know i love you and want you to be happy but thats been your whole trouble hon money you just didnt have the money to get started off right oh i know how smart and wonderful my lambie is even if i havent acted like it and i could just absolutely cry sometimes when i think how different it could be for him just think of it lambie starting out in a new place with everything we need to make a good impression good clothes and a swell car and a decent place to live and a real office for you hon a nice big office and a fine big laboratory where you could carry on your experiments she held him close and over his shoulder she winked at rudy clinton twitched and sputtered simultaneously attempting it seemed to return her embrace and disengage himself from it his protests grew weaker and fewer finally as a last resort he professed a willingness to take on the enterprise he wanted to do it but the potential danger made it unthinkable we might have an accident and theyd find out who mr torrento was or the police might just stop us on suspicion you know one of those routine investigations a lot of criminals get caught that way and a lot of people get nibbled to death by wild ducks rudy yawned but ill tell you what ill do clint we get a bad break like you mention and you and fran can be hostages ill back you up on it youre helping me because idve killed you if you hadnt clinton sighed and gave up all his life he had given up he didnt know why it was like that why a man who wanted nothing but to live honestly and industriously and usefully who briefly asked only the privileges of giving and helping had had to compromise and surrender at every turn but that was the way it had been and that apparently was the way it was to be i suppose it doesnt seem to you that im giving up much mr torrento he said dully but to me he paused his eyes straying to the swaybacked mare and his voicegathered new strength theyre awfully smart mr torrento you wouldnt believe how smart and uh nice they can be why you take something like a pig or even a garter snake and pet it and feed it and fix up whatevers wrong with it just treat it like youd want to be treated if you were what it is oh put it in a book his wife jumped to her feet weve got things to do rudys car was driven into a weedchoked and rocky pasture buried beneath a stack of moldering hay the doctors business and professional affairs were wound up by two brief telephone calls ending his lease and turning over his practice to another veterinarian neither the landlord nor the other vet was surprised by this action or its nominal abruptness clinton had been barely eking out an existence the rundown acres and tumbledown house rented furnished had discouraged far more resourceful and tenacious tenants than he after taking rudys temperature again and urging him to rest clinton drove away in his ancient jalopy he had more than three thousand dollars of rudys money in his wallet his destination was a nearby city where the cash purchase of a car would arouse no suspicion fran clinton waved him a loving goodbye from the doorway of the barn then sauntered back hips swinging and resumed her stool opposite rudy well she smirked howd you like the way i handled stupid the doc you mean rudy crooked a finger at her come here what for rudy stared at her steadily not answering the knowing smile on her face wavered a little but she slid off the stool and came across the aisle she started to step up into the stall where rudy lay without the slightest change of expression he kicked her in the stomach watched unwinking as she landed floundering and groaning in the straw of the aisle she staggered to her feet gasping eyes tearwashed with anger and pain she asked furiously just what was the big idea anyway just who the hell did he think he was anyway then weakly as he continued to stare at her in silence she began to weep i ddidnt do anything i i tried to be nnice and do what you wanted me to do and yyou she was overwhelmed with selfpity blindly as though drawn by a magnet she came close to rudy again and he hooked her stumbling into the stall with his foot brought her down on her knees with a yank of a viselike hand the hand went to the back of her head her mouth crushed cruelly against his she gasped and struggled for a moment then with a greedy moan she surrendered squirming and pressing her softness against him abruptly rudy pushed her away you get the idea he said when i tell you to do something you do it fast think you can remember that oh yes she saideyes glowing softly anything you say rudy you just tell me and and whatever it is ill he told her what she was to do then as she looked at him face falling he pointed up the command with a twist of her arm now hop to it he said get that red paint off your claws its making me sick doc followed the thief through the gate to the train then down the winding ramp to the loading platform the man was nowhere in sight when he emerged from the tunnel but doc had not expected him to be stepping behind a nearby pillar he waited watchfully and after a minute or two the thief edged out from behind another pillar and started back up the platform doc confronted him abruptly all right mister he said ill just his hand grasped for the bag almost gripped the handle the thief twisted it yanked and trotted back down the platform doc strode after him he had made a mistake he knew back there in the station he should have shouted at the thief shouted that he was a thief in which case the man would certainly have dropped the bag and fled but he had been afraid to call out had even believed that it wouldnt be necessary caught redhanded the thief would or should hightail it unfortunately the man was as unobliging as he was discerning he had stolen this tall gents bag or his wifes bag the wife had been nervous as all hell about it and now this guy her husband was making no outcry at all that must be because he couldnt so the thief made off taking the bag with him more than a little hopeful that doc would not risk pursuing him as much exultant as dismayed when he saw doc was right after him this must be something big that he had latched onto and with doc unable to squawk he stood a good chance of getting away with it or at least part of it he could demand a split of whatever the bag contained the thief was very cocksure it should be said in his particular branch of crime he had to be also and it is hardly necessary to point this out he had known no criminals of doc mccoys caliber only two doors of the train were open one in the pullman section the other to admit coach passengers the thief approached the latter squeezing himself in line behind an elderly couple the conductor stopped them as they started to climb aboard tickets tickets please he intoned impatiently see your ticket lady mister it developed that the tickets were at the bottom of the ladys handbag while she fumbled for them anxiously the thief eased around her and got a foot on the steps ticket ticket mister the conductor called to him but the thief was already in the car the conductor glowered the elderly woman produced one of the two necessary tickets then pawing for the other she spilled a handful of small change onto the platform immediately she and her husband stooped to gather it up the conductor implored them to please step aside folks tickets tickets kindly show your tickets but he himself was pushed aside as the other passengers pressed forward began to clamber aboard by twos and threes and what with one thing and another he not only was unable to check their tickets but he ceased to give a damn whether he did with a heavenward gesture he stalked away to converse with a sympathetically grinning brakeman meanwhile doc was on the train trailing the thief by less than a car length the man had turned right heading toward the front of the train he moved with relatively little haste as long as he was within docs view but losing him momentarily in passing from one car to another he began to run his intent or rather hope was to get off the train and leave doc on it but that would take time as his hurried attempt to open a connecting door proved he would need at least a couple of minutes to jump off and lose himself and so he ran the passengers became fewer and fewer as he neared the front of the train he raced through one in which there were none at all and then coming to the door at its end he stopped short the car ahead was a dingy strawseated smoker it was wholly empty like the one he was in and it adjoined the first of the express cars in other words he could go no farther and he still lacked the time or was afraid that he did to make his escape his thiefs mind weighed the situation made an almost instantaneous decision darting through the drapes of the mens rest room he yanked down the window shade tossed the bag onto the leather couch and pressed the catches which held it shut he was going to get something out of this frammis make sure at least that there was something to get after all the world was full of screwballs and it just might be that there was nothing in this keister but old matchbook covers or he gasped when he saw what was in it automatically he grabbed a thick packet of bills and shoved them into his inside coat pocket then hearing an approaching telltale sound he slammed the bag shut pushed it under the couch and flattened himself against the wall by the doorway the train jerked and began to move docs swift footsteps came closer then the drapes rustled and in the mirror above the lavatory the thief saw his pursuer glance inside there was a muttered curse of disappointment then the drapes fell back into place and the car door wheezed open and shut the thief stayed where he was motionless hardly breathing some thirty seconds passed the train slowly gathered speed it still wasnt going too fast for a man to jump off but there was a muted clang the grating and scraping of metal against metal then silence save for the clicking of the wheels exultantly the thief let out his breath he pulled the bag from beneath the couch and stepped out into the vestibule the metal platform above the steps was swinging free and the lower half of the exit door was partly open the thief laughed out loud what a break boy what a break him speeding toward california with a satchelful of dough and the guy back there at the station looking for him and he couldnt raise a beef about his loss grinning he reclosed and locked the exit door he entered the next car the smoker threw two seats together and tossed the bag onto the overhead rack he sat down placed his feet comfortably on the seat ahead of him and doc moved away from the rear wall of the car and sat down at his side the thief gaped his stiff lips framed a silent question doc jerked his head over his shoulder back there he said in the same place you were approximately when you hid in the rest room ill tell you something he added whenever you can see someone in a mirror you can also be seen bbut the thief shook his head helplessly but i wanted to get you out of the rest room and it wouldnt have looked well to carry you just in case someone was looking and of course youd head this way instead of going back the way you came he smiled unpleasantly prodding the thiefs ribs with his gun thats the mark of a punk you know he loves a cinch id jumped the train supposedly and it was traveling fast but you were still too gutless togo back into the cars you were afraid i might spot you from the platform and hop back on he was very annoyed with the thief the man had given him an extremely bad time and he was apt to receive an even worse one from carol as an aftermath he had seen her just before he sat down motioned to her as she hesitantly entered the car behind and while he couldnt tell much about her expression at that distance he could see that she was angry he had known that she must be before she showed up as soon as having cornered the thief he had had time to think of anything else put the rod away mister the thief was smiling getting back his nerve you arent going to use it thats another mark of a punk doc told him he doesnt know when to be frightened you cant use it you cant make any kind of rumble if you could youdve already done it he winked at doc companionably were two of a kind mister you now that doc said is carrying things too far and he whipped the gun barrel upward it smashed against the point of the thiefs chin his eyes glazed and his body went into a sacklike sag methodically doc locked an arm around his head braced the other across his back and jerked it was over in a split second if a man can die instantly the thief did doc tilted the seat back a little adjusted the mans body to a slightly reclining position he placed his feet on the seat ahead and pulled his hat over his eyes doc studied the corpse critically he gave it a few minor touches closing the staring eyes putting one of the limp hands into a coat pocket and was satisfied to all appearances the man was asleep even carol thought he was or would have if she had not known otherwise she sat down facing doc her anger somewhat weakened by the relief of being reunited with him he hadnt had it very easy either she guessed and the terrifying mixup at the station was probably more her own fault than his still she couldnt quite locate the cause of her anger explain in absolute terms why she had viewed him and almost everything he had done with distrust and distaste practically from the moment of their postrobbery meeting it wasnt so much what hed done she supposed as what he had not not so much what he was as what he was not and in her mind she wailed bridelike for what she had lost or thought she had for something that had never existed outside of her mind he doesnt treat me like he used to she thought hes not the same man any more carol doc spoke to her a second time i said i was sorry dear she looked at him coldly shrugged all right whats the pitch now that depends has the conductor collected your ticket no well thats good but he did see you when you got on carol shook her head the train was already moving if the porter hadnt hopped off and helped me well never mind the less said about that the better perhaps for the moment at least doc looked back through the door saw the conductor trudging up the aisle of the next car now give me one of the tickets for my friend here and just follow my lead the conductor was grumbling complaining almost before he reached them what was the sense of their coming way up here it was uncomfortable for them and it made things hard on him doc murmured apologies their friend had wanted to visit the diner having come this far in the wrong direction he had decided to remain my wife and i are getting off at the first stop he added proffering a bill along with the ticket we hadnt planned to youre getting off the conductor exploded this isnt some commuters local mister you shouldnt have got on without a ticket shouldntve stayed on anyway and we hadnt planned to but this gentleman wasnt feeling well and then he shouldnt have got on either or he ought tove bought himself some pullman space he jabbed a train check into the window clip yanked a coupon from the ticket book and tossed it down onto the seat you dont have enough money there mister he snapped at doc the first scheduled stop for this train is ten oclock tonight carols mouth tightened nervously ten oclock more than nine hours from now they could never maintain the masquerade of the sleeping man that long the conductor was already studying him narroweyed turning a suspicious gaze toward doc whats the matter with him anyway he said he acts like he was drunk or doped or something here you he started to grab the corpse by the shoulder what doc caught his hand grimly rose up from the seat ill tell you whats the matter with him he said he got a bad jostling when he boarded the train started up an old neck injury you didnt notice because you were off chatting with a friend instead of minding your job but ive got several witnesses to the fact that it happened and if youre looking for trouble ill be glad to supply it the conductors mouth opened and reopened he swallowed heavily doc softened his tone warmed him with a look of mantoman sympathy now i know a man cant be everyplace at once he said i dont always follow rules right to the letter and i dont expect anyone else to and as long as my friend isnt seriously injured were both inclined to forget the matter on the other hand he let the words hang in the air the conductor glanced at his watch took out a receipt book suppose we pull a stop for you in about an hour i could do it sooner i guess but we might get a flag there anyway and an hour that will be fine doc said and uh everythingll be okay with your friend i mean you dont think hell uh file a complaint dont give it a thought doc said heartily ill guarantee that he wont he sat down again as the conductor left and tucked the railroad ticket into the breast pocket of the dead mans coat carol watched him a little mistyeyed feeling a sudden resurgence of the slavish devotion and adoration which had been about to be lost to the past everything had been such a mess everything had seemed so different she doc everything but now the mess was gone the mistakes and misunderstandings brushed away or aside and doc was exactly the same doc she had dreamed of and longed for these last four years relief engulfed her relief and gratitude at being snatched back from a laststraw nottobeborne peril she had been sinking coming apart inside and doc had saved her and made her whole again impulsively she reached out and squeezed his hand doc she said do me a favor practically anything doc slid instantly into her mood if i ever get nasty again give me a good hard kick in the pants doc said he would have to investigate the possibility of breakage first he had a very delicate foot then he laughed and she laughed and quivering with the movement of the train the dead man seemed to laugh too when they got off the train doc waved a smiling goodbye toward the window then advised the conductor that his friend was doing nicely i gave him some aspirin and hes going back to sleep for a while thats all he needs just rest and quiet the conductor said there was no reason at all why the gentleman shouldnt get it he can sleep till doomsday as far as im concerned doc thanked him for his courtesy and gave him a warm handshake as the train pulled out the conductor examined the bill he had received during the handshaking process and glowing pleasantly telling himself you could always spot a gentleman he started back down the line of cars his happy musings were interrupted with nerveshattering suddenness by a screamed demand to stick em up the owner of the voice had been crouching between two seats he was about seven dressed in cowboy regalia and equipped anachronistically with a toy machine gun what are you doing here the conductor gasped his hair slowly settling back to his scalp ive told you about fifteen times already to stay with your moth bang bang bang the boy screamed youre an old stinky booger man an im gonna shoot you dead he dropped into a crouch triggered the gun it chattered and barked realistically even more realistic was the water which jetted from its muzzle and sprayed the conductors starched white shirtfront the conductor grabbed at him the boy fledscreaming with laughter shrieking insults and threats spreading consternation through the next six cars until he reached the sanctuary of his mother she responded to his pursuers complaints with a kind of arch crossness oh my goodness such a fuss over one little boy do you expect him to just sit still with his hands folded she glanced around smiling at the other passengers soliciting approval none was forthcoming the conductor said that he expected her to keep an eye on her son to see that he cease his rambunctious ramblings forthwith i mean that lady im insisting on it i dont want to find that young man outside of this car again but i just dont understand the woman frowned prettily what possible difference does it make if the poor child moves around a little hes not hurting anything but he might get hurt in fact the conductor added grimly hes very likely to and youd be the first to complain if he did he trudged away reflecting that it was such brats and such mothers who provided unanswerable argument for the proponents of capital punishment bang bang bang he brooded bitterly ol stinky booger man id like to boogerman him if he could have looked ahead a few hours but he could not fortunately it would have been much to bear in his mood to see the boy acclaimed however briefly as brave bold brilliant and in sum a national hero which is just what happened doc mccoy had a fairly good map of the united states in his mind surprisingly detailed and as uptodate as he could keep it so leaving the train he inquired about a remembered landmark although it was ten years since he had been in the area and learning that it was still in existence he and carol taxied out to the place it was some five miles out on the highway a familystyle roadhouse set down amidst several acres of picnic grounds they had lunch inside the establishment then taking several bottles of beer with them they located a secluded picnic table and settled down for the brief wait until nightfall they could not get a car before then at any rate it would not be wise to attempt it and the way they intended to get it made night travel advisable a hot car was always cooler at night providing of course that its loss was unreported people werent so alert there was a sharp reduction in the risk of raising some yokel who knew the owner and theres no big hurry doc pointed out ive got a hunch that our late traveling companion will go right on sleeping undisturbed until that ten oclock stop even if they found out the nature of his slumber before then it wouldnt matter much the body has to be posted that takes time and it cant be done in just any hick village then theres the conductors story of an old neck injury along with the conductors guilty conscience to add confusion to the proceedings he laughed softly if i know anything about human nature hell swear that our friend was alive and in good health at the time we left him carol nodded laughing with him this was the old doc talking her doc she wanted more of his warming reassurance and doc did his best to supply it of course we will be suspected of bringing about the gentlemans death he went on sometime tomorrow say when the conductor has come clean and its definitely determined that the broken neck was inflicted rather than accidental but who are we anyway what good is our description if they dont have a channel for it now if there was anything to indicate we were bank robbers wed be tabbed in five minutes just as quickly as a batch of wanted cards could be run through the sorter its not going to happen carol said firmly so lets not talk about it right doc said no point to it at all but its still smart to get off the highway one more night is as much as we can risk well that may be putting it a little strong we wont be tagged with beynons car and we helped our chances with that longjump north lets just say that the railroad still seems like our best bet obviously he continued they couldnt go back to the line theyd been on in fact any of the duewest routes were a poor risk unless and the time element precluded this they were able to take one across the northern rim of the united states so id say we do this pull another swingback get completely away from this eastwest travel route we can push hard tonight make tulsa or oklahoma city by morning and take a southern route train we can miss los angeles that way come into california through the carriso gorge and then straight on into san diego we can make it in fortyeight hours if everything goes all right and it will doc carol squeezed his hand i know it of course it will doc said actually he was more than a little uneasy about their situation there was much that he disliked about it but since it could not be changed he put the best possible face on it if he was secretly perhaps subconsciously annoyed at the necessity for doing so much of their predicament was carols fault she should have been absolutely frank with him about beynon failing that having made that one serious error she should have kept the bag with her at the kansas city station that was little enough to expect of her wasnt it it was simple enough but she had had to blunder again again forcing him to plan extemporaneously which was another way of saying dangerously and now instead of being properly apologetic willing to look the facts in the face she had to be cajoled and bolstered up if id known she was going to be like this he thought and left the thought at that he took another drink of the beer smiling at her inwardly grinning the wry pained grin of a man who has bumped his elbow doc she was looking down at the table idly scratching at the chipped paint with a fingernail doc she raised her eyes ive changed a lot havent i you think i have oh well doc began after all its been you seem the same way to me doc almost like a stranger at times i mean well i dont mean it as though i was criticizing or blaming you or anything ive seemed to have done something dopey every time turned around and youve been a damn sight nicer about it than you should have been but now dont feel that way doc laid a hand over hers weve had some bad luck weve never been involved in anything quite like this before i dont think thats the trouble not the real trouble we had our difficulties before and they didnt seem to matter we were so much closer and she hesitated thoughtfully i guess thats it isnt it we kind of are strangers we arent the same people we were four years ago essentially the same doc disagreed lets say that perhaps weve forgotten what those people were like in toto i mean weve forgotten their bad times the occasions when they rubbed each other the wrong way and remembered only the good well maybe yes she added i suppose that is it i know it is just as soon as weve gotten a little reacquainted have time for something besides running doc she looked down at the table again a faint blush spreading over her cheeks i think we should you know get really acquainted again i think weve just about got to very soon ccant we isnt there some way we could manage to be together doc murmured that he was sure they could beneath the table he pressed her ankle with his and the silken flesh quivered in response he began to feel a lot better about her about everything his inherent optimism reasserted itself smothering his worries recreating him in the delightful and irresistible image that had burned so bright in carols memory i know we cant lay over stop anywhere she said but well do you suppose we could travel together on the train take a stateroom or a bedroom and doc said he thought so he was pretty sure of it well count on it anyway ill count on it my dear and carol blushed and squirmed deliciously in the deceptive halflight of dusk doc walked down the highway a couple of hundred yards and took cover behind a hedgerow carol meanwhile took up a position at the edge of the picnic grounds protected by the thickening shadows of the driveway but within a quick step of the road doc heard two cars stop for her then speed on again almost before they had stopped soon there was a third car and the opening and slamming of a door and doc came out of his place of concealment the car stopped for him jerkily carol was holding a gun in the drivers ribs doc climbed into the back seat and putting a gun to the mans head ordered him to relinquish the wheel the man did so fearfully too frightened for speech limbs stiff and numb as he slid over in the seat with carol driving they moved on again naturally the car was from outofstate had it borne local license plates carol would never have gotten into it the owner was a salesman a man of about thirtyfive with a plump wellfed face and a wide goodnatured mouth doc spoke to him soothingly putting him as much at ease as the circumstances would allow were sorry to do this he apologized believe me weve never done anything like it before but we ran out of money and the wife cant take another night on the road so i hope you understand youre a married man yourself i take it the salesman wasnt hed tried the double harness once and it hadnt worked oh thats too bad doc murmured now i wonder if you could drive us down into oklahoma i can get some money there and ssure i could glad to the salesman was pitiful in his eagerness naw i really mean it i was figuring on taking a fling at tulsa myself just for kicks yknow im not due back in chicago for three days yet but i already made all my calls and doc slugged him with the gun barrel the man grunted and slumped forward carol gave him a shove pushed him down on the floor of the car side road doc she spoke over her shoulder back on the train the boy in the cowboy suit napped dined and resumed his wanderings after a longer absence than usual he returned to his mother shouting brassily that he had just killed a robber man i did so too he screamed as she laughed indulgently i told him to stick em up an he didnt so i poked him an he fell over dead an the money he stole fell out of his pocket an i got it i got it right here he pulled a thick sheaf of bills from his blouse waved them about excitedly across the aisle a man reached out and took it from him frowned startled as he read the imprint on the paper banding the bank of beacon city why that was the place that had been robbed yesterday morning he jumped up and went in search of the conductor doc frisked the salesman taking his wallet and all other identification then with the whispering of the cars radio fading behind him he dragged the man down the ditch to the culvert and placed the gun muzzle inside his mouth he triggered the gun twice he shoved it back into his belt began squeezing the now faceless body into the culvert doc carols voice came to him urgently doc be right with you he called back easily just as soon as i the cars starter whirred the motor coughed caught and roared doc hastily clambered up the side of the ditch yanked open the door and climbed in whats the matter he demanded cant i leave you for two minutes without then he broke off listened incredulously to the newscasters staccato voice the man has been positively identified as doc mccoy notorious bank robber and criminal mastermind police are certain that the woman with him is his wife carol their descriptions follow rudy torrento and the clintons started for california the morning after his arrival at their place he was running a slight temperature feeling worse than he had the day before and clinton suggested anxiously that they take it very easy for a day or so but rudy fearful that doc and carol might get away from him wouldnt hear of it they were going to make california in three days see three days and nights of steady driving he himself would take a turn at the wheel if he had to and if he did have to theyd wish that he hadnt then late that evening he heard the news about doc and carol knew immediately that there was no longer any need for hurry for certainly they would not be able to the way things looked to him he could probably rollerskate his way to california and golies tourist court and get there ahead of them so he informed the clintons amiably that he had changed his mind hed decided to take clintyboys advice after all because what the hell was the use of having a doctor if you didnt listen to him anyway theyd take it easy like clint said just take their time and get a little fun out of the trip and theyd start in right now by turning in at a good motel they took connecting cabins but only for the sake of appearances they used only one of them the three of them sleeping crosswise and partly disrobed in one bed with fran clinton in the middle now we wont be getting lost from each other rudy explained grinning clint wont have to worry about me sneakin off to the police and reporting him for practicing medicine without a license mrs clinton smirked lewdly rudy winked at her husband its okay with you aint it clint youve got no objections why no no of course not clinton said hastily its uh very sensible and he winced as his wife laughed openly he did not know how to object in his inherent delicacy and decency he could not admit that there was anything to object to he heard them that night and subsequent nights of their leisurely journey westward but he kept his back turned and his eyes closed feeling no shame or anger but only an increasing sickness of soul just inside the border of california they stopped for a picnic lunch at a roadside tourist park afterward while rudy dozed in the car and fran clinton thumbed through a movie magazine her husband wandered off among the trees he did not return when they found him he was lying face down in a pool of blood one of his small hands still gripping the razor blade with which he had cut his throat rudy dropped down to the ground at his side clutching himself he began to rock back and forth groaning and gasping with what mrs clinton mistook for a paroxysm of laughter she could hardly be blamed for her error she had never seen rudy grief stricken the piehead overwhelmed by sorrow or laughter appeared much the same so she began to laugh with him she thought and rudy came abruptly out of his fit and slugged her in the stomach he beat her black and blue everywhere but in her face except that he needed her he would have beaten her to death then he made her carry the body into the bushes and cover it over with rocks she never again gave him reason to beat her on the contrary no one could have been more worshipful or watchful of his whims yet hardly a day passed after their arrival at golies that he did not pound and pummel her at least once because she annoyed him with her groveling because he was restless because he was very worried about doc come on boy he would mumble fiercely sitting hunched in front of the radio you can do it doc you done it before an you can do it again he seldom mentioned carol in these injunctions seldom thought of her she would be with doc and as long as he was safe so was she rudy couldnt see them as splitting up getting fed up to the point of wanting to split like em or not those two were really nuts about each other and rudy was sure that nothing short of prison or death could break them up just in case though rudy grinned evilly considering the impossible possibility of a falling out between carol and doc it couldnt happen but if it did it wouldnt change a thing carol needed doc shed never been on the run before and shed never make it without him and because she wouldnt doc couldnt split with her or let her split with him shed be too apt to rattle the cup on him buy herself a deal at his expense they were tied together bound together inextricably and rudy roared with crazy laughter when he thought what would happen if either attempted any untying that would be something to see one of them trying to get the jump on the other hell it would be like trying to do something with your right hand without letting the left know about it they were still very hot news rudy himself was mentioned frequently but the focus was mainly on carol and doc theyd been seen in new york florida and new orleans theyd boarded a train for canada a plane for south america a ship for the straits settlements it was mostly nut stuff rudy guessed the kind of hooroosh that always sprang up around a big name or a big kill but not all of it doc had friends everywhere the really slick rumorplanting the stuff that got more than a second look from the cops would be their work done to repay an old favor or simply to give a hand to a brother in need one of their stunts even had rudy going for a while two stiffs were found in a burneddown house in washington dc they were charred beyond recognition but of a size with carol and doc and the womans almost melted ring bore the inscription d to c as a clinching bit of evidence the fireblackened refrigerator was found to contain several packets of small bills all banded with bank of beacon city tape the police were sure they had found the remains of carol and doc so almost was rudy then some eager beaver of a lab hound had managed to raise a latent print on the mans corpse establishing him indisputably as an underworld inandouter who had acquired a bad name for reliability and with this much to go on the police hunted out the printing shop where the bank bands had been obtained aside from admitting that they had been made from his stock and type the owner denied all knowledge of them he was of the opinion however that the bands had been turned out during a burglary of his shop said burglary having been duly reported to the police several days before so the hoax was exposed if not the hoaxers no one seemed interested in learning their identity no one seemed to care who the woman had been rudy wondered about her in his weirdly oblique way and was sullenly envious of doc the inandouter had been a bum a nogood with neither the physical attractiveness nor the cash to attract a lady friend so apparently docs friends had arbitrarily provided him with one just any dame that met certain specifications they werent sore at her as they were with the man it was a hundred to one that they didnt even know her theyd snatched her and bumped her simply to help doc rudy was forced to admit that he had no such good friends even little max vonderscheid would never kill anyone to help him not that he cared if a doublecrosser like doc had friends then he could do without em but just the same come on doc he pleaded come to rudy doc what the hells holding you up anyway flight is many things something clean and swift like a bird skimming across the sky or something filthy and crawling a series of crablike movements through figurative and literal slime a process of creeping ahead jumping sideways running backward it is sleeping in fields and river bottoms it is bellying for miles along an irrigation ditch it is back roads spur railroad lines the tailgate of a wildcat truck a stolen car and a dead couple in lovers lane it is food pilfered from freight cars garments taken from clotheslines robbery and murder sweat and blood the complex made simple by the alchemy of necessity you cannot do what you must unaided so throughout your struggling your creeping and running your thieving and killing you are on the hunt for help and if you live you find it sooner or later rudy torrento found his sooner in the clintons doc found his later in a family of migratory farm workers sharecroppers turned crop tramps there were nine of them husband and wife and seven stairstep children the youngest a toddling tot the eldest a rawboned boy who was the scantling shadow of his father they were camped alongside the muddy trickle of a creek two of the tires on their ancient truck were flat and its battery stood on the ground their clothes were ragged but clean when doc emerged from the underbrush and approached them trailed nervously by carol they drew together in a kind of phalanx and the same look of wary phlegmatism was on every one of their suntanned faces carol had no reason to be nervous doc knew people and having been born among them he knew this kind very well their existence was centered around existing they had no hope of anything more no comprehension that there might be anything more in a sense they were an autonomous body functioning within a society which was organized to grind them down the law did not protect them for them it was merely an instrument of harassment a means of moving them on when it was against their interest to move or detaining them where it was to their disadvantage to stay doc knew them well he knew how to talk to them beyond a casual nod he ignored the mans wife and brood they had no authority and to imply any to them would have been discourteous drawing the man aside he spoke to him circuitously casually hunkering down on his heels talking with the mans own languid caution sometimes whole minutes passed in silence and speaking they seemed to discuss almost everything but the subject at hand yet they understood each other and they came to an agreement quite quickly doc gave the man some bills not many and none of them large for integrity cannot be bought and they were simply men in need assisting one another then the man gave drawled instructions to his family these here folks is friends he said theyll be movin on with us we dont let on about it to no one not ary peep or whistle he sent the eldest boy and the second eldest into town for new secondhand tires a battery and food in the morning they headed westward and lying prone in the rear of the truck doc and carol heard the womans cracked voice raised in a spiritual and they smelled the smoke from the mans nickel seegar the seven children were squeezed into the truck bed with them the bigger ones sitting with slumped shoulders to accommodate themselves to its low canvas cover they were all around them shielding them from view hiding them as effectively as though they had been at the bottom of a well but close as they were physically they were still worlds apart carol smiled at one of the girls and received a flat stare in return she started to pat the tots head and barely jerked her hand back in time to avoid being bitten the eldest boy protectively took charge of the child wouldnt do that no more maam he advised carol with chill politeness he dont cotton none to strangers the trucks best speed was barely thirty miles an hour despite their early starts and late stops they seldom made two hundred miles a day their food was monotonously unvaried practically the same from one meal to the next salt pork and gravy biscuits or mush and chicory coffee for breakfast for lunch mush or biscuits and salt pork eaten cold while they rode and for dinner there was more biscuits salt pork and gravy with perhaps some sweetnin and a poke salad greens boiled with pork into a greasy tasteless mess doc ate heartily of everything nauseated by the stuff carol ate no more than she had to to stay alive she acquired a painful and embarrassing stomach complaint her small body ached constantly from the jouncing and bouncing of the truck she became very bitter at doc the more so because she knew her predicament was her own fault and because she dared not complain these people didnt like her they tolerated her only because she was docs woman and without doc she would be lost whether the family knew who they were the most wanted criminals in the country is a moot point but reading no newspapers having no radio living in their own closemouthed world of existing to exist it is unlikely that they did and probably they would have turned their back on the opportunity to inform themselves these folks was feedin them these folks business was their own business ask no questions an youll hear no lies curiosity killed the cat leave well enough be an youll be well enough the old truck limped westward carrying doc and carol far beyond the danger zone of roadblocks and police checks and into the whilom safety of california and there after another day or so of travel they parted company with the family doc didnt want them to know his and carols destination to get any closer to it than they already were that would be asking for trouble and askedfor trouble was usually gotten moreover the family did not wish to go any farther south into an area that was traditionally hostile to vagrants or anyone who might possibly become vagrant and they hoped to have other fish to fry or rather apples to pick in the pacific northwest so there were monosyllabic farewells a final exchange of money then the family moved on and carol and doc remained behind quite inappropriately in the city of angels doc was dressed in blue overalls and a jumper and a striped railroad workers cap he carried himself with a pronounced stoop a pair of oldfashioned steelrimmed glasses were perched on the end of his nose and he peered over them nearsightedly as he paid for his ticket from a snaptop money pouch a metal lunch bucket was tucked under one arm beneath his clothes and carols was an outsize money belt carol came into the railroad station several minutes after him she also was stooped cronelike of figure she wore a long shapeless black dress and under the shadow of her head shawl her face was wizened and sunblack they boarded the train separately carol taking a rear seat doc entering the mens lounge then when their tickets had been collected and the train was well out of the yards he came out and sat down at her side he opened the lunch bucket and took out a pint bottle of whiskey he drank from it thirstily wiped the neck with his sleeve and extended it toward carol she shook her head her nose wrinkling distastefully do you have to keep hitting that stuff she frowned keep hitting it he returned her frown thats the first drink ive had in days well its one too many at a time like this if you ask me i but i didnt he took another long drink then returned the bottle to the lunch bucket look he said reasonably what do you want to do anyway break up go it on your own id like to know as if you didnt already know what the hell difference does it make what i want to do well said doc well then actually he did not want to be separated from her even if it had been practical he would not have wanted it and despite anything she said or did he knew that she felt the same way they were still in love as much as they had ever been strangely nothing had changed that his eyes drifted shut he wondered where the family of sharecroppers was by now and subconsciously he wished that he was still with them it hadnt been at all bad that long creeping journey across half of the united states nothing to do but ride and ride with every day exactly like the one before no worries no decisions to make above all the freedom in fact the necessity not to talk he had never before realized the blessedness of silence the freedom to be silent rather if one chose he had never realized somehow that such blessedness might be his privilege he was doc mccoy and doc mc coy was born to the obligation of being one hell of a guy persuasive impelling of personality insidiously likable and goodhumored and imperturbable one of the nicest guys youd ever meet that was doc mccoy they broke the pattern when they made him and of course doc did like people and he liked to be liked and hed been well compensated for his efforts in that direction still well there you were it had become an effort something else that he hadnt realized maybe he was just very tired he thought wearily and very worried because exactly what they were going to do after they got to golies he didnt know doc carol said whats the next step after we get to golies doc grimaced she can read my mind he thought im thinking about it he said i havent decided yet you dont know do you you havent any plan now thats putting it a little strong ill have to check around and her scornful smile stopped him all right he said i dont know she waited staring at him demandingly he fumbled the lunch bucket open and took another drink he gestured with it diffidently then quickly recapped it and put it away i it would have been simple enough ordinarily he explained i mean if we could have made it before they had the alarm out for us coming back from mexico youre apt to get a pretty thorough going over but going over they hardly take a second look at you you can just walk across the border or drive across and all right but thats what we could have done well maybe we still can there doesnt seem to be much noise out here about us maybe he broke off unable to continue so palpable a lie perhaps there wasnt any general search for them on the west coast but the border patrol would certainly have been alerted well see he mumbled ill have to look around maybe i can get a line on ma santis ma santis carol let out a disgusted snort just like that youre going to get a line on ma santis huh you already told me you thought she was dead and even if she wasnt id like to know how youre going to get a line on her or anyone else you cant make any inquiries you cant go wandering around and thats right i cant doc said curtly and he got up and entered the rest room seated on the long leather couch he lighted a cigarette looked wearily out into the moonlit night he had always thought this was the most beautiful stretch of country in the world this area of orange and avocado groves of rolling blackgreen hills of tileroofed houses all alike yet all different stretching endlessly along the endless expanse of curving whitesand beach he had thought about retiring here some day and though the idea was preposterous he still thought about it he could see himself and carol on the patio of one of those incredibly gay houses barbecuing a steak perhaps or sipping tall drinks while they stared out to sea there would be a cool breeze blowing in temperately cool and smelling of salt and doc carol murmured suddenly from the doorway he said coming and rejoined her in the seat and she patted his hand and gave him a lingering smile you know something doc she whispered this will be our first night together our first night together and alone so it will doc made his voice hearty it doesnt seem possible does it and im not going to let anything spoil it either nothing well just pretend like we dont have a worry in the world tonight just push everything out of our minds and have ourselves a nice long hot bath and something to eat and and she squeezed his hand almost fiercely sandyeggo bawled the conductor next stop is san diego the cabdriver accepted docs tip with a grunt of surprise hed figured this pair for stiffs and maybe even nopays they were some kind of foreigners he guessed and they didnt know their way around yet and he hastened to place himself at their disposal maybe you folks would like to go somewhere for a bite to eat he suggested after you uh get cleaned up a little i mean well doc glanced at carol im not sure just how long well or i could bring you something if you dont want to go out sandwiches chicken an french fries maybe some chinese or mexican food anything you say beer booze or baloney and no service charge just my cab fare and waitin time suppose you wait a moment doc said ill have to see about a cabin fat little golie was nervous but then golie almost always was he had things to make him that way so doc couldnt say just what it was that made him feel uneasy he stalled over the selection of a cabin finally choosing one at the far end of the court but his effort to smell out the trouble he felt to get at the source of his hunch was unavailing leaving the office he gave the cabdriver his cabin number and a twenty ordered two chicken dinners cigarettes and a carton of coffee the cabdriver saluted and sped away and doc and carol went down the long single row of cabins to the last one he unloeked the door switched on the light carol yanked down the shade pirouetted and flopped down on the bedkicking her legs high into the air boy she breathed does this ever feel good then wiggling her finger at him come here you right this minute doc took a step toward her then stopped short frowning listen do you hear anything oh now doc of course i hear something after all were not the only people in the court doc stared at her absently his brow furrowed with thought carol jumped up and put her arms around him leaned into him smiling up into his face this was to be their night together didnt he remember their first night in more than four years so would he kindly stop acting foolish and jumpy and thats it docs eyes narrowed suddenly golies family there was none of em around didnt you notice not even that overstuffed wife of his and she hasnt been twenty feet away from the place since she came here weve got to get out of here carol now gget out but but hes sent them away somewhere dont you see he must have and theres only one reason why he would have but carol looked at him incredulously but why what could i dont know it doesnt matter it may be too late already but it was too late there was a crunch of gravel outside then a polite knock on the door and a womans soft voice mr kramer miz kramer doc stiffened whipped a gun from beneath the bib of his overalls he gripped carols arm held it for a moment then nodded to her yes carol called who is it please the maid maam i brought you some towels doc glanced into the bathroom and slowly shook his head he pointed at carols dress mouthed a silent speech could you just leave them on the step please im undressed there was silence for a long moment a whispering so faint that it might have been anything but a whisper but that was the tipoff there was someone with this maid if it was a maid someone who was giving her instructions doc looked around swiftly he squeezed carols arm again and pointed toward the bathroom and his lips formed the word window carol shook her head violently and tried to hang onto him then winced and nodded whitely as he gave her arm another painful squeeze he raised the window silently he heard the maid say i cant leave em outside maam maybe your husband can come and get em just a moment please carol called back hes in the bathroom right now doc dropped through the window he tiptoed along the rear of the house and around the side and peered carefully around the corner rudy the gun in his hand jerked involuntarily how in the hell he put it out of his mind the wonderment the sense of being unbearably put upon facts were facts something to be accepted and dealt with and the fact was that rudy was here there was a woman with him it was fran clinton but she didnt appear to be armed gun in hand rudy stood to one side of her his head turned away from doc he didnt want to use the gun of course he could no more afford a racket than doc and carol could his objective and docs would be exactly the same to settle their score silently and unseen in the privacy of the cabin doc hefted his gun raised the barrel level with his shoulder he edged silently around the corner of the building rudy first with one skullcrushing blow from the gun then before the woman could move or yell a hard left hook with his free hand eyes fixed on them doc slowly raised and lowered his foot it came down on an upcornered brick one of several that had once formed the border of a flower bed and he fell headlong falling he triggered the gun it was all he could do now instantly rudy whirled gun blazing whirling the woman in front of him but his bullets passed above doc and docs drilled through the woman and into him and in seconds they lay dead on the ground one of rudys hands still holding her arm behind her back from a couple of blocks away the cabdriver heard the racket but he did not place it as coming from golies and certainly he did not connect it with his recent fares then he saw doc and carol running down the street toward him and hey look at that old gal run would you and puzzled he stopped the cab and got out somethin wrong folks somebody givin you some trouble yes doc told him ill explain it while youre driving us into the city into diego but what about your grub what doc jabbed a gun into his stomach gave him a shove toward the cab do you want to go on living do you then do what i tell you the driver obeyed but sullenly with the dragging deliberation of the very stubborn as they reached the highway and turned toward town he gave doc a selfrighteous glare this wont get you nothin mac he said i dont know what youre after but this wont get you a thing doc looked at him tightlipped in the back seat carol leaned forward anxiously doc i think hes right theres probably an alert out for us already goliell spill everything now how far can we get in this circus wagon doc asked her curtly how far they would get without it with an alert on the air what chance did they have of grabbing another car the cops wont know what were traveling in or whether were traveling in anything maybe we can make it to the border before they find out to the border but what youll never do it mac the driver cut in doggedly the best thing you can do is give yourselves up now oof like it doc gave him another prod with the gun want some more teeth gritted the man shook his head all right then doc said mildly make a left here and head straight up mission valley until i tell you to turn the cab swung left they sped down the curving cliffshadowed road and after a time doc spoke over his shoulder to carol they couldnt get through the border gates he said that obviously would be impossible but they might be able to slip across the line at some unguarded point people do it all the time he went on its not the best bet in the world and well still have problems if and when we get across but you wont make it the driver broke in dogged again not anywhere near the gates where youll be tryin i know that border mister and im telling you his sentence ended in a scream the cab swerved and he turned paincrazed eyes on doc you ttry that again he gasped you do that again and see what happens doc promised that he wouldnt do it again next time ill shoot you now go right at this next turn were hitting crosstown to the tijuana highway the cab made the turn with an angry skidding of tires they raced up the steep road into mission hills then down the long arterial street which skirts san diegos business district the traffic began to thicken there was the wail of a siren fading eerily into the distance above the windshield the blurred murmuring of the radio squawk box became a crisp voice cab seventynine cab seventynine come in seventynine the driver was elaborately disinterested doc glanced at the identification plate on the instrument panel and spoke to him sharply thats you answer it what dyou want me to say tell her youve got a couple of people on a sightseeing tour youll be tied up for about an hour sightseeing tour the driver squirmed in the seat leaned slightly over the wheel she wont never go for that mister shell know i got a couple of crooks headin for tijuana what doc frowned how will she know she just will shell even know where we are right now just making the turnoff for national city doc got it then he linked the drivers seemingly senseless speech with the breathless silence of the squawk box and savagely his nerves worn raw he smashed the gun barrel into the mans stubborn doughish face he smashed it he smashed it again the driver groaned and flung himself against the door of the car it shot open and he went tumbling and bouncing into the street the door swung shut again doc fought the wheel of the cab swinging it out of the path of an oncoming vehicle there was a frozen silence from carol a wondering silence then answering her unspoken question the voice of the squawkbox seventynine seventynine i read you seventynine doc found the switch and closed it he turned off the highway sped along roughly parallel to it on a gravel county road he asked is there a radio back there and carol said there was none it didnt matter of course they both knew what would be happening now the county road got them around national city then implacably it veered back toward the highway doc tried to get away from it lights turned off he weaved the cab through a network of outlying side streets that got them only a little farther south and in the end they were led back to the highway doc stopped just short of it his mind racing desperately to the lazy throb of the cabs motor take to the fields run for it on foot no no it was too late as impractical and impossible as trying to hook another car well then how about how about moving in on one of these suburbanites holing up with them holding the family hostage until there was a chance to make a break for it no again not with them penned in in so small an area holing up would simply eliminate the almost nochance they had now doc shrugged unconsciously he watched the intermittent flash of lights in front of them listened to the swishflick of the cars speeding past the intersection and finally since there was nothing else to do he drove back onto the highway again other cars whipped past them and laughter snatches of happy conversation spilled out into the night pleasure seekers people in a hurry to begin their evening of wining and dining across the border and with nothing more to fear than a hangover in the morning people who had earned their good time doc drove slowly for once in his life he had no plan he saw no way out they could not turn back neither could they cross the border through the gates or any other way the police had only to wait for them to close in the net until they were snared in it after a time he turned off the highway again pursuing a winding trail until it came to a dead end by the ocean he backed up headed back in the direction from which he had come and then he was again on the highway moving south the other cars were not moving so quickly now they shot past the cab then a few hundred yards beyond they began to slow and peering into the distance doc saw why so did carol and she spoke for the first time in minutes spoke with a tone that was at once angry frightened and a little gleeful well doc what do you figure on doing now do the roadblock what are you going to do her voice broke crazily just drive on into itjust keep on going and say yessir im ddoc mccoy and ththis is my wife carol and aand shut up doc cut in look dont you tell me tto look at what just ahead of us there that thing at the side of the road it seemed to be suspended some six feet above the roadside embankment an illuminated oblong blob topped by a larger and shadowy blob thenas the cab crept toward it the outlines of the two blobs became clearer revealed themselves as a womans face beneath a mans hat she was holding a flashlight in her hand shining the beam into her face swinging loosely from her other hand was a shotgun a rawboned giant of a woman she wore overalls and a sheepskin coat she stared at them at the cab rather flicked the beam of the flashlight across it then she made a brief swinging motion with it the light disappeared and so did she doc let out a suppressed shout he glanced over his shoulder quickly waited for the two cars behind him to pass carol shook him fiercely doc whats the matter with you who what was that and doc laughed a little wildly babbled that he couldnt believe it himself and then he slammed the cab into low gear cut the wheels to the right and went roaring up over the embankment and into the field it was wasteland an expanse of eroded topsoilless rock ahead of them the tall shadow of the woman beckoned then moved away swiftly guiding them up over a rise in the land and down into a cuplike valley there was a house there a dark desertedlooking shack two great forms came bounding from behind it mastiffs and streaked toward the cab in deadly silence but the woman spoke gestured to them and they came meekly to heel trotted along with her as she strode past the shack and on into the darkness beyond it doc do you hear me i want to know what this is all about doc didnt answer her it was in his mind perhaps that he had already explained fully and all his thoughts now were on the woman and the deliverance which she represented about a hundred yards beyond the house she came to a stop turned and faced them beckoned them forward slowly until they were almost upon her then she stopped them with a pushing motion of her hand and yanked open the door of the cab got anything in here that you want to save doc well pile out then were gettin rid of it for good they piled out just back of the point where the woman had been standing was a broad crater the dull gleam of moonlight on dark water gravel pit the woman explained succinctly aint got no bottom to it that lever found now well just give this buggy a good hard push they pushed straining then trotting sluggishly as the cab gathered speed then at a warning grunt from the woman they came to a halt and the cab shot over the brink of the pit descended with a resounding splash and disappeared beneath the oily surface the woman turned and gripped docs hand doc youre a sight for sore eyes and thats a fact couldnt hardly believe it was you when i got the word on the radio tonight and you needless to say are also a sight for sore eyes doc murmured you were waiting for us down there on the highway yep knew you was headin this way just took a chance on you spotting me incidentally her voice altered slightly not that i really give a whoop but what happened between you and rudy well doc hesitated you know rudy he never was quite right in the head and hed gotten a lot worse the more reasonable you tried to be with him why yeah sure finally blew his top huh well i been expecting it for a long time the woman shook her head wisely but to hell with the poor devil right now we got to hide you an and she paused with rough delicacy glancing at carol doc apologized hastily im sorry ma mrs santis id like you to meet my wife carol it is scarcely to be wondered at that carols handshake had been a little limp she had heard so much of this gaunt craggyfaced woman for so long that she had almost come to regard her as a myth ma santis daughter of a criminal wife of a criminal mother of six criminal sons two of mas boys had died in gun battles with the police two others like their father had died in the electric chair of the remaining two one was in jail and the other earl was at liberty the santises were hill people rebels and outlaws rather than criminals in the usual sense of the word they never forgot a favor nor forgave an injury they were that rare thing in the world of crime people with a very real sense of honor in another era they might have been pirates or privateers or soldiers of fortune it was their misfortune and perhaps the nations as a whole that they had been born into a civilization which insisted upon conformity and pardoned no breakage of its laws regardless of ones needs or motives the santises were unable to conform they would have died and did die rather than attempt to and now at age sixtyfour and after more than twenty years in prison ma was as completely unreconstructed as she had been at fourteen her son earl was living over in the back country she explained doin enough farming to look respectable and livin high on the hog from cached loot been so long since me or him turned a trick that people plumb forgot all about us ma chuckled so i figured well probably get a good goin over here at my place but no moren tany other you just hole up where i put you until earl shows up an by the by you was headin for el reys doc thats right well dont you never doubt youll make it ma said firmly men earl we helped plenty of friends to get there pat gangloni red reading ike moss an his woman course youre maybe a little hottern any of them but come here she turned and went back to the brink of the pit squatted there pointing with the beam of her flashlightyou see that them two clumps of bushes now look right below them there at them kind of shady places just under the water line i see them doc nodded caves you could call em that really aint much more than holesjust about big enough to crawl into and get out of sight but thats all you need aint it ma laughed jovially doc hesitated shooting a quick glance at carols taut face it you think this is necessary ma i mean wouldnt have you do it if i didnt think so there was a hint of tartness in her voice it aint so bad doc theres fresh air seeps in from somewhere and it aint really so cramped pat gangloni took it and you know pat makes two fellas your size with half a man left over doc forced himself to laugh at the joke well have to strip i suppose id say so unless you want to keep on your unmentionables theys blankets down there an its kind of hot anyways fine doc said well he unbuttoned his jumper and dropped it to the ground he sat down and began taking off his shoes and socks ma looked at carol she said probly need a rope and disappeared into the darkness carol remained standing motionless making no move to remove her clothes carol doc said then carol nono carol said shakily no i cant how do i know that that youre with me youre riding on my ticket now get out of those clothes he stood up stripped out of the jeans he unbuckled the money belt and dropped it on top of the pile of clothing he waited a moment working up an encouraging smile storing up warmth for his voice then hand outstretched he took a step toward carol she backed desperately away from him nno no she gasped i know what youre planning youll get me down there and stop it what else can you do anyway i know you id never get back up again shes your friend not mine she yyoud leave me down there under the ground and well here we are ma santis was suddenly back with them trouble im sorry doc said my wifes a little upset uuhuh ma drawled thought she kind of sounded like she was me im just a leetle upset myself figured i was goin a long ways to do you two a favor and now i aint so sure like to get set straight before i go any farther doc repeated that he was sorry ma shifted the shotgun under her arm and behind her the two mastiffs suddenly came to attention she waited staring stonily at carol and as if from some great distance carol heard her own voice felt her face stiffen in a conciliatory smile she was sorry she hadnt meant what she said she was very grateful to ma she she broke off stooping to pull the voluminous black dress over her head almost eagerly she unfastened the money belt made a tentative gesture of offering it to the older woman ma motioned laconically with the gun just drop it on the pile an dont worry about none of it showin up missing you help yourself to as much as you want doc said warmly i mean that ma we ma nodded she knew he meant it but she wasnt needin nothing always thought you was a hell of a guy doc heard a thing or two to the contrary but you was always square with me an mine aint a one of us that didnt think the world of you and ive felt exactly the same way about all of you ma but she continued i aint buyin in on no one elses fight i aint putting myself any further in the middle than i am already you two got a quarrel which i hope you aint you settle it somewheres else elsewise ill do the settlin and it wont be no fun for the party that starts the trouble she paused looking from one to the other waiting for their acknowledgments of her statement carols was somewhat readier than docs well thats fine ma said mildly now theres some water in them holes probly a little stale but you can drink it if youre thirsty enough no grub ocourse you can do without for as long as youre down there no smokin and no matches aint enough air to allow it well that about does it i guess want me to help you down doc doc shook his head i can make it all right thanks have you any idea how long it will be ma well id say tomorrow night but you know how it is doc come see come sah she laughed throatily oh yeah i knew was forgettin something sleepin pills cant tell you where they are exactly but just feel around an youll find em oh fine i was just going to ask about them now if youll just give me a little light for a moment ma ma squatted again beamed the flashlight down the wall of the pit doc studied it gave her shoulder a pat of thanks and poised himself on the brink good night he said and shooting a smile at carol and a very good night to you my dear then he jumped stifflegged there was an audible grunt as he struck the water he went under and he came up and then getting a grip on the bushes he pushed himself under again and stayed under now there ma said quietly there is one hell of a guy just in case you didnt know it i know it carol said she took the rope that ma handed her took a turn around her waist with it bellying down on the ground she got her legs over the edge of the pit and squirmed slowly backward she paused there halfsuspended in space breathing very rapidly then she looked up and gave ma the nod to lower her got somethin on your mind ma held her where she was for a moment maybe you better unload it while you can i nothing i guess i was just going to ask about the sleeping pills i mean why you and doc seem to take it for granted that well need them why ma frowned incredulously hey you aint been around much have you honey well i used to think so uhhuh ma said mmmhum well ill tell you somethin about them pills dont you doubt that youll need em an dont wait to take em until you do you gulp you down some right to begin with an when them wears off she tugged upward on the rope then slacked off on it carol swung off of the brink and moved slowly down toward the water yes she called shivering as her feet touched the water when they begin to wear off take some more ma said the hole lay on a slant and for its first two or three feet it was largely filled with water making it all but impossible to breathe until one had navigated it carol came through it at a frantic scramble continued to scramble forward with eyes closed breath held until her head butted against the rock at the end of the hole and then gratefully gasping in the air she let herself go prone strangely it was not absolutely dark wherever the faint seepage of air came from there was an equally faint seepage of light if only the relative light of the night outside to relieve the blackness of this hidden cave it was like being in a coffin she thought a dimly lit wellventilated coffin it wasnt uncomfortable not yet at least merely confining as long as one was content to remain in it and did not try to get out abruptly she cut off the thought fumbling in the dimness running her hands up to the end of the hole she encountered the oval canvascovered surface of a water canteen she shook it felt the swish and swing of the liquid inside she laid it down again and continued to fumble until she found a small tightly capped bottle she got the cap off and sniffed the contents taking out one of the capsules she pinched it and touched her tongue to it mildly bitter a faintly salty taste she dropped it back into the bottle and screwed the lid back on she didnt need that stuff she wasnt going to take anything that made her any more helpless than she was already ma had told her in so many words that she had nothing to fear she and doc were both under mas protection until they struck out on their own again but just the same she wasnt knocking herself out with goof balls ma might be absolutely on the square she might be but doc could outsmart someone like her without even halfway trying and if he decided to have things his own way and if he thought it was safe well never mind but no sleeping pills for her if they were sleeping pills her mind moved around and around the subject moving with a kind of fuzzy firmness with no coherent thought proeess she arrived at a conviction a habit with the basically insecure an insecurity whose seeds are invariably planted earlier in underor overprotectiveness in a distrust of parental authority which becomes all authority it can later with maturity a flexible concept be laughed away dispelled by determined clear thinking or it can be encouraged by selfabusive resentment and brooding selfpity it can grow ever greater until the original authority becomes intolerable and a change becomes imperative not to a radical one in thinking that would be too troublesome too painful the change is simply to authority in another guise which in time and under any great stress must be distrusted and resented even more than the first thrashing it and herself carol wondered why she feared doc as she did how she could fear him and be unable to trust him and yet love him as she could never love another even now despite her fear and distrust she would have given anything to have him with her he was always or virtually always so calm and selfassured he always knew just what to do and how to do it he could be breaking apart inside and youd never know it from the way he acted hed be just as pleasant and polite as if he didnt have a care in the world you had to be careful with someone like that you could never know what he was thinking but she sighed uxoriously squirming a little doc mccoy one hell of a guy ma had called him and that had seemed to say it all there just wasnt anyone else in the world like doc and there never would be she toyed with the bottle of pills then turning on her side she tapped on the wall with it he couldnt be too far away from her just a few feet through this coldly sweating roek if she could make him hear her and if he would reply to it well it would be nice each would be comforted she persuaded herself to know that the other was all right she tapped and listened tapped and listened she frowned with a kind of angry nervousness then brightening she turned and tapped on the opposite wall perhaps he was there on that side after all he just about had to be didnt he he had to be on one side or the other she tapped and listened tapped and listened the silence between tappings pressed in around her it became an aching thing a void crying to be filled it was unbearable and since the unbearable cannot be borne her imagination that friendly enemy stepped in quite clearly she heard docs answering taps well not clearly perhaps the imagination does have its limitations but she did hear them she tapped and he it tapped the signals went back and forth a great relief spread through her and then on its heels overlaying it an increasing restlessness and irritation what was the point in just tapping in just making a meaningless noise now if she could send him a message ask him tell him to to but maybe hed already thought of that and thought it was impossible and maybe it was she pushed herself back against the wall then measured the space to the opposite wall there seemed to be enough room for two people that is it could get to be a tight squeeze of course you couldnt continue it indefinitely but just for a little while an hour or so it would be fine the overhead space well she placed her palms against the roof of the hole gave a start at its nearness to her in the dimness it had seemed much farther away she pushed on it not realizing that she was pushing and suddenly she pounded on it with her fists she stopped that very quickly and lay very still for a few minutes until the wild pounding of her heart had stopped then pushing herself with heels and elbows she began to scoot toward the entrance water touched her feet she jerked them away from it she let them slide into it again and remain there for a moment and then with resentful resignation she withdrew them for obviously she couldnt leave this place go back out into the pit someone might see her for all she knew the place might be swarming with cops by this time at any rate the water was very deep bottomless ma had said and she could swim very little if she should be unable to find the hole doc was in or if she was unable to get into it or get back into this one perhaps they had planned it that way they hoped and expected that she would try to leave knowing that she would drown if she did but anyway leaving was out of the question she had to stay here until she was got out as her pendulum mind swinging back again she assured herself she would be doc would get her out after all she was his wife and theyd been through a lot together and shed done a lot for him and and if hed really wanted to get rid of her hed had plenty of chances before this hed get her out all right as soon as it was safe ma would make him it was just a little roomier down here near the entrance to the hole the roof was just a little higher she measured the distance with her upstretched palms thinking that there was almost room enough to sit up and no sooner had the thought entered her mind than she knew she must sit up she had to she could not remain prone or lie halfpropped up on her elbows another minute tucking her chin against her chest she raised herself experimentally six inches afoot a foot and a half a the stone pressed against her head she shoved against it stubbornly then with a suppressed ouch she dropped back to the floor she rested for a moment then tried again a kind of sideways try this time with her knees pulled upward that got her up a little farther though not nearly far enough but it did or seemed to show her how the trick could be done she was very lithe and limber more so now than ever after the arduous thinningdown of their crosscountry journey so she sucked her stomach in drew her knees flat against it and pressed her chin down against them and thus in a kind of flat ball she flung herself upward and forward her head struck the roof with a stunning bump then skidded along it gratingly leaving a thin trail of hair and scalp she would have stopped with the first painful impact but the momentum of her body arced her onward and then at last she was sitting up or rather sitting bent forward as she was it would have been far from accurate to say that she was sitting up the roof pressed upon her neck and shoulders her head was forced downward her widespread legs were flattened against the floor and to support herself she had her hands placed between them she raised one of them to brush at her face but the strain was so intolerable that she hastily put it back in use as a brace she rested breathing heavily finding it difficult to breathe at all in that constricting position thinking well at least i know i can do it now i can sit up if i want to then as the awkward pose became agonizing she tried to lie down again and was held almost motionless exactly as she was she couldnt accept the fact it was too terrible now surely she thought if i got into this i can get out of it if i can sit up then i can s i can lie down again of course i can she spoke grunted aloud why not anyway there was of course every reason why not it was impossible to draw her legs up as she had in the first instance almost impossible to move them at all as for balling herself up well she already was even more than she had been originally but now there was no give in the ball her body was like an overburdened spring so heavily laden that it can only go down farther and never up no she said quietly no then on an ascending note no no nno she waited panting the blood running to her head and her hair tumbled over her eyes her wrists throbbed and her elbows ached with sugary pain and suddenly they doubled under her and her torso lurched downward and a tortured scream burbled from her lips sobbing painfully she braced herself again tears ran down her face and she could not brush them away and in her agony and growing hysteria that seemed the most unbearable thing of all ccant cant even raise a finger she wept cant even rraise a then so softly that she could hardly be heard ma said tomorrow night tomorrow night probly the words trickled off into silence her panting grew more labored she wheezed and coughedgroaned with the jerking of her body and her tears ran harder i cant stand it she gasped you hear me i cant stand it cant stand it cant stand it ccaaan t stand eet cant stand eeyaahhhhhh she screamed and the pain of the exertion caused her to scream even louder and that scream wrung still another from her throat she writhed and screamed gripped in a frenzy of pain and fury her head pounded against the roof and her heels dug and kicked into the floor and her elbows churned and banged and scraped against the imprisoning sides of the hole blood mingled with the tears on her face it streamed down her back over her arms and legs and thighs from a hundred tiny cuts and scratches and bruises it came coating her body warm red blood combining slippery with the dust of the cave she never knew when she broke free or how or that she had she was still struggling still screaming when she got the cap off the pill bottle and upended it into her mouth peevishly she came up out of the pleasant blackness something was gripping her ankle and she tried to jerk away from it but the thing held tight it yanked skidding her down the hole peeling more hide from her body she cried out in protest and the cry was choked off suddenly as water closed over her choking and kicking she slid out of the hole and into the pit it was night again or night still and in the moonlight she looked blurrily into the flattest eyes she had ever seen im earl he grinned showing twisted teeth just hold tight now an ill getcha leggo she flung herself frantically backward just leave me alone i dont want to go anywhere pplease please dont make me just let me sstay where she made a grab for the bushes tried to pull herself back into the hole treading water earl gave her a hard slap in the face son of a gun he mumbled getting a rope around her waist signaling to ma and doc wasnt fortyeight hours enough for yuh covered by odds and ends of sacking doc and carol lay in the rear of earls old truck and were taken joltingly back through the hills to a county road and thence on several miles to the socalled farm where earl lived it was a shabby rundown place with a grassless junklittered yard a cow a few chickens a couple of acres of fruit trees and two or three more of truck crops inside the weatherbeaten house however with its bare warped floors and boardedup windows there was an outsize color tv set a huge deep freeze and refrigerator and an enormous woodfuel range earl was obviously proud of these possessions and doc complimented him on them laconically trying to conceal his pleasure santis took a large beef roast from the oven and slapped it platterless on the table as he whacked it into great bleeding chunks ma set out other vittles cold boiled cabbage bread a pot of coffee a gallon jug of bonded whiskey and tin cups and plates they all sat down then and everyone but carol began to eat hungrily she sat dazed and listless her stomach turning queasily hardly able to tolerate the sight and the smell of the food ma gave her an appraising look and reached for the whiskey jug she filled a tin cup pronounced tin cup half full of the white liquid and thrust it across the table now you drink that she ordered go on dont make me tell you twice carol drank it she swallowed hastily trying to swallow back the sickness and then a comforting fire spread through her stomach and a little color came back into her face now eat ma said and carol ate and after the first few bites the food tasted very good to her both of her eyes were slightly blackened her mouth was puffy and bruised and her face and hands were a mass of scratches and cuts but no one commented on her appearance or inquired into the why of it old hands in the sleazy bypaths of crime they could pretty well guess what had happened to her she kept her eyes on her plate taking no part in their conversation as indifferent to it as though it had nothing to do with her needless to say she and doc were still very hot it would be impossible for them to sneak across the mexican border and make their way down into the interior by land but ma and earl had lined up a good seaward contact the captain of a small portuguese fisherman who had handled similar ventures for them before no one with the kind of heat you two got ocourse ma took a swig of whiskey belched and wiped her mouth with the back of her hand hes stallin now trying to weasel out of the deal but hell come around in a day or so soons he sees it aint getting him nowheres you mean doc frowned warily you mean he knows who we are ma said sure naturally the fellow knew who else would be skippin the country right now but dont you worry none about it doc he knows all about us santises and you got nothing to worry about i see doc said yes im sure youre right roy santis would be getting out of prison in another year or so that would make three of them on the loose not to mention their manifold kinsfolk and friends and no one who was even slightly familiar with the santis reputation would do anything to offend them anyone who did in hope of reward or in fear of punishment would never live to brag about it the meal over earl filled a crockery jug with water and led carol and doc down through his gullied backyard to a haystacksize mound of manure it was partly dugout roofed over with boards which were in turn covered with manure facing away from the house the entrance was covered with a piece of canvas which was smeared with cow dung dried now but apparently applied when wet diffidently earl handed doc the water jug get you some grub too if you want it doc just figured youd want to do your eatin at night when you could come outside of course doc said we wont want a thing now earl well oh yeah no smokin guess you dont need me to tell you that dont believe id even light a match if i was you little smoke or fire shows a long ways off i understand there wont be any doc promised ever chaw got an extra plug with me you can have well now that might be all right doc said thank you very much earl earl went back to the house doc politely held the canvas door aside and waited for carol to precede him it was an hour or so before dawn without a word carol curled up on the floor and was almost immediately asleep again doc hunkered down against the wall and took a chew of tobacco he had slept himself out during the past two days and nights now sleeping was something to be done when he could no longer stay awake something to be conserved against the boredom of wakefulness he chewed and spa tcarefully covering up the spittle each time occasionally he looked at the dark shadow that was carol and his eyes became brooding and thoughtful with the first rays of sunlight the manure pile began to gather heat by ten oclock when carol came suddenly awake doc had stripped himself naked except for his shoes and socks and was sitting crosslegged on his pile of clothes he shook his head warningly as she broke into startled laughter then grinned in goodnatured selfdepreciation which would you say was the funniest he whispered me or the symbolism of the situation i cant decide she laughed softly maybe id better get into the act myself she undressed wiping away the sweat with her clothes making a cushion of them as doc had with his and now that they were alone doc showed a great deal of concern about her many cuts and bruises carol made little of them she deserved them she said for making a darned fool of herself but she was pleased by his solicitude and completely rested and relaxed she felt very kindly toward him head tilted to one side she gave him an impish look then leaning forward suddenly she took his bristled face in her hands and a soggy mass struck her on the forehead slid down across her face she sat back abruptly scrubbing and brushing at herself gaah she spat disgustedly nose wrinkled ugh of all the filthy messy now that was a shame doc said its the heat i suppose it softens this stuff up and please shegrimaced isnt it bad enough without you drawing me a picture that was the end of any lovemaking doc withdrew behind the calm mask of his face and carol sank back into her former listlessness as the long hours dragged by she talked to herself silently jeered the vague they and them for the fools that they were a lot of fun isnt it oh sure just like the movies real dramatic and exciting two big bad brainy bank robbers hiding naked in a pile of manure the heat brought hordes of flies it brought out swarms of corpsecolored grub worms which dropped down on their heads and backs or crawled up under them from the floor and it brought a choking eyewatering stench which seemed to seep through every pore of their skins once in desperation carol started to swing back the canvas door but doc pushed her away from it firmly you know better than that try a chew of tobacco tobacco thatll kill the smell of this stuff no but itll take the taste of it out of your mouth she hesitated then held out her hand gimme i cant be any sicker than i am already she took a small chew it did make her sicker but it was a different kind of sickness and even that was a relief she and doc sat chewing and spitting not bothering to cover the spittle not having to the manure dripped and plopped down on it and the flies swarmed and the bugs crawled and so the long day dragged on and at last it was night earl carried several pails of water down from the house and they were able to douse away some of the filth but the stench and the tobaccotainted taste of it remained with them it flavored the little food they were able to eat in their imagination they could even taste it in the whiskey which earl served them from a hippocket bottle there was no one at the house so earl had to get back to it quickly which meant that carol and doc could not linger in the open as they had hoped to reluctantly they went back beneath the canvas door flap and into the wretchedness of another night doc settled himself down to as much comfort as he could create carol moved restlessly from one spot to another on the filthy floor why she whispered fiercely why did they have to be here first those terrible underwater holes that even a rat would have run from and now this this place it didnt make sense after all thered been plenty of heat on them after theyd jumped the train and theyd had to hide then but never had they holed up in anything as bad as the santises had provided we were on the move then doc pointed out mildly we werent pinned down in so small an area i dont care i say we could hide just as well in some place that we could at least stand that was endurable i mean doc said that they seemed to have endured thus far then patiently he went on to explain that the best hiding place was always the one which seemed utterly impossible for human habitation the water holes for example as she had said even a rat would have shied from them and now the manure pile if it was nauseously repellent even at a distance who would expect anyone to take refuge inside of it carol listened dully then ceased to listen or to think shed better not complain any more she guessed her position was uncertain enough as it was unlike doc however she had not schooled herself to accepting what she could not change so she simply deadened herself to it lapsing into a blind blank lifelessness where time was at once endless and nonexistent they were in the manure pile for two more nights and days on the third night earl came down to them without his usual burden of provisions grab yourself a bite at the house he explained get cleaned up too looks like youre on your way earl lounged on the porch his pack of viciouslooking curs romping around him seated around the kitchen table were ma the boat captain carol and doc carols hair was cut short to her head both she and doc wore rolledup stocking caps jeans and loosely fitting sweat shirts to all appearances they were one with the captains crew his three kinsmen who stood behind his chair beaming frowning smiling as the case might be in exaggerated imitation of his expression right now they were all frowning but twentyfive thousan the captain rolled his eyes heavenward what is twentyfive thousan for such a risk a mere pittance then it aint really the risk you mind ma said drily long as you get paid enough for it thats the way it sizes up pete well sure it is so you got a bigger risk and youre gettin bigger money twice what you ever got before an thats moren fair and its all youre gonna get the two money belts were on the table ma opened them and counted out an equal amount from each melodramatically the captain continued his protests it will not do senhora me i do not mind we are old friends an with friends one is generous but my crew he turned and shook his head at them you see they will not do it they insis that who you kiddin ma laughed them ginks dont even know what were talkin about the captain scowled then his manner undergoing a complete change he also laughed well one must always try yes even with friends it is no less than a duty but now that we are agreed he reached for the money ma dropped a hamlike hand over it when you get back she said when i get the word from these people that they got to where they weregoin safe an sound an with all their belongins but but the captain sputtered coloring you think i am stool pigeon you do not trust me yes huhuh didnt say nothin like that then why an suppose there is trouble what if could not come back eh then you wouldnt get no money an she gave him a steady look you wouldnt need none pete his eyes fell he mumbled weakly that the matter was really nothing to dispute about he was quite content to wait for his money ma nodded wadded the bills into a roll and tucked it into the front of her dress earl came in from the porch everyone shook hands and doc suggested lightly that ma and earl come along for the journey they demurred grinning at each other as though exchanging some secret joke guess not doc me n earl kind of likes it here yeah said earl yes sir we like it real well here an o course we couldnt leave now nohow not with roy still in the pen doc said that he understood there was an awkward moment of silence with no one seemingly able to speak or move and then prompted by something in mas attitude doc felt constrained to proffer payment for the help which she and earl had rendered id really feel much better about it he said with wholly insincere sincerity i know youve said you dont need any money but weel lets see now ma said what you think its been worth to you doc why he kept his smile warm but there was a cold lump in his stomach several times already he had mentally totted up the money in the belts and divided it by two why i wouldnt put a figure on it ma its worth whatever you say it is and whatever you say is a hundred percent okay with me howd five grand strike you five hed been expecting well he didnt know just what but when people tapped you on a deal like this it was usually for most of what you had and there was nothing you could do but like it its not enough he declared generous in his relief id be getting a bargain at ten knew youd take it that way ma wagged her head in satisfaction told earl you would didnt i son but it aint for us doc what i had in mind was if youre sure that five or ten wont pinch you ten and it doesnt matter if it does pinch well id like you to pass it on to pat gangloni i told you he was down there i guess he wasnt carryin very heavy when he skipped an been pretty concerned about him good old pat doc said ill see that he gets it ma id o helped him myself but he was in an out awful fast an i didnt have nothin i could get at in a hurry so she wrung his hand im right pleased youll be lookin out for him know you mean to or you wouldnt say so its as good as done doc promised after all pats a mighty good friend of mine too they rode in the captains car with doc in the front seat between him and one of his crew and carol in the rear between the remaining two crewmen fog was thickening over san diego slowly descending upon the bay the car crept through it cautiously coming into the quay from the north then circling the citys civic center and returning from the south the boat was a sturdy fiftyfooter tied up about halfway down the long wharf there were other seagoing craft on either side of it a shrimp fisherman and a pleasure launch but both were silent and dark the captain parked the car and put the keys in the glove compartment he opened the door spoke quickly in portuguese and english now we are in a hurry so we must be to go out with the tide but we are not running we go slow fast yes his teeth gleamed in a nervous smile he got out and the others followed him and they moved with unhurried haste across the quay the captain leaped aboard held out his hands to carol doc landed on the deck a second behind her and calling lowvoiced instructions over his shoulder the captain showed them to his tiny cabin it was to be theirs for the voyage he himself would bunk with the crew he closed the door behind him and there was a murmuring of voices a blurred confusion of sounds then the roar quickly muted of the boats twin diesels and they moved out into the bay the captain came back drew the shades over the portholes and turned on the light you will be very quiet yes he smiled his white nervous smile on the water the sound she travels far he left again almost imperceptibly the boat gathered speed they slid deeper and deeper into the fog and the gray mass of it closed in behind them doc prowled about the cabin automatically inspecting it as he did any place that was strange to him he was looking for nothing in particular simply looking most topdrawer criminals have this habit it had saved docs life several times conversely bringing about the loss of anothers life or others lives on each occasion he checked the small shelf of books and the firstaid cabinet he looked under the bunk smiling an apology at carol who had lain down on it he poked through the pigeonholes of the desk located a key ring and unlocked and examined each of the drawers reloeking them and leaving their contents exactly as he found them he turned his attention to the heavy chest at the foot of the bunk it was padlocked at either end doc made a selection from the keys on the ring found the appropriate ones on the first try and raised the heavy oak lid there was a quantity of grayish blankets inside also bedded between them several boxes of ammunition two repeating rifles and two twelvegauge doublebarreled shotguns docs eyes lit up then almost absently he loaded the shotguns laid them at the top of the chest and lowered the lid he put the locks back on their staples not locked although they appeared to be that completed his inspection and its corollary activities and he rehid the keys in their pigeonhole and fixed himself a drink lying in the bunk carol watched her husband for a few moments then turned on her side and closed her eyes his behavior was merely another variation of a norm if there was anything more than that behind it he would tell her when and if the telling became necessary she slept almost immediately it seemed she came awake again out there in the night there was a peculiar echo to the boats diesels or no it wasnt an echo but the mounting purr of another engine and against the blinded portholes pushing stubbornly through the fog was a fuzzy beam of light the cabin was dark there was silence tense expectant and then docs harsh whisper carol could see him now feel him sitting at her side and near the door she saw the white flash of the captains teeth you do what i tell you to pete my wife and i will do the rest no please senhor i cannot it is not necessary only a small launch no more than three men i know all that makes it all the better please i tell you we do not have to i swear it and i know thees coast guard am i a stranger to them have i not made this same run many times we will chat for a few moments perhaps and and theyll hold you up in the meantime find out who you are where youre headed get all the dope they need to have us nailed by a cruiser but but there was a desperate sob in the darkness but later senhor what of that his position will have been known and it will be known that i my boat was you can blame it on me my wife and i slipped on board without your knowledge and took charge of your guns and ammunition ha they will believe such a story why not its a pretty good one doc paused ominously in fact id say it was a lot better than the other one you say it is easy for what other one the one youd have to tell ma santis not that it would do you any good pete nothing you could tell her would do any good but the captain sighed heavily the purr of the motor launch swelled to a sluggish drone i dont like it either pete doc said earnestly i hate killing and i particularly hate this but what else can i do what else it scarcely sounded like the captains voice yes what else senhor what could possibly be dearer than ones own life he turned and left a moment later there was a cry of ahoy there ahoy elena isabella then a gentle bump and the scraping of wood against wood doc cocked the shotguns he handed one of them to carol and silently opened the two portholes there were three men in the launch a gunner the steersman and its captain a young lieutenant jg he stood with one foot braced on the side of his boat cap pushed back on his head the steersman slouched nearby an elbow hooked over the windshield hands in his pockets the gunner stood by his sternmounted machine gun doc studied him he put a restraining hand on carols arm wait perhaps the three would draw closer together whats the big hurry pete the lieutenant spoke in an amiable drawl a friend addressing a friend werent trying to run away from me were you rrun the captain laughed shakily who runs who is in a hurry didnt bait up tonight did you why not why because i did so this afternoon also i iced fueled provisioned keesed my wife okay okay the lieutenant chuckled got any coffee in the galley jack bring us our bucket back there the gunner came forward with a tin lunch pail the lieutenant extended it upward holding onto him for support now said doc he got the two of them almost cutting them in half at the waist with one double blast they doubled over toppled down into the dark water between the two boats carols shot got the steersman in the face and chest he was still alive when two of the fishermans crew tossed him over the side and blinded faceless he managed to struggle to the surface mercifully one of the men crushed his skull with an axe then they chopped a hole in the bottom of the launch and leaped back aboard their own craft the diesels roared frantically the boat lunged at the waves lunged through them like a terrified thing running as though it could never run far enough as though it would run forever and then as the hours passed slowing for what was done was done and for now at least there was no need to run as for carol and doc they lay in one anothers arms replete reunited at last and doc held her very close stroked her head protectively for she was his wife much dearer to him then the average wife to the average husband and if circumstances compelled him to think of her as an opponent and he was not sure that they did just yet it was with no less love and a very great deal of regret she shivered against him made muffled sounds against his chest he emitted a few husbandly theretheres murmured that everything was all right now then realizing that she was laughing he gave her a tender kiss now whats so funny hummm yyou i i dont be angry doc but of course i wont be now what did i do that amused you nnothing it was well just you she snickered delightly you never really planned on staying in mexico did you you never stopped hoping you could someday somehow you intended to do it i could tell i watched your expression when we were coming down on the train to san diego and and and well you know now you cant not after that deal tonight correction doc said now we cant the tiny area where el rey is uncrowned king appears on no maps and for very practical reasons it has no official existence this has led to the rumor that the place actually does not exist that it is only an illusory haven conjured up in the minds of the wicked and since no one with a good reputation for truth and veracity has ever returned from it well you see but it is there all right lying in a small coastal group of mountains it suffers from sudden and drastic changes in climate it is almost impossible to dress for it the barely adequate clothes of one hour become a sweltering burden the next and somehow doubtless as an outgrowth of these climatic phenomena one is always a little thirsty still many tropical and semitropical climates have these same disadvantages and worse and there is this to be said for el reys kingdom it is healthy disease is almost unknown even such mancreated maladies as malnutrition and starvation are minus much of their normal potency and a man may be almost consumed by them before he succumbs to them it is an excellent place in many ways healthy possessed of a climate to suit every taste protected by the largest per capita police force in the world yet there is constant grumbling among its expatriate guests one of the commonest causes of complaint strangely is that all accommodations everything one must buy are strictly first class not that they are exorbitantly priced understand on the contrary a fourbathroom villa which might cost several thousand a month in some french riviera resort will rent for no more than a few hundred but you can get nothing for less than that you must pay that few hundred it is the same with food and drink nothing but the very best with clothes cosmetics tobacco and a hundred other things all quite reasonably priced for what they are but still worrisomely expensive to people who have just so much money and can get no more el rey manifests great concern over these complaints but there is a sardonic twinkle in his ageless old eyes naturally he provides only the best for his guests isnt it what they always wanted elsewhere didnt they insist on having it regardless of cost well then he goes on to point out that less exquisite accommodations and material goods would encourage an undesirable type of immigrant persons his present guests would not care to be identified with for if they did they obviously would not be what they were nor be where they were watching their assets trickle nay pour away on every side people scheme and struggle feverishly to economize they cut down on food they do without drink they wear their clothes threadbare and the result is that they are just as much out of pocket as if they had bought what they did without which brings us to the subject of el reys bank another cause for bitter complaint the bank makes no loans of course who would it make them to so the only available source of revenue is interest paid by the depositor rather than to him on balances of one hundred thousand dollars or more the rate is six percent but on lesser sums it rises sharply reaching a murderous twentyfive percent on amounts of fifty thousand and under briefly it is almost imperative that a patron keep his account at or above the one hundred thousand figure but he may not do this by a program of skimping and doing without when ones monthly withdrawals fall under an arbitrary total the approximate amount which it should cost him to live at the prevailing firstclass scale he becomes subject to certain inactive account charges and these added to his withdrawals invariably equal that total this is just about as it has to be of course el rey must maintain an elaborately stocked commissary and he can only do so on a fixedpatronage basis such is the rule in almost every firstclass resort a certain tariff is collected from every guest and whether he uses what he pays for is strictly up to him to strike another analogy no one is compelled to deposit his money in el reys bank but the resort management specifically the police will assume no responsibility if it is stolen as it is very likely to be there is good reason to believe that the police themselves do the stealing from nondepositors but there is no way of proving it and certainly nothing to be done about it so the complaints go on el rey is unfair you cant win against him he listens courteously to all grievances but you get no satisfaction from him he tosses your words back at you answers questions with questions retorts with biting and ironic parables tell him that such and such a thing is bad and suggest a goodly substitute and he will quote you the ancient proverb about the king with two sons named either and neither an inquiry was made as to their character senor were they good or bad boys or which was the good and which the bad and the kings reply either is neither and neither is either people curse him they call him the devil and accuse him of thinking he is god and el rey will nod to either charge but is there a difference senor where the difference between punishment and reward when one gets only what he asks for most immigrants to the kingdom come in pairs married couples or simply couples for the journey is an arduous one and it can seldom be made without the devoted assistance of another in the beginning each will handle his own money carefully contributing an exact half of the common expenses but this is awkward it leads to arguments and no matter how much the individual has he is never quite free of the specter of want so very soon there is a casual discussion of the advantages of a joint account and it is casually agreed that they should open one and from then on well the outcome depends on which of the two is the shrewder the more coldblooded or requires the least sleep and whoever is the survivor and thus has the account at his disposal will not be alone long he will be encouraged to seek out another partner or one will seek him out and when their association terminates as it must there will be still another the process goes on and on inevitable immutable as simple as abc mention was made of el reys police the protection they provide the populace but this is a word of broad implications if one is to protect he may not annoy he must remember that life belongs to the living he will be wise to refrain from stepping over the line of his obvious duty to harry down a miscreant who may not exist sluggings are unheard of in el reys dominion no one is ever shot stabbed bludgeoned strangled or brought to death by the usual agencies of murder in fact there are no murders officially there are none the very high death rate derives from the numerous suicides and the immigrants proclivity for fatal accidents the fine swimming pools of the various villas are rarely used the horses in the public stables grow fat for want of exercise and the boats stand rotting in their docks no one fishes no one hunts no one plays golf tennis or darts briefly except for el reys annual grand ball there is almost no social life anyone approaching another is suspect or suspicious doc hardly knew what to do with himself one day a few months after his arrival he took a walk up into the hills and there nestled in a pleasant valley and hidden from the city he came upon a village the one street was attractively cobblestoned the buildings were freshly whitewashed drifting to him on the breeze came the smell of roasting peppery meat the only people in sight were two men down near the end of the street who were sweeping the cobblestones with longhandled brooms doc recognized them he had nodded to them a time or two in the city he raised his hand in a halfsalute but not seeing him apparently they finished their sweeping and disappeared inside a building yes senor a blueuniformed carabinero stepped out of a nearby doorway i may be of service nothing doc smiled i thought for a moment that i recognized those two men the streetsweepers they are friends of yours oh no not at all hardly know them as a matter of fact i see well they are newly arrived those two they will live here now in case you should wonder about their absence from their usual haunts doc looked around commented on the pleasing appearance of the place the carabinero agreed that everything was indeed well kept it is required each resident contributes such labor as he is able to uhhuh doc nodded its a cooperative right the labor is contributed in lieu of money that is right senor mmmhmm doc took another appreciative look around now was wondering my wife and i have a very nice villa in the city but no senor you would not be eligible for admittance here well now i dont know about that doc began but the officer cut him off he was sure that doc was not eligible when he became so he would be notified you may depend on it senor meanwhile perhaps you would like to walk around see what your future home will be like doc said that he would and they started down the wide sparkling street smoke rolled up from the chimneys of the houses but no one stood in their doorways or looked out their windows and hardly a sound came from any of them the high dry air seemed unusually warm and doc paused and mopped his face wheres the cantina ill buy the drinks there is none senor you can buy no drinks here well some coffee then that neither senor no drink or food of any kind no doc frowned you mean everything has to be brought out from the city i dont think id like that the officer slowly shook his head you would not like it senor but no that is not what i meant nothing is brought from the city nothing but the people themselves the words seemed to hang suspended in the air a brooding message painted upon the silence the carabinero seemed to study them to look through them and on into docs eyes and he spoke gently as though in answer to a question yes senor that is the how of it no doubt you have already noticed the absence of a cemetery bbut doc brushed a shaky hand across his mouth bbut that smell that filled the air the odor of peppery roasting flesh peppers could be had anywhere for the picking the asking but the meat quite fitting eh senor and such an easy transition one need only live literally as he has always done figuratively he smiled handsomely and the gorge rose in docs throat it was all he could do to keep from striking the man fitting he snarled it its disgusting thats what it is its hateful hideous inhuman inhuman but what has that to do with it senor dont get sarcastic with me ive taken care of better men than you without i am sure of it that is why you are here yes but wait he pointed there is one who knows you i believe the man had just emerged from one of the houses he was well over six feet tall some five or six inches perhaps and his normal weight should have been indeed it had been no less than two hundred and fifty pounds but what it was now could not possibly be more than a third of that his eyes were enormous in the unfleshed skulls head of his face his neck was no larger than docs wrist it was incredible that he could be alive but of course the climate is very healthy in el reys kingdom and many people live to a hundred years and more he staggered toward doc mouthing silently in his weakness in his helpless silence the exaggerated slowness of his movements he was like a man caught up in some terrifying nightmare pat docs voice was a sickened whisper pat gangloni automatically he recoiled from the apparition and then bracing himself he stepped forward deliberately and took gangloni into his arms its all right pat take it easy boy youre okay now he patted the skeletons shoulders and gangloni wept silently the carabinero watched them an unaccustomed sympathy in his eyes a sad case he murmured oh but very sad he is unable to resign himself already he has been here far longer than many never mind that doc turned on him angrily can you get me a car a cab something to get him out of here weel yes it will take a little time but i can do it well do it then go on your pardon senor the carabinero didnt move you would take him out of here you said out of here to where where why to my home naturally someplace where i can take care of him get him back on his feet and then senor then you will continue to provide for him why uh doc slowed down a little well yes of course i suppose so i mean uh you would be required to senor as long as you were able to provide for yourself it would be so pointless otherwise so cruel inhuman as you said a moment ago gangloni began to shudder violently he could not talk but he could hear like the man in the nightmare he knew what was going on doc made a feeble attempt to free himself and the skeleton arms tightened around him he is a good friend eh you owe him much the carabinero was sympathy personified i can understand in this one i would say there is an inner fineness he is a man of beliefs principles distorted and twisted perhaps but doc abruptly broke free of gangloni he backed away on the cobblestones grimacing mumbling apologetically i ill have to come back later i you know make some arrangements first ttalk with my wife sure itll be all right bbut but you know how women arei mean i i pat don t look at me like that don t he turned and began to run on the suddenly chill breeze the carabineros voice followed him hasta la vista senor until we meet again you tell yourself it is a bad dream you tell yourself you have died you not the others and have waked up in hell but you know better you know better there is an end to dreams and there is no end to this and when people die they are dead as who should know better than you el rey does only what he has to his criminal sanctuary is a big improvement over most he does not kill you for your loot he gives you value for your money he runs a firstclass place and he could not do so if you were allowed to be miserly nor can he permit you to linger on when your money is gone there would be no room for newcomers if he did and allowed to accumulate you and your kind would soon take over you would be in his place and he would be in yours up on that cobblestoned street with its sparkling whitewashed buildings and he knows this he and his native subjects know it it explains their delight in irony in symbolism in constantly holding a mirror up to you so that you must see yourself as you are and as they see you no it is impossible to deceive yourself the kingdom is there maps and officialdom to the contrary it is there call it what you like all things considered it is probably the best place of its kind and its bad features such as they are derive not from el rey but his guests he will not cheat you he will not kill you he cannot and will not provide for you but he will not put an end to your life no matter how long you live and in that strangely salubrious climate you seem to live an eternity in el reys dominion there is one night of the year the night of the annual grand ball when there are no suicides or fatal accidents everyone is politely but thoroughly searched before entering the palacio del rey where the fete is held everyone is advised that any misfortune to a guest will be regarded with great displeasure it has been many years since any such misfortune occurred and the victims plunge from a fourthfloor window actually was accidental but everyone present was fined heavily and the supposed instigator of the accident the womans husband suffered total confiscation of his bank account so today not only does no one make an untoward move but everyone shows the greatest concern for the welfare of everyone else raise your voice slightly and you are immediately the target of a hundred anxious eyes reach suddenly for a handkerchief or cigarette and a dozen people move toward you very distinguished in white tie and tails doc mccoy stood on the promenade border of the great ballroom beaming out over the swirling assemblage of dancers bowing to this couple smiling at that one courteously inclining his head toward another perfectly groomed his temples touched with gray he was the very picture of a gentleman at ease of wellbred charm but he had seldom been less at ease or more thoroughly miserable his physical discomfort his numbed feet and aching back was largely attributed to the wives of el reys two chief justices neither of the ladies was over five feet tall yet their combined weight was considerably more than a quarter of a ton and they were as near to being inexhaustible as anyone doc had ever met he had danced with them by turns murmuring exquisite apologies as they walked giggling on his feet whispering compliments as his back screamed at the constant bending oh he had buttered up the ladies but good for they were known to be ogres in private and virtually the masters of their henpecked husbands then while he was silently congratulating himself he had seen carol dance by in the arms of the chief of police and he knew that his agonized efforts had been wasted the chief of police against the chief justices if there was any advantage it was on carols side she might suffer for it perhaps if he became one of the dominions suicides or accident victims but that would do him no good whatsoever it was now more than an hour since he had seen either her or the chief of police and his anxiety was growing he would have to think very fast or this might well be the last grand ball he would ever attend he made a final survey of the ballroom then turning apparently unseeing as a fat feminine hand waved to him across the throng he strolled slowly down the palmbordered promenade and for some reason his mind went back to that longago day in kansas to the picnic grounds where he and carol had gone after leaving the train need to get acquainted again doc wejustabout have to doc smiled wryly to himself get acquainted oh no they didnt need to what had actually troubled them was that they knew each other too well they lived by taking what they wanted by getting rid of anyone who got in their way or ceased to be useful to them it was a fixed pattern with them it was them and in the event of a showdown they would show no more mercy toward each other than they had toward so many others wrapped in thought doc sauntered down the promenade absently glancing through the doorways of the innumerable parlors drawing rooms and bars from one of them fat ike moss called a muffled greeting to him gestured his mouth stuffed to a long delicacyladen table but doc smilingly shook his head and passed on ike moss he thought distastefully how gross how completely lacking in a sense of propriety could the man be only last week his wife had drowned in her bath yet here he was dressed to the nines and gobbling down everything in sight probably raided the icebox after he finished her off doc thought and he chuckled silently at the picture that came into his mind he came to a small billiard room started on past it then he paused abruptly straightened his shoulders and went through the doorway dr max vonderscheid was at the one pool table his dwarfed hunchbacked body was dressed in rusty black the tails of the illfitting suit almost touching the floor and his gray leonine head rose only a few inches above the table but still he appeared austerely handsome and dignified and he sent the pool balls caroming about the green with almost magical accuracy he pocketed the last two with a difficult doublebank shot doc applauded lightly and vonderscheid set the cue on the floor butt down and leaned on it looking at him yes herr mccoy i may be of service to you his speech was almost unaccented doc had observed that it almost always was except when he was around el rey he and el rey were seemingly on very good terms the latter making extraordinary concessions to the doctor with regard to rent and other expenses still vonderscheid had to have some kind of income and he couldnt have much of a practice here yes there was a peculiar gleam in the hunchbacks eyes you cannot perhaps make up your mind sorry doc said hastily i was so absorbed in watching your game that but yes i believe you can be of help to me i uh the truth is im very worried about my wife i dont think shes at all well i see so well doc lowered his voice its of a highly confidential nature doctor id want to discuss it in absolute privacy vonderscheid turned and glanced around the room his gaze lingering for the merest moment on a palmsheltered corner nook brows raised he turned back to doc again this would seem to be private enough he said yes this should do perfectly so what is it about your wife and why do you bring the matter to me doc began a cautious explanation he had not nearly finished when vonderscheid interrupted with an impatient gesture if you please herr mccoy so much talk for so commonplace a deed you want me to examine your wife yes to suggest that she would do well to have one with no mention that it is your suggestion and then you wish me to tell her that she is in need of an operation to convince her of it and during the course of the operation i am to no point in spelling it out doc said quickly after all a great many people die in surgery now if youd uh care to give me an estimate of your fee if i did it there would be none to remove either you or your wife from society would be both pleasure and privilege unfortunately i cannot do it my name is vonderscheid not katzenjammer i am a doctor not an assassin now just a moment doc frowned im afraid you misunderstood me doctor you surely dont think that i if you please vonderscheid cut him off with a bang of a cue do not ask me what i think of you or your wife of what you have done with your good bodies your strong minds your unlimited opportunities if only half so much i had had or poor rudy torrento so thats it doc said angrily sardonic you and rudy were friends so naturally he broke off vonderscheid had moved back a step stood gripping the cue with both hands he wagged it with an ominous movement and doc discovered he had nothing more to say you are quite through mccoy the doctor grinned at him furiously then i will finish rudy was my friend yes he was insane he had been brutalized almost from birth he had been made into what he was and he could not have been anything else he had never had a friend so i became one to him i did not regard him as a criminal no more merely because i have broken laws do i consider myself one so so that is all herr mccoy except for two things your wife approached me only a few minutes ago with a proposition similar to your own in fact she should still be here he pointed to the cluster of potted palms so in case you should wish to condole with one another he laughed wickedly tossed his billiard cue onto the table and walked out doc bit his lip he remained where he was for a moment and then with a kind of dreary nonchalance he walked around the table and skirted the palms carol had a portable bar drawn up in front of her silently he sat down at her side and silently she fixed him a drink her eyes warmly sympathetic he was pretty rough on you doc im sorry oh well doc sighed i hope he wasnt equally nasty with you my dear i dont care about myself ive been told off by experts but someone like you someone that everyone has always liked she gave his hand a soothing pat and doc turned to her with thoughtful wonderment do you know he said i believe you really love me love you she frowned why of course i do dont you love me yes doc nodded slowly yes carol strangely enough i love you very much i always have and i always will and i could never love anyone else and i couldnt either i oh doc doc and it doesnt make any difference does it carol or does it does it she dabbed her eyes with her handkerchief ttell me it does doc and ill tell you it does and what the hell difference will it make doc nodded vaguely he refilled their glasses in the palace tower a great bell began to toll the hour of twelve and in the ballroom the band struck up the strains of home sweet home well carol said i guess its just about over doc yes doc said just about over carol you she said and her voice was suddenly angry frightened tortured ill drink a toast to you doc darling why how kind of you doc said and he touched his glass to hers what will it be to you to you and our successful getaway and to you my dear doc said and another such victory about the author james meyers thompson was born in anadarko oklahoma in he began writing fiction at a very young age selling his first
