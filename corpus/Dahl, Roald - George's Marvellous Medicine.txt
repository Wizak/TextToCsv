roald dahl georges marvellous medicineroald dahl georges marvellous medicine warning to readers do not try to make georges marvellous medicine yourselves at home it could be dangerous grandma im going shopping in the village georges mother said to george on saturday morning so be a good boy and dont get up to mischief this was a silly thing to say to a small boy at any time it immediately made him wonder what sort of mischief he might get up to and dont forget to give grandma her medicine at eleven oclock the mother said then out she went closing the back door behind her grandma who was dozing in her chair by the window opened one wicked little eye and said now you heard what your mother said george dont forget my medicine no grandma george said and just try to behave yourself for once while shes away yes grandma george said george was bored to tears he didnt have a brother or a sister his father was a farmer and the farm they lived on was miles away from anywhere so there were never any children to play with he was tired of staring at pigs and hens and cows and sheep he was especially tired of having to live in the same house as that grizzly old grunion of a grandma looking after her all by himself was hardly the most exciting way to spend a saturday morning you can make me a nice cup of tea for a start grandma said to george thatll keep you out of mischief for a few minutes yes grandma george said george couldnt help disliking grandma she was a selfish grumpy old woman she had pale brown teeth and a small puckered up mouth like a dogs bottom how much sugar in your tea today grandma george asked her one spoon she said and no milk most grandmothers are lovely kind helpful old ladies but not this one she spent all day and every day sitting in her chair by the window and she was always complaining grousing grouching grumbling griping about something or other never once even on her best days had she smiled at george and said well how are you this morning george or why dont you and i have a game of snakes and ladders or how was school today she didnt seem to care about other people only about herself she was a miserable old grouch george went into the kitchen and made grandma a cup of tea with a teabag he put one spoon of sugar in it and no milk he stirred the sugar well and carried the cup into the livingroom grandma sipped the tea its not sweet enough she said put more sugar in george took the cup back to the kitchen and added another spoonful of sugar he stirred it again and carried it carefully in to grandma wheres the saucer she said i wont have a cup without a saucer george fetched her a saucer and what about a teaspoon if you please ive stirred it for you grandma i stirred it well ill stir my own tea thank you very much she said fetch me a teaspoon george fetched her a teaspoon when georges mother or father were home grandma never ordered george about like this it was only when she had him on her own that she began treating him badly you know whats the matter with you the old woman said staring at george over the rim of the teacup with those bright wicked little eyes youre growing too fast boys who grow too fast become stupid and lazy but i cant help it if im growing fast grandma george said of course you can she snapped growings a nasty childish habit but we have to grow grandma if we didnt grow wed never be grownups rubbish boy rubbish she said look at me am i growing certainly not but you did once grandma only very little the old woman answered i gave up growing when i was extremely small along with all the other nasty childish habits like laziness and disobedience and greed and sloppiness and untidiness and stupidity you havent given up any of these things have you im still only a little boy grandma youre eight years old she snorted thats old enough to know better if you dont stop growing soon itll be too late too late for what grandma its ridiculous she went on youre nearly as tall as me already george took a good look at grandma she certainly was a very tiny person her legs were so short she had to have a footstool to put her feet on and her head only came halfway up the back of the armchair daddy says its fine for a man to be tall george said dont listen to your daddy grandma said listen to me but how do i stop myself growing george asked her eat less chocolate grandma said does chocolate make you grow it makes you grow the wrong way she snapped up instead of down grandma sipped some tea but never took her eyes from the little boy who stood before her never grow up she said always down yes grandma and stop eating chocolate eat cabbage instead cabbage oh no i dont like cabbage george said its not what you like or what you dont like grandma snapped its whats good for you that counts from now on you must eat cabbage three times a day mountains of cabbage and if its got caterpillars in it so much the better owch george said caterpillars give you brains the old woman said mummy washes them down the sink george said mummys as stupid as you are grandma said cabbage doesnt taste of anything without a few boiled caterpillars in it slugs too not slugs george cried out i couldnt eat slugs whenever i see a live slug on a piece of lettuce grandma said i gobble it up quick before it crawls away delicious she squeezed her lips together tight so that her mouth became a tiny wrinkled hole delicious she said again worms and slugs and beetley bugs you dont know whats good for you youre joking grandma i never joke she said beetles are perhaps best of all they go crunch grandma thats beastly the old hag grinned showing those pale brown teeth sometimes if youre lucky she said you get a beetle inside the stem of a stick of celery thats what i like grandma how could you you find all sorts of nice things in sticks of raw celery the old woman went on sometimes its earwigs i dont want to hear about it cried george a big fat earwig is very tasty grandma said licking her lips but youve got to be very quick my dear when you put one of those in your mouth it has a pair of sharp nippers on its back end and if it grabs your tongue with those it never lets go so youve got to bite the earwig first chop chop before it bites you george started edging towards the door he wanted to get as far away as possible from this filthy old woman youre trying to get away from me arent you she said pointing a finger straight at georges face youre trying to get away from grandma little george stood by the door staring at the old hag in the chair she stared back at him could it be george wondered that she was a witch he had always thought witches were only in fairy tales but now he was not so sure come closer to me little boy she said beckoning to him with a horny finger come closer to me and i will tell you secrets george didnt move grandma didnt move either i know a great many secrets she said and suddenly she smiled it was a thin icy smile the kind a snake might make just before it bites you come over here to grandma and shell whisper secrets to you george took a step backwards edging closer to the door you mustnt be frightened of your old grandma she said smiling that icy smile george took another step backwards some of us she said and all at once she was leaning forward in her chair and whispering in a throaty sort of voice george had never heard her use before some of us she said have magic powers that can twist the creatures of this earth into wondrous shapes a tingle of electricity flashed down the length of georges spine he began to feel frightened some of us the old woman went on have fire on our tongues and sparks in our bellies and wizardry in the tips of our fingers some of us know secrets that would make your hair stand straight up on end and your eyes pop out of their sockets george wanted to run away but his feet seemed stuck to the floor we know how to make your nails drop off and teeth grow out of your fingers instead george began to tremble it was her face that frightened him most of all the frosty smile the brilliant unblinking eyes we know how to have you wake up in the morning with a long tail coming out from behind you grandma he cried out stop we know secrets my dear about dark places where dark things live and squirm and slither all over each other george made a dive for the door it doesnt matter how far you run he heard her saying you wont ever get away george ran into the kitchen slamming the door behind him the marvellous plan george sat himself down at the table in the kitchen he was shaking a little oh how he hated grandma he really hated that horrid old witchy woman and all of a sudden he had a tremendous urge to do something about her something whopping something absolutely terrific a real shocker a sort of explosion he wanted to blow away the witchy smell that hung about her in the next room he may have been only eight years old but he was a brave little boy he was ready to take this old woman on im not going to be frightened by her he said softly to himself but he was frightened and thats why he wanted suddenly to explode her away well not quite away but he did want to shake the old woman up a bit very well then what should it be this whopping terrific exploding shocker for grandma he would have liked to put a firework banger under her chair but he didnt have one he would have liked to put a long green snake down the back of her dress but he didnt have a long green snake he would have liked to put six big black rats in the room with her and lock the door but he didnt have six big black rats as george sat there pondering this interesting problem his eye fell upon the bottle of grandmas brown medicine standing on the sideboard rotten stuff it seemed to be four times a day a large spoonful of it was shovelled into her mouth and it didnt do her the slightest bit of good she was always just as horrid after shed had it as shed been before the whole point of medicine surely was to make a person better if it didnt do that then it was quite useless soho thought george suddenly ahha hohum i know exactly what ill do i shall make her a new medicine one that is so strong and so fierce and so fantastic it will either cure her completely or blow off the top of her head ill make her a magic medicine a medicine no doctor in the world has ever made before george looked at the kitchen clock it said five past ten there was nearly an hour left before grandmas next dose was due at eleven here we go then cried george jumping up from the table a magic medicine it shall be so give me a bug and a jumping flea give me two snails and lizards three and a slimy squiggler from the sea and the poisonous sting of a bumblebee and the juice from the fruit of the jujube tree and the powdered bone of a wombats knee and one hundred other things as well each with a rather nasty smell ill stir them up ill boil them long a mixture tough a mixture strong and then heighho and down it goes a nice big spoonful just gulp it down and have no fear how do you like it granny dear will she go pop will she explode will she go flying down the road will she go poof in a puff of smoke start fizzing like a can of coke who knows not i lets wait and see oh grandma if you only knew what i have got in store for you george begins to make the medicine george took an enormous saucepan out of the cupboard and placed it on the kitchen table george came the shrill voice from the next room what are you doing nothing grandma he called out you neednt think i cant hear you just because you closed the door youre rattling the saucepans im just tidying the kitchen grandma then there was silence george had absolutely no doubts whatsoever about how he was going to make his famous medicine he wasnt going to fool about wondering whether to put in a little bit of this or a little bit of that quite simply he was going to put in everything he could find there would be no messing about no hesitating no wondering whether a particular thing would knock the old girl sideways or not the rule would be this whatever he saw if it was runny or powdery or gooey in it went nobody had ever made a medicine like that before if it didnt actually cure grandma then it would anyway cause some exciting results it would be worth watching george decided to work his way round the various rooms one at a time and see what they had to offer he would go first to the bathroom there are always lots of funny things in a bathroom so upstairs he went carrying the enormous twohandled saucepan before him in the bathroom he gazed longingly at the famous and dreaded medicine cupboard but he didnt go near it it was the only thing in the entire house he was forbidden to touch he had made solemn promises to his parents about this and he wasnt going to break them there were things in there they had told him that could actually kill a person and although he was out to give grandma a pretty fiery mouthful he didnt really want a dead body on his hands george put the saucepan on the floor and went to work number one was a bottle labelled golden gloss hair shampoo he emptied it into the pan that ought to wash her tummy nice and clean he said he took a full tube of toothpaste and squeezed out the whole lot of it in one long worm maybe that will brighten up those horrid brown teeth of hers he said there was an aerosol can of superfoam shaving soap belonging to his father george loved playing with aerosols he pressed the button and kept his finger on it until there was nothing left a wonderful mountain of white foam built up in the giant saucepan with his fingers he scooped out the contents of a jar of vitamin enriched face cream in went a small bottle of scarlet nail varnish if the toothpaste doesnt clean her teeth george said then this will paint them as red as roses he found another jar of creamy stuff labelled hair remover smear it on your legs it said and allow to remain for five minutes george tipped it all into the saucepan there was a bottle with yellow stuff inside it called dishworths famous dandruff cure in it went there was something called brillident for cleaning false teeth it was a white powder in that went too he found another aerosol can nevermore ponking deodorant spray guaranteed it said to keep away unpleasant body smells for a whole day she could use plenty of that george said as he sprayed the entire canful into the saucepan liquid paraffin the next one was called it was a big bottle he hadnt the faintest idea what it did to you but he poured it in anyway that he thought looking around him was about all from the bathroom on his mothers dressingtable in the bedroom george found yet another lovely aerosol can it was called helgas hairset hold twelve inches away from the hair and spray lightly he squirted the whole lot into the saucepan he did enjoy squirting these aerosols there was a bottle of perfume called flowers of turnips it smelled of old cheese in it went and in too went a large round box of powder it was called pink plaster there was a powderpuff on top and he threw that in as well for luck he found a couple of lipsticks he pulled the greasy red things out of their little cases and added them to the mixture the bedroom had nothing more to offer so george carried the enormous saucepan downstairs again and trotted into the laundryroom where the shelves were full of all kinds of household items the first one he took down was a large box of superwhite for automatic washingmachines dirt it said will disappear like magic george didnt know whether grandma was automatic or not but she was certainly a dirty old woman so shed better have it all he said tipping in the whole boxful then there was a big tin of waxwell floor polish it removes filth and foul messes from your floor and leaves everything shiny bright it said george scooped the orangecoloured waxy stuff out of the tin and plonked it into the pan there was a round cardboard carton labelled flea powder for dogs keep well away from the dogs food it said because this powder if eaten will make the dog explode good said george pouring it all into the saucepan he found a box of canary seed on the shelf perhaps itll make the old bird sing he said and in it went next george explored the box with shoecleaning materials brushes and tins and dusters well now he thought grandmas medicine is brown so my medicine must also be brown or shell smell a rat the way to colour it he decided would be with brown shoepolish the large tin he chose was labelled dark tan splendid he scooped it all out with an old spoon and plopped it into the pan he would stir it up later on his way back to the kitchen george saw a bottle of gin standing on the sideboard grandma was very fond of gin she was allowed to have a small nip of it every evening now he would give her a treat he would pour in the whole bottle he did back in the kitchen george put the huge saucepan on the table and went over to the cupboard that served as a larder the shelves were bulging with bottles and jars of every sort he chose the following and emptied them one by one into the saucepan a tin of curry powder a tin of mustard powder a bottle of extra hot chilli sauce a tin of black peppercorns a bottle of horseradish sauce there he said aloud that should do it george came the screechy voice from the next room who are you talking to in there what are you up to nothing grandma absolutely nothing he called back is it time for my medicine yet no grandma not for about half an hour well just see you dont forget it i wont grandma george answered i promise i wont animal pills at this point george suddenly had an extra good wheeze although the medicine cupboard in the house was forbidden ground what about the medicines his father kept on the shelf in the shed next to the henhouse the animal medicines what about those nobody had ever told him he mustnt touch them lets face it george said to himself hairspray and shavingcream and shoepolish are all very well and they will no doubt cause some splendid explosions inside the old geezer but what the magic mixture now needs is a touch of the real stuff real pills and real tonics to give it punch and muscle george picked up the heavy threequarters full saucepan and carried it out of the back door he crossed the farmyard and headed straight for the shed alongside the henhouse he knew his father wouldnt be there he was out haymaking in one of the meadows george entered the dusty old shed and put the saucepan on the bench then he looked up at the medicine shelf there were five big bottles there two were full of pills two were full of runny stuff and one was full of powder ill use them all george said grandma needs them boy does she need them the first bottle he took down contained an orangecoloured powder the label said for chickens with foul pest hen gripe sore beaks gammy legs cockerelitis egg trouble broodiness or loss of feathers mix one spoonful only with each bucket of feed well george said aloud to himself as he tipped in the whole bottleful the old bird wont be losing any feathers after shes had a dose of this the next bottle he took down had about five hundred gigantic purple pills in it for horses with hoarse throats it said on the label the hoarsethroated horse should suck one pill twice a day grandma may not have a hoarse throat george said but shes certainly got a sharp tongue maybe theyll cure that instead into the saucepan went the five hundred gigantic purple pills then there was a bottle of thick yellowish liquid for cows bulls and bullocks the label said will cure cow pox cow mange crumpled horns bad breath in bulls earache toothache headache hoofache tailache and sore udders that grumpy old cow in the livingroom has every one of those rotten illnesses george said shell need it all with a slop and a gurgle the yellow liquid splashed into the now nearly full saucepan the next bottle contained a brilliant red liquid sheepdip it said on the label for sheep with sheeprot and for getting rid of ticks and fleas mix one spoonful in one gallon of water and slosh it over the sheep caution do not make the mixture any stronger or the wool will fall out and the animal will be naked by gum said george how id love to walk in and slosh it all over old grandma and watch the ticks and fleas go jumping off her but i cant i mustnt so shell have to drink it instead he poured the bright red medicine into the saucepan the last bottle on the shelf was full of pale green pills pig pills the label announced for pigs with pork prickles tender trotters bristle blight and swine sickness give one pill per day in severe cases two pills may be given but more than that will make the pig rock and roll just the stuff said george for that miserable old pig back there in the house shell need a very big dose he tipped all the green pills hundreds and hundreds of them into the saucepan there was an old stick lying on the bench that had been used for stirring paint george picked it up and started to stir his marvellous concoction the mixture was as thick as cream and as he stirred and stirred many wonderful colours rose up from the depths and blended together pinks blues greens yellows and browns george went on stirring until it was all well mixed but even so there were still hundreds of pills lying on the bottom that hadnt melted and there was his mothers splendid powderpuff floating on the surface i shall have to boil it all up george said one good quick boil on the stove is all it needs and with that he staggered back towards the house with the enormous heavy saucepan on the way he passed the garage so he went in to see if he could find any other interesting things he added the following half a pint of engine oil to keep grandmas engine going smoothly some antifreeze to keep her radiator from freezing up in winter a handful of grease to grease her creaking joints then back to the kitchen the cookup in the kitchen george put the saucepan on the stove and turned up the gas flame underneath it as high as it would go george came the awful voice from the next room its time for my medicine not yet grandma george called back theres still twenty minutes before eleven oclock what mischief are you up to in there now granny screeched i hear noises george thought it best not to answer this one he found a long wooden spoon in a kitchen drawer and began stirring hard the stuff in the pot got hotter and hotter soon the marvellous mixture began to froth and foam a rich blue smoke the colour of peacocks rose from the surface of the liquid and a fiery fearsome smell filled the kitchen it made george choke and splutter it was a smell unlike any he had smelled before it was a brutal and bewitching smell spicy and staggering fierce and frenzied full of wizardry and magic whenever he got a whiff of it up his nose firecrackers went off in his skull and electric prickles ran along the backs of his legs it was wonderful to stand there stirring this amazing mixture and to watch it smoking blue and bubbling and frothing and foaming as though it were alive at one point he could have sworn he saw bright sparks flashing in the swirling foam and suddenly george found himself dancing around the steaming pot chanting strange words that came into his head out of nowhere fiery broth and witchs brew foamy froth and riches blue fume and spume and spoondrift spray fizzle swizzle shout hooray watch it sloshing swashing sploshing hear it hissing squishing spissing grandma better start to pray brown paint george turned off the heat under the saucepan he must leave plenty of time for it to cool down when all the steam and froth had gone away he peered into the giant pan to see what colour the great medicine now was it was a deep and brilliant blue it needs more brown in it george said it simply must be brown or shell get suspicious george ran outside and dashed into his fathers toolshed where all the paints were kept there was a row of cans on the shelf all colours black green red pink white and brown he reached for the can of brown the label said simply dark brown gloss paint one quart he took a screwdriver and prised off the lid the can was threequarters full he rushed it back to the kitchen he poured the whole lot into the saucepan the saucepan was now full to the brim very gently george stirred the paint into the mixture with the long wooden spoon ahha it was all turning brown a lovely rich creamy brown wheres that medicine of mine boy came the voice from the livingroom youre forgetting me youre doing it on purpose i shall tell your mother im not forgetting you grandma george called back im thinking of you all the time but there are still ten minutes to go youre a nasty little maggot the voice screeched back youre a lazy and disobedient little worm and youre growing too fast george fetched the bottle of grandmas real medicine from the sideboard he took out the cork and tipped it all down the sink he then filled the bottle with his own magic mixture by dipping a small jug into the saucepan and using it as a pourer he replaced the cork had it cooled down enough yet not quite he held the bottle under the cold tap for a couple of minutes the label came off in the wet but that didnt matter he dried the bottle with a dishcloth all was now ready this was it the great moment had arrived medicine time grandma he called out i should hope so too came the grumpy reply the silver tablespoon in which the medicine was always given lay ready on the kitchen sideboard george picked it up holding the spoon in one hand and the bottle in the other he advanced into the livingroom grandma gets the medicine grandma sat hunched in her chair by the window the wicked little eyes followed george closely as he crossed the room towards her youre late she snapped i dont think i am grandma dont interrupt me in the middle of a sentence she shouted but youd finished your sentence grandma there you go again she cried always interrupting and arguing you really are a tiresome little boy whats the time its exactly eleven oclock grandma youre lying as usual stop talking so much and give me my medicine shake the bottle first then pour it into the spoon and make sure its a whole spoonful are you going to gulp it all down in one go george asked her or will you sip it what i do is none of your business the old woman said fill the spoon as george removed the cork and began very slowly to pour the thick brown stuff into the spoon he couldnt help thinking back upon all the mad and marvellous things that had gone into the making of this crazy stuff the shaving soap the hair remover the dandruff cure the automatic washingmachine powder the flea powder for dogs the shoe polish the black pepper the horseradish sauce and all the rest of them not to mention the powerful animal pills and powders and liquids and the brown paint open your mouth wide grandma he said and ill pop it in the old hag opened her small wrinkled mouth showing disgusting pale brown teeth here we go george cried out swallow it down he pushed the spoon well into her mouth and tipped the mixture down her throat then he stepped back to watch the result it was worth watching grandma yelled oweeeee and her whole body shot up whoosh into the air it was exactly as though someone had pushed an electric wire through the underneath of her chair and switched on the current up she went like a jackinthebox and she didnt come down she stayed there suspended in mid air about two feet up still in a sitting position but rigid now frozen quivering the eyes bulging the hair standing straight up on end is something wrong grandma george asked her politely are you all right suspended up there in space the old girl was beyond speaking the shock that georges marvellous mixture had given her must have been tremendous youd have thought shed swallowed a redhot poker the way she took off from that chair then down she came again with a plop back into her seat call the fire brigade she shouted suddenly my stomachs on fire its just the medicine grandma george said its good strong stuff fire the old woman yelled fire in the basement get a bucket man the hoses do something quick cool it grandma george said but he got a bit of a shock when he saw the smoke coming out of her mouth and out of her nostrils clouds of black smoke were coming out of her nose and blowing around the room by golly you really are on fire george said of course im on fire she yelled ill be burned to a crisp ill be fried to a frizzle ill be boiled like a beetroot george ran into the kitchen and came back with a jug of water open your mouth grandma he cried he could hardly see her for the smoke but he managed to pour half a jugful down her throat a sizzling sound the kind you get if you hold a hot fryingpan under a cold tap came up from deep down in grandmas stomach the old hag bucked and shied and snorted she gasped and gurgled spouts of water came shooting out of her and the smoke cleared away the fires out george announced proudly youll be all right now grandma all right she yelled whos all right theres jackyjumpers in my tummy theres squigglers in my belly theres bangers in my bottom she began bouncing up and down in the chair quite obviously she was not very comfortable youll find its doing you a lot of good that medicine grandma george said good she screamed doing me good its killing me then she began to bulge she was swelling she was puffing up all over someone was pumping her up thats how it looked was she going to explode her face was turning from purple to green but wait she had a puncture somewhere george could hear the hiss of escaping air she stopped swelling she was going down she was slowly getting thinner again shrinking back and back slowly to her shrivelly old self hows things grandma george said no answer then a funny thing happened grandmas body gave a sudden sharp twist and a sudden sharp jerk and she flipped herself clear out of the chair and landed neatly on her two feet on the carpet thats terrific grandma george cried you havent stood up like that for years look at you youre standing up all on your own and youre not even using a stick grandma didnt even hear him the frozen popeyed look was back with her again now she was miles away in another world marvellous medicine george told himself he found it fascinating to stand there watching what it was doing to the old hag what next he wondered he soon found out suddenly she began to grow it was quite slow at first just a very gradual inching upwards up up up inch by inch getting taller and taller about an inch every few seconds and in the beginning george didnt notice it but when she had passed the five foot six mark and was going on up towards being six feet tall george gave a jump and shouted hey grandma youre growing youre going up hang on grandma youd better stop now or youll be hitting the ceiling but grandma didnt stop it was a truly fantastic sight this ancient scrawny old woman getting taller and taller longer and longer thinner and thinner as though she were a piece of elastic being pulled upwards by invisible hands when the top of her head actually touched the ceiling george thought she was bound to stop but she didnt there was a sort of scrunching noise and bits of plaster and cement came raining down hadnt you better stop now grandma george said daddys just had this whole room repainted but there was no stopping her now soon her head and shoulders had completely disappeared through the ceiling and she was still going george dashed upstairs to his own bedroom and there she was coming up through the floor like a mushroom whoopee she shouted finding her voice at last hallelujah here i come steady on grandma george said with a heighnonnyno and up we go she shouted just watch me grow this is my room george said look at the mess youre making terrific medicine she cried give me some more shes dotty as a doughnut george thought come on boy give me some more she yelled dish it out im slowing down george was still clutching the medicine bottle in one hand and the spoon in the other oh well he thought why not he poured out a second dose and popped it into her mouth oweee she screamed and up she went again her feet were still on the floor downstairs in the livingroom but her head was moving quickly towards the ceiling of the bedroom im on my way now boy she called down to george just watch me go thats the attic above you grandma george called out id keep out of there its full of bugs and bogles crash the old girls head went through the ceiling as though it were butter george stood in his bedroom gazing at the shambles there was a big hole in the floor and another in the ceiling and sticking up like a post between the two was the middle part of grandma her legs were in the room below her head in the attic im still going came the old screechy voice from up above give me another dose my boy and lets go through the roof no grandma no george called back youre busting up the whole house to heck with the house she shouted i want some fresh air i havent been outside for twenty years by golly she is going through the roof george told himself he ran downstairs he rushed out of the back door into the yard it would be simply awful he thought if she bashed up the roof as well his father would be furious and he george would get the blame he had made the medicine he had given her too much dont come through the roof grandma he prayed please dont the brown hen george stood in the farmyard looking up at the roof the old farmhouse had a fine roof of pale red tiles and tall chimneys there was no sign of grandma there was only a songthrush sitting on one of the chimneypots singing a song the old wurzels got stuck in the attic george thought thank goodness for that suddenly a tile came clattering down from the roof and fell into the yard the songthrush took off fast and flew away then another tile came down then half a dozen more and then very slowly like some weird monster rising up from the deep grandmas head came through the roof then her scrawny neck and the tops of her shoulders howm i doing boy she shouted hows that for a bash up dont you think youd better stop now grandma george called out i have stopped she answered i feel terrific didnt i tell you i had magic powers didnt i warn you i had wizardry in the tips of my fingers but you wouldnt listen to me would you you wouldnt listen to your old grandma you didnt do it grandma george shouted back to her i did it i made you a new medicine a new medicine you what rubbish she yelled i did i did george shouted youre lying as usual grandma yelled youre always lying im not lying grandma i swear im not the wrinkled old face high up on the roof stared down suspiciously at george are you telling me you actually made a new medicine all by yourself she shouted yes grandma all by myself i dont believe you she answered but im very comfortable up here fetch me a cup of tea a brown hen was pecking about in the yard close to where george was standing the hen gave him an idea quickly he uncorked the medicine bottle and poured some of the brown stuff into the spoon watch this grandma he shouted he crouched down holding out the spoon to the hen chicken he said chickchickchicken come here have some of this chickens are stupid birds and very greedy they think everything is food this one thought the spoon was full of corn it hopped over it put its head on one side and looked at the spoon come on chicken george said good chicken chickchickchick the brown hen stretched out its neck towards the spoon and went peck it got a beakful of medicine the effect was electric oweee shrieked the hen and it shot straight up into the air like a rocket it went as high as the house then down it came again into the yard splosh and there it sat with its feathers all sticking straight out from its body there was a look of amazement on its silly face george stood watching it grandma up on the roof was watching it too the hen got to its feet it was rather shaky it was making funny gurgling noises in its throat its beak was opening and shutting it seemed like a pretty sick hen youve done it in you stupid boy grandma shouted that hens going to die your fatherll be after you now hell give you socks and serve you right all of a sudden black smoke started pouring out of the hens beak its on fire grandma yelled the hens on fire george ran to the watertrough to get a bucket of water that henll be roasted and ready for eating any moment grandma shouted george sloshed the bucket of water over the hen there was a sizzling sound and the smoke went away old hens laid its last egg grandma shouted hens dont do any laying after theyve been on fire now that the fire was out the hen seemed better it stood up properly it flapped its wings then it crouched down low to the ground as though getting ready to jump it did jump it jumped high in the air and turned a complete somersault then landed back on its feet its a circus hen grandma shouted from the rooftop its a flipping acrobat now the hen began to grow george had been waiting for this to happen its growing he yelled its growing grandma look its growing bigger and bigger taller and taller it grew soon the hen was four or five times its normal size can you see it grandma george shouted i can see it boy the old girl shouted back im watching it george was hopping about from one foot to the other with excitement pointing at the enormous hen and shouting its had the magic medicine grandma and its growing just like you did but there was a difference between the way the hen was growing and the way grandma grew when grandma grew taller and taller she got thinner and thinner the hen didnt it stayed nice and plump all along soon it was taller than george but it didnt stop there it went right on growing until it was about as big as a horse then it stopped doesnt it look marvellous grandma george shouted its not as tall as me grandma sang out compared with me that hen is titchy small i am the tallest of them all the pig the bullocks the sheep the pony and the nannygoat at that moment georges mother came back from shopping in the village she drove her car into the yard and got out she was carrying a bottle of milk in one hand and a bag of groceries in the other the first thing she saw was the gigantic brown hen towering over little george she dropped the bottle of milk then grandma started shouting at her from the rooftop and when she looked up and saw grandmas head sticking up through the tiles she dropped the bag of groceries how about that then eh mary grandma shouted ill bet youve never seen a hen as big as that thats georges giant hen that is but but but stammered georges mother its georges magic medicine grandma shouted weve both of us had it the hen and i but how in the world did you get up on the roof cried the mother i didnt cackled the old woman my feet are still standing on the floor in the livingroom this was too much for georges mother to understand she just goggled and gaped she looked as though she was going to faint a second later georges father appeared his name was mr killy kranky mr kranky was a small man with bandy legs and a huge head he was a kind father to george but he was not an easy person to live with because even the smallest things got him all worked up and excited the hen standing in the yard was certainly not a small thing and when mr kranky saw it he started jumping about as though something was burning his feet great heavens he cried waving his arms whats this whats happened where did it come from its a giant hen who did it i did george said look at me grandma shouted from the rooftop never mind about the hen what about me mr kranky looked up and saw grandma shut up grandma he said it didnt seem to surprise him that the old girl was sticking up through the roof it was the hen that excited him he had never seen anything like it but then who had its fantastic mr kranky shouted dancing round and round its colossal its gigantic its tremendous its a miracle how did you do it george george started telling his father about the magic medicine while he was doing this the big brown hen sat down in the middle of the yard and went cluckcluckcluck cluckcluckcluckcluckcluck everyone stared at it when it stood up again there was a brown egg lying there the egg was the size of a football that egg would make scrambled eggs for twenty people mrs kranky said george mr kranky shouted how much of this medicine have you got lots george said theres a big saucepanful in the kitchen and this bottle heres nearly full come with me mr kranky yelled grabbing george by the arm bring the medicine for years and years ive been trying to breed bigger and bigger animals bigger bulls for beef bigger pigs for pork bigger sheep for mutton they went to the pigsty first george gave a spoonful of medicine to the pig the pig blew smoke from its nose and jumped about all over the place then it grew and grew in the end it looked like this they went to the herd of fine black bullocks that mr kranky was trying to fatten for the market george gave each of them some medicine and this is what happened then the sheep he gave some to his grey pony jack frost and finally just for fun he gave some to alma the nannygoat a crane for grandma grandma from high up on the rooftop could see everything that was going on and she didnt like what she saw she wanted to be the centre of attention and nobody was taking the slightest notice of her george and mr kranky were running round and getting excited about the enormous animals mrs kranky was washing up in the kitchen and grandma was all alone on the rooftop hey you she yelled george get me a cup of tea this minute you idle little beast dont listen to the old goat mr kranky said shes stuck where she is and a good thing too but we cant leave her up there dad george said what if it rains george grandma yelled oh you horrible little boy you disgusting little worm fetch me a cup of tea at once and a slice of currant cake well have to get her out dad george said she wont give us any peace if we dont mrs kranky came outside and she agreed with george shes my own mother she said shes a pain in the neck mr kranky said i dont care mrs kranky said im not leaving my own mother sticking up through the roof for the rest of her life so in the end mr kranky telephoned the crane company and asked them to send their biggest crane out to the house at once the crane arrived one hour later it was on wheels and there were two men inside it the crane men climbed up on to the roof and put ropes under grandmas arms then she was lifted right up through the roof in a way the medicine had done grandma good it had not made her any less grumpy or badtempered but it seemed to have cured all her aches and pains and she was suddenly as frisky as a ferret as soon as the crane had lowered her to the ground she ran over to georges huge pony jack frost and jumped on to his back this ancient old hag who was now as tall as a house then galloped about the farm on the gigantic pony jumping over trees and sheds and shouting out of my way clear the decks stand back all you miserable midgets or ill trample you to death and other silly things like that but because grandma was now much too tall to get back into the house she had to sleep that night in the haybarn with the mice and the rats mr krankys great idea the next day georges father came down to breakfast in a state of greater excitement than ever ive been awake all night thinking about it he cried about what dad george asked him about your marvellous medicine of course we cant stop now my boy we must start making more of it at once more and more and more the giant saucepan had been completely emptied the day before because there had been so many sheep and pigs and cows and bullocks to be dosed but why do we need more dad george asked weve done all our own animals and weve made grandma feel as frisky as a ferret even though she does have to sleep in the barn my dear boy cried mr killy kranky we need barrels and barrels of it tons and tons then we will sell it to every farmer in the world so that all of them can have giant animals we will build a marvellous medicine factory and sell the stuff in bottles at five pounds a time we will become rich and you will become famous but wait a minute dad george said theres no waiting cried mr kranky working himself up so much that he put butter in his coffee and milk on his toast dont you understand what this tremendous invention of yours is going to do to the world nobody will ever go hungry again why wont they asked george because one giant cow will give fifty buckets of milk a day cried mr kranky waving his arms one giant chicken will make a hundred fried chicken dinners and one giant pig will give you a thousand pork chops its tremendous my dear boy its fantastic itll change the world but wait a minute dad george said again dont keep saying wait a minute shouted mr kranky there isnt a minute to wait we must get cracking at once do calm down my dear mrs kranky said from the other end of the table and stop putting marmalade on your cornflakes the heck with my cornflakes cried mr kranky leaping up from his chair come on george lets get going and the first thing well do is to make one more saucepanful as a tester but dad said little george the trouble is there wont be any trouble my boy cried mr kranky how can there possibly be any trouble all youve got to do is put the same stuff into the saucepan as you did yesterday and while youre doing it ill write down each and every item thats how well get the magic recipe but dad george said please listen to me why dont you listen to him mrs kranky said the boys trying to tell you something but mr kranky was too excited to listen to anyone except himself and then he cried when the new mixture is ready well test it out on an old hen just to make absolutely sure weve got it right and after that well all shout hooray and build the giant factory but dad come on then what is it you want to say i cant possibly remember all the hundreds of things i put into the saucepan to make the medicine george said of course you can my dear boy cried mr kranky ill help you ill jog your memory youll get it in the end you see if you dont now then what was the very first thing you put in i went up to the bathroom first george said i used a lot of things in the bathroom and on mummys dressingtable come on then cried mr killy kranky up we go to the bathroom when they got there they found of course a whole lot of empty tubes and empty aerosols and empty bottles thats great said mr kranky that tells us exactly what you used if anything is empty it means you used it so mr kranky started making a list of everything that was empty in the bathroom then they went to mrs krankys dressingtable a box of powder said mr kranky writing it down helgas hairset flowers of turnips perfume terrific this is going to be easy where did you go next to the laundryroom george said but are you sure you havent missed anything out up here dad thats up to you my boy mr kranky said have i i dont think so george said so down they went to the laundryroom and once again mr kranky wrote down the names of all the empty bottles and cans my goodness me what a mass of stuff you used he cried no wonder it did magic things is that the lot no dad its not george said and he led his father out to the shed where the animal medicines were kept and showed him the five big empty bottles up on the shelf mr kranky wrote down all their names anything else mr kranky asked little george scratched his head and thought and thought but he couldnt remember having put anything else in mr killy kranky leapt into his car and drove down to the village and bought new bottles and tubes and cans of everything on his list he then went to the vet and got a fresh supply of all the animal medicines george had used now show me how you did it george he said come along show me exactly how you mixed them all together marvellous medicine number two they were in the kitchen now and the big saucepan was on the stove all the things mr kranky had bought were lined up near the sink come along my boy cried mr killy kranky which one did you put in first this one george said goldengloss hair shampoo he emptied the bottle into the pan now the toothpaste george went on and the shaving soap and the face cream and the nail varnish keep at it my boy cried mr kranky dancing round the kitchen keep putting them in dont stop dont pause dont hesitate its a pleasure my dear fellow to watch you work one by one george poured and squeezed the things into the saucepan with everything so close at hand the whole job didnt take him more than ten minutes but when it was all done the saucepan didnt somehow seem to be quite as full as it had been the first time now what did you do cried mr kranky did you stir it i boiled it george said but not for long and i stirred it as well so mr kranky lit the gas under the saucepan and george stirred the mixture with the same long wooden spoon he had used before its not brown enough george said wait a minute i know what ive forgotten what cried mr kranky tell me quick because if weve forgotten even one tiny thing then it wont work at least not in the same way a quart of brown gloss paint george said thats what ive forgotten mr killy kranky shot out of the house and into his car like a rocket he sped down to the village and bought the paint and rushed back again he opened the can in the kitchen and handed it to george george poured the paint into the saucepan ahha thats better george said thats more like the right colour its boiling cried mr kranky its boiling and bubbling george is it ready yet its ready george said at least i hope it is right shouted mr kranky hopping about lets test it lets give some to a chicken my heavens alive why dont you calm down a bit mrs kranky said coming into the kitchen calm down cried mr kranky you expect me to calm down and here we are mixing up the greatest medicine ever discovered in the history of the world come along george dip a cupful out of the saucepan and get a spoon and well give some to a chicken just to make absolutely certain weve got the correct mixture outside in the yard there were several chickens that hadnt had any of georges marvellous medicine number one they were pecking about in the dirt in that silly way chickens do george crouched down holding out a spoonful of marvellous medicine number two come on chicken he said good chicken chickchickchick a white chicken with black specks on its feathers looked up at george it walked over to the spoon and went peck the effect that medicine number two had on this chicken was not quite the same as the effect produced by medicine number one but it was very interesting whooosh shrieked the chicken and it shot six feet up in the air and came down again then sparks came flying out of its beak bright yellow sparks of fire as though someone was sharpening a knife on a grindstone inside its tummy then its legs began to grow longer its body stayed the same size but the two thin yellow legs got longer and longer and longer and longer still whats happening to it cried mr killy kranky somethings wrong george said the legs went on growing and the more they grew the higher up into the air went the chickens body when the legs were about fifteen feet long they stopped growing the chicken looked perfectly absurd with its long long legs and its ordinary little body perched high up on top it was like a chicken on stilts oh my sainted aunts cried mr killy kranky weve got it wrong this chickens no good to anybody its all legs no one wants chickens legs i must have left something out george said i know you left something out cried mr kranky think boy think what was it you left out ive got it said george what was it quick flea powder for dogs george said you mean you put flea powder in the first one yes dad i did a whole carton of it then thats the answer wait a minute said george did we have brown shoe polish on our list we did not said mr kranky i used that too said george well no wonder it went wrong said mr kranky he was already running to his car and soon he was heading down the village to buy more flea powder and more shoe polish marvellous medicine number three here it is cried mr killy kranky rushing into the kitchen one carton of flea powder for dogs and one tin of brown shoepolish george poured the flea powder into the giant saucepan then he scooped the shoepolish out of its tin and added that as well stir it up george shouted mr kranky give it another boil weve got it this time ill bet weve got it after marvellous medicine number three had been boiled and stirred george took a cupful of it out into the yard to try it on another chicken mr kranky ran after him flapping his arms and hopping with excitement come and watch this one he called out to mrs kranky come and watch us turning an ordinary chicken into a lovely great big one that lays eggs as large as footballs i hope you do better than last time said mrs kranky following them out come on chicken said george holding out a spoonful of medicine number three good chicken chickchickchickchickchick have some of this lovely medicine a magnificent black cockerel with a scarlet comb came stepping over the cockerel looked at the spoon and it went peck cockadoodledo squawked the cockerel shooting up into the air and coming down again watch him now cried mr kranky watch him grow any moment hes going to start getting bigger and bigger mr killy kranky mrs kranky and little george stood in the yard staring at the black cockerel the cockerel stood quite still it looked as though it had a headache whats happening to its neck mrs kranky said its getting longer george said ill say its getting longer mrs kranky said mr kranky for once said nothing last time it was the legs mrs kranky said now its the neck who wants a chicken with a long neck you cant eat a chickens neck it was an extraordinary sight the cockerels body hadnt grown at all but the neck was now about six feet long all right george mr kranky said what else have you forgotten i dont know george said oh yes you do mr kranky said come along boy think theres probably just one vital thing missing and youve got to remember it i put in some engine oil from the garage george said did you have that on your list eureka cried mr kranky thats the answer how much did you put in half a pint george said mr kranky ran to the garage and found another half pint of oil and some antifreeze george called after him i sloshed in a bit of antifreeze marvellous medicine number four back in the kitchen once again george with mr kranky watching him anxiously tipped half a pint of engine oil and some antifreeze into the giant saucepan boil it up again cried mr kranky boil it and stir it george boiled it and stirred it youll never get it right said mrs kranky dont forget you dont just have to have the same things but youve got to have exactly the same amounts of those things and how can you possibly do that you keep out of this cried mr kranky were doing fine weve got it this time you see if we havent this was georges marvellous medicine number four and when it had boiled for a couple of minutes george once again carried a cupful of it out into the yard mr kranky ran after him mrs kranky followed more slowly youre going to have some mighty queer chickens around here if you go on like this she said dish it out george cried mr kranky give a spoonful to that one over there he pointed to a brown hen george knelt down and held out the spoon with the new medicine in it chickchick he said try some of this the brown hen walked over and looked at the spoon then it went peck owch it said then a funny whistling noise came out of its beak watch it grow shouted mr kranky dont be too sure said mrs kranky why is it whistling like that keep quiet woman cried mr kranky give it a chance they stood there staring at the brown hen its getting smaller george said look at it dad its shrinking and indeed it was in less than a minute the hen had shrunk so much it was no bigger than a newhatched chick it looked ridiculous goodbye grandma theres still something youve left out mr kranky said i cant think what it could be george said give it up mrs kranky said pack it in youll never get it right mr kranky looked very forlorn george looked pretty fed up too he was still kneeling on the ground with the spoon in one hand and the cup full of medicine in the other the ridiculous tiny brown hen was walking slowly away at that point grandma came striding into the yard from her enormous height she glared down at the three people below her and she shouted whats going on around here why hasnt anyone brought me my morning cup of tea its bad enough having to sleep in the yard with the rats and mice but ill be blowed if im going to starve as well no tea no eggs and bacon no buttered toast im sorry mother mrs kranky said weve been terribly busy ill get you something right away let george get it the lazy little brute grandma shouted just then the old woman spotted the cup in georges hand she bent down and peered into it she saw that it was full of brown liquid it looked very much like tea hoho she cried haha so thats your little game is it you look after yourself all right dont you you make quite sure youve got a nice cup of morning tea but you didnt think to bring one to your poor old grandma i always knew you were a selfish pig no grandma george said this isnt dont lie to me boy the enormous old hag shouted pass it up here this minute no cried mrs kranky no mother dont thats not for you now youre against me too shouted grandma my own daughter trying to stop me having my breakfast trying to starve me out mr kranky looked up at the horrid old woman and he smiled sweetly of course its for you grandma he said you take it and drink it while its nice and hot dont think i wont grandma said bending down from her great height and reaching out a huge horny hand for the cup hand it over george no no grandma george cried out pulling the cup away you mustnt youre not to have it give it to me boy yelled grandma dont cried mrs kranky thats georges marvellous everythings georges round here shouted grandma georges this georges that im fed up with it she snatched the cup out of little georges hand and carried it high up out of reach drink it up grandma mr kranky said grinning hugely lovely tea no the other two cried no no no but it was too late the ancient beanpole had already put the cup to her lips and in one gulp she swallowed everything that was in it mother wailed mrs kranky youve just drunk fifty doses of georges marvellous medicine number four and look what one tiny spoonful did to that little old brown hen but grandma didnt even hear her great clouds of steam were already pouring out of her mouth and she was beginning to whistle this is going to be interesting mr kranky said still grinning now youve done it cried mrs kranky glaring at her husband youve cooked the old girls goose i didnt do anything mr kranky said oh yes you did you told her to drink it a tremendous hissing sound was coming from above their heads steam was shooting out of grandmas mouth and nose and ears and whistling as it came shell feel better after shes let off a bit of steam mr kranky said shes going to blow up mrs kranky wailed her boilers going to burst stand clear mr kranky said george was quite alarmed he stood up and ran back a few paces the jets of white steam kept squirting out of the skinny old hags head and the whistling was so high and shrill it hurt the ears call the firebrigade cried mrs kranky call the police man the hosepipes too late said mr kranky looking pleased grandma shrieked mrs kranky mother run to the drinkingtrough and put your head under the water but even as she spoke the whistling suddenly stopped and the steam disappeared that was when grandma began to get smaller she had started off with her head as high as the roof of the house but now she was coming down fast watch this george mr kranky shouted hopping around the yard and flapping his arms watch what happens when someones had fifty spoonfuls instead of one very soon grandma was back to normal height stop cried mrs kranky thats just right but she didnt stop smaller and smaller she got down and down she went in another half minute she was no bigger than a bottle of lemonade how dyou feel mother asked mrs kranky anxiously grandmas tiny face still bore the same foul and furious expression it had always had her eyes no bigger now than little keyholes were blazing with anger how do i feel she yelled how dyou think i feel how would you feel if youd been a glorious giant a minute ago and suddenly youre a miserable midget shes still going shouted mr kranky gleefully shes still getting smaller and by golly she was when she was no bigger than a cigarette mrs kranky made a grab for her she held her in her hands and she cried how do i stop her getting smaller still you cant said mr kranky shes had fifty times the right amount i must stop her mrs kranky wailed i can hardly see her as it is catch hold of each end and pull mr kranky said by then grandma was the size of a matchstick and still shrinking fast a moment later she was no bigger than a pin then a pumpkin seed then then where is she cried mrs kranky ive lost her hooray said mr kranky shes gone shes disappeared completely cried mrs kranky thats what happens to you if youre grumpy and badtempered said mr kranky great medicine of yours george george didnt know what to think for a few minutes mrs kranky kept wandering round with a puzzled look on her face saying mother where are you whereve you gone whereve you got to how can i find you but she calmed down quite quickly and by lunchtime she was saying ah well i suppose its all for the best really she was a bit of a nuisance around the house wasnt she yes mr kranky said she most certainly was george didnt say a word he felt quite trembly he knew something tremendous
