 edith wharton madame de treymes i john durham while he waited for madame de malrive to draw on her gloves stood in the hotel doorway looking out across the rue de rivoli at the afternoon brightness of the tuileries gardens his european visits were infrequent enough to have kept unimpaired the freshness of his eye and he was always struck anew by the vast and consummately ordered spectacle of paris by its look of having been boldly and deliberately planned as a background for the enjoyment of life instead of being forced into grudging concessions to the festive instincts or barricading itself against them in unenlightened ugliness like his own lamentable new york but today if the scene had never presented itself more alluringly in that moist spring bloom between showers when the horsechestnuts dome themselves in unreal green against a gauzy sky and the very dust of the pavement seems the fragrance of lilac made visible today for the first time the sense of a personal stake in it all of having to reckon individually with its effects and influences kept durham from an unrestrained yielding to the spell paris might still be to the unimplicated it doubtless still was the most beautiful city in the world but whether it were the most lovable or the most detestable depended for him in the last analysis on the buttoning of the white glove over which fanny de malrive still lingered the mere fact of her having forgotten to draw on her gloves as they were descending in the hotel lift from his mothers drawingroom was in this connection charged with significance to durham she was the kind of woman who always presents herself to the minds eye as completely equipped as made up of exquisitely cared for and finelyrelated details and that the heat of her parting with his family should have left her unconscious that she was emerging gloveless into paris seemed on the whole to speak hopefully for durhams future opinion of the city even now he could detect a certain confusion a desire to draw breath and catch up with life in the way she dawdled over the last buttons in the dimness of the portecochere while her footman outside hung on her retarded signal when at length they emerged it was to learn from that functionary that madame la marquises carriage had been obliged to yield its place at the door but was at the moment in the act of regaining it madame de malrive cut the explanation short i shall walk home the carriage this evening at eight as the footman turned away she raised her eyes for the first time to durhams will you walk with me let us cross the tuileries i should like to sit a moment on the terrace she spoke quite easily and naturally as if it were the most commonplace thing in the world for them to be straying afoot together over paris but even his vague knowledge of the world she lived in a knowledge mainly acquired through the perusal of yellowbacked fiction gave a thrilling significance to her naturalness durham indeed was beginning to find that one of the charms of a sophisticated society is that it lends point and perspective to the slightest contact between the sexes if in the old unrestricted new york days fanny frisbee from a brown stone doorstep had proposed that they should take a walk in the park the idea would have presented itself to her companion as agreeable but unimportant whereas fanny de malrives suggestion that they should stroll across the tuileries was obviously fraught with unspecified possibilities he was so throbbing with the sense of these possibilities that he walked beside her without speaking down the length of the wide alley which follows the line of the rue de rivoli suffering her even when they reached its farthest end to direct him in silence up the steps to the terrace of the feuillants for after all the possibilities were doublefaced and her bold departure from custom might simply mean that what she had to say was so dreadful that it needed all the tenderest mitigation of circumstance there was apparently nothing embarrassing to her in his silence it was a part of her long european discipline that she had learned to manage pauses with ease in her frisbee days she might have packed this one with a random fluency now she was content to let it widen slowly before them like the spacious prospect opening at their feet the complicated beauty of this prospect as they moved toward it between the symmetrically clipped limes of the lateral terrace touched him anew through her nearness as with the hint of some vast impersonal power controlling and regulating her life in ways he could not guess putting between himself and her the whole width of the civilization into which her marriage had absorbed her and there was such fear in the thought he read such derision of what he had to offer in the splendour of the great avenues tapering upward to the sunset glories of the arch that all he had meant to say when he finally spoke compressed itself at last into an abrupt unmitigated well she answered at once as though she had only awaited the call of the national interrogation i dont know when i have been so happy so happy the suddenness of his joy flushed up through his fair skin as i was just now taking tea with your mother and sisters durhams oh of surprise betrayed also a note of disillusionment which she met only by the reconciling murmur shall we sit down he found two of the springy yellow chairs indigenous to the spot and placed them under the tree near which they had paused saying reluctantly as he did so of course it was an immense pleasure to them to see you again oh not in the same way i mean she paused sinking into the chair and betraying for the first time a momentary inability to deal becomingly with the situation i mean she resumed smiling that it was not an event for them as it was for me an event he caught her up again eagerly for what in the language of any civilization could that word mean but just the one thing he most wished it to to be with dear good sweet simple real americans again she burst out heaping up her epithets with reckless prodigality durhams smile once more faded to impersonality as he rejoined just a shade on the defensive if its merely our americanism you enjoyed ive no doubt we can give you all you want in that line yes its just that but if you knew what the word means to me it means it means she paused as if to assure herself that they were sufficiently isolated from the desultory groups beneath the other trees it means that im safe with them as safe as in a bank durham felt a sudden warmth behind his eyes and in his throat i think i do know no you dont really you cant know how dear and strange and familiar it all sounded the old new york names that kept coming up in your mothers talk and her charming quaint ideas about europe their all regarding it as a great big innocent pleasure ground and shop for americans and your mothers missing the homemade bread and preferring the american asparagus im so tired of americans who despise even their own asparagus and then your married sisters spending her summers at where is it the kittawittany house on lake pohunk a vision of earnest women in shetland shawls with spectacles and thin knobs of hair eating blueberry pie at unwholesome hours in a shingled diningroom on a bare new england hilltop rose pallidly between durham and the verdant brightness of the champs elysees and he protested with a slight smile oh but my married sister is the black sheep of the family the rest of us never sank as low as that low i think its beautiful fresh and innocent and simple i remember going to such a place once they have early dinner rather late and go off in buckboards over terrible roads and bring back golden rod and autumn leaves and read nature books aloud on the piazza and there is always one shy young man in flannels only one who has come to see the prettiest girl though how he can choose among so many and who takes her off in a buggy for hours and hours she paused and summed up with a long sigh it is fifteen years since i was in america and youre still so good an american oh a better and better one every day he hesitated then why did you never come back her face altered instantly exchanging its retrospective light for the look of slightly shadowed watchfulness which he had known as most habitual to it it was impossible it has always been so my husband would not go and since since our separation there have been family reasons durham sighed impatiently why do you talk of reasons the truth is you have made your life here you could never give all this up he made a discouraged gesture in the direction of the place de la concorde give it up i would go tomorrow but it could never now be for more than a visit i must live in france on account of my boy durhams heart gave a quick beat at last the talk had neared the point toward which his whole mind was straining and he began to feel a personal application in her words but that made him all the more cautious about choosing his own it is an agreement about the boy he ventured i gave my word they knew that was enough she said proudly adding as if to put him in full possession of her reasons it would have been much more difficult for me to obtain complete control of my son if it had not been understood that i was to live in france that seems fair durham assented after a moments reflection it was his instinct even in the heat of personal endeavour to pause a moment on the question of fairness the personal claim reasserted itself as he added tentatively but when he is brought up when hes grown up then you would feel freer she received this with a start as a possibility too remote to have entered into her view of the future he is only eight years old she objected ah of course it would be a long way off a long way off thank heaven french mothers part late with their sons and in that one respect i mean to be a french mother of course naturally since he has only you durham again assented he was eager to show how fully he took her point of view if only to dispose her to the reciprocal fairness of taking his when the time came to present it and he began to think that the time had now come that their walk would not have thus resolved itself without excuse or pretext into a tranquil session beneath the trees for any purpose less important than that of giving him his opportunity he took it characteristically without seeking a transition when i spoke to you the other day about myself about what i felt for you i said nothing of the future because for the moment my mind refused to travel beyond its immediate hope of happiness but i felt of course even then that the hope involved various difficulties that we cant as we might once have done come together without any thought but for ourselves and whatever your answer is to be i want to tell you now that i am ready to accept my share of the difficulties he paused and then added explicitly if theres the least chance of your listening to me im willing to live over here as long as you can keep your boy with you ii whatever madame de malrives answer was to be there could be no doubt as to her readiness to listen she received durhams words without sign of resistance and took time to ponder them gently before she answered in a voice touched by emotion you are very generous very unselfish but when you fix a limit no matter how remote to my remaining here i see how wrong it is to let myself consider for a moment such possibilities as we have been talking of wrong why should it be wrong because i shall want to keep my boy always not of course in the sense of living with him or even forming an important part of his life i am not deluded enough to think that possible but i do believe it possible never to pass wholly out of his life and while there is a hope of that how can i leave him she paused and turned on him a new face a face in which the past of which he was still so ignorant showed itself like a shadow suddenly darkening a clear pane how can i make you understand she went on urgently it is not only because of my love for him not only i mean because of my own happiness in being with him that i cant in imagination surrender even the remotest hour of his future it is because the moment he passes out of my influence he passes under that other the influence i have been fighting against every hour since he was born i dont mean you know she added as durham with bent head continued to offer the silent fixity of his attention i dont mean the special personal influence except inasmuch as it represents something wider more general something that encloses and circulates through the whole world in which he belongs that is what i meant when i said you could never understand there is nothing in your experience in any american experience to correspond with that farreaching family organization which is itself a part of the larger system and which encloses a young man of my sons position in a network of accepted prejudices and opinions everything is prepared in advance his political and religious convictions his judgments of people his sense of honour his ideas of women his whole view of life he is taught to see vileness and corruption in every one not of his own way of thinking and in every idea that does not directly serve the religious and political purposes of his class the truth isnt a fixed thing its not used to test actions by its tested by them and made to fit in with them and this forming of the mind begins with the childs first consciousness its in his nursery stories his baby prayers his very games with his playmates already he is only half mine because the church has the other half and will be reaching out for my share as soon as his education begins but that other half is still mine and i mean to make it the strongest and most living half of the two so that when the inevitable conflict begins the energy and the truth and the endurance shall be on my side and not on theirs she paused flushing with the repressed fervour of her utterance though her voice had not been raised beyond its usual discreet modulations and durham felt himself tingling with the transmitted force of her resolve whatever shock her words brought to his personal hope he was grateful to her for speaking them so clearly for having so sure a grasp of her purpose her decision strengthened his own and after a pause of deliberation he said quietly there might be a good deal to urge on the other side the ineffectualness of your sacrifice the probability that when your son marries he will inevitably be absorbed back into the life of his class and his people but i cant look at it in that way because if i were in your place i believe i should feel just as you do about it as long as there was a fighting chance i should want to keep hold of my half no matter how much the struggle cost me and one reason why i understand your feeling about your boy is that i have the same feeling about you as long as theres a fighting chance of keeping my half of you the half he is willing to spare me i dont see how i can ever give it up he waited again and then brought out firmly if youll marry me ill agree to live out here as long as you want and well be two instead of one to keep hold of your half of him he raised his eyes as he ended and saw that hers met them through a quick clouding of tears ah i am glad to have had this said to me but i could never accept such an offer he caught instantly at the distinction that doesnt mean that you could never accept me under such conditions but if i am satisfied with the conditions dont think i am speaking rashly under the influence of the moment i have expected something of this sort and i have thought out my side of the case as far as material circumstances go i have worked long enough and successfully enough to take my ease and take it where i choose i mention that because the life i offer you is offered to your boy as well he let this sink into her mind before summing up gravely the offer i make is made deliberately and at least i have a right to a direct answer she was silent again and then lifted a cleared gaze to his my direct answer then is if i were still fanny frisbee i would marry you he bent toward her persuasively but you will be when the divorce is pronounced ah the divorce she flushed deeply with an instinctive shrinking back of her whole person which made him straighten himself in his chair do you so dislike the idea the idea of divorce no not in my case i should like anything that would do away with the past obliterate it all make everything new in my life then what he began again waiting with the patience of a wooer on the uneasy circling of her tormented mind oh dont ask me i dont know i am frightened durham gave a deep sigh of discouragement i thought your coming here with me today and above all your going with me just now to see my mother was a sign that you were not frightened well i was not when i was with your mother she made everything seem easy and natural she took me back into that clear american air where there are no obscurities no mysteries what obscurities what mysteries are you afraid of she looked about her with a faint shiver i am afraid of everything she said thats because you are alone because youve no one to turn to ill clear the air for you fast enough if youll let me he looked forth defiantly as if flinging his challenge at the great city which had come to typify the powers contending with him for her possession you say that so easily but you dont know none of you know know what the difficulties i told you i was ready to take my share of the difficulties and my share naturally includes yours you know americans are great hands at getting over difficulties he drew himself up confidently just leave that to me only tell me exactly what youre afraid of she paused again and then said the divorce to begin with they will never consent to it he noticed that she spoke as though the interests of the whole clan rather than her husbands individual claim were to be considered and the use of the plural pronoun shocked his free individualism like a glimpse of some dark feudal survival but you are absolutely certain of your divorce ive consulted of course without mentioning names she interrupted him with a melancholy smile ah so have i the divorce would be easy enough to get if they ever let it come into the courts how on earth can they prevent that i dont know my never knowing how they will do things is one of the secrets of their power their power what power he broke in with irrepressible contempt who are these bogeys whose machinations are going to arrest the course of justice in a comparatively civilized country youve told me yourself that monsieur de malrive is the least likely to give you trouble and the others are his uncle the abbe his mother and sister that kind of a syndicate doesnt scare me much a priest and two women contra mundum she shook her head not contra mundum but with it their whole world is behind them its that mysterious solidarity that you cant understand one doesnt know how far they may reach or in how many directions i have never known they have always cropped up where i least expected them before this persistency of negation durhams buoyancy began to flag but his determination grew the more fixed well then supposing them to possess these supernatural powers do you think its to people of that kind that ill ever consent to give you up she raised a halfsmiling glance of protest oh theyre not wantonly wicked theyll leave me alone as long as as i do he interrupted do you want me to leave you alone was that what you brought me here to tell me the directness of the challenge seemed to gather up the scattered strands of her hesitation and lifting her head she turned on him a look in which but for its underlying shadow he might have recovered the full free beam of fanny frisbees gaze i dont know why i brought you here she said gently except from the wish to prolong a little the illusion of being once more an american among americans just now sitting there with your mother and katy and nannie the difficulties seemed to vanish the problems grew as trivial to me as they are to you and i wanted them to remain so a little longer i wanted to put off going back to them but it was of no use they were waiting for me here they are over there now in that house across the river she indicated the grey skyline of the faubourg shining in the splintered radiance of the sunset beyond the long sweep of the quays they are a part of me i belong to them i must go back to them she sighed she rose slowly to her feet as though her metaphor had expressed an actual fact and she felt herself bodily drawn from his side by the influences of which she spoke durham had risen too then i go back with you he exclaimed energetically and as she paused wavering a little under the shock of his resolve i dont mean into your house but into your life he said she suffered him at any rate to accompany her to the door of the house and allowed their debate to prolong itself through the almost monastic quiet of the quarter which led thither on the way he succeeded in wresting from her the confession that if it were possible to ascertain in advance that her husbands family would not oppose her action she might decide to apply for a divorce short of a positive assurance on this point she made it clear that she would never move in the matter there must be no scandal no retentissement nothing which her boy necessarily brought up in the french tradition of scrupulously preserved appearances could afterward regard as the faintest blur on his muchquartered escutcheon but even this partial concession again raised fresh obstacles for there seemed to be no one to whom she could entrust so delicate an investigation and to apply directly to the marquis de malrive or his relatives appeared in the light of her past experience the last way of learning their intentions but durham objected beginning to suspect a morbid fixity of idea in her perpetual attitude of distrust but surely you have told me that your husbands sister what is her name madame de treymes was the most powerful member of the group and that she has always been on your side she hesitated yes christiane has been on my side she dislikes her brother but it would not do to ask her but could no one else ask her who are her friends she has a great many and some of course are mine but in a case like this they would be all hers they wouldnt hesitate a moment between us why should it be necessary to hesitate between you suppose madame de treymes sees the reasonableness of what you ask suppose at any rate she sees the hopelessness of opposing you why should she make a mystery of your opinion its not that it is that if i went to her friends i should never get her real opinion from them at least i should never know if it is was her real opinion and therefore i should be no farther advanced dont you see durham struggled between the sentimental impulse to soothe her and the practical instinct that it was a moment for unmitigated frankness im not sure that i do but if you cant find out what madame de treymes thinks ill see what i can do myself oh you broke from her in mingled terror and admiration and pausing on her doorstep to lay her hand in his before she touched the bell she added with a halfwhimsical flash of regret why didnt this happen to fanny frisbee iii why had it not happened to fanny frisbee durham put the question to himself as he walked back along the quays in a state of inner commotion which left him for once insensible to the ordered beauty of his surroundings propinquity had not been lacking he had known miss frisbee since his college days in unsophisticated circles one family is apt to quote another and the durham ladies had always quoted the frisbees the frisbees were bold experienced enterprising they had what the novelists of the day called dash the beautiful fanny was especially dashing she had the showiest national attributes tempered only by a native grace of softness as the beam of her eyes was subdued by the length of their lashes and yet young durham though not unsusceptible to such charms had remained content to enjoy them from a safe distance of good fellowship if he had been asked why he could not have told but the durham of forty understood it was because there were with minor modifications many other fanny frisbees whereas never before within his ken had there been a fanny de malrive he had felt it in a flash when the autumn before he had run across her one evening in the diningroom of the beaurivage at ouchy when after a furtive exchange of glances they had simultaneously arrived at recognition followed by an eager pressure of hands and a long evening of reminiscence on the starlit terrace she was the same but so mysteriously changed and it was the mystery the sense of unprobed depths of initiation which drew him to her as her freshness had never drawn him he had not hitherto attempted to define the nature of the change it remained for his sister nannie to do that when on his return to the rue de rivoli where the family were still sitting in conclave upon their recent visitor miss durham summed up their groping comments in the phrase i never saw anything so french durham understanding what his sisters use of the epithet implied recognized it instantly as the explanation of his own feelings yes it was the finish the modelling which madame de malrives experience had given her that set her apart from the fresh uncomplicated personalities of which she had once been simply the most charming type the influences that had lowered her voice regulated her gestures toned her down to harmony with the warm dim background of a long social past these influences had lent to her natural fineness of perception a command of expression adapted to complex conditions she had moved in surroundings through which one could hardly bounce and bang on the genial american plan without knocking the angles off a number of sacred institutions and her acquired dexterity of movement seemed to durham a crowning grace it was a shock now that he knew at what cost the dexterity had been acquired to acknowledge this even to himself he hated to think that she could owe anything to such conditions as she had been placed in and it gave him a sense of the tremendous strength of the organization into which she had been absorbed that in spite of her horror her moral revolt she had not reacted against its external forms she might abhor her husband her marriage and the world to which it had introduced her but she had become a product of that world in its outward expression and no better proof of the fact was needed than her exotic enjoyment of americanism the sense of the distance to which her american past had been removed was never more present to him than when a day or two later he went with his mother and sisters to return her visit the region beyond the river existed for the durham ladies only as the unmapped environment of the bon marche and nannie durhams exclamation on the pokiness of the streets and the dulness of the houses showed durham with a start how far he had already travelled from the family point of view well if this is all she got by marrying a marquis the young lady summed up as they paused before the small sober hotel in its highwalled court and katy following her mother through the stonevaulted and stonefloored vestibule murmured it must be simply freezing in winter in the softlyfaded drawingroom with its old pastels in old frames its windows looking on the damp green twilight of a garden sunk deep in blackened walls the american ladies might have been even more conscious of the insufficiency of their friends compensations had not the warmth of her welcome precluded all other reflections it was not till she had gathered them about her in the corner beside the teatable that durham identified the slender dark lady loitering negligently in the background and introduced in a comprehensive murmur to the american group as the redoubtable sisterinlaw to whom he had declared himself ready to throw down his challenge there was nothing very redoubtable about madame de treymes except perhaps the kindly yet critical observation which she bestowed on her sisterinlaws visitors the unblinking attention of a civilized spectator observing an encampment of aborigines he had heard of her as a beauty and was surprised to find her as nannie afterward put it a mere stick to hang clothes on but they did hang with a small brown glancing face like that of a charming little inquisitive animal yet before she had addressed ten words to him nibbling at the hard english consonants like nuts he owned the justice of the epithet she was a beauty if beauty instead of being restricted to the cast of the face is a pervasive attribute informing the hands the voice the gestures the very fall of a flounce and tilt of a feather in this impalpable aura of grace madame de treymes dark meagre presence unmistakably moved like a thin flame in a wide quiver of light and as he realized that she looked much handsomer than she was so while they talked he felt that she understood a great deal more than she betrayed it was not through the groping speech which formed their apparent medium of communication that she imbibed her information she found it in the air she extracted it from durhams look and manner she caught it in the turn of her sisterinlaws defenseless eyes for in her presence madame de malrive became fanny frisbee again she put it together in short out of just such unconsidered indescribable trifles as differentiated the quiet felicity of her dress from nannie and katys handsome haphazard clothes her actual converse with durham moved meanwhile strictly in the conventional ruts had he been long in paris which of the new plays did he like best was it true that american jeunes filles were sometimes taken to the boulevard theatres and she threw an interrogative glance at the young ladies beside the teatable to durhams reply that it depended how much french they knew she shrugged and smiled replying that his compatriots all spoke french like parisians enquiring after a moments thought if they learned it la bas des negres and laughing heartily when durhams astonishment revealed her blunder when at length she had taken leave enveloping the durham ladies in a last puzzled penetrating look madame de malrive turned to mrs durham with a faintly embarrassed smile my sisterinlaw was much interested i believe you are the first americans she has ever known good gracious ejaculated nannie as though such social darkness required immediate missionary action on some ones part well she knows us said durham catching in madame de malrives rapid glance a startled assent to his point after all reflected the accurate katy as though seeking an excuse for madame de treymes unenlightenment we dont know many french people either to which nannie promptly if obscurely retorted ah but we couldnt and she could iv madame de treymes friendly observation of her sisterinlaws visitors resulted in no expression on her part of a desire to renew her study of them to all appearances she passed out of their lives when madame de malrives door closed on her and durham felt that the arduous task of making her acquaintance was still to be begun he felt also more than ever the necessity of attempting it and in his determination to lose no time and his perplexity how to set most speedily about the business he bethought himself of applying to his cousin mrs boykin mrs elmer boykin was a small plump woman to whose vague prettiness the lines of middleage had given no meaning as though whatever had happened to her had merely added to the sum total of her inexperience after a parisian residence of twentyfive years spent in a state of feverish servitude to the great artists of the rue de la paix her dress and hair still retained a certain rigidity in keeping with the directness of her gaze and the unmodulated candour of her voice her very drawingroom had the hard bright atmosphere of her native skies and one felt that she was still true at heart to the national ideals in electric lighting and plumbing she and her husband had left america owing to the impossibility of living there with the finish and decorum which the boykin standard demanded but in the isolation of their exile they had created about them a kind of phantom america where the national prejudices continued to flourish unchecked by the national progressiveness a little world sparsely peopled by compatriots in the same attitude of chronic opposition toward a society chronically unaware of them in this uncontaminated air mr and mrs boykin had preserved the purity of simpler conditions and elmer boykin returning rakishly from a sundays racing at chantilly betrayed under his knowing coat and the racingglasses slung ostentatiously across his shoulder the unmistakeable cut of the american business man coming up town after a long day in the office it was a part of the boykins uncomfortable but determined attitude and perhaps a last expression of their latent patriotism to live in active disapproval of the world about them fixing in memory with little stabs of reprobation innumerable instances of what the abominable foreigner was doing so that they reminded durham of persons peacefully following the course of a horrible war by pricking red pins in a map to mrs durham with her gentle tourists view of the european continent as a vast museum in which the human multitudes simply furnished the element of costume the boykins seemed abysmally instructed and darkly expert in forbidden things and her son without sharing her simple faith in their omniscience credited them with an ample supply of the kind of information of which he was in search mrs boykin from the corner of an intensely modern gobelin sofa studied her cousin as he balanced himself insecurely on one of the small gilt chairs which always look surprised at being sat in fanny de malrive oh of course i remember you were all very intimate with the frisbees when they lived in west thirtythird street but she has dropped all her american friends since her marriage the excuse was that de malrive didnt like them but as shes been separated for five or six years i cant see you say shes been very nice to your mother and the girls well i daresay she is beginning to feel the need of friends she can really trust for as for her french relations that malrive set is the worst in the faubourg of course you know what he is even the family for decencys sake had to back her up and urge her to get a separation and christiane de treymes durham seized his opportunity is she so very reprehensible too mrs boykin pursed up her small colourless mouth i cant speak from personal experience i know madame de treymes slightly i have met her at fannys but she never remembers the fact except when she wants me to go to one of her ventes de charite they all remember us then and some american women are silly enough to ruin themselves at the smart bazaars and fancy they will get invitations in return they say mrs addison g pack followed madame dalglade around for a whole winter and spent a hundred thousand francs at her stalls and at the end of the season madame dalglade asked her to tea and when she got there she found that was for a charity too and she had to pay a hundred francs to get in mrs boykin paused with a smile of compassion that is not my way she continued personally i have no desire to thrust myself into french society i cant see how any american woman can do so without loss of selfrespect but any one can tell you about madame de treymes i wish you would then durham suggested well i think elmer had better said his wife mysteriously as mr boykin at this point advanced across the wide expanse of aubusson on which his wife and durham were islanded in a state of propinquity without privacy whats that bessy hah durham how are you didnt see you at auteuil this afternoon you dont race busy sightseeing i suppose what was that my wife was telling you oh about madame de treymes he stroked his pepperandsalt moustache with a gesture intended rather to indicate than conceal the smile of experience beneath it well madame de treymes has not been like a happy country shes had a history several of em some one said she constituted the feuilleton of the faubourg daily news la suite au prochain numero you see the point not that i speak from personal knowledge bessy and i have never cared to force our way he paused reflecting that his wife had probably anticipated him in the expression of this familiar sentiment and added with a significant nod of course you know the prince darmillac by sight no im surprised at that well hes one of the choicest ornaments of the jockey club very fascinating to the ladies i believe but the deuce and all at baccara ruined his mother and a couple of maiden aunts already and now madame de treymes has put the family pearls up the spout and is wearing imitation for love of him i had that straight from my maids cousin who is employed by madame darmillacs jeweller said mrs boykin with conscious pride oh its straight enough more than she is retorted her husband who was slightly jealous of having his facts reinforced by any information not of his own gleaning be careful of what you say elmer mrs boykin interposed with archness i suspect john of being seriously smitten by the lady durham let this pass unchallenged submitting with a good grace to his hosts low whistle of amusement and the sardonic enquiry ever do anything with the foils darmillac is what they call over here a fine lame oh i dont mean to resort to bloodshed unless its absolutely necessary but i mean to make the ladys acquaintance said durham falling into his key mrs boykins lips tightened to the vanishing point i am afraid you must apply for an introduction to more fashionable people than we are elmer and i so thoroughly disapprove of french society that we have always declined to take any part in it but why should not fanny de malrive arrange a meeting for you durham hesitated i dont think she is on very intimate terms with her husbands family you mean that shes not allowed to introduce her friends to them mrs boykin interjected sarcastically while her husband added with an air of portentous initiation ah my dear fellow the way they treat the americans over here thats another chapter you know how some people can stand it mrs boykin chimed in and as the footman entering at that moment tendered her a large coronetted envelope she held it up as if in illustration of the indignities to which her countrymen were subjected look at that my dear john she exclaimed another card to one of their everlasting bazaars why its at madame darmillacs the princes mother madame de treymes must have sent it of course the brazen way in which they combine religion and immorality fifty francs admission rien que cela to see some of the most disreputable people in europe and if youre an american youre expected to leave at least a thousand behind you their own people naturally get off cheaper she tossed over the card to her cousin theres your opportunity to see madame de treymes make it two thousand and shell ask you to tea mr boykin scathingly added v in the monumental drawingroom of the hotel de malrive it had been a surprise to the american to read the name of the house emblazoned on black marble over its still more monumental gateway durham found himself surrounded by a buzz of feminine teasipping oddly out of keeping with the wigged and cuirassed portraits frowning high on the walls the majestic attitude of the furniture the rigidity of great gilt consoles drawn up like lordsinwaiting against the tarnished panels it was the old marquise de malrives day and madame de treymes who lived with her mother had admitted durham to the heart of the enemys country by inviting him after his prodigal disbursements at the charity bazaar to come in to tea on a thursday whether in thus fulfilling mr boykins prediction she had been aware of durhams purpose and had her own reasons for falling in with it or whether she simply wished to reward his lavishness at the fair and permit herself another glimpse of an american so picturesquely embodying the type familiar to french fiction on these points durham was still in doubt meanwhile madame de treymes being engaged with a venerable duchess in a black shawl all the older ladies present had the sloping shoulders of a generation of shawlwearers her american visitor left in the isolation of his unimportance was using it as a shelter for a rapid survey of the scene he had begun his study of fanny de malrives situation without any real understanding of her fears he knew the repugnance to divorce existing in the french catholic world but since the french laws sanctioned it and in a case so flagrant as his injured friends would inevitably accord it with the least possible delay and exposure he could not take seriously any risk of opposition on the part of the husbands family madame de malrive had not become a catholic and since her religious scruples could not be played on the only weapon remaining to the enemy the threat of fighting the divorce was one they could not wield without selfinjury certainly if the chief object were to avoid scandal common sense must counsel monsieur de malrive and his friends not to give the courts an opportunity of exploring his past and since the echo of such explorations and their ultimate transmission to her son were what madame de malrive most dreaded the opposing parties seemed to have a common ground for agreement and durham could not but regard his friends fears as the result of overtaxed sensibilities all this had seemed evident enough to him as he entered the austere portals of the hotel de malrive and passed between the faded liveries of old family servants to the presence of the dreaded dowager above but he had not been ten minutes in that presence before he had arrived at a faint intuition of what poor fanny meant it was not in the exquisite mildness of the old marquise a little grayhaired bunch of a woman in dowdy mourning or in the small neat presence of the priestly uncle the abbe who had so obviously just stepped down from one of the pictureframes overhead it was not in the aspect of these chief protagonists so outwardly unformidable that durham read an occult danger to his friend it was rather in their setting their surroundings the little company of elderly and dowdy persons so uniformly clad in weeping blacks and purples that they might have been assembled for some mortuary anniversary it was in the remoteness and the solidarity of this little group that durham had his first glimpse of the social force of which fanny de malrive had spoken all these amiably chatting visitors who mostly bore the stamp of personal insignificance on their mildly sloping or aristocratically beaked faces hung together in a visible closeness of tradition dress attitude and manner as different as possible from the loose aggregation of a roomful of his own countrymen durham felt as he observed them that he had never before known what society meant nor understood that in an organized and inherited system it exists fullfledged where two or three of its members are assembled upon this state of bewilderment this sense of having entered a room in which the lights had suddenly been turned out even madame de treymes intensely modern presence threw no illumination he was conscious as she smilingly rejoined him not of her points of difference from the others but of the myriad invisible threads by which she held to them he even recognized the audacious slant of her little brown profile in the portrait of a powdered ancestress beneath which she had paused a moment in advancing she was simply one particular facet of the solid glittering impenetrable body which he had thought to turn in his hands and look through like a crystal and when she said in her clear staccato english perhaps you will like to see the other rooms he felt like crying out in his blindness if i could only be sure of seeing anything here was she conscious of his blindness and was he as remote and unintelligible to her as she was to him this possibility as he followed her through the noblyunfolding rooms of the great house gave him his first hope of recoverable advantage for after all he had some vague traditional lights on her world and its antecedents whereas to her he was a wholly new phenomenon as unexplained as a fragment of meteorite dropped at her feet on the smooth gravel of the gardenpath they were pacing she had led him down into the garden in response to his admiring exclamation and perhaps also because she was sure that in the chill spring afternoon they would have its embowered privacies to themselves the garden was small but intensely rich and deep one of those wells of verdure and fragrance which everywhere sweeten the air of paris by wafts blown above old walls on quiet streets and as madame de treymes paused against the ivy bank masking its farther boundary durham felt more than ever removed from the normal bearings of life his sense of strangeness was increased by the surprise of his companions next speech you wish to marry my sisterinlaw she asked abruptly and durhams start of wonder was followed by an immediate feeling of relief he had expected the preliminaries of their interview to be as complicated as the bargaining in an eastern bazaar and had feared to lose himself at the first turn in a labyrinth of foreign intrigue yes i do he said with equal directness and they smiled together at the sharp report of question and answer the smile put durham more completely at his ease and after waiting for her to speak he added with deliberation so far however the wishing is entirely on my side his scrupulous conscience felt itself justified in this reserve by the conditional nature of madame de malrives consent i understand but you have been given reason to hope every man in my position gives himself his own reasons for hoping he interposed with a smile i understand that too madame de treymes assented but still you spent a great deal of money the other day at our bazaar yes i wanted to have a talk with you and it was the readiest if not the most distinguished means of attracting your attention i understand she once more reiterated with a gleam of amusement it is because i suspect you of understanding everything that i have been so anxious for this opportunity she bowed her acknowledgement and said shall we sit a moment adding as he drew their chairs under a tree you permit me then to say that i believe i understand also a little of our good fannys mind on that point i have no authority to speak i am here only to listen listen then you have persuaded her that there would be no harm in divorcing my brother since i believe your religion does not forbid divorce madame de malrives religion sanctions divorce in such a case as as my brother has furnished yes i have heard that your race is stricter in judging such ecarts but you must not think she added that i defend my brother fanny must have told you that we have always given her our sympathy she has let me infer it from her way of speaking of you madame de treymes arched her dramatic eyebrows how cautious you are i am so straightforward that i shall have no chance with you you will be quite safe unless you are so straightforward that you put me on my guard she met this with a low note of amusement at this rate we shall never get any farther and in two minutes i must go back to my mothers visitors why should we go on fencing the situation is really quite simple tell me just what you wish to know i have always been fannys friend and that disposes me to be yours durham during this appeal had had time to steady his thoughts and the result of his deliberation was that he said with a return to his former directness well then what i wish to know is what position your family would take if madame de malrive should sue for a divorce he added without giving her time to reply i naturally wish to be clear on this point before urging my cause with your sisterinlaw madame de treymes seemed in no haste to answer but after a pause of reflection she said not unkindly my poor fanny might have asked me that herself i beg you to believe that i am not acting as her spokesman durham hastily interposed i merely wish to clear up the situation before speaking to her in my own behalf you are the most delicate of suitors but i understand your feeling fanny also is extremely delicate it was a great surprise to us at first still in this case madame de treymes paused since she has no religious scruples and she had no difficulty in obtaining a separation why should she fear any in demanding a divorce i dont know that she does but the mere fact of possible opposition might be enough to alarm the delicacy you have observed in her ah yes on her boys account partly doubtless on her boys account so that if my brother objects to a divorce all he has to do is to announce his objection but my dear sir you are giving your case into my hands she flashed an amused smile on him since you say you are madame de malrives friend could there be a better place for it as she turned her eyes on him he seemed to see under the flitting lightness of her glance the sudden concentrated expression of the ancestral will i am fannys friend certainly but with us family considerations are paramount and our religion forbids divorce so that inevitably your brother will oppose it she rose from her seat and stood fretting with her slender boottip the minute red pebbles of the path i must really go in my mother will never forgive me for deserting her but surely you owe me an answer durham protested rising also in return for your purchases at my stall no in return for the trust i have placed in you she mused on this moving slowly a step or two toward the house certainly i wish to see you again you interest me she said smiling but it is so difficult to arrange if i were to ask you to come here again my mother and uncle would be surprised and at fannys oh not there he exclaimed where then is there any other house where we are likely to meet durham hesitated but he was goaded by the flight of the precious minutes not unless youll come and dine with me he said boldly dine with you au cabaret ah that would be diverting but impossible well dine with my cousin then i have a cousin an american lady who lives here said durham with suddenlysoaring audacity she paused with puzzled brows an american lady whom i know by name at any rate you send her cards for all your charity bazaars she received the thrust with a laugh we do exploit your compatriots oh i dont think she has ever gone to the bazaars but she might if i dined with her still less i imagine she reflected on this and then said with acuteness i like that and i accept but what is the ladys name vi on the way home in the first drop of his exaltation durham had said to himself but why on earth should bessy invite her he had naturally no very cogent reasons to give mrs boykin in support of his astonishing request and could only marvelling at his own growth in duplicity suffer her to infer that he was really shamelessly smitten with the lady he thus proposed to thrust upon her hospitality but to his surprise mrs boykin hardly gave herself time to pause upon his reasons they were swallowed up in the fact that madame de treymes wished to dine with her as the lesser luminaries vanish in the blaze of the sun i am not surprised she declared with a faint smile intended to check her husbands unruly wonder i wonder you are elmer didnt you tell me that armillac went out of his way to speak to you the other day at the races and at madame dalglades sale yes i went there after all just for a minute because i found katy and nannie were so anxious to be taken well that day i noticed that madame de treymes was quite empressee when we went up to her stall oh i didnt buy anything i merely waited while the girls chose some lampshades they thought it would be interesting to take home something painted by a real marquise and of course i didnt tell them that those women never make the things they sell at their stalls but i repeat im not surprised i suspected that madame de treymes had heard of our little dinners you know theyre really horribly bored in that poky old faubourg my poor john i see now why shes been making up to you but on one point i am quite determined elmer whatever you say i shall not invite the prince darmillac elmer as far as durham could observe did not say much but like his wife he continued in a state of pleasantly agitated activity till the momentous evening of the dinner the festivity in question was restricted in numbers either owing to the difficulty of securing suitable guests or from a desire not to have it appear that madame de treymes hosts attached any special importance to her presence but the smallness of the company was counterbalanced by the multiplicity of the courses the national determination not to be downed by the despised foreigner to show a wealth of material resource obscurely felt to compensate for the possible lack of other distinctions this resolve had taken in mrs boykins case the shape or rather the multiple shapes of a series of culinary feats of gastronomic combinations which would have commanded her deep respect had she seen them on any other table and which she naturally relied on to produce the same effect on her guest whether or not the desired result was achieved madame de treymes manner did not specifically declare but it showed a general complaisance a charming willingness to be amused which made mr boykin for months afterward allude to her among his compatriots as an old friend of my wifes takes potluck with us you know of course theres not a word of truth in any of those ridiculous stories it was only when to durhams intense surprise mr boykin hazarded to his neighbour the regret that they had not been so lucky as to secure the prince it was then only that the lady showed not indeed anything so simple and unprepared as embarrassment but a faint play of wonder an underflicker of amusement as though recognizing that by some odd law of social compensation the crudity of the talk might account for the complexity of the dishes but mr boykin was tremulously alive to hints and the conversation at once slid to safer topics easy generalizations which left madame de treymes ample time to explore the table to use her narrowed gaze like a knife slitting open the unsuspicious personalities about her nannie and katy durham who after much discussion to which their hostess candidly admitted them had been included in the feast were the special objects of madame de treymes observation during dinner she ignored in their favour the other carefullyselected guests the fashionable artcritic the old legitimist general the beauty from the english embassy the whole impressive marshalling of mrs boykins social resources and when the men returned to the drawingroom durham found her still fanning in his sisters the flame of an easily kindled enthusiasm since she could hardly have been held by the intrinsic interest of their converse the sight gave him another swift intuition of the working of those hidden forces with which fanny de malrive felt herself encompassed but when madame de treymes at his approach let him see that it was for him she had been reserving herself he felt that so graceful an impulse needed no special explanation she had the art of making it seem quite natural that they should move away together to the remotest of mrs boykins fardrawn salons and that there in a glaring privacy of brocade and ormolu she should turn to him with a smile which avowed her intentional quest of seclusion confess that i have done a great deal for you she exclaimed making room for him on a sofa judiciously screened from the observation of the other rooms in coming to dine with my cousin he enquired answering her smile let us say in giving you this half hour for that i am duly grateful and shall be still more so when i know what it contains for me ah i am not sure you will not like what i am going to say shall i not he rejoined changing colour she raised her eyes from the thoughtful contemplation of her painted fan you appear to have no idea of the difficulties should i have asked your help if i had not had an idea of them but you are still confident that with my help you can surmount them i cant believe you have come here to take that confidence from me she leaned back smiling at him through her lashes and all this i am to do for your beaux yeux no for your own that you may see with them what happiness you are conferring you are extremely clever and i like you she paused and then brought out with lingering emphasis but my family will not hear of a divorce she threw into her voice such an accent of finality that durham for the moment felt himself brought up against an insurmountable barrier but almost at once his fear was mitigated by the conviction that she would not have put herself out so much to say so little when you speak of your family do you include yourself he suggested she threw a surprised glance at him i thought you understood that i am simply their mouthpiece at this he rose quietly to his feet with a gesture of acceptance i have only to thank you then for not keeping me longer in suspense his air of wishing to put an immediate end to the conversation seemed to surprise her sit down a moment longer she commanded him kindly and as he leaned against the back of his chair without appearing to hear her request she added in a low voice i am very sorry for you and fanny but you are not the only persons to be pitied she had dropped her light manner as she might have tossed aside her fan and he was startled at the intimacy of misery to which her look and movement abruptly admitted him perhaps no anglosaxon fully understands the fluency in selfrevelation which centuries of the confessional have given to the latin races and to durham at any rate madame de treymes sudden avowal gave the shock of a physical abandonment i am so sorry he stammered is there any way in which i can be of use to you she sat before him with her hands clasped her eyes fixed on his in a terrible intensity of appeal if you would if you would oh there is nothing i would not do for you i have still a great deal of influence with my mother and what my mother commands we all do i could help you i am sure i could help you but not if my own situation were known and if nothing can be done it must be known in a few days durham had reseated himself at her side tell me what i can do he said in a low tone forgetting his own preoccupations in his genuine concern for her distress she looked up at him through tears how dare i your race is so cautious so selfcontrolled you have so little indulgence for the extravagances of the heart and my folly has been incredible and unrewarded she paused and as durham waited in a silence which she guessed to be compassionate she brought out below her breath i have lent money my husbands my brothers money that was not mine and now i have nothing to repay it with durham gazed at her in genuine astonishment the turn the conversation had taken led quite beyond his uncomplicated experiences with the other sex she saw his surprise and extended her hands in deprecation and entreaty alas what must you think of me how can i explain my humiliating myself before a stranger only by telling you the whole truth the fact that i am not alone in this disaster that i could not confess my situation to my family without ruining myself and involving in my ruin some one who however undeservedly has been as dear to me as as you are to durham pushed his chair back with a sharp exclamation ah even that does not move you she said the cry restored him to his senses by the long shaft of light it sent down the dark windings of the situation he seemed suddenly to know madame de treymes as if he had been brought up with her in the inscrutable shades of the hotel de malrive she on her side appeared to have a startled but uncomprehending sense of the fact that his silence was no longer completely sympathetic that her touch called forth no answering vibration and she made a desperate clutch at the one chord she could be certain of sounding you have asked a great deal of me much more than you can guess do you mean to give me nothing not even your sympathy in return is it because you have heard horrors of me when are they not said of a woman who is married unhappily perhaps not in your fortunate country where she may seek liberation without dishonour but here you who have seen the consequences of our disastrous marriages you who may yet be the victim of our cruel and abominable system have you no pity for one who has suffered in the same way and without the possibility of release she paused laying her hand on his arm with a smile of deprecating irony it is not because you are not rich at such times the crudest way is the shortest and i dont pretend to deny that i know i am asking you a trifle you americans when you want a thing always pay ten times what it is worth and i am giving you the wonderful chance to get what you most want at a bargain durham sat silent her little gloved hand burning his coatsleeve as if it had been a hot iron his brain was tingling with the shock of her confession she wanted money a great deal of money that was clear but it was not the point she was ready to sell her influence and he fancied she could be counted on to fulfil her side of the bargain the fact that he could so trust her seemed only to make her more terrible to him more supernaturally dauntless and baleful for what was it that she exacted of him she had said she must have money to pay her debts but he knew that was only a pretext which she scarcely expected him to believe she wanted the money for some one else that was what her allusion to a fellowvictim meant she wanted it to pay the princes gambling debts it was at that price that durham was to buy the right to marry fanny de malrive once the situation had worked itself out in his mind he found himself unexpectedly relieved of the necessity of weighing the arguments for and against it all the traditional forces of his blood were in revolt and he could only surrender himself to their pressure without thought of compromise or parley he stood up in silence and the abruptness of his movement caused madame de treymes hand to slip from his arm you refuse she exclaimed and he answered with a bow only because of the return you propose to make me she stood staring at him in a perplexity so genuine and profound that he could almost have smiled at it through his disgust ah you are all incredible she murmured at last stooping to repossess herself of her fan and as she moved past him to rejoin the group in the farther room she added in an incisive undertone you are quite at liberty to repeat our conversation to your friend vii durham did not take advantage of the permission thus strangely flung at him of his talk with her sisterinlaw he gave to madame de malrive only that part which concerned her presenting himself for this purpose the day after mrs boykins dinner he found his friend alone with her son and the sight of the child had the effect of dispelling whatever illusive hopes had attended him to the threshold even after the governesss descent upon the scene had left madame de malrive and her visitor alone the little boys presence seemed to hover admonishingly between them reducing to a bare statement of fact durhams confession of the total failure of his errand madame de malrive heard the confession calmly she had been too prepared for it not to have prepared a countenance to receive it her first comment was i have never known them to declare themselves so plainly and durhams baffled hopes fastened themselves eagerly on the words had she not always warned him that there was nothing so misleading as their plainness and might it not be that in spite of his advisedness he had suffered too easy a rebuff but second thoughts reminded him that the refusal had not been as unconditional as his necessary reservations made it seem in the repetition and that furthermore it was his own act and not that of his opponents which had determined it the impossibility of revealing this to madame de malrive only made the difficulty shut in more darkly around him and in the completeness of his discouragement he scarcely needed her reminder of his promise to regard the subject as closed when once the other side had defined its position he was secretly confirmed in this acceptance of his fate by the knowledge that it was really he who had defined the position even now that he was alone with madame de malrive and subtly aware of the struggle under her composure he felt no temptation to abate his stand by a jot he had not yet formulated a reason for his resistance he simply went on feeling more and more strongly with every precious sign of her participation in his unhappiness that he could neither owe his escape from it to such a transaction nor suffer her innocently to owe hers the only mitigating effect of his determination was in an increase of helpless tenderness toward her so that when she exclaimed in answer to his announcement that he meant to leave paris the next night oh give me a day or two longer he at once resigned himself to saying if i can be of the least use ill give you a hundred she answered sadly that all he could do would be to let her feel that he was there just for a day or two till she had readjusted herself to the idea of going on in the old way and on this note of renunciation they parted but durham however pledged to the passive part could not long sustain it without rebellion to hang round the shut door of his hopes seemed after two long days more than even his passion required of him and on the third he despatched a note of goodbye to his friend he was going off for a few weeks he explained his mother and sisters wished to be taken to the italian lakes but he would return to paris and say his real farewell to her before sailing for america in july he had not intended his note to act as an ultimatum he had no wish to surprise madame de malrive into unconsidered surrender when almost immediately his own messenger returned with a reply from her he even felt a pang of disappointment a momentary fear lest she should have stooped a little from the high place where his passion had preferred to leave her but her first words turned his fear into rejoicing let me see you before you go something extraordinary has happened she wrote what had happened as he heard from her a few hours later finding her in a tremor of frightened gladness with her door boldly closed to all the world but himself was nothing less extraordinary than a visit from madame de treymes who had come officially delegated by the family to announce that monsieur de malrive had decided not to oppose his wifes suit for divorce durham at the news was almost afraid to show himself too amazed but his small signs of alarm and wonder were swallowed up in the flush of madame de malrives incredulous joy its the long habit you know of not believing them of looking for the truth always in what they dont say it took me hours and hours to convince myself that theres no trick under it that there cant be any she explained then you are convinced now escaped from durham but the shadow of his question lingered no more than the flit of a wing across her face i am convinced because the facts are there to reassure me christiane tells me that monsieur de malrive has consulted his lawyers and that they have advised him to free me maitre enguerrand has been instructed to see my lawyer whenever i wish it they quite understand that i never should have taken the step in face of any opposition on their part i am so thankful to you for making that perfectly clear to them and i suppose this is the return their pride makes to mine for they can be proud collectively she broke off and added with happy hands outstretched and i owe it all to you christiane said it was your talk with her that had convinced them durham at this statement had to repress a fresh sound of amazement but with her hands in his and a moment after her whole self drawn to him in the first yielding of her lips doubt perforce gave way to the lovers happy conviction that such love was after all too strong for the powers of darkness it was only when they sat again in the blissful aftercalm of their understanding that he felt the pricking of an unappeased distrust did madame de treymes give you any reason for this change of front he risked asking when he found the distrust was not otherwise to be quelled oh yes just what ive said it was really her admiration of you of your attitude your delicacy she said that at first she hadnt believed in it theyre always looking for a hidden motive and when she found that yours was staring at her in the actual words you said that you really respected my scruples and would never never try to coerce or entrap me something in her poor christiane answered to it she told me and she wanted to prove to us that she was capable of understanding us too if you knew her history youd find it wonderful and pathetic that she can durham thought he knew enough of it to infer that madame de treymes had not been the object of many conscientious scruples on the part of the opposite sex but this increased rather his sense of the strangeness than of the pathos of her action yet madame de malrive whom he had once inwardly taxed with the morbid raising of obstacles seemed to see none now and he could only infer that her sisterinlaws actual words had carried more conviction than reached him in the repetition of them the mere fact that he had so much to gain by leaving his friends faith undisturbed was no doubt stirring his own suspicions to unnatural activity and this sense gradually reasoned him back into acceptance of her view as the most normal as well as the pleasantest he could take viii the uneasiness thus temporarily repressed slipped into the final disguise of hoping he should not again meet madame de treymes and in this wish he was seconded by the decision in which madame de malrive concurred that it would be well for him to leave paris while the preliminary negotiations were going on he committed her interests to the best professional care and his mother resigning her dream of the lakes remained to fortify madame de malrive by her mild unimaginative view of the transaction as an uncomfortable but commonplace necessity like housecleaning or dentistry mrs durham would doubtless have preferred that her only son even with his hair turning gray should have chosen a fanny frisbee rather than a fanny de malrive but it was a part of her acceptance of life on a general basis of innocence and kindliness that she entered generously into his dream of rescue and renewal and devoted herself without afterthought to keeping up fannys courage with so little to spare for herself the process the lawyers declared would not be a long one since monsieur de malrives acquiescence reduced it to a formality and when at the end of june durham returned from italy with katy and nannie there seemed no reason why he should not stop in paris long enough to learn what progress had been made but before he could learn this he was to hear on entering madame de malrives presence news more immediate if less personal he found her in spite of her gladness in his return so evidently preoccupied and distressed that his first thought was one of fear for their own future but she read and dispelled this by saying before he could put his question poor christiane is here she is very unhappy you have seen in the papers i have seen no papers since we left turin what has happened the prince darmillac has come to grief there has been some terrible scandal about money and he has been obliged to leave france to escape arrest and madame de treymes has left her husband ah no poor creature they dont leave their husbands they cant but de treymes has gone down to their place in brittany and as my motherinlaw is with another daughter in auvergne christiane came here for a few days with me you see she need not pretend she can cry her eyes out and that is what she is doing it was so unlike his conception of the way in which under the most adverse circumstances madame de treymes would be likely to occupy her time that durham was conscious of a note of scepticism in his query poor thing if you saw her you would feel nothing but pity she is suffering so horribly that i reproach myself for being happy under the same roof durham met this with a tender pressure of her hand then he said after a pause of reflection i should like to see her he hardly knew what prompted him to utter the wish unless it were a sudden stir of compunction at the memory of his own dealings with madame de treymes had he not sacrificed the poor creature to a purely fantastic conception of conduct she had said that she knew she was asking a trifle of him and the fact that materially it would have been a trifle had seemed at the moment only an added reason for steeling himself in his moral resistance to it but now that he had gained his point and through her own generosity as it still appeared the largeness of her attitude made his own seem cramped and petty since conduct in the last resort must be judged by its enlarging or diminishing effect on character might it not be that the zealous weighing of the moral anise and cummin was less important than the unconsidered lavishing of the precious ointment at any rate he could enjoy no peace of mind under the burden of madame de treymes magnanimity and when he had assured himself that his own affairs were progressing favourably he once more at the risk of surprising his betrothed brought up the possibility of seeing her relative madame de malrive evinced no surprise it is natural knowing what she has done for us that you should want to show her your sympathy the difficulty is that it is just the one thing you cant show her you can thank her of course for ourselves but even that at the moment would seem brutal yes i recognize that i should have to choose my words he admitted guiltily conscious that his capability of dealing with madame de treymes extended far beyond her sisterinlaws conjecture madame de malrive still hesitated i can tell her and when you come back tomorrow it had been decided that in the interests of discretion the interests in other words of the poor little future marquis de malrive durham was to remain but two days in paris withdrawing then with his family till the conclusion of the divorce proceedings permitted him to return in the acknowledged character of madame de malrives future husband even on this occasion he had not come to her alone nannie durham in the adjoining room was chatting conspicuously with the little marquis whom she could with difficulty be restrained from teaching to call her aunt nannie durham thought her voice had risen unduly once or twice during his visit and when on taking leave he went to summon her from the inner room he found the higher note of ecstasy had been evoked by the appearance of madame de treymes and that the little boy himself absorbed in a new toy of durhams bringing was being bent over by an actual as well as a potential aunt madame de treymes raised herself with a slight start at durhams approach she had her hat on and had evidently paused a moment on her way out to speak with nannie without expecting to be surprised by her sisterinlaws other visitor but her surprises never wore the awkward form of embarrassment and she smiled beautifully on durham as he took her extended hand the smile was made the more appealing by the way in which it lit up the ruin of her small dark face which looked seared and hollowed as by a flame that might have spread over it from her fevered eyes durham accustomed to the pale inward grief of the inexpressive races was positively startled by the way in which she seemed to have been openly stretched on the pyre he almost felt an indelicacy in the ravages so tragically confessed the sight caused an involuntary readjustment of his whole view of the situation and made him as far as his own share in it went more than ever inclined to extremities of selfdisgust with him such sensations required for his own relief some immediate penitential escape and as madame de treymes turned toward the door he addressed a glance of entreaty to his betrothed madame de malrive whose intelligence could be counted on at such moments responded by laying a detaining hand on her sisterinlaws arm dear christiane may i leave mr durham in your charge for two minutes i have promised nannie that she shall see the boy put to bed madame de treymes made no audible response to this request but when the door had closed on the other ladies she said looking quietly at durham i dont think that in this house your time will hang so heavy that you need my help in supporting it durham met her glance frankly it was not for that reason that madame de malrive asked you to remain with me why then surely not in the interest of preserving appearances since she is safely upstairs with your sister no but simply because i asked her to i told her i wanted to speak to you how you arrange things and what reason can you have for wanting to speak to me he paused for a moment cant you imagine the desire to thank you for what you have done she stirred restlessly turning to adjust her hat before the glass above the mantelpiece oh as for what i have done dont speak as if you regretted it he interposed she turned back to him with a flash of laughter lighting up the haggardness of her face regret working for the happiness of two such excellent persons cant you fancy what a charming change it is for me to do something so innocent and beneficent he moved across the room and went up to her drawing down the hand which still flitted experimentally about her hat dont talk in that way however much one of the persons of whom you speak may have deserved it one of the persons do you mean me he released her hand but continued to face her resolutely i mean myself as you know you have been generous extraordinarily generous ah but i was doing good in a good cause you have made me see that there is a distinction he flushed to the forehead i am here to let you say whatever you choose to me whatever i choose she made a slight gesture of deprecation has it never occurred to you that i may conceivably choose to say nothing durham paused conscious of the increasing difficulty of the advance she met him parried him at every turn he had to take his baffled purpose back to another point of attack quite conceivably he said so much so that i am aware i must make the most of this opportunity because i am not likely to get another but what remains of your opportunity if it isnt one to me it still remains for me an occasion to abase myself he broke off conscious of a grossness of allusion that seemed on a closer approach the real obstacle to full expression but the moments were flying and for his selfesteems sake he must find some way of making her share the burden of his repentance there is only one thinkable pretext for detaining you it is that i may still show my sense of what you have done for me madame de treymes who had moved toward the door paused at this and faced him resting her thin brown hands on a slender sofaback how do you propose to show that sense she enquired durham coloured still more deeply he saw that she was determined to save her pride by making what he had to say of the utmost difficulty well he would let his expiation take that form then it was as if her slender hands held out to him the fools cap he was condemned to press down on his own ears by offering in return in any form and to the utmost any service you are forgiving enough to ask of me she received this with a low sound of laughter that scarcely rose to her lips you are princely but my dear sir does it not occur to you that i may meanwhile have taken my own way of repaying myself for any service i have been fortunate enough to render you durham at the question or still more perhaps at the tone in which it was put felt through his compunction a vague faint chill of apprehension was she threatening him or only mocking him or was this barbed swiftness of retort only the wounded creatures way of defending the privacy of her own pain he looked at her again and read his answer in the last conjecture i dont know how you can have repaid yourself for anything so disinterested but i am sure at least that you have given me no chance of recognizing ever so slightly what you have done she shook her head with the flicker of a smile on her melancholy lips dont be too sure you have given me a chance and i have taken it taken it to the full so fully she continued keeping her eyes fixed on his that if i were to accept any farther service you might choose to offer i should simply be robbing you robbing you shamelessly she paused and added in an undefinable voice i was entitled wasnt i to take something in return for the service i had the happiness of doing you durham could not tell whether the irony of her tone was selfdirected or addressed to himself perhaps it comprehended them both at any rate he chose to overlook his own share in it in replying earnestly so much so that i cant see how you can have left me nothing to add to what you say you have taken ah but you dont know what that is she continued to smile elusively ambiguously and whats more you wouldnt believe me if i told you how do you know he rejoined you didnt believe me once before and this is so much more incredible he took the taunt full in the face i shall go away unhappy unless you tell me but then perhaps i have deserved to he confessed she shook her head again advancing toward the door with the evident intention of bringing their conference to a close but on the threshold she paused to launch her reply i cant send you away unhappy since it is in the contemplation of your happiness that i have found my reward ix the next day durham left with his family for england with the intention of not returning till after the divorce should have been pronounced in september to say that he left with a quiet heart would be to overstate the case the fact that he could not communicate to madame de malrive the substance of his talk with her sisterinlaw still hung upon him uneasily but of definite apprehensions the lapse of time gradually freed him and madame de malrives letters addressed more frequently to his mother and sisters than to himself reflected in their reassuring serenity the undisturbed course of events there was to durham something peculiarly touching as of an involuntary confession of almost unbearable loneliness in the way she had regained with her reentry into the clear air of american associations her own fresh trustfulness of view once she had accustomed herself to the surprise of finding her divorce unopposed she had been as it now seemed to durham in almost too great haste to renounce the habit of weighing motives and calculating chances it was as though her coming liberation had already freed her from the garb of a mental slavery as though she could not too soon or too conspicuously cast off the ugly badge of suspicion the fact that durhams cleverness had achieved so easy a victory over forces apparently impregnable merely raised her estimate of that cleverness to the point of letting her feel that she could rest in it without farther demur he had even noticed in her during his few hours in paris a tendency to reproach herself for her lack of charity and a desire almost as fervent as his own to expiate it by exaggerated recognition of the disinterestedness of her opponents if opponents they could still be called this sudden change in her attitude was peculiarly moving to durham he knew she would hazard herself lightly enough wherever her heart called her but that with the precious freight of her childs future weighing her down she should commit herself so blindly to his hand stirred in him the depths of tenderness indeed had the actual course of events been less auspiciously regular madame de malrives confidence would have gone far toward unsettling his own but with the process of law going on unimpeded and the other side making no sign of open or covert resistance the fresh air of good faith gradually swept through the inmost recesses of his distrust it was expected that the decision in the suit would be reached by midseptember and it was arranged that durham and his family should remain in england till a decent interval after the conclusion of the proceedings early in the month however it became necessary for durham to go to france to confer with a business associate who was in paris for a few days and on the point of sailing for cherbourg the most zealous observance of appearances could hardly forbid durhams return for such a purpose but it had been agreed between himself and madame de malrive who had once more been left alone by madame de treymes return to her family that so close to the fruition of their wishes they would propitiate fate by a scrupulous adherence to usage and communicate only during his hasty visit by a daily interchange of notes the ingenuity of madame de malrives tenderness found however the day after his arrival a means of tempering their privation christiane she wrote is passing through paris on her way from trouville and has promised to see you for me if you will call on her today she thinks there is no reason why you should not go to the hotel de malrive as you will find her there alone the family having gone to auvergne she is really our friend and understands us in obedience to this request though perhaps inwardly regretting that it should have been made durham that afternoon presented himself at the proud old house beyond the seine more than ever in the semiabandonment of the morte saison with reduced service and shutters closed to the silence of the highwalled court did it strike the american as the incorruptible custodian of old prejudices and strange social survivals the thought of what he must represent to the almost human consciousness which such old houses seem to possess made him feel like a barbarian desecrating the silence of a temple of the earlier faith not that there was anything venerable in the attestations of the hotel de malrive except in so far as to a sensitive imagination every concrete embodiment of a past order of things testifies to real convictions once suffered for durham at any rate always alive in practical issues to the view of the other side had enough sympathy left over to spend it sometimes whimsically on such perceptions of difference today especially the assurance of success the sense of entering like a victorious beleaguerer receiving the keys of the stronghold disposed him to a sentimental perception of what the other side might have to say for itself in the language of old portraits old relics old usages dumbly outraged by his mere presence on the appearance of madame de treymes however such considerations gave way to the immediate act of wondering how she meant to carry off her share of the adventure durham had not forgotten the note on which their last conversation had closed the lapse of time serving only to give more precision and perspective to the impression he had then received madame de treymes first words implied a recognition of what was in his thoughts it is extraordinary my receiving you here but que voulez vous there was no other place and i would do more than this for our dear fanny durham bowed it seems to me that you are also doing a great deal for me perhaps you will see later that i have my reasons she returned smiling but before speaking for myself i must speak for fanny she signed to him to take a chair near the sofacorner in which she had installed herself and he listened in silence while she delivered madame de malrives message and her own report of the progress of affairs you have put me still more deeply in your debt he said as she concluded i wish you would make the expression of this feeling a large part of the message i send back to madame de malrive she brushed this aside with one of her light gestures of deprecation oh i told you i had my reasons and since you are here and the mere sight of you assures me that you are as well as fanny charged me to find you with all these preliminaries disposed of i am going to relieve you in a small measure of the weight of your obligation durham raised his head quickly by letting me do something in return she made an assenting motion by asking you to answer a question that seems very little to do dont be so sure it is never very little to your race she leaned back studying him through halfdropped lids well try me he protested she did not immediately respond and when she spoke her first words were explanatory rather than interrogative i want to begin by saying that i believe i once did you an injustice to the extent of misunderstanding your motive for a certain action durhams uneasy flush confessed his recognition of her meaning ah if we must go back to that you withdraw your assent to my request by no means but nothing consolatory you can find to say on that point can really make any difference will not the difference in my view of you perhaps make a difference in your own she looked at him earnestly without a trace of irony in her eyes or on her lips it is really i who have an amende to make as i now understand the situation i once turned to you for help in a painful extremity and i have only now learned to understand your reasons for refusing to help me oh my reasons groaned durham i have learned to understand them she persisted by being so much lately with fanny but i never told her he broke in exactly that was what told me i understood you through her and through your dealings with her there she was the woman you adored and longed to save and you would not lift a finger to make her yours by means which would have seemed i see it now a desecration of your feeling for each other she paused as if to find the exact words for meanings she had never before had occasion to formulate it came to me first a light on your attitude when i found you had never breathed to her a word of our talk together she had confidently commissioned you to find a way for her as the mediaeval lady sent a prayer to her knight to deliver her from captivity and you came back confessing you had failed but never justifying yourself by so much as a hint of the reason why and when i had lived a little in fannys intimacy at a moment when circumstances helped to bring us extraordinarily close i understood why you had done this why you had let her take what view she pleased of your failure your passive acceptance of defeat rather than let her suspect the alternative offered you you couldnt even with my permission betray to any one a hint of my miserable secret and you couldnt for your lifes happiness pay the particular price that i asked she leaned toward him in the intense almost childlike effort at full expression oh we are of different races with a different point of honour but i understand i see that you are good people just simply courageously good she paused and then said slowly have i understood you have i put my hand on your motive durham sat speechless subdued by the rush of emotion which her words set free that you understand is my question she concluded with a faint smile and he answered hesitatingly what can it matter when the upshot is something i infinitely regret having refused me dont she spoke with deep seriousness bending her eyes full on his ah i have suffered suffered but i have learned also my life has been enlarged you see how i have understood you both and that is something i should have been incapable of a few months ago durham returned her look i cant think that you can ever have been incapable of any generous interpretation she uttered a slight exclamation which resolved itself into a laugh of selfdirected irony if you knew into what language i have always translated life but that she broke off is not what you are here to learn i think he returned gravely that i am here to learn the measure of christian charity she threw him a new odd look ah no but to show it she exclaimed to show it and to whom she paused for a moment and then rejoined instead of answering do you remember that day i talked with you at fannys the day after you came back from italy he made a motion of assent and she went on you asked me then what return i expected for my service to you as you called it and i answered the contemplation of your happiness well do you know what that meant in my old language the language i was still speaking then it meant that i knew there was horrible misery in store for you and that i was waiting to feast my eyes on it thats all she had flung out the words with one of her quick bursts of selfabandonment like a fevered sufferer stripping the bandage from a wound durham received them with a face blanching to the pallour of her own what misery do you mean he exclaimed she leaned forward laying her hand on his with just such a gesture as she had used to enforce her appeal in mrs boykins boudoir the remembrance made him shrink slightly from her touch and she drew back with a smile have you never asked yourself she enquired why our family consented so readily to a divorce yes often he replied all his unformed fears gathering in a dark throng about him but fanny was so reassured so convinced that we owed it to your good offices she broke into a laugh my good offices will you never you americans learn that we do not act individually in such cases that we are all obedient to a common principle of authority then it was not you she made an impatient shrugging motion oh you are too confiding it is the other side of your beautiful good faith the side you have taken advantage of it appears i we all of us i especially she confessed x there was another pause during which durham tried to steady himself against the shock of the impending revelation it was an odd circumstance of the case that though madame de treymes avowal of duplicity was fresh in his ears he did not for a moment believe that she would deceive him again whatever passed between them now would go to the root of the matter the first thing that passed was the long look they exchanged searching on his part tender sad undefinable on hers as the result of it he said why then did you consent to the divorce to get the boy back she answered instantly and while he sat stunned by the unexpectedness of the retort she went on is it possible you never suspected it has been our whole thought from the first everything was planned with that object he drew a sharp breath of alarm but the divorce how could that give him back to you it was the only thing that could we trembled lest the idea should occur to you but we were reasonably safe for there has only been one other case of the same kind before the courts she leaned back the sight of his perplexity checking her quick rush of words you didnt know she began again that in that case on the remarriage of the mother the courts instantly restored the child to the father though he had well given as much cause for divorce as my unfortunate brother durham gave an ironic laugh your french justice takes a grammar and dictionary to understand she smiled we understand it and it isnt necessary that you should so it would appear he exclaimed bitterly dont judge us too harshly or not at least till you have taken the trouble to learn our point of view you consider the individual we think only of the family why dont you take care to preserve it then ah thats what we do in spite of every aberration of the individual and so when we saw it was impossible that my brother and his wife should live together we simply transferred our allegiance to the child we constituted him the family a precious kindness you did him if the result is to give him back to his father that i admit is to be deplored but his father is only a fraction of the whole what we really do is to give him back to his race his religion his true place in the order of things his mother never tried to deprive him of any of those inestimable advantages madame de treymes unclasped her hands with a slight gesture of deprecation not consciously perhaps but silences and reserves can teach so much his mother has another point of view thank heaven durham interjected thank heaven for her yes perhaps but it would not have done for the boy durham squared his shoulders with the sudden resolve of a man breaking through a throng of ugly phantoms you havent yet convinced me that it wont have to do for him at the time of madame de malrives separation the court made no difficulty about giving her the custody of her son and you must pardon me for reminding you that the fathers unfitness was the reason alleged madame de treymes shrugged her shoulders and my poor brother you would add has not changed but the circumstances have and that proves precisely what i have been trying to show you that in such cases the general course of events is considered rather than the action of any one person then why is madame de malrives action to be considered because it breaks up the unity of the family unity broke from durham and madame de treymes gently suffered his smile of the family tradition i mean it introduces new elements you are a new element thank heaven said durham again she looked at him singularly yes you may thank heaven why isnt it enough to satisfy fanny why isnt what enough your being as i say a new element taking her so completely into a better air why shouldnt she be content to begin a new life with you without wanting to keep the boy too durham stared at her dumbly i dont know what you mean he said at length i mean that in her place she broke off dropping her eyes she may have another son the son of the man she adores durham rose from his seat and took a quick turn through the room she sat motionless following his steps through her lowered lashes which she raised again slowly as he stood before her your idea then is that i should tell her nothing he said tell her now but my poor friend you would be ruined exactly he paused then why have you told me under her dark skin he saw the faint colour stealing we see things so differently but cant you conceive that after all that has passed i felt it a kind of loyalty not to leave you in ignorance and you feel no such loyalty to her ah i leave her to you she murmured looking down again durham continued to stand before her grappling slowly with his perplexity which loomed larger and darker as it closed in on him you dont leave her to me you take her from me at a stroke i suppose he added painfully i ought to thank you for doing it before its too late she stared i take her from you i simply prevent your going to her unprepared knowing fanny as i do it seemed to me necessary that you should find a way in advance a way of tiding over the first moment that of course is what we had planned that you shouldnt have we meant to let you marry and then oh there is no question about the result we are certain of our case our measures have been taken de loin she broke off as if oppressed by his stricken silence you will think me stupid but my warning you of this is the only return i know how to make for your generosity i could not bear to have you say afterward that i had deceived you twice twice he looked at her perplexedly and her colour rose i deceived you once that night at your cousins when i tried to get you to bribe me even then we meant to consent to the divorce it was decided the first day that i saw you he was silent and she added with one of her mocking gestures you see from what a milieu you are taking her durham groaned she will never give up her son how can she help it after you are married there will be no choice no but there is one now now she sprang to her feet clasping her hands in dismay havent i made it clear to you havent i shown you your course she paused and then brought out with emphasis i love fanny and i am ready to trust her happiness to you i shall have nothing to do with her happiness he repeated doggedly she stood close to him with a look intently fixed on his face are you afraid she asked with one of her mocking flashes afraid of not being able to make it up to her their eyes met and he returned her look steadily no if i had the chance i believe i could i know you could she exclaimed thats the worst of it he said with a cheerless laugh the worst dont you see that i cant deceive her cant trick her into marrying me now madame de treymes continued to hold his eyes for a puzzled moment after he had spoken then she broke out despairingly is happiness never more to you then than this abstract standard of truth durham reflected i dont know its an instinct there doesnt seem to be any choice then i am a miserable wretch for not holding my tongue he shook his head sadly that would not have helped me and it would have been a thousand times worse for her nothing can be as bad for her as losing you arent you moved by seeing her need horribly are not you he said lifting his eyes to hers suddenly she started under his look you mean why dont i help you why dont i use my influence ah if you knew how i have tried and you are sure that nothing can be done nothing nothing what arguments can i use we abhor divorce we go against our religion in consenting to it and nothing short of recovering the boy could possibly justify us durham turned slowly away then there is nothing to be done he said speaking more to himself than to her he felt her light touch on his arm wait there is one thing more she stood close to him with entreaty written on her small passionate face there is one thing more she repeated and that is to believe that i am deceiving you again he stopped short with a bewildered stare that you are deceiving me about the boy yes yes why shouldnt i youre so credulous the temptation is irresistible ah it would be too easy to find out dont try then go on as if nothing had happened i have been lying to you she declared with vehemence do you give me your word of honour he rejoined a liars i havent any take the logic of the facts instead what reason have you to believe any good of me and what reason have i to do any to you why on earth should i betray my family for your benefit ah dont let yourself be deceived to the end she sparkled up at him her eyes suffused with mockery but on the lashes he saw a tear he shook his head sadly i should first have to find a reason for your deceiving me why i gave it to you long ago i wanted to punish you and now ive punished you enough yes youve punished me enough he conceded the tear gathered and fell down her thin cheek its you who are punishing me now i tell you im false to the core look back and see what ive done to you he stood silent with his eyes fixed on the ground then he took one of her hands and raised it to his lips you poor good woman he said gravely her hand trembled as she drew it away youre going to her straight from here yes straight from here to tell her everything to renounce your hope that is what it amounts to i suppose she watched him cross the room and lay his hand on the door ah you poor good man she said with a sob end of the project gutenberg etext of madame de treymes
