face after basho japanese poet part one it is better to travel hopefully scissors cut paper the geisha called trembling leaf on her knees beside james bond leant forward from the waist and kissed him chastely on the right cheek thats a cheat said bond severely you agreed that if i won it would be a real kiss on the mouth at the very least he added grey pearl the madame who had black lacquered teeth a bizarre affectation and was so thickly made up that she looked like a character out of a no play translated there was much giggling and cries of encouragement trembling leaf covered her face with her pretty hands as if she were being required to perform some ultimate obscenity but then the fingers divided and the pert brown eyes examined bonds mouth as if taking aim and her body lanced forward this time the kiss was full on the lips and it lingered fractionally in invitation in promise bond remembered that he had been promised a pillow geisha technically this would be a geisha of low caste she would not be proficient in the traditional arts of her calling she would not be able to tell humorous stories sing paint or compose verses about her patron but unlike her cultured sisters she might agree to perform more robust services discreetly of course in conditions of the utmost privacy and at a high price but to the boorish brutalized tastes of a gaijin a foreigner this made more sense than having a tanka of thirtyone syllables which in any case he couldnt understand equate in exquisite ideograms his charms with budding chrysanthemums on the slopes of mount fuji the applause which greeted this unbridled exhibition of lasciviousness died quickly and respectfully the powerful chunky man in the black yukata sitting directly across the low red lacquer table from bond had taken the dunhill filter holder from between his golden teeth and had laid it beside his ashtray bondosan said tiger tanaka head of the japanese secret service i will now challenge you to this ridiculous game and i promise you in advance that you will not win the big creased brown face that bond had come to know so well in the past month split expansively the wide smile closed the almond eyes to slits slits that glittered bond knew that smile it wasnt a smile it was a mask with a golden hole in it bond laughed all right tiger but first more sake and not in these ridiculous thimbles ive drunk five flasks of the stuff and its effect is about the same as one double martini i shall need another double martini if i am to go on demonstrating the superiority of western instinct over the wiles of the orient is there such a thing as a lowly glass tumbler discarded in some corner behind the cabinets of ming bondosan ming is chinese your knowledge of porcelain is as meagre as your drinking habits are gross moreover it is unwise to underestimate sake we have a saying it is the man who drinks the first flask of sake then the second flask drinks the first then it is the sake that drinks the man tiger tanaka turned to grey pearl and there followed a laughing conversation which bond interpreted as jokes at the expense of this uncouth westerner and his monstrous appetites at a word from the madame trembling leaf bowed low and scurried out of the room tiger turned to bond you have gained much face bondosan it is only the sumo wrestlers who drink sake in these quantities without showing it she says you are undoubtedly an eightflask man tigers face became sly but she also suggests that you will not make much of a companion for trembling leaf at the end of the evening tell her that i am more interested in her own more mature charms she will certainly possess talents in the art of love making which will overcome any temporary lassitude on my part this leaden gallantry got what it deserved there came a spirited crackle of japanese from grey pearl tiger translated bondosan this is a woman of some wit she has made a joke she says she is already respectably married to one bonsan and there is no room on her futon for another bonsan means a priest a greybeard futon as you know is a bed she has made a joke on your name the geisha party had been going on for two hours and bonds jaws were aching with the unending smiles and polite repartee far from being entertained by the geisha or bewitched by the inscrutable discords issuing from the catskincovered box of the threestringed samisen bond had found himself having to try desperately to make the party go he also knew that tiger tanaka had been observing his effort with a sadistic pleasure dikko henderson had warned him that geisha parties were more or less the equivalent for a foreigner of trying to entertain a lot of unknown children in a nursery with a strict governess the madame looking on but dikko had also warned him that he was being done a great honour by tiger tanaka that the party would cost tiger a small fortune whether from secret funds or from his own pocket and that bond had better put a good face on the whole thing since this looked like being a breakthrough in bonds mission but it could equally well be disaster so now bond smiled and clapped his hands in admiration he said to tiger tell the old bitch shes a clever old bitch accepted the brimming tumbler of hot sake from the apparently adoring hands of trembling leaf and downed it in two tremendous gulps he repeated the performance so that more sake had to be fetched from the kitchen then he placed his fist decisively on the red lacquer table and said with mock belligerence all right tiger go to it it was the old game of scissors cut paper paper wraps stone stone blunts scissors that is played by children all over the world the fist is the stone two outstretched fingers are the scissors and a flat hand is the paper the closed fist is hammered twice in the air simultaneously by the two opponents and at the third downward stroke the chosen emblem is revealed the game consists of guessing which emblem the opponent will choose and of you yourself choosing one that will defeat him best of three goes or more it is a game of bluff tiger tanaka rested his fist on the table opposite bond the two men looked carefully into each others eyes there was dead silence in the boxlike little lathandpaper room and the soft gurgling of the tiny brook in the ornamental square of garden outside the opened partition could be heard clearly for the first time that evening perhaps it was this silence after all the talk and giggling or perhaps it was the deep seriousness and purpose that was suddenly evident in tiger tanakas formidable cruel samurai face but bonds skin momentarily crawled for some reason this had become more than a childrens game tiger had promised he would beat bond to fail would be to lose much face how much enough to breach a friendship that had become oddly real between the two of them over the past weeks this was one of the most powerful men in japan to be defeated by a miserable gaijin in front of the two women might be a matter of great moment to this man the defeat might leak out through the women in the west such a trifle would be farcically insignificant like a cabinet minister losing a game of backgammon at blades but in the east in a very short while dikko henderson had taught bond total respect for oriental conventions however oldfashioned or seemingly trivial but bond was still at sea in their gradations this was a case in point should bond try and win at this baby game of bluff and doublebluff or should he try to lose but to try and lose involved the same cleverness at correctly guessing the other mans symbols in advance it was just as difficult to lose on purpose as to win and anyway did it really matter unfortunately on the curious assignment in which james bond was involved he had a nasty feeling that even this idiotic little gambit had significance towards success or failure as if with second sight tiger tanaka spelled the problem out he gave a harsh taut laugh that was more of a shout than an expression of humour or pleasure bondosan with us and certainly at a party at which i am the host and you are the honoured guest it would be good manners for me to let you win this game that we are to play together it would be more it would be required behaviour so i must ask your forgiveness in advance for defeating you bond smiled cheerfully my dear tiger there is no point in playing a game unless youtry to win it would be a very great insult to me if you endeavoured to play to lose but if i may say so your remarks are highly provocative they are like the taunts of the sumo wrestlers before the bout if i was not myself so certain of winning i would point out that you spoke in english please tell our dainty and distinguished audience that i propose to rub your honourable nose in the dirt at this despicable game and thus display not only the superiority of great britain and particularly scotland over japan but also the superiority of our queen over your emperor bond encouraged perhaps by the crafty ambush of the sake had committed himself this kind of joking about their different cultures had become a habit between himself and tiger who with a first in ppe at trinity before the war prided himself in the demokorasu of his outlook and the liberality and breadth of his understanding of the west but bond having spoken caught the sudden glitter in the dark eyes and he thought of dikko hendersons cautionary nowlisten you stupid limey bastard youre doing all right but dont press your luck tts a civilized kind of a chap as japs go that is but dont overdo it take a look at that mug theres manchu there and tartar and dont forget the soanso was a black belt at judo before he ever went up to your bloody oxford and dont forget he was spying for japan when he called himself assistant naval attache in their london embassy before the war and you stupid bastards thought he was okay because hed got a degree at oxford and dont forget his war record dont forget he ended up as personal aide to admiral ohnishi and was training as a kamikaze when the americans made loud noises over nagasaki and hiroshima and the rising sun suddenly took a backward somersault in to the sea and if you forget all that just ask yourself why its tt rather than any other of the ninety million japanese who happens to hold down the job as head of the koanchosakyoku okay james got the photo since bond had arrived in japan he had assiduously practised sitting in the lotus position dikko henderson had advised it if you make the grade with these people he had said or even if you dont youll be spending a lot of time sitting on your ass on the ground theres only one way to do it without cracking your joints thats in the indian position squatting with your legs crossed and the sides of your feet hurting like hell on the floor it takes a bit of practice but it wont kill you and youll end up gaining plenty of face bond had more or less mastered the art but now after two hours his kneejoints were on fire and he felt that if he didnt alter his posture he would end up bandylegged for life he said to tiger playing against a master such as yourself i must first adopt a relaxed position so that my brain may be totally concentrated he got painfully to his feet stretched and sat down again this time with one leg extended under the low table and his left elbow resting on the bent knee of the other it was a blessed relief he lifted his tumbler and obediently trembling leaf filled it from a fresh flagon bond downed the sake handed the tumbler to the girl and suddenly crashed his right fist down on the lacquer table so that the little boxes of sweetmeats rattled and the porcelain tinkled he looked belligerently acrossat tiger tanaka right tiger bowed bond bowed back the girl leant forward expectantly tigers eyes bored into bonds trying to read his plan bondhad decided to have no plan display no pattern he would play completely at random showing the symbol that his fist decided to make at the psychological moment after the two hammer blows tiger said three games of three right the two fists rose slowly from the table top quickly hammered twice in unison and shot forward tiger had kept his fist balled in the stone bonds palm was open in the paper that wrapped the stone one up to bond again the ritual and the moment of truth tiger had kept to the stone bonds first and second fingers were open in the scissors blunted by tigers stone one all tiger paused and placed his fist against his forehead he closed his eyes in thought he said yes ive got you bondosan you cant escape good show said bond trying to clear his mind of the suspicion that tiger would keep to the stone or alternatively that tiger would expect him to play it that way expect bond to play the paper and himself riposte with the scissors to cut the paper and so on and so forth the three emblems whirled round in bonds mind like the symbols on a fruit machine the two fists were raised one two forward tiger had kept to his stone bond had wrapped it up with the paper first game to bond the second game lasted longer they both kept on showing the same symbol which meant a replay it was as if the two players were getting the measure of each others psychology but that could not be so since bond had no psychological intent he continued to play at random it was just luck tiger won the game one all last game the two contestants looked at each other bonds smile was bland rather mocking a glint of red shone in the depths of tigers dark eyes bond saw it and said to himself i would be wise to lose or would i he won the game in two straight goes blunting tigers scissors with his stone wrapping tigers stone with his paper tiger bowed low bond bowed even lower he sought for a throwaway remark he said i must get this game adopted in time for your olympics i would certainly be chosen to play for my country tiger tanaka laughed with controlled politeness you play with much insight what was the secret of your method bond had had no method he quickly invented the one that would be most polite to tiger you are a man of rock and steel tiger i guessed that the paper symbol would be the one you would use the least i played accordingly this bit of mumbojumbo got by tiger bowed bond bowed and drank more sake toasting tiger released from the tension the geisha applauded and the madame instructed trembling leaf to give bond another kiss she did so how soft the skins of japanese women were and their touch was almost weightless james bond was plotting the rest of his night when tiger said bondosan i have matters to discuss with you will you do me the honour of coming to my house for a nightcap bond immediately put away his lascivious thoughtsaccording to dikko to be invited to a japanese private house was a most unusual sign of favour so for some reason he had done right to win this childish game this might mean great things bond bowed nothing would give me more pleasure tiger an hour later they were sitting in blessed chairs with a drinktray between them the lights of yokohama glowed a deep orange along the horizon and a slight smell of the harbour and the sea came in through the wideopen partition leading on to the garden tigers house was designed enchantingly as is even the meanest japanese salarymans house to establish the thinnest possible dividing line between the inhabitant and nature the three other partitions in the square room were also fully slid back revealing a bedroom a small study and a passage tiger had opened the partitions when they entered the room he had commented in the west when you have secrets to discuss you shut all the doors and windows in japan we throw everything open to make sure that no one can listen at the thin walls and what i have now to discuss with you is a matter of the very highest secrecy the sake is warm enough you have the cigarettes you prefer then listen to what i have to say to you and swear on your honour to divulge it to no one tiger tanaka gave his great golden shout of mirthless laughter if you were to break your promise i would have no alternative but to remove you from the earth curtains for bond exactly one month before it had been the eve of the annual closing of blades on the next day september those members who were still unfashionably in london would have to pig it for a month at whites or boodles whites they considered noisy andsmart boodles too full of superannuated country squires who would be talking of nothing but the opening of the partridge season for blades it was one month in the wilderness but there it was the staff one supposed had to have their holiday more important there was some painting to be done and there was dryrot in the roof m sitting in the bow window looking out over st jamess street couldnt care less he had two weeks trout fishing on the test to look forward to and for the other two weeks he would have sandwiches and coffee at his desk he rarely used blades and then only to entertain important guests he was not a clubable man and if he had had the choice he would have stuck to the senior that greatest of all services clubs in the world but too many people knew him there and there was too much shop talked and there were too many former shipmates who would come up and ask him what he had been doing with himself since he retired and the lie got a job with some people called universal export bored him and though verifiable had its risks porterfield hovered with the cigars he bent and offered the wide case to ms guest sir james molony raised a quizzical eyebrow i see the havanas are still coming in his hand hesitated he picked out a romeo y julieta pinched it gently and ran it under his nose he turned to m whats universal export sending castro in return blue streak m was not amused porterfield observed that he wasnt as chief petty officer he had served under m in one of his last commands he said quickly but not too quickly as a matter of fact sir james the best of the jamaicans are quite up to the havanas these days theyve got the outer leaf just right at last he closed the glass lid of the case and moved away sir james molony picked up the piercer the head waiter had left on the table and punctured the tip of his cigar with precision he lit a swan vesta and waved its flame to and fro across the tip and sucked gently until he had got the cigar going to his satisfaction then he took a sip first at his brandy and then at his coffee and sat back he observed the corrugated brow of his host with affection and irony he said all right my friend now tell me whats the problem ms mind was elsewhere he seemed to be having difficulty getting his pipe going he said vaguely between puffs what problem sir james molony was the greatest neurologist in england the year before he had been awarded a nobel prize for his now famous some psychosomatic sideeffects of organic inferiority he was also nerve specialist by appointment to the secret service and though he was rarely called in and then only in extremis the problems he was required to solve intrigued him greatly because they were both human and vital to the state and since the war the second qualification was a rare one m turned sideways to his guest and watched the traffic up st jamess sir james molony said my friend like everybody else you have certain patterns of behaviour one of them consists of occasionally asking me to lunch at blades stuffing me like a strasbourg goose and then letting me in on some ghastly secret and asking me to help you with it the last time as i recall you wanted to find out if i could extract certain information from a foreign diplomat by getting him under deep hypnosis without his knowledge you said it was a last resort i said i couldnt help you two weeks later i read in the paper that this same diplomat had come to a fatal end by experimenting with the force of gravity from a tenth floor window the coroner gave an open verdict of the fell or was pushed variety what song am i to sing for my supper this time sir james molony relented he said with sympathy come on m get it off your chest m looked him coldly in the eye its im getting more and more worried about him youve read my two reports on his condition anything new no just the same hes going slowly to pieces late at the office skimps his work makes mistakes hes drinking too much and losing a lot of money at one of these new gambling clubs it all adds up to the fact that one of my best men is on the edge of becoming a security risk absolutely incredible considering his record sir james molony shook his head with conviction its not in the least incredible you either dont read my reports or you dont pay enough attention to them i have said all along that the man is suffering from shock sir james molony leant forward and pointed his cigar at ms chest youre a hard man m in your job you have to be but there are some problems the human ones for instance that you cant always solve with a ropes end this is a case in point heres this agent of yours just as tough and brave as i expect you were at his age hes a bachelor and a confirmed womanizer then he suddenly falls in love partly i suspect because this woman was a bird with a wing down and needed his help its surprising what soft centres these socalled tough men always have so he marries her and within a few hours shes shot dead by this supergangster chap what was his name blofeld said m ernst stavro blofeld all right and your man got away with nothing worse than a crack on the head but then he started going to pieces and your mo thought he might have suffered some brain injury and sent him along to me nothing wrong with him at all nothing physical that is just shock he admitted to me that all his zest had gone that he wasnt interested in his job any more or even in his life i hear this sort of talk from patients every day its a form of psychoneurosis and it can grow slowly or suddenly in your mans case it was brought on out of the blue by an intolerable lifesituation or one that he found intolerable because he had never encountered it before the loss of a loved one aggravated in his case by the fact that he blamed himself for her death now my friend neither you nor i have had to carry such a burden so we dont know how we would react under it but i can tell you that its a hell of a burden to lug around and your mans caving in under it i thought and i said so in my report that his job its dangers and emergencies and so forth would shake him out of it ive found that one must try and teach people that theres no top limit to disaster that so long as breath remains in your body youve got to accept the miseries of life they will often seem infinite insupportable they are part of the human condition have you tried him on any tough assignments in the last few months two said m drearily he bungled them both on one he nearly got himself killed and on the other he made a mistake that was dangerous for others thats another thing that worries me he didnt make mistakes before now suddenly hes become accidentprone another symptom of his neurosis so what are you going to do about it tire him said m brutally just as if hed been shot to pieces or got some incurable disease ive got no room in his section for a lamebrain whatever his past record or whatever excuses you psychologists can find for him pension of course honourable discharge and all that try and find him a job one of these new security organizations for the banks might take him m looked defensively into the clear blue comprehending eyes of the famous neurologist he said seeking support for his decision you do see my point sir james im tightly staffed at headquarters and in the field for that matter theres just no place where i can tuck away so that he wont cause harm youll be losing one of your best men used to be isnt any longer sir james molony sat back he looked out of the window and puffed thoughtfully at his cigar he liked this man bond he had had him as his patient perhaps a dozen times before he had seen how the spirit the reserves in the man could pull him out of badly damaged conditions that would have broken the normal human being he knew how a desperate situation would bring out those reserves again how the will to live would spring up again in a real emergency he remembered how countless neurotic patients had disappeared for ever from his consultingrooms when the last war had broken out the big worry had driven out the smaller ones the greater fear the lesser he made up his mind he turned back to m give him one more chance m if itll help ill take the responsibility what sort of chance are you thinking of well now i dont know much about your line of business m and i dont want to got enough secrets in my own job to look after but havent you got something really sticky some apparently hopeless assignment you can give this man i dont mean necessarily dangerous like assassination or stealing russian ciphers or whatever but something thats desperately important but apparently impossible by all means give him a kick in the pants at the same time if you want to but what he needs most of all is a supreme call on his talents something thatll really make him sweat so that hes simply forced to forget his personal troubles hes a patriotic sort of a chap give him something that really matters to his country it would be easy enough if a war broke out nothing like death or glory to take a man out of himself but cant you dream up something that simply stinks of urgency if you can give him the job it might get him right back on the rails anyway give him the chance yes the urgent thrill of the red telephone that had been silent for so many weeks shot mary goodnight out of her seat at the typewriter as if it had been fitted with a cartridge ejector she dashed through into the next room waited a second to get her breath back and picked up the receiver as if it had been a rattlesnake yes sir no sir its his secretary speaking she looked down at her watch knowing the worst its most unusual sir i dont expect hell be more than a few minutes shall i ask him to call you sir yes sir she put the receiver back on its cradle she noticed that her hand was trembling damn the man where the hell was he she said aloud oh james please hurry she walked disconsolately back and sat down again at her empty typewriter she gazed at the grey keys with unseeing eyes and broadcast with all her telepathic strength james james m wants you m wants you m wants you her heart dropped a beat the syncraphone perhaps just this once he hadnt forgotten it she hurried back into his room and tore open the right hand drawer no there it was the little plastic receiver on which he could have been bleeped by the switchboard the gadget that it was mandatory for all senior headquarters staff to carry when they left the building but for weeks he had been forgetting to carry it or worse not caring if he did or didnt she took it out and slammed it down in the centre of his blotter oh damn you damn you damn you she said out loud and walked back into her room with dragging feet the state of your health the state of the weather the wonders of nature these are things that rarely occupy the average mans mind until he reaches the middle thirties it is only on the threshold of middleage that you dont take them all for granted just part of an unremarkable background to more urgent more interesting things until this year james bond had been more or less oblivious to all of them apart from occasional hangovers and the mending of physical damage that was merely for him the extension of a child falling down and cutting its knee he had taken good health for granted the weather just a question of whether or not he had to carry a raincoat or put the hood up on his bentley convertible as for birds bees and flowers the wonders of nature it only mattered whether or not they bit or stung whether they smelled good or bad but today on the last day of august just eight months as he had reminded himself that morning since tracy had died he sat in queen marys rose garden in regents park and his mind was totally occupied with just these things first his health he felt like hell and knew that he also looked it for months without telling anyone he had tramped harley street wigmore street and wimpole street looking for any kind of doctor who would make him feel better he had appealed to specialists gps quacks even to a hypnotist he had told them i feel like hell i sleep badly i eat practically nothing i drink too much and my work has gone to blazes im shot to pieces make me better and each man had taken his blood pressure a specimen of his urine listened to his heart and chest asked him questions he had answered truthfully and had told him there was nothing basically wrong with him then he had paid his five guineas and gone off to john bell and croyden to have the new lot of prescriptions for tranquillizers sleeping pills energizers made up and now he had just come from breaking off relations with the last resort the hypnotist whose basic message had been that he must go out and regain his manhood by having a woman as if he hadnt tried that the ones who had told him to take it easy up the stairs the ones who had asked him to take them to paris the ones who had inquired indifferently feeling better now dearie the hypnotist hadnt been a bad chap rather a bore about how he could take away warts and how he was persecuted by the bma but bond had finally had enough of sitting in a chair and listening to the quietly droning voice while as instructed he relaxed and gazed at a naked electric light bulb and now he had thrown up the fiftyguinea course after only half the treatment and had come to sit in this secluded garden before going back to his office ten minutes away across the park he looked at his watch just after three oclock and he was due back at twothirty what the hell god it was hot he wiped a hand across his forehead and then down the side of his trousers he used not to sweat like this the weather must be changing atomic bomb whatever the scientists might say to the contrary it would be good to be down somewhere in the south of france somewhere to bathe whenever he wanted but he had had his leave for the year that ghastly month they had given him after tracy then he had gone to jamaica and what hell that had been no bathing wasnt the answer it was all right here really lovely roses to look at they smelled good and it was pleasant looking at them and listening to the faraway traffic nice hum of bees the way they went around the flowers doing their work for their queen must read that book about them by the belgian chap metternich or something same man who wrote about the ants extraordinary purpose in life they didnt have troubles just lived and died did what they were supposed to do and then dropped dead why didnt one see a lot of bees corpses around ants corpses thousands millions of them must die every day perhaps the others ate them oh well better go back to the office and get hell from mary she was a darling she was right to nag at him as she did she was his conscience but she didnt realize the troubles he had what troubles oh well dont lets go into that james bond got to his feet and went over and read the lead labels of the roses he had been gazing at they told him that the bright vermilion ones were super star and the white ones iceberg then with a jumble of his health the heat and the corpses of bees revolving lazily round his mind james bond strolled off in the direction of the tall grey building whose upper storeys showed themselves above the trees it was three thirty only two more hours to go before his next drink the lift man resting the stump of his right arm on the operating handle said your secretarys in a bit of a flap sir been asking everywhere for you thank you sergeant he got the same message when he stepped out at the fifth floor and showed his pass to the security guard at the desk he walked unhurriedly along the quiet corridor to the group of end rooms whose outer door bore the doubleo sign he went through and along to the door marked he closed it behind him mary goodnight looked up at him and said calmly m wants you he rang down half an hour ago whos m mary goodnight jumped to her feet her eyes flashing oh for gods sake james snap out of it here your ties crooked shecame up to him and he docilely allowed her to pull it straight and your hairs all over the place here use my comb bond took the comb and ran it absentmindedly through his hair he said youre a good girl goodnight he fingered his chin suppose you havent got your razor handy must look my best on the scaffold please james her eyes were bright go and get on to him he hasnt talked to you for weeks perhaps its something important something exciting she tried desperately to put encouragement into her voice its always exciting starting a new life anyway whos afraid of the big bad m will you come and lend a hand on my chicken farm she turned away and put her hands up to her face he patted her casually on the shoulder and walked through into his office and went over and picked up the red telephone here sir im sorry sir had to go to the dentist i know sir im sorry i left it in my desk yes sir he put the receiver down slowly he looked round his office as if saying goodbye to it walked out and along the corridor and went up in the lift with the resignation of a man under sentence miss moneypenny looked up at him with illconcealed hostility you can go in bond squared his shoulders and looked at the padded door behind which he had so often heard his fate pronounced almost as if it were going to give him an electric shock he tentatively reached out for the door handle and walked through and closed the door behind him the impossible mission m his shoulders hunched inside the squarecut blue suit was standing by the big window looking out across the park without looking round he said sit down no name no number bond took his usual place across the desk from ms tallarmed chair he noticed that there was no file on the expanse of red leather in front of the chair and the in and out baskets were both empty suddenly he felt really bad about everything about letting m down letting the service down letting himself down this empty desk the empty chair were the final accusation we have nothing for you they seemed to say youre no use to us any more sorry its been nice knowing you but there it is m came over and sat heavily down in the chair and looked across at bond there was nothing to read in the lined sailors face it was as impassive as the polished blue leather of the empty chairback had been m said you know why ive sent for you i can guess sir you can have my resignation m said angrily what in hell are you talking about its not your fault that the doubleo sections been idle for so long its the way things go youve had flat periods before nowmonths with nothing in your line but i made a mess of the last two jobs and i know my medicals been pretty poor these last few months nonsense theres nothing the matter with you youve been through a bad time youve had good reason to be a bit under the weather as for the last two assignments anyone can make mistakes but i cant have idle hands around the place so im taking you out of the doubleo section bonds heart had temporarily risen now it plummeted again the old man was being kind trying to let him down lightly he said then if its all the same to you sir id still like to put in my resignation ive held the doubleo number for too long im not interested in staff work im afraid sir and no good at it either m did something bond had never seen him do before he lifted his right fist and brought it crashing down on the desk who the devil do you think youre talking to who the devil dyou thinks running this show god in heaven i send for you to give you promotion and the most important job of your career and you talk to me about resignation i pigheaded young fool bond was dumbfounded a great surge of excitement ran through him what in hell was all this about he said im terribly sorry sir i thought id been letting the side down lately ill soon tell you when youre letting the side down m thumped the desk for a second time but less hard now listen to me im giving you acting promotion to the diplomatic section four figure number and a thousand a year extra pay you wont know much about the section but i can tell you there are only two other men in it you can keep your present office and your secretary if you like in fact i would prefer it i dont want your change of duty to get about understand yes sir in any case youll be leaving for japan inside a week the chief of staff is handling the arrangements personally not even my secretary knows about it as you can see m waved his hand theres not even a file on the case thats how important it is but why have you chosen me sir bonds heart was thumping this was the most extraordinary change in his fortunes that had ever come about ten minutes before he had been on the rubbish heap his career his life in ruins and now here he was being set up on a pinnacle what the hell was it all about for the simple reason that the jobs impossible no i wont go as far as that lets say totally improbable of success youve shown in the past that you have an aptitude for difficult assignments the only difference here is that there wont be any strongarm stuff m gave a frosty smile none of the gunplay you pride yourself on so much itll just be a question of your wits and nothing else but if you bring it off which i very much doubt you will just about double our intelligence about the soviet union can you tell me some more about it sir have to as theres nothing written down lower echelon stuff about the japanese secret service and so forth you can get from section j the chief of staff will tell colonel hamilton to answer your questions freely though you will tell him nothing about the purpose of your mission understood yes sir well now you know a bit about cryptography the bare bones sir ive preferred to keep clear of the subject better that way in case the opposition ever got hold of me quite right well now the japanese are past masters at it theyve got the right mentality for finicky problems in letters and numbers since the war under cia guidance theyve built incredible cracking machines far ahead of ibm and so forth and for the last year theyve been reading the cream of the soviet traffic from vladivostok and oriental russia diplomatic naval airforce the lot thats terrific sir terrific for the cia arent they passing it on to us sir i thought we were hand in glove with cia all along the line not in the pacific they regard that as their private preserve when allan dulles was in charge we used at least to get digests of any stuff that concerned us but this new man mccone has cracked down on all that hes a good man all right and we get along well personally but hes told me candidly that hes acting under orders national defence council theyre worried about our security cant blame them im equally worried about theirs two of their top cryptographers defected a couple of years ago and they must have blown a lot of the stuff we give the americans trouble with this socalled democracy of ours is that the press get hold of these cases and write them up too big pravda doesnt burst into tears when one of their men come over to us izvestia doesnt ask for a public inquiry somebody in kgb gets hell i suppose but at least theyre allowed to get on with their job instead of having retired members of the supreme soviet pawing through their files and telling them how to run a secret service bond knew that m had tendered his resignation after the prenderghast case this had involved a head of station with homosexual tendencies who had recently amidst worldwide publicity been given thirty years for treason bond himself had had to give evidence in that particular case and he knew that the questions in the house the case at the old bailey and the hearings before the farrer tribunal on the intelligence services that had followed had held up all work at headquarters for at least a month and brought about the suicide of a totally innocent head of section who had taken the whole affair as a direct reflection on his own probity to get m back on the track bond said about this stuff the japanese are getting where do i come in sir m put both hands flat on the table it was the old gesture when he came to the dollar question and bonds heart lifted even further at the sight of it theres a man in tokyo called tiger tanaka head of their secret service cant remember what they call it some unpronounceable japanese rubbish hes quite a man first at oxford came back here and spied for them before the war joined the kempeitai their wartime gestapo trained as a kamikaze and would be dead by now but for the surrender well hes the chap who has control of the stuff we want i want the chiefs of staff want youre to go out there and get it off him how i dont know thats up to you but you can see why i say youre unlikely to succeed hes in fief bond was amused by the old scottish expression to the cia he probably doesnt think much of us ms mouth bent down at the corners people dont these days they may be right or wrong im not a politician he doesnt know much about the service except what hes penetrated or heard from the cia and that wont be greatly to our advantage id say we havent had a station in japan since no traffic it all went to the americans youll be working under the australians they tell me their mans good section j says so too anyway thats the way it is if anyone can bring it off you can care to have a try james ms face was suddenly friendly it wasnt friendly often james bond felt a quick warmth of affection for this man who had ordered his destiny for so long but whom he knew so little his instinct told him that there were things hidden behind this assignment motives which he didnt understand was this a rescue job on him was m giving him his last chance but it sounded solid enough the reasons for it stood up hopeless impossible perhaps why hadnt m chosen a jap speaker bond had never been east of hongkong but then orientalists had their own particular drawbacks too much tied up with tea ceremonies and flower arrangements and zen and so forth no it sounded a true bill he said yes sir id like to have a try m gave an abrupt nod good he leant forward and pressed a button on the intercom chief of staff what number have you allotted to right hes coming to see you straight away m leant back he gave one of his rare smiles youre stuck with your old digit all right four sevens go along and get briefed bond said right sir and er thank you he got up and walked over to the door and let himself out he walked straight over to miss moneypenny and bent down and kissed her on the cheek she turned pink and put a hand up to where he had kissed her bond said be an angel penny and ring down to mary and tell her shes got to get out of whatever shes doing tonight im taking her out to dinner scotts tell her well have our first roast grouse of the year and pink champagne celebration what of miss moneypennys eyes were suddenly wide and excited oh i dont know the queens birthday or something right james bond crossed the room and went into the chief of staffs office miss moneypenny picked up the interoffice telephone and passed on the message in a thrilled voice she said i do think hes all right again mary its all there again like it used to be heaven knows what ms been saying to him he had lunch with sir james molony today dont tell james that but it may have something to do with it hes with the chief of staff now and bill said he wasnt to be disturbed sounds like some kind of a job bill was very mysterious bill tanner late colonel tanner of the sappers and bonds best friend in the service looked up from his heavily laden desk he grinned with pleasure at what he saw he said take a pew james so youve bought it thought you might but its a stinker all right think you can bring it off not an earthly id guess said bond cheerfully this man tanaka sounds a tough nut and im no great hand at diplomacy but why did m pick on me bill i thought i was in the dog house because of messing up those last two jobs i was all set to go into chicken farming now be a good chap and tell me whats the real score bill tanner had been ready for that one he said easily balls james youve been running through a bad patch we all hit em sometimes m just thought youd be the best man for the job you know hes got an entirely misplaced opinion of your abilities anyway itll be a change from your usual roughhousing time you moved up out of that damned doubleo section of yours dont you ever think about promotion absolutely not said bond with fervour as soon as i get back from this caper ill ask for my old number back again but tell me how am i supposed to set about this business whats this australian cover consist of have i got anything to offer this wily oriental in exchange for his jewels hows the stuff to be transmitted back here if i do get my hands on it must be the hell of a lot of traffic he can have the entire product of station h he can send one of his own staffers down to hongkong to sit in with us if he likes hell probably be pretty well off on china already but he wont have anything as high grade as our macao link the blue route hamilton will tell you all about that in tokyo the man youll be working with is an aussie called henderson richard lovelace henderson fancy name but section j and all the old jap hands say hes a good man youll have an australian passport and well fix for you to go out as his number two thatll give you diplomatic status and a certain amount of face which counts for damn near everything out there according to hamilton if you get the stuff henderson will push it back to us through melbourne well give him a communications staff to handle it next question what are the cia going to say about all this after all its barefaced poaching they dont own japan anyway theyre not to know thats up to this fellow tanaka hell have to fix the machinery for getting it into the australian embassy thats his worry but the whole things on pretty thin ice the main problem is to make sure he doesnt go straight along to the cia and tell em of your approach if you get blown well just have to get the australians to hold the baby theyve done it before when weve been bowled out edging our way into the pacific were good friends with their service firstrate bunch of chaps and anyway the cias hands arent as clean as all that weve got a whole file of cases where theyve crossed wires with us round the world often dangerously we can throw that book at mccone if this business blows up in our faces but part of your job is to see that it doesnt seems to me im getting all balled up in high politics not my line of country at all but is this stuff really as vital as m says absolutely if you get hold of it your grateful country will probably buy you that chicken farm youre always talking about so be it now if youll give hamilton a buzz ill go and start learning all about the mysterious east kangei welcome aboard said the pretty kimonoed and obied stewardess of japan air lines as a week later james bond settled into the comfortable window seat of the fourjet turbofan douglas d c at london airport and listened to the torrent of soft japanese coming from the tannoy that would be saying all those things about life jackets and the flying time to orly the sickbags in case of motion disturbance were embellished with pretty bamboo emblems and according to the exquisitely bound travel folder the random scribbles on the luggage rack above his head werethe traditional and auspicious tortoiseshell motif the stewardess bowed and handed him a dainty fan a small hot towel in a wickerbasket and a sumptuous menu that included a note to the effect that an assortment of cigarettes perfumes and pearls were available for sale then they were off with pounds of thrust on the first leg of the four that would take the good aircraft yoshino over the north pole to tokyo bond gazed at the picture of three oranges in a blue bowl that faced him and when the aircraft flattened out at feet ordered the first of the chain of brandies and ginger ales that was to sustain him over the channel a leg of the north sea the kattegat the arctic ocean the beaufort sea the bering sea and the north pacific ocean and decided that whatever happened on this impossible assignment he would put up no resistance to his old skin being sloughed off him on the other side of the world by the time he was admiring the huge stuffed polar bear at anchorage in alaska the embrace of jals soft wings had persuaded him that he didnt even mind if the colour of the new skin was to be yellow dikko on the ginza the huge right fist crashed into the left palm with the noise of a pistol shot the great square face of the australian turned almost purple and the veins stood out on the grizzled temples with controlled violence but almost under his breath he intoned savagely i bludge thou bludgest he bludges we bludge you bludge they all bludge he reached under the low table and then seemed to think better of it and moved his hand to the glass of sake picked it up and poured it down his throat without a swallow bond said mildly take it easy dikko whats bitten you and what does this vulgarsounding colonial expression mean richard lovelace henderson of her majestys australian diplomatic corps looked belligerently round the small crowded bar in a bystreet off the ginza and said out of the corner of his large and usually cheerful mouth that was now turned down in bitterness and anger you stupid pommy bastard weve been miked that bludger tanakas miked us here under the table see the little wire down the leg and see that wingy over at the bar chap with one arm looking bloody respectable in his blue suit and black tie thats one of tigers men i can smell em by now theyve been tailing me off and on for ten years tiger dresses em all like little cia gentlemen you watch out for any jap whos drinking western and wearing that rig all tigers men he grumbled damn good mind to go over and call the bastard bond said well if were being miked all thisll make sweet reading for mr tanaka tomorrow morning what the hell said dikko henderson resignedly the old bastard knows what i think of him now hell just have it in writing teach him to stop leaning on me and my friends he added with a blistering glance at bond its really you he wants to size up and i dont mind if he hears me saying so bludger well hear me now tiger this is the great australian insult you can use it anyways he raised his voice but in general it means a worthless pervert ponce scoundrel liar traitor and rogue with no redeeming feature and i hope your stewed seaweed sticks in your gullet at breakfast tomorrow when you know what i think of you bond laughed the torrent of powerful swearwords had started its ceaseless flow the day before at the airport haneda the field of wings it had taken bond nearly an hour to extract his single suitcase from the customs area and he had emerged fuming into the central hall only to be jostled and pushed aside by an excited crowd of young japanese bearing paper banners that said international laundry convention bond was exhausted from his flight he let out one single fourletter expletive behind him a big voice repeated the same word and added some more thats my boy thats the right way to greet the east youll be needing all those words and more before youre through with the area bond had turned the huge man in the rumpled grey suit thrust out a hand as big as a small ham glad to meet you im henderson as you were the only pommy on the plane i guess youre bond here give me that bag got a car outside and the sooner we get away from this blankety blank madhouse the better henderson looked like a middleaged prize fighter who has retired and taken to the bottle his thin suit bulged with muscle round the arms and shoulders and with fat round the waist he had a craggy sympathetic face rather stony blue eyes and a badly broken nose he was sweating freely and as he barged his way through the crowd using bonds suitcase as a battering ram he extracted a rumpled square of terry cloth from his trouserpocket and wiped it round his neck and face the crowd parted unresentfully to let the giant through and bond followed in his wake to a smart toyopet saloon waiting in a noparking area the chauffeur got out and bowed henderson fired a torrent of instructions at him in fluent japanese and followed bond into the back seat settling himself with a grunt taking you to your hotel first the okura latest of the western ones american tourist got murdered at the royal oriental the other day and we dont want to lose you all that soon then well do a bit of serious drinking had some dinner about six of them as far as i can remember j al certainly takes good care of your stomach why did you choose the willowpattern route how was the old ruptured duck they told me the bird was a crane very dainty but efficient thought i might as well practise being inscrutable before plunging into all this bond waved at the cluttered shambles of the tokyo suburbs through which they were tearing at what seemed to bond a suicidal speed doesnt look the most attractive city in the world and why are we driving on the left god knows said henderson moodily the bloody japs do everything the wrong way round read the old instruction books wrong i daresay light switches go up instead of down taps turn to the left door handles likewise why they even race their horses clockwise instead of anticlockwise like civilized people as for tokyo its bloody awful its either too hot or too cold or pouring with rain and theres an earthquake about every day but dont worry about them they just make you feel slightly drunk the typhoons are worse if one starts to blow go into the stoutest bar you can see and get drunk but the first ten years are the worst its got its point when you know your way around bloody expensive if you live western but i stick to the back alleys and do all right really quite exhilarating got to know the lingo though and when to bow and take off your shoes and so on youll have to get the basic routines straight pretty quickly if youre going to make any headway with the people youve come to see underneath the stiff collars and striped pants in the government departments theres still plenty of the old samurai tucked away i laugh at them for it and they laugh back because theyve got to know my line of patter but that doesnt mean i dont bow from the waist when i know its expected of me and when i want something youll get the hang of it all right henderson fired some japanese at the driver who had been glancing frequently in his driving mirror the driver laughed and replied cheerfully thought so said henderson weve got ourselves a tail typical of old tiger i told him you were staying at the okura but he wants to make sure for himself dont worry its just part of his crafty ways if you find one of his men breathing down your neck in bed tonight or a girl if youre lucky just talk to them politely and theyll bow and hiss themselves out but a solitary sleep had followed the serious drinking in the bamboo bar of the okura and the next day had been spent doing the sights and getting some cards printed that described bond as second secretary in the cultural department of the australian embassy they know thats our intelligence side said henderson and they know im the head of it and youre my temporary assistant so why not spell it out for them and that evening they had gone for more serious drinking to hendersons favourite bar melodys off the ginza where everybody called henderson dikko or dikkosan and where they were ushered respectfully to the quiet corner table that appeared to be his stammtisch and now henderson reached under the table and with a powerful wrench pulled out the wires and left them hanging ill give that black bastard melody hell for this when i get around to it he said belligerently and to think of all ive done for the dingo bastard used to be a favourite pub of the english colony and the press club layabouts had a good restaurant attached to it thats gone now the eyteye cook trod on the cat and spilled the soup and he picked up the cat and threw it into the cooking stove of course that got around pretty quick and all the animallovers and sanctimonious bastards got together and tried to have melodys licence taken away i managed to put in squeeze in the right quarter and saved him but everyone quit his restaurant and he had to close it im the only regular whos stuck to him and now he goes and does this to me oh well hell have had the squeeze put on him i suppose anyway thats the end of the tape so far as tts concerned ill give him hell too he ought to have learned by now that me and my friends dont want to assassinate the emperor or blow up the diet or something dikko glared around him as if he proposed to do both those things now then james to business ive fixed up for you to meet tiger tomorrow morning at eleven ill pick you up and take you there the bureau of allasian folkways i wont describe it to you itd spoil it now i dont really know what youre here for spate of top secret cables from melbourne to be deciphered by yours truly in person thanks very much and my ambassador jim saunderson good bloke says he doesnt want to know anything about it thinks itd be even better if he didnt meet you at all okay with you no offence but hes a wise guy and likes to keep his hands clean and i dont want to know anything about your job either that way youre the only one who gets the powdered bamboo in his coffee but i gather you want to get some highpowered gen out of tiger without the cia knowing anything about it right well thats going to be a dicey business tigers a career man with a career mind although on the surface hes a hundred per cent demokorasu hes a deep one very deep indeed the american occupation and the american influence here look like a very solid basis for a total americanjapanese alliance but once a jap always a jap its the same with all the other great nations chinese russian german english its their bones that matter not their lying faces and all those races have got tremendous bones compared with the bones the smiles or scowls dont mean a thing and time means nothing for them either ten years is the blink of a star for the big ones get me so tiger and his superiors who i suppose are the diet and in the end the emperor will look at your proposition principally from two angles is it immediately desirable today or is it a longterm investment something that may pay off for the country in ten twenty years and if i were you id stick to that spiel the longterm talk these people people like tiger whos an absolutely top man in japan dont think in terms of days or months or years they think in terms of centuries quite right when you come to think of it dikko henderson made a wide gesture with his left hand bond decided that dikko was getting cheerfully tight he had found a palomar pony to run with they must be rare enough in tokyo they were both past the eighth flask of sake but dikko had also laid a foundation of suntory whisky in the okura while hed been waiting for bond to write out an innocuous cable to melbourne with the prefix informationwise which meant that it was for mary goodnight to announce his arrival and give his current address but it was all right with bond that dikko should be getting plastered he would talk better and looser and in the end wiser that way and bond wanted to pick his brains bond said but what sort of a chap is this tanaka is he your enemy or your friend both more of a friend probably at least id guess so i amuse him his cia pals dont he loosens up with me weve got things in common we share a pleasure in the delights of samsara wine and women hes a great cocksman i also have ambitions in that direction ive managed to keep him out of two marriages trouble with tiger is he always wants to marry em hes paying cocktax thats alimony in the australian vernacular to three already so hes acquired an on with regard to me thats an obligation almost as important in the japanese way of life as face when you have an on youre not very happy until youve discharged it honourably if youll pardon the bad pun and if a man makes you a present of a salmon you mustnt repay him with a shrimp its got to be with an equally larg salmon larger if possible so that then youve jumped the man and now he has an on with regard to you and youre quids in morally socially and spiritually and the last ones the most important well now tigers on towards me is a very powerful one very difficult to discharge hes paid little slices of it off with various intelligence dope hes paid off another big slice by accepting your presence here and giving you an interview so soon after your arrival if youd been an ordinary supplicant it might have taken you weeks hed have given you a fat dose of shikirinaoshi thats making you wait giving you the great stone face the sumo wrestlers use it in the ring to make an opponent look and feel small in front of the audience got it so you start with that in your favour he would be predisposed to do what you want because that would remove all his on towards me and by his accounting stick a whole packet of on on my back towards him but its not so simple as that all japanese have permanent on towards their superiors the emperor their ancestors and the japanese gods this they can only discharge by doing the right thing not easy youll say because how can you know what the higher echelon thinks is the right thing well you get out of that by doing what the bottom of the ladder thinks right ie your immediate superiors that passes the buck psychologically on to the emperor and hes got to make his peace with ancestors and gods but thats all right with him because he embodies all the echelons above him so he can get on with dissecting fish which is his hobby with a clear conscience got it its not really as mysterious as it sounds much the same routine as operates in big corporations like ici or shell or in the services except with them the ladder stops at the board of directors or the chiefs of staff its easier that way you dont have to involve the almighty and your greatgrandfather in a decision to cut the price of aspirin by a penny a bottle it doesnt sound very demokorasu to me of course it isnt you dumb bastard for gods sake get it into your head that the japanese are a separate human species theyve only been operating as a civilized people in the debased sense we talk about it in the west for fifty at the most a hundred years scratch a russian and youll find a tartar scratch a japanese and youll find a samurai or what he thinks is a samurai most of this samurai stuff is a myth like the wild west bunk the americans are brought up on or your knights in shining armour at king arthurs court just because people play baseball and wear bowler hats doesnt mean theyre quote civilized unquote just to show you im getting rather tight not drunk mark youid add that the un are going to reap the father and mother of a whirlwind by quote liberating unquote the colonial peoples give em a thousand years yes but give em ten no youre only taking away their blowpipes and giving them machine guns just you wait for the first one to start crying to high heaven for nuclear fission because they must have quote parity unquote with the lousy colonial powers ill give you ten years for that to happen my friend and when it does ill dig myself a deep hole in the ground and sit in it bond laughed that also doesnt sound very demokorasu i fornicate upon thy demokorasu as brother hemingway would have said i stand for government by an elite dikko henderson downed his ninth pint of sake and voting graded by each individuals rating in that elite and one tenth of a vote for my government if you dont agree with me for gods sake dikko plow in hell did we get on to politics lets go and get some food ill agree theres a certain aboriginal common sense in what you say dont talk to me about the aborigines what in hell do you think you know about the aborigines do you know that in my country theres a move afoot not afoot at full gallop to give the aborigines the vote you pommy poofter you give me any more of that liberal crap and ill have your balls for a bowtie bond said mildly whats a poofter what youd call a pansy no dikko henderson got to his feet and fired a string of what sounded like lucid japanese at the man behind the bar before i condemn you utterly well go and eat eelsplace where you can get a serious bottle of plonk to match then well go to the house of total delight after that i will give you my honest verdict honestly come by bond said youre a nogood kangaroo bum dikko but i like eels as long as theyre not jellied ill pay for them and for the later relaxation you pay for the rice wine and the plonk whatever that is take it easy the wingy at the bar has an appraising look i come to appraise mr richard lovelace henderson not to bury him dikko henderson produced a wad of thousand yen notes and began counting them out for the waiter not yet that is he walked with careful majesty up to the bar and addressed himself to the large negro in a plumcoloured coat behind it melody be ashamed of yourself then he led the way with massive dignity out of the bar magic dikko henderson came to fetch bond at ten oclock next morning he was considerably overhung the hard blue eyes were veined with blood and he made straight for the bamboo bar and ordered himself a double brandy and ginger ale bond said mildly you shouldnt have poured all that sake on top of the suntory i cant believe japanese whisky makes a good foundation for anything youve got something there sport ive got myself a proper futsukayoi honourable hangover mouth like a vultures crutch soon as we got home from that lousy cat house i had to go for the big spit but youre wrong about suntory its a good enough brew stick to the cheapest the white label at around fifteen bob a bottle there are two smarter brands but the cheap ones the best went up to the distillery some whiles ago and met one of the family told me an interesting thing about whisky he said you can only make good whisky where you can take good photographs ever heard that one said it was something to do with the effect of clear light on the alcohol but did i talk a lot of crap last night or did you seem to recollect that one of us did you only gave me hell about the state of the world and called me a poofter but you were quite friendly about it no offence given or taken oh christ dikko henderson gloomily pushed a hand through his tough grizzled hair but i didnt hit anyone only that girl you slapped so hard on the bottom that she fell down oh that said dikko henderson with relief that was just a lovepat whats a girls bottom for anyway and so far as i recall they all screamed with laughter including her right how did you make out with yours by the way she looked pretty enthusiastic she was good show he swallowed the remains of his drink and got to his feet come on bud lets go wouldnt do to keep tiger waiting i once did and he wouldnt speak to me for a week it was a typical tokyo day in late summer hot sticky and grey the air full of fine dust from the endless demolition and reconstruction work they drove for half an hour towards yokohama and pulled up outside a dull grey building which announced itself in large letters to be the bureau of allasian folkways there was a busy traffic of japanese scurrying in and out through the bogusly importantlooking entrance but no one glanced at dikko and bond and they were not asked their business as dikko led the way through an entrance hall where there were books and postcards on sale as if the place were some kind of museum dikko made for a doorway marked coordination department and there was a long corridor with open rooms on both sides the rooms were full of studiouslooking young men at desks there were large wall maps with coloured pins dotted across them and endless shelves of books a door marked international relations gave on to another corridor this time lined with closed doors which had peoples names on them in english and japanese a sharp right turn took them through the visual presentation bureau with more closed doors and on to documentation a large hallshaped library with more people bent over desks here for the first time they were scrutinized by a man at a desk near the entrance he rose to his feet and bowed wordlessly as they walked on dikko said quietly this is where the cover tapers off up till now all those people really were researching asian folkways but these here are part of tigers outside staff doing more or less classified work sort of archivists this is where wed be politely turned back if wed lost our way behind a final wall of bookshelves that stretched out into the room a small door was concealed it was marked proposed extension to documentation department danger construction work in progress from behind it came the sound of drills a circular saw cutting through the wood and other building noises dikko walked through the door into a totally empty room with a highlypolished wood floor there was no sign of construction work dikko laughed at bonds surprise he gestured towards a large metal box fitted to the back of the door through which they had come tape recorder he said clever gimmick sounds just like the real thing and this he pointed to the stretch of bare floor ahead is what the japanese call a nightingale floor relic of the old days when people wanted to be warned of intruders serves the same purpose here imagine trying to get across here without being heard they set off and immediately the cunningly sprung boards gave out penetrating squeaks and groans in a small facing door a spyhole slid open and one large eye surveyed them the door opened to reveal a stocky man in plain clothes who had been sitting at a small deal table reading a book it was a tiny boxlike room that seemed to have no other exit the man bowed dikko said some phrases containing the words tanakasan the man bowed again dikko turned to bond youre on your own now be in it champ tigerll send you back to your hotel see you bond said tell mother i died game and walked into the little box and the door was closed behind him there was a row of buttons by the desk and the guard pressed one of them there came a barely perceptible whine and bond got the impression of descent so the room was a lift what a box of tricks the formidable tiger had erected as a screen for himself the authentic eastern nest of boxes what next the descent continued for some time when it stopped the guard opened the door and bond stepped out and stood stock still he was standing on the platform of an underground station there it all was the red and green signals over the two yawning tunnels the conventional white tiles on the walls and the curved roof even an empty cigarette kiosk let into the wall beside him a man had come out of this he now said in good english please to follow me commander and led the way through an arch marked exit but here all the floor space of the hall that would one day lead to the moving stairways was occupied by trim prefabricated offices on both sides of a wide corridor bond was led into the first of these which revealed itself as a waitingroom and outer office a male secretary rose from his typewriter bowed and went through a communicating door he immediately reappeared bowed again and held the door open please to come this way commander bond went through and the door was softly closed behind him the big square figure that dikko had described to him came forward across the handsome red carpet and held out a hand that was hard and dry my dear commander good morning it is a great pleasure to meet you the wide goldtoothed smile signalled welcome the eyes glittered between long dark lashes that were almost feminine come and sit down how do you like my offices rather different from your own chiefs no doubt but the new underground will take another ten years to complete and there is little office space in tokyo it crossed my mind to make use of this disused station it is quiet it is private it is also cool i shall be sorry when the trains are required to run and we shall have to move out bond took the proffered chair across the empty desk from tanaka its a brilliant idea and i enjoyed the folkways above our heads are there really so many people in the world interested in folkways tiger tanaka shrugged what does it matter the literature is given away free i have never asked the director who reads it americans i expect and germans perhaps some swiss the seriousminded can always be found for such stuff it is an expensive conceit of course but fortunately the expense is not carried by the ministry of internal affairs with whom i am concerned down here we have to count our pennies i suppose it is the same with your own budget bond assumed that this man would know the published facts of the secret service vote he said under ten million pounds a year doesnt go far when there is the whole world to cover the teeth glistened under the neon strip lighting at least for the last ten years you have saved money by closing down your activities in this part of the world yes we rely on the cia to do our work here for us they are most efficient and helpful as much so under mccone as under dulles the old fox nearly so nowadays they are even more inclined to regard the pacific as their own back garden from which you wish to borrow the mowing machine without them knowing tigers smile was even more tigerish bond had to laugh the wily devil had certainly been putting two and two together when bond laughed tiger also laughed but carefully bond said we had a man called captain cook and various others who discovered much of this garden australia and new zealand are two very great countries you must admit that our interest in this half of the world is perfectly legitimate my dear commander you were lucky that we struck at pearl harbour rather than at australia can you doubt that we would have occupied that country and new zealand if we had done otherwise these are big and important land spaces insufficiently developed you could not have defended them the americans would not have if our policy had been different we would now own half the british commonwealth personally i have never understood the strategy behind pearl harbour did we wish to conquer america the supply lines were too long but australia and new zealand were ripe for the plucking he pushed forward a large box of cigarettes do you smoke these are shinsei it is an acceptable brand james bond was running out of his morland specials he would soon have to start on the local stuff he also had to collect his thoughts this was rather like being involved in a summit meeting between the united kingdom and japan he felt way out of his depth he took a cigarette and lit it it burned rapidly with something of the effect of a slowburning firework it had a vague taste of american blends but it was good and sharp on the palate and lungs like proof spirits he let the smoke out in a quiet hiss and smiled mr tanaka these are matters for political historians i am concerned with much lower matters and matters concerning the future rather than the past i quite understand commander tiger tanaka was obviously displeased that his game of generalities had been dodged by bond but we have a saying speak of next year and the devil laughs the future is inscrutable but tell me what are your impressions of japan you have been enjoying yourself i imagine that one always enjoys oneself with dikko henderson yes he is a man who lives as if he were going to die tomorrow this is a correct way to live he is a good friend of mine i greatly enjoy his company we have certain tastes in common bond said ironically folkways exactly he has a great affection for you i do not know him well but i suspect that he is a lonely man it is an unfortunate combination to be both lonely and intelligent wouldnt it be a good thing for him to marry a japanese girl and settle down couldnt you find him one bond was pleased that the conversation had descended to personalities he sensed that he was on the right track at least on a better track than this talk about power politics but there would come a bad moment when he would have to get down to business he didnt care for the prospect as if he had sensed this tiger tanaka said i have arranged for our friend to meet many japanese girls the result in every case has been negative or at the best fleeting but tell me commander we have not met here to discuss mr hendersons private life in what respect can i be of service to you is it the lawn mower bond smiled it is the manufacturers trade mark for this particular implement is magic ah yes a most valuable implement of many uses i can understand that your country would wish to have the services of this implement a case in point is an example of its capabilities which came into my hands only this morning tiger tanaka opened a drawer in his desk and extracted a file it was a pale green file stamped in a square box with the word gokuhi in black japanese and roman characters bond assumed this to be the equivalent of top secret he put this to mr tanaka who confirmed it mr tanaka opened the file and extracted two sheets of yellow paper bond could see that one was covered with japanese ideograms and that the other had perhaps fifty lines of typewriting mr tanaka slipped the typewritten one across the desk he said may i beg you on oath not to reveal to anyone what you are about to read if you insist mr tanaka i am afraid i must commander so be it bond drew the sheet of paper towards him the text was in english this is what it said to all stations of grade two and above to be deciphered by addressee personally and then destroyed when destruction has been effected confirm by the code word quote saturn unquote text begins in amplification of number ones published speech to the supreme soviet on september first this confirms that we are in possession of the two hundred megaton weapon and that a test firing will take place on september twentieth at high altitude in the novaya zemlya area stop considerable fallout can be expected and public outcry can be anticipated in the arctic north pacific and alaskan areas stop this should be countered and will be countered from moscow by reference to the more recent tests by america and to number ones repeated demands for an end to tests of nuclear fission weapons of offence which have successively been rebuffed stop for information the delivery of one such weapon by icbm on london would destroy all life and property south of a line drawn between newcastle and carlisle stop it follows that a second missile dropped in the neighbourhood of aberdeen would inevitably result in the total destruction of britain and all ireland stop this fact will shortly be employed by number one as the teeth in a diplomatic demarche designed to achieve the removal of all american bases and offensive weapons from britain and the nuclear disarmament of britain itself stop this will test to the uttermost and probably destroy the anglo hyphen american alliance since it can be assumed that america will not risk a nuclear war involving her territory for the sake of rescuing a now more or less valueless ally dash an ally now openly regarded in washington as of little more account than belgium or italy stop if this diplomatic demarche comma which must of course be categorized as carrying some degree of risk comma is successful it follows that similar demarches will be undertaken in europe and later in the pacific area comma individual countries being singled out one by one for terrorization and demoralization stop the final fruits of this grand stratagem if successful will guarantee the security of the ussr for the foreseeable future and ultimately result in peaceful coexistence with america stop peaceful intent of the ussr will therefore be emphasized throughout by number one and by all government agencies stop this line of reasoning you will also follow should your station be at any time involved or affected stop informatively all soviet citizens working in britain will be withdrawn from that country one week before the initial demarche stop no explanation will be given but a considerable and desirable heightening of tension will thus be achieved stop the same procedure which can be categorized as a softening up of the target country will be followed in the secondary demarches referred to above stop for the time being you should take no precautionary steps on your station except to prepare your mind in total secrecy for the eventuality that your station may become involved at some later date and that evacuation of your staff and the burning of archives will become mandatory on receipt of the code word quote lightning unquote addressed to you personally over circuit forty hyphen four stop end of text signed central james bond pushed the document away from him as if he feared contamination from it he let out his breath in a quiet hiss he reached for the box of shinsei and lit one drawing the harsh smoke deep down into his lungs he raised his eyes to mr tanakas which were regarding him with polite interest i suppose number one is khrushchev that is correct and the meaning of stations grade two and above is consulates general and embassies it is interesting material is it not it is a mistake that you are keeping this material from us we have a treaty of friendship and a trade treaty with you do you not regard the withholding of this vital information as a dishonourable act honour is a very serious word in japan commander would it not be even more dishonourable to break our word to our good american friends they have several times assured me and my government that any information of vital importance to our other friends and allies will be passed on to them in such a way as not to divulge the source i have no evidence that they are not pursuing this routine you know as well as i do mr tanaka that rewriting and doctoring to conceal the source reduces this type of material to a grade no higher than secret reports from countless other delicate and reliable sources the nature of this particular source the fact that one is reading the very words of the enemy is at least fifty per cent of the value of the information this message contains no doubt washington will pass on a garbled version of this message to london i hope they already have but you realize that it might be in their interests to keep quiet about this terrible threat that hangs over england at the same time it is in englands interest to use every hour in devising some counter to this plan one small step which at once comes to mind is preparations for the internment of all soviet citizens in britain at the first sign of the evacuation measures mentioned in the message i appreciate your point of view commander there is of course in this instance an alternative route for this information to reach your government mr tanakas face crinkled wickedly bond leant urgently over the desk but i gave my word of honour mr tanakas face underwent a curious change all the upward lines turned downwards the dark eyes lost their glitter and assumed an inward look in a curious way the whole face slumped into melancholy he said commander i was very happy in england your people were very good to me i repaid them in an unworthy fashion i plead youth and the heat of a war that i thought would bring much glory to my country i was mistaken we were defeated the expiation of that dishonour is a large matter a matter for the youth of this country i am not a politician and i do not know what course that expiation will take at present we are going through the usual transition period of the vanquished but i tanaka have my own private accounting to balance i am in great debt to your country this morning i have betrayed a state secret to you i was encouraged in my action by my friendship for dikko i was also encouraged by the sincerity of your bearing and the honesty of your approach to the duty that has been laid upon you i fully realize the importance of this piece of paper to britain you remember its contents exactly i think and you are on your honour not to communicate it elsewhere yes tiger tanaka got to his feet and held out his hand goodbye for the time being commander i hope that we shall be seeing more of each other the powerful face lit up again now there was no pretence in the great golden smile honour is a pattern of behaviour commander the bamboo must bend to the breeze but equally the cedar must bend to the typhoon the meaning of this is that sometimes duty is more compelling than any words a car is waiting to take you back to your hotel please give my deep respects to dikko and tell him he owes me one thousand yen for repairs to electronic equipment that is the property of the state james bond took the hard dry paw he said from his heart thank you mr tanaka he walked out of the little secret room with one thought uppermost in his mind how fast were dikkos communications to melbourne how fast from melbourne to london tiger tiger and now it was a month later and mr tanaka had become tiger and commander bond had become bondosan tiger had explained his name for james bond james he had said that is a difficult work in japanese and it does not convey sufficient respect bondsan is too much like the japanese word bonsan which means a priest a greybeard the hard consonants at the end of bond are also not easy for the japanese and when these occur in a foreign word we add an o so you are bondosan that is acceptable does bondo mean a pig or anything like that in japanese no it has no meaning forgive my asking the japanese seem to enjoy many private jokes at the expense of the gaijin i referred the other day to a friend of mine called monkey mccall whom we used to call munko you told me that this was an unmentionable word in your language so i thought bondo might be equally unmentionable have no fear it is totally respectable the weeks had passed without any significant progress in bonds mission except in the direction of what seemed to be a genuine friendship between bond tiger and dikko outside working hours the three men became wellnigh inseparable but bond sensed that on their excursions into the countryside and during their roistering in the evenings he was being constantly but with great discretion sized up dikko had confirmed bonds impression i think youre making progress champ tiger would regard it as dishonourable to lead you up the garden path and then pull the rug out from under you with a flat refusal somethings definitely cooking in the background but what it is i havent the faintest idea i guess the balls with tigers superiors but with tiger on your side and in the vernacular tigers got whats called a broad face that means he has great powers as a fixer and this on hes got in respect of britain is a huge factor in your favour what he gave you on your first meeting was an unheardof presento as we call it here but watch out youre piling up a great heap of on in respect of tiger and if it comes to striking a bargain i hope youve got a pretty massive presento up your sleeve so that the on on both sides is more or less evenly balanced none of this salmon and shrimp business have got can do im not so sure said bond doubtfully the macao blue route material had already dwindled in his mind to the size of a minnow in comparison with the salmon that was tigers to give or withhold the impact of the single slice he had handed bond had already been formidable the test of the zoomegaton bomb had duly taken place and had been greeted by the public uproar anticipated by moscow but counteraction by the west had been swift on the excuse of protecting soviet personnel in england from demonstrations of public animosity they had been confined within a radius of twenty miles of their homes and for their protection police were thick round the soviet embassy the consulates and their various trading offices there had of course been reprisals on british diplomats and journalists in russia but these were to have been expected then president kennedy had come out with the strongest speech of his career and had committed total reprisals from the united states in the event of a single nuclear device being exploded by the soviet union in any country in the world outside soviet territory this thundering pronouncement which had produced a growl of dismay from the american maninthestreet was greeted from moscow by the feeble riposte that they would take similar action in answer to any western nuclear device exploded on the territory of the ussr or her allies a few days later bond had been summoned again to tigers underground hideout you will not of course repeat this tiger had said with his wicked smile but action in respect of the matter of which you are privately aware has been indefinitely postponed by the central authority thank you for this private information bond had said but you do realize how your kindness of three weeks ago has greatly alleviated the international tension particularly in relation to my country my country would be immensely grateful if they knew of your personal generosity to me have i grounds for hoping for your further indulgence bond had got used to the formalities of oriental circumlocution although he had not yet attained the refinements of dikkos speech with tiger which included at least one fourletter word in each flowery sentence and which caused tiger much amusement bondosan this implement which you wish to rent from us in the most improbable event that it is made available will command a very high price as a fair trader what has your country to offer in exchange for the full use of magic we have a most important intelligence network in china known as the macao blue route the fruits of this source would be placed entirely at your disposal melancholy settled over tigers massive face but deep down in the tartar eyes there was a wicked gleam i am very much afraid that i have bad news for you bondosan blue route has been penetrated by my organization almost since its inception we already receive the entire fruits of that source i could show you the files if you wish we have simply renamed it route orange and i admit that the material is very acceptable but we already have it what other goods had you in mind for exchange bond had to laugh the pride of section j and of m for that matter the work the expense the danger of running the blue route and at least fifty per cent in aid of japan by god his eyes were being opened on this trip this news would put a fine cat among the pigeons at hq he said blandly we have many other commodities now that you have demonstrated the undoubted value of your implement may i suggest that you name your price you believe that you have something on your shelves that is of comparable value perhaps material from a similar though no doubt inferior source that would be of equal importance in the defence of our country undoubtedly said bond staunchly but my dear tiger would it not be a good idea once your mind is made up for you to pay a visit to london and inspect the shelves for yourself i am sure my chief would be honoured to receive you you do not possess full powers of negotiation that would be impossible my dear tiger our security is such that even i have not full knowledge of all our merchandise so far as i personally am concerned i am only in a position to pass on to my chief the substance of what you say or to render you any other personal services you might ask of me for a moment tiger tanaka looked thoughtful he seemed to be turning bonds last words over in his mind then he closed the interview with the invitation to the geisha restaurant and bond went off with mixed feelings to report to melbourne and london what he had gleaned in the room where he now sat after the geisha party and where tiger had just cheerfully threatened him with death tigers heads snarled at him from the walls and gnashed at him from the floor his ashtray was enclosed in a stuffed tigers paw and the chair in which he was sitting was upholstered in tigers skin mr tanaka had been born in the year of the tiger whereas bond as tiger had taken much pleasure in telling him had been born in the year of the rat bond took a deep drink of sake and said my dear tiger i would hate to put you to the inconvenience of having to remove me from the face of the earth you mean that this time the cedar may not bow before the typhoon so be it this time you have my very topmost word of honour tiger pulled up a chair and faced bond across the low drink table he poured himself a liberal tot of suntory and splashed in the soda the sound of night traffic from the main tokyoyokohama road came in from some way beyond the surrounding houses only a few of which now showed dollshouse squares of yellow light it was the end of september but warm it was ten minutes to midnight tiger began talking in a soft voice in that case my dear bondosan and since i know you to be a man of honour except of course in matters affecting your country which this does not i will tell you quite an interesting story this is how it is he got out of his chair and sat down on the tatami and arranged himself in the lotus position he was obviously more comfortable in this posture he said in an expository tone of voice ever since the beginning of the era of meiji who you will know was the emperor who fathered the modernization and westernization of japan from the beginning of his reign nearly a hundred years ago there have from time to time been foreigners who have come to this country and settled here they have for the most part been cranks and scholars and the europeanborn american lafcadio hearn who became a japanese citizen is a very typical example in general they have been tolerated usually with some amusement so perhaps would be a japanese who bought a castle in the highlands of scotland and who learned and spoke gaelic with his neighbours and expressed unusual and often impertinent interest in scottish folkways if he went about his researches politely and peaceably he would be dubbed an amiable eccentric and so it has been with the westerners who have settled and spent their lives in japan though occasionally in time of war as would no doubt be the case with our mythical japanese in scotland they have been regarded as spies and suffered internment and hardship now since the occupation there have been many such settlers the great majority of whom as you can imagine have been american the oriental way of life is particularly attractive to the american who wishes to escape from a culture which i am sure you will agree has become to say the least of it more and more unattractive except to the lower grades of the human species to whom bad but plentiful food shiny toys such as the automobile and the television and the quick buck often dishonestly earned or earned in exchange for minimal labour or skills are the summum bonum if you will allow the sentimental echo from my oxford education i will said bond but is this not a picture of the life that is being officially encouraged in your own country tiger tanakas face darkened perceptibly for the time being he said with distaste we are being subjected to what i can best describe as the scuola di cocacola baseball amusement arcades hot dogs hideously large bosoms neon lighting these are the part of our payment for defeat in battle they are the tepid tea of the way of life we know under the name of demokorasu they are a frenzied denial of the official scapegoats for our defeat a denial of the spirit of the samurai as expressed in the kamikaze a denial of our ancestors a denial of our gods they are a despicable way of life tiger almost spat the words but fortunately they are also expendable and temporary they have as much importance in the history of japan as the life of a dragonfly he paused but to return to my story our american residents are of a sympathetic type on a low level of course they enjoy the subservience which i may say is only superficial of our women they enjoy the remaining strict patterns of our life the symmetry compared with the chaos that reigns in america they enjoy our simplicity with its underlying hint of deep meaning as expressed for instance in the tea ceremony flower arrangements no plays none of which of course they understand they also enjoy because they have no ancestors and probably no family life worth speaking of our veneration of the old and our worship of the past for in their impermanent world they recognize these as permanent things just as in their ignorant and childish way they admire the fictions of the wild west and other american myths that have become known to them not through their education of which they have none but through television this is tough stuff tiger ive got a lot of american friends who dont equate with what youre saying presumably youre talking of the lower level gis secondgeneration americans who are basically irish or germans or czechs or poles who probably ought to be working in the fields or coalmines of their countries of origin instead of swaggering around a conquered country under the blessed coverlet of the stars and stripes with too much money to spend i daresay they occasionally marry a japanese girl and settle down here but surely they pull up stumps pretty quickly our tommies have done the same thing in germany but thats quite a different thing from the lafcadio hearns of the world tiger tanaka bowed almost to the ground forgive me bondosan of course you are right and i have been diverted from my story down most unworthy paths i did not ask you here to pour out my innermost repugnance at the occupation of my country this of course is repugnance against the fact of defeat i apologize and of course you are correct there are many cultured americans who have taken up residence in this country and who are most valued citizens you are right to correct me for i have friends of this nature in the arts the sciences in literature and they are indeed valued members of the community i was let us say letting off steam you understand of course tiger my country has not been occupied for many centuries the imposition of a new culture on an old one is something we have not suffered i cannot imagine my reactions in the same circumstances much the same as yours i expect please go on with your story bond reached for the sake flask it stood in a jar of warm water being heated over a slow flame from a charcoal burner he filled his glass and drank tiger tanaka rocked two or three times on his buttocks and the sides of his feet he resumed as i have said there are a number of foreigners who have taken up residence in japan and for the most part they are inoffensive eccentrics but there is one such person who entered the country in january of this year who has revealed himself to be an eccentric of the most devilish nature this man is a monster you may laugh bondosan but this man is no less than a fiend in human form i have met many bad men in my time tiger and generally they have been slightly mad is that the case in this instance very much the reverse the calculated ingenuity of this man his understanding of the psychology of my people show him to be a man of quite outstanding genius in the opinion of our highest scholars and savants he is a scientific research worker and collector probably unique in the history of the world what does he collect he collects death the death collector james bond smiled at this dramatic utterance a collector of death you mean he kills people no bondosan it is not as simple as that he persuades or rather entices people to kill themselves tiger paused the wide expanse of his brow furrowed no that also is not being just let us just say that he provides an easy and attractive opportunity a resort for people to do away with themselves his present tally in just under six months is something over five hundred japanese why dont you arrest him hang him bondosan it is not as easy as that i had better begin at the beginning in january of this year there entered the country quite legally a gentleman by the name of doctor guntram shatterhand he was accompanied by frau emmy shatterhand born de bedon they had swiss passports and the doctor described himself as a horticulturalist and botanist specializing in subtropical species he carried high references from the jardin des plantes in paris kew gardens and other authorities but these were couched in rather nebulous terms he quickly got in touch with the equivalent authorities in japan and with experts in the ministry of agriculture and these gentlemen were astonished and delighted to learn that doctor shatterhand was prepared to spend no less than one million pounds on establishing an exotic garden or park in this country which he would stock with a priceless collection of rare plants and shrubs from all over the world these he would import at his own expense in a sufficient state of maturity to allow his park to be planted with the minimum of delay an extremely expensive procedure if you know anything about horticulture i know nothing about it like the texan millionaires who import fullygrown palms and tropical shrubs from florida exactly well the park was not to be open to the public but would be freely available for study and research work by authorized japanese experts all right a wonderful offer that was enthusiastically accepted by the government who in return granted the good doctor a tenyear residence permit a very rare privilege meanwhile as a matter of routine the immigration authorities made inquiries about the doctor through my department since i have no representative in switzerland i referred the matter to our friends of the cia and in due course he was given complete clearance it appeared that he was of swedish origin and was not widely known in switzerland where he only possessed the minimum requirement for residential status in the shape of two rooms in an apartment block in lausanne but his financial standing with the union de banques suisses was grade one which i understand requires you to be a millionaire many times over since money is almost the unique status symbol in switzerland his clearance by the swiss was impeccable though no information could be obtained about his standing as a botanist kew and the jardin des plantes on inquiry referred to him as an enthusiastic amateur who had made valuable contributions to these institutions in the form of tropical and sub tropical species collected for him by expeditions which he had financed so an interesting and financially sound citizen whose harmless pursuits would be of some benefit to japan yes sounds like it after travelling round the country in great style the doctor took a fancy to a semiruined castle in kyushu our southern island the castle was in an extremely remote corner of the coast not far from fukuoka the principal prefecture of the island and in ancient times it had been one of a line of castles facing the tsushima straits the scene of the famous defeat of the russian navy these castles were originally designed to repel attacks from the korean mainland most of them had fallen into disrepair but the one chosen by the doctor was a giant edifice that had been occupied until the last war by a rich and eccentric family of textile millionaires and its monumental surrounding wall was just what the doctor required for the privacy of his undertaking an army of builders and decorators moved in meanwhile the plants ordered by the doctor began arriving from all over the world and with a blanket customs clearance from the ministry of agriculture they were planted in appropriate soils and settings here i should mention that an additional reason for the doctors choice of site was that the property which extends for some five hundred acres is highly volcanic and furnished with many geysers and fumaroles which are common in japan these would provide all the year round the temperature needed for the successful propagation of these tropical shrubs trees and plants from the equatorial zones the doctor and his wife who is by the way extremely ugly moved into the castle with all speed and set about recruiting staff in the neighbourhood who would look after the establishment and its grounds here tiger assumed his sorrowful face and it was at this time that i should not have dismissed as fanciful certain reports that reached me from the chief of police at fukuoka these were to the effect that the doctor was recruiting his staff uniquely from former members of the black dragon society and what might that be have been tiger corrected him the society was officially disbanded before the war but in its heyday it was the most feared and powerful secret society in japan it consisted originally of the dregs of the soshi the unemployed samurai who were left high and dry after the meiji restoration of about a hundred years ago but it later recruited terrorists gangsters fascist politicos cashiered officers from the navy and army secret agents soldiers of fortune and other riffraff but also big men in industry and finance and even the occasional cabinet minister who found black dragon support of much practical value when dirty work had to be done and the odd thing is though it does not seem so odd to me today that the doctor should have chosen his site leaving out its practical amenities in just that corner of japan that used to be the headquarters of the black dragons and has always been a hotbed of extremists toyama mitsuru the former head of the black dragons came from fukuoka so did the anarchist hirota and nakano leader of the former tohokai or fascist group in the diet it has always been a nest of scoundrels this district and it remains so today these extreme sects never die out completely as you have recently my dear bondosan found in the resurgence of the black shirts in england and this doctor shatterhand found no difficulty in collecting some twenty extremely tough and dangerous characters around him all most correctly clothed as servants and gardeners and no doubt perfectly good at their ostensible jobs on one occasion the prefect of police thought it his duty to make a courtesy call and give his distinguished inhabitant a word of caution but the doctor dismissed the matter on the grounds that competent guards would be necessary to maintain his privacy and keep trespassers away from his valuable collection of plants this seemed reasonable enough and anyway the doctor appeared to be under high patronage in tokyo the prefect bowed himself out much impressed with the lavish display of wealth in evidence in the heart of his poor province tiger tanaka paused and poured more sake for bond and more suntory for himself bond took the opportunity to ask just how dangerous this black dragon society had really been was it the equivalent of the chinese tongs much more powerful you have heard of the chingpang and hungpang tongs that were so much feared in china in the days of the kuomintang no well the black dragons were a hundred times worse to have them on your heels was certain death they were totally ruthless and not out of any particular political conviction they operated strictly for cash well under this doctor from switzerland have they done any harm yet oh no they are nothing more than he says personal staff at the worst if you like a bodyguard no the trouble is quite different much more complex you see this man shatterhand has created what i can only describe as a garden of death bond raised his eyebrows really for the head of a national secret service tigers metaphors were almost ridiculously dramatic tiger exploded his golden smile bondosan i can see from your face that you think i am either drunk or mad now listen this doctor shatterhand has filled this famous park of his uniquely with poisonous vegetation the lakes and streams with poisonous fish and he has infested the place with snakes scorpions and poisonous spiders he and this hideous wife of his are not harmed by these things because whenever they leave the castle he wears full suits of armour of the seventeenth century and she wears some other kind of protective clothing his workers are not harmed because they wear rubber boots up to the knee and maskos that is antiseptic gauze masks such as many people in japan wear over the mouth and nose to avoid infection or the spreading of infection what a daft setup tiger reached into the folds of the yukata he had changed into when they entered the house he brought out several sheets of paper pinned together he handed them over to bond and said be patient do not judge what you do not understand i know nothing of these poisonous plants nor i expect do you here is a list of those that have so far been planted by this doctor together with comments by our ministry of agriculture read it take your time you will be interested to learn what charming vegetation grows on the surface of the globe bond took the papers the first page was a general note on vegetable poisons there followed an annotated list the papers bore the seal of the ministry of agriculture this is what he read the poisons listed fall into six main categories deliriant symptoms spectral illusions delirium dilated pupils thirst and dryness incoordination then paralysis and

papers back he said doctor shatterhands garden is indeed a lovesome thing god wot and you have of course heard of the south american piranha fish they can strip a whole horse to the bones in less than an hour the scientific name is serrasalmus the subspecies nattered is the most voracious our good doctor has preferred these fish to our native goldfish for his lakes you see what i mean no said bond frankly i dont whats the object of the good doctors exercise slay it with flowers it was three oclock in the morning the noise of the traffic to yokohama had died james bond didnt feel tired he was now totally absorbed in this extraordinary story of the swiss doctor who as tiger had originally said collected death tiger wasnt telling him this bizarre case history for his entertainment there was going to come a moment of climax what would that climax be tiger wiped his hand over his face he said did you read a story in the evening edition of the asahi today it concerned a suicide no this was a young student aged eighteen who had failed his examination for the university for the second time he lived in the suburbs of tokyo there was construction work on a new department a department store going on near where he lived he went out of his room on to the site a piledriver was at work sinking the foundations suddenly this youth broke through the surrounding workmen and as the pile came crashing down laid his head on the block beneath it what a ghastly business why he had brought dishonour on his parents his ancestors this was his way of expiation suicide is a most unfortunate aspect of the japanese way of life tiger paused or perhaps a most noble one it depends how you look at it that boy and his family will have gained great face in his neighbourhood you cant gain face from strawberry jam think again bondosan your posthumous vcs for instance theyre not awarded for committing suicide after failing in an examination we are not so demokorasu as you are there was irony in tigers voice dishonour must be expunged according to those of us who remain what you would describe as oldfashioned there is no apology more sincere than the offering up of your own life it is literally all you have to give but even if this boy failed for the university he could have gone for a lower standard of examination for a lower grade of college as you know we say blast or perhaps a stronger word if we fail an examination in britain but we readjust our sights or our parents do it for us and have another bash we dont kill ourselves it wouldnt occur to us it would be dishonourable rather than honourable it would be cowardly a refusal to stand up to reverses to life and it would give great pain to our parents and certainly no satisfaction to our ancestors with us it is different and despite demokorasu the parents of this youth will be rejoicing this evening and their neighbours will be rejoicing with them honour is more important to us than life more proud more beautiful bond shrugged well i just think that if the boy had the guts to do this thing it was the waste of a perfectly good japanese life in fact of course this suicide business in japan is nothing more than a form of hysteriaan expression of the streak of violence that seems to run all through the history of japan if you hold your own life so cheaply it follows that you will hold others lives even more cheaply the other day i saw a traffic accident at one of the main crossings i dont know the name of it it was a multiple affair and there were bodies all over the place the police came but instead of concentrating on getting the wounded to hospital insisted that they should lie where they were so that they could draw chalk lines round them and photograph them presumably for use when the case came to court that is common practice said tiger indifferently we are much overpopulated abortion is legal it is helping to solve one of our problems if a few extra people die in an automobile accident but there is something in what you said earlier our word for suicide is jisatsu literally selfmurder and although it is a violent solution to a personal problem it carries no stigma as it would in your country in fact one of our most famous folktales known to all children is of the fortyseven ronin or bodyguards through their negligence their lord asano was assassinated they swore to avenge him and they did so but then they came together at a place called ako and all committed seppuku to expiate their negligence this is what you know as harakiri which is a vulgar term meaning bellycutting today at the time of the festival at the ako shrine special trains have to be laid on to accommodate the respectful pilgrims well if you bring your children up on that sort of stuff you cant expect them not to venerate the act of suicide just so said tiger proudly japanese commit suicide every year only the bureaucrats regard that as a shameful statistic and the more spectacular the suicide the more warmly it is approved not long ago a young student achieved great renown by trying to saw his own head off lovers link hands and throw themselves over the very high kegon falls at nikko the mihara volcano on the island of oshima is another favourite locale people run down the roasting slope of the crater and hurl themselves their shoes on fire into the bubbling cauldron in its centre to combat this popular pastime the interfering authorities have now opened at great expense a suicide prevention office on the peak but always the wheels of the good oldfashioned railway train provide the most convenient guillotine they have the merit of being selfoperating all you need to do is make a fourfoot jump youre a bloodthirsty old bastard tiger but whats all this lecture about anyway whats it got to do with friend shatterhand and his pretty garden everything bondosan everything you see much against the good doctors wishes of course his poison garden has become the most desirable site for suicides in the whole of japan it has everything a ride on our famous romance express to kyoto a boat trip across our beautiful inland sea that is so full of japanese history a local train from the terminal harbour at beppu to fukuoka and a walk or taxi drive along a beautiful coast to the aweinspiring ramparts of this mysterious castle of death climb these or smuggle yourself in on a provision cart and then a last delicious ruminative walk perhaps handinhand with your lover through the beautiful groves and finally the great gamble the game of pachinko the japanese love so much which ball will have your number on it will your death be easy or painful will a russells viper strike at your legs as you walk the silent wellraked paths will some kindly deadly dew fall upon you during the night as you rest under this or that gorgeous tree or will hunger or curiosity lead you to munch a handful of those red berries or pick one of those orange fruit of course if you want to make it quick there is always a bubbling sulphurous fumarole at hand in any one of those the thousand degrees centigrade will allow you just enough time for one scream the place is nothing more than a departmento of death its shelves laden with delicious packages of selfdestruction all given away for nothing can you not imagine that old and young flock there as if to a shrine the police have erected a barricade across the road genuine visitors botanists and so on have to show a pass but the suicides fight their way to the shrine across the fields and marshes scrabble at the great walls break their nails to gain entrance the good doctor is of course much dismayed he has erected stern notices of warning with skulls and crossbones upon them they act only as advertisements he has even gone to the expense of flying one of those high helium balloons from the roof of his castle the hanging streamers threaten trespassers with prosecution but alas for the doctors precautions the high balloon serves only to beckon here is death it proclaims come and get it youre daft tiger why dont you arrest him burn the place down arrest him for what for presenting japan with this unique collection of rare plants burn down a millionpound establishment belonging to a respected galjin resident the man has done nothing wrong if anyone is to blame it is the japanese people it is true that he could exercise more careful surveillance have his grounds more regularly patrolled and it is certainly odd that when he has the ambulance called the victims are always totally dead and are usually in the form of a bag of calcined bones fished out of one of the fumaroles from the list i have shown you one would have expected some to be only crippled or blinded the herr doktor expresses himself as much puzzled he suggests that in the cases of blindness or amnesia the victims presumably fall into one of the fumaroles by mistake maybe but as i have said his tally so far is over five hundred and with the stream of publicity more and more people will be attracted to the castle of death we have got to put a stop to it what steps have been taken so far commissions of investigation have visited the doctor they have been most courteously treated the doctor has begged that something shall be done to protect him from these trespassers he complains that they interfere with his work break off precious boughs and pick valuable plants he shows himself as entirely cooperative with any measures that can be suggested short of abandoning this project which is so dear to his heart and so much appreciated by trie japanese specialists in botany and so forth he has made a further most generous offer he is constructing a research department to be manned by workers of his own choice mark you to extract the poisons from his shrubs and plants and give the essences free to an appropriate medical research centre you will have noted that many of these poisons are valuable medicines in a diluted form but how has all this come on your plate bond was now getting drowsy it was four oclock and the horizon of jagged grey porcelainshingled rooftops was lightening he poured down the last of the sake it had the flat taste of too much it was time he was in bed but tiger was obviously obsessed with this lunatic business and subtle authentic glimpses of japan were coming through the ridiculous nightmare story with its undertones of poe le fanu bram stoker ambrose bierce tiger seemed unaffected by the lateness of the hour the samurai face was perhaps etched in more sinister more brutal lines the hint of tartar tamed and civilized lurked with less concealment like a caged animal in the dark pools of his eyes but the occasional rocking motion on the buttocks and sides of the feet was the only sign that he was interested even excited he said one month ago bondosan i sent one of my best men into this place to try and discover what it was all about i was so instructed by my minister the minister of the interior he in turn was under orders from the prime minister the matter was becoming one of public debate i chose a good man he was instructed to get into the place observe and report one week later bondosan he was recovered from the sea on a beach near this castle of death he was blinded and in delirium all the lower half of his body was terribly burned he could only babble a haiku about dragonflies i later discovered that as a youth he had indulged in the pastime of our youngsters he had tied a female dragonfly on a thread and let it go this acts as a lure for the male dragonfly and you can quickly catch many males in this way they attach themselves to the female and will not let go the haiku that is a verse of seventeen syllables he kept on reciting until his death which came soon was desolation pink dragonflies flitting above the graves james bond felt he was living inside a dream the little room partitioned in imitation ricepaper and cedar plywood the open vista of a small inscrutable garden in which water tinkled the distant redness of an imminent dawn the long background of sake and cigarettes the quiet voice of the storyteller telling a fairy tale as it might be told in a tent under the stars and yet this was something that had happened the other day close by was happening now something that tiger had brought him here to tell why because he was lonely because there was no one else he could trust bond pulled himself out of his somnolent slouch he said im sorry tiger what did you do next tiger tanaka seemed to sit slightly more upright on his blackedged rectangle of golden tatami he looked very directly at james bond and said what was there to do i did nothing except apologize to my superiors i waited for an honourable solution to present itself i waited for you to come me you were sent it might have been another james bond yawned he couldnt help it he could see no end to the evening tiger had got some japanese bee in his japanese bonnet how in hell could bond stop it buzzing he said tiger its time for bed lets talk about the rest of this tomorrow of course ill give you any advice i can i can see its a difficult problem but those are just the ones to sleep on he made to rise from his chair tiger said and it was an order sit down bondosan if you have any regard for your country you leave tomorrow he consulted his watch by the twelvetwenty from tokyo main station your ultimate destination is fukuoka on the southern island of kyushu you will not be going back to your hotel you will not be seeing dikko from now on you are under my personal orders the voice went very quiet and velvety is that understood bond sat up as if he had been stung what in gods name are you talking about tiger tiger tanaka said in my office the other day you made a significant statement you said words to the effect that in exchange for magic you were empowered to carry out any personal services that i might require of you i didnt say that i was empowered i meant that i would do anything for you on my personal responsibility that is quite good enough i took you at your word and i requested an audience of the prime minister he instructed me to proceed but to regard the matter as a state secret known only to him and to meand of course to you come on tiger said bond impatiently cut the cackle what is it you want me to do but tiger was not to be hurried he said bondosan i will now be blunt with you and you will not be offended because we are friends yes now it is a sad fact that i and many of us in positions of authority in japan have formed an unsatisfactory opinion about the british people since the war you have not only lost a great empire you have seemed almost anxious to throw it away with both hands all right he held up a hand we will not go deeply into the reasons for this policy but when you apparently sought to arrest this slide into impotence at suez you succeeded only in stagemanaging one of the most pitiful bungles in the history of the world if not the worst further your governments have shown themselves successively incapable of ruling and have handed over effective control of the country to the trade unions who appear to be dedicated to the principle of doing less and less work for more money this featherbedding this shirking of an honest days work is sapping at everincreasing speed the moral fibre of the british a quality the world once so much admired in its place we now see a vacuous aimless horde of seekersafterpleasure gambling at the pools and bingo whining at the weather and the declining fortunes of the country and wallowing nostalgically in gossip about the doings of the royal family and of your socalled aristocracy in the pages of the most debased newspapers in the world james bond roared with laughter youve got a bloody cheek tiger you ought to write that out and sign it octogenarian and send it in to the times you just come over and take a look at the place its not doing all that badly bondosan you have pleaded guilty out of your own mouth not doing too badly indeed that is the crybaby excuse of a boy who gets a thoroughly bad endofterm report in fact you are doing very badly indeed in the opinion of your few remaining friends and now you come to me and ask for some very important intelligence material to bolster up the pitiful ruins of a once great power why should we give it to you what good will it do us what good will it do you bondosan it is like giving smelling salts to a punchdrunk heavyweight just before the inevitable knockout bond said angrily balls to you tiger and balls again just because youre a pack of militant potential murderers here longing to get rid of your american masters and play at being samurai again snarling behind your subservient smiles you only judge people by your own jungle standards let me tell you this my fine friend england may have been bled pretty thin by a couple of world wars our welfare state politics may have made us expect too much for free and the liberation of our colonies may have gone too fast but we still climb everest and beat plenty of the world at plenty of sports and win nobel prizes our politicians may be a feather pated bunch and i expect yours are too all politicians are but theres nothing wrong with the british people although there are only fifty million of them tiger tanaka smiled happily well spoken bondosan i thought your famous english stoicism might break down if i hit hard enough i just wanted to see and for your information those are very similar to the words i addressed to my prime minister and do you know what he said he said all right mr tanaka put this commander bond to the test if he succeeds i will agree that there is still an elite in britain and that this valuable material would be safe in their hands if he fails you will politely turn down the request bond shrugged impatiently he was still smarting under tigers onslaught and the halftruths which he knew lay behind his words all right tiger what is this ridiculous test some typical bit of samurai nonsense i suppose more or less agreed tiger tanaka with equanimity you are to enter this castle of death and slay the dragon within instant japan the black topoyet hurtled through the deserted streets which were shiny with the dew of what would be a beautiful day tiger had dressed in casual clothes as if for a country outing he had a small overnight bag on the seat beside him they were on the way to a bathhouse which tiger said was of a very special a very pleasurable nature it was also tiger said very discreet and the opportunity would be taken to make a start in transforming bonds appearance into something more closely resembling a japanese tiger had overridden all bonds objections on all the evidence this doctor was a purveyor of death because he was mad because it amused him tiger neither knew nor cared for obvious reasons of policy his assassination which had been officially agreed to could not be carried out by a japanese bonds appearance on the scene was therefore very timely he had had much practice in such clandestine operations and if he was subsequently arrested by the japanese police an adequate cover story involving foreign intelligence services could be cooked up he would be tried sentenced and then quietly smuggled out of the country if he failed then presumably the doctor or his guards would kill him that would be too bad bond argued that he had personally nothing against this swiss botanist tiger replied that any good mans hand would be against a man who had already killed five hundred of his fellow creatures was that not so and in any case bond was being hired to do this act in exchange for magic did that not quieten his conscience bond agreed reluctantly that it did as a last resort bond said that the operation was in any case impossible a foreigner in japan could be spotted five miles away tiger replied that this matter had been provided for and the first step was a visit to this most discreet bathhouse here bond would receive his first treatment and then get some sleep before catching the train on which tiger would be accompanying him and tiger with a devilish grin had assured him that at any rate part of his treatment would be most pleasurable and relaxing the exterior of the bathhouse looked like a japanese inn some carefully placed steppingstones meandering briefly between dwarf pines a wideopen yellowlighted doorway with a vista of polished wood floors behind three bowing smiling women in traditional dress as bright as birds although it was nearly five in the morning and the inevitable row of spotless but undersied slippers after much bowing and counterbowing and a few phrases from tiger bond took off his shoes and in his socks did as tiger told him and followed one of the women along a gleaming corridor and through an open partition that revealed a miniature combination of a bedroom and a turkish bath a young girl wearing nothing but tight brief shorts and an exiguous white brassiere bowed low said excuse please and began to unbutton bonds trousers bond held the pretty hand where it was he turned to the older woman who was about to close the partition and said tanakasan in a voice that pleaded and ordered tiger was fetched he was wearing nothing but his underpants he said what is it now bond said now listen tiger im sure this pretty girl and i will get along very well indeed but just tell me what the menu is am i going to eat her or is she going to eat me tiger said patiently you really must learn to obey orders without asking questions bondosan that is the essence of our relationship during the next few days you see that box when she has undressed you she will put you in the box which has a charcoal fire under it you will sweat after perhaps ten minutes she will help you out of the box and wash you from head to foot she will even tenderly clean out your ears with a special ivory instrument she will then pour a very tenacious dark dye with which she has been supplied into that tiled bath in the floor and you will get in you will relax and bathe your face and hair she will then dry you and cut your hair in the japanese style she will then give you a massage on that couch and according to your indications she will make this massage as delightful as prolonged as you wish you will then go to sleep when you are awakened with eggs and bacon and coffee you will kiss the girl good morning and shave or the other way round and that will be that tiger curtly asked the girl a question she brushed back her bang of black hair coquettishly and replied the girl says she is eighteen and that her name is mariko ichiban mariko means truth and ichiban means number one the girls in these establishments are numbered and now please dont disturb me any more i am about to enjoy myself in a similar fashion but without the walnut stain and please in future have faith you are about to undergo a period of entirely new sensations they may be strange and surprising they will not be painful while you are under my authority that is savour them enjoy them as if each one was your last all right then good night my dear bondosan the night will be short alas but if you embrace it fully it will be totally delightful up to the last squirm of ecstasy and tiger gave a malicious wave of the hand as he went out and closed the partition you will arise from it what is known as a new man james bond got at any rate part of the message as marikos busy fingers proceeded to remove his trousers and then his shirt he lifted her chin and kissed her full on the soft yielding budlike mouth later sitting sweating and reflecting in the comfortable wooden box very tired slightly but cheerfully drunk he remembered his dismal thoughts in queen marys rose garden he also remembered his interview with m and m saying that he could leave the hardware behind on this purely diplomatic assignment and the lines of irony round bonds mouth deepened mariko was looking into the wall mirror and fiddling with her hair and eyebrows bond said mariko out i mariko smiled and bowed she unhurriedly removed her brassiere and came towards the wooden box bond reflected what was it that tiger had said about becoming a new man and he reached for marikos helping hands and watched her breasts tauten as she pulled him out and towards her it was indeed a new man who followed tiger through the thronged halls of tokyo main station bonds face and hands were of a light brown tint his black hair brightly oiled was cut and neatly combed in a short fringe that reached halfway down his forehead and the outer corners of his eyebrows had been carefully shaved so that they now slanted upwards he was dressed like so many of the other travellers in a white cotton shirt buttoned at the wrists and a cheap knitted silk black tie exactly centred with a rolled gold pin his readymade black trousers held up by a cheap black plastic belt were rather loose in the fork because japanese behinds are inclined to hang low but the black plastic sandals and dark blue nylon socks were exactly the right size a muchused overnight bag of japan air lines was slung over his shoulder and this contained a change of shirt singlet pants and socks shinsei cigarettes and some cheap japanese toilet articles in his pockets were a comb a cheap used wallet containing some five thousand yen in small denomination notes and a stout pocket knife which by japanese law had a blade not more than two inches long there was no handkerchief only a packet of tissues despite his height bond merged quite adequately into the bustling shoving crowd of passengers hisdisguise had mysteriously appeared in his room at the bathhouse and mariko had greatly enjoyed dressing him up now japanese gentleman she had said approvingly as with a last lingering kiss she had gone to answer tigers rap on the partition bonds own clothes and possessions had already been taken away they and your things from the hotel will be transferred to dikkos apartment tiger had said later today dikko will inform your chief that you have left tokyo with me for a visit to the magic establishment which is in fact a days journey from tokyo and that you will be away for several days dikko believes that this is so my own department merely know that i shall be absent on a mission to fukuoka they do not know that you are accompanying me and now we will take the express to gamagori on the south coast and the evening hydrofoil across ise bay to the fishing port of toba there we will spend the night this is to be a slow journey to fukuoka for the purpose of training and educating you it is necessary that i make you familiar with japanese customs and folkways so that you make as few mistakes as possible when the time comes the gleaming orange and silver express slid to a stop beside them tiger barged his way on board bond waited politely for two or three women to precede him when he sat down beside tiger tiger hissed angrily first lesson bondosan do not make way for women push them trample them down women have no priority in this country you may be polite to very old men but to no one else is that understood yes master said bond sarcastically and do not make westernstyle jokes while you are my pupil we are engaged on a serious mission oh all right tiger said bond resignedly but damn it all tiger held up a hand and that is another thing no swearing please there are no swearwords in the japanese language and the usage of bad language does not exist but good heavens tiger no selfrespecting man could get through the day without his battery of fourletter words to cope with the roughage of life and let off steam if youre late for a vital appointment with your superiors and you find that youve left all your papers at home surely you say well freddie uncle charlie katie if i may put it so as not to offend no said tiger i would say shimata which means i have made a mistake nothing worse there is nothing worse to say well supposing it was your drivers fault that the papers had been forgotten wouldnt you curse him backwards and sideways if i wanted to get myself a new driver i might conceivably call him bakyaro which means a bloody fool or even konchihikisho which means you animal but these are deadly insults and he would be within his rights to strike me he would certainly get out of the car and walk away and those are the worst words in the japanese language what about your taboos the emperor your ancestors all these gods dont you ever wish them in hell or worse no that would have no meaning well then dirty words sex words there are two chimbo which is masculine and monks which is feminine these are nothing but coarse anatomical descriptions they have no meaning as swearing words there are no such things in our language well im i mean well im astonished a violent people without a violent language i must write a learned paper on this no wonder you have nothing left but to commit suicide when you fail an exam or cut your girl friends head off when she annoys you tiger laughed we generally push them under trams or trains well for my money youd do much better to say you bond fired off the hackneyed string and get it off your chest that way that is enough bondosan said tiger patiently the subject is now closed but you will kindly refrain both from using these words or looking them be calm stoical impassive do not show anger smile at misfortune if you sprain your ankle laugh tiger youre a cruel taskmaster tiger grinned with satisfaction bondosan you dont know the half of it but now let us go and get something to eat and drink in the buffet car all that suntory you forced on me last night is crying out for the skin of the dog that bit me the hair corrected bond one hair would not be enough bondosan i need the whole skin james bond wrestled with his chopsticks and slivers of raw octopus and a mound of rice and watched the jagged coastline interspersed with glittering paddyfields flash by he was lost in thought when he felt a hard jostle from behind he had been constantly jostled as he sat up at the counter the japanese are great j ostlers but he now turned and caught a glimpse of the stocky back of a man disappearing into the next compartment there were white strings round his ears which showed that he was wearing a masko and he wore an ugly black leather hat when they went back to their seat bond found that his pocket had been picked his wallet was gone tiger was astonished that is very unusual in japan he said defensively but no matter i will get you another at toba it would be a mistake to call the conductor we do not wish to draw attention to ourselves the police would be sent for at the next station and there would be much interrogation and filling out of forms and there is no way of finding the thief the man will have pocketed his masko and hat and will be unrecognizable i regret the incident bondosan i hope you will forget it of course its nothing they left the train at gamagori a pretty seaside village with a humped island in the bay that tiger said housed an important shrine and the fiftyknot ride in the hydrofoil to toba an hour away across the bay was exhilarating as they disembarked bond caught a glimpse of a stocky silhouette in the crowd could it be the thief on the train but the man wore heavy hornrimmed spectacles and there were many other stocky men in the crowd bond dismissed the thought and followed tiger along the narrow streets gaily hung with paper banners and lanterns to the usual discreet frontage and dwarf pines that he had become accustomed to they were expected and were greeted with deference bond had had about enough of the day there werent many bows and smiles left in him and he was glad when he was at last left alone in his maddeningly dainty room with the usual dainty pot of tea dainty cup and dainty sweetmeat wrapped in ricepaper he sat at the open partition that gave on to a handkerchief of garden and then the sea wall and gazed gloomily across the water at a giant statue of a man in a bowler hat and morning coat that tiger had told him was mr mikimoto founder of the cultured pearl industry who had been born at toba and had there as a poor fisherman invented the trick of inserting grains of sand under the mantle of a live oyster to form the kernel of a pearl bond thought to hell with tiger and his crazy plan what in gods name have i got myself into he was still sitting there cursing his lot when tiger came in and brusquely ordered him to don one of the yukatas that hung with the bedding in the single cupboard in the paper wall you really must concentrate bondosan said tiger mildly but you are making progress as a reward i have ordered sake to be brought in large quantities and then a dinner of the speciality of this place lobster bonds spirits rose minutely he undressed to his pants donned the darkbrown yukata and adopted the lotus position across the low table from tiger he had to admit that the kimono was airy and comfortable he bowed low that sounds a most sincere programme now then tiger tell me about the time you were training as a kamikaze every detail what was it all about the sake came the pretty waitress knelt on the tatami and served them both tiger had been thoughtful he had ordered tumblers bond swallowed his at one gulp tiger said the grossness of your drinking habits fits well with your future identity and what is that to be a coalminer from fukuoka there are many tall men in that profession your hands are not rough enough but you pushed a truck underground your nails will be filled with coal dust when the time comes you were too stupid to wield a pick you are deaf and dumb here tiger slipped across a scrubby card creased and dogeared there were some japanese characters on it that is tsumbo de oshi deaf and dumb your disability will inspire pity and some distaste if someone talks to you show that and they will desist they may also give you a few pieces of small coin accept them and bow deeply thanks very much and i suppose i have to account for these tips to your secret fund that will not be necessary tiger was woodenfaced our expenses on this mission are a direct charge on the prime ministers purse bond bowed i am honoured he straightened himself and now you old bastard more sake and tell me about the kamikaze in due course i am prepared to become a deaf and dumb miner from fukuoka in public i am prepared to hiss and bow with the best of them but by god when were alone the password is freddie uncle charlie katie or ill be putting my head under a piledriver before you get me on to the first tee is that agreed tiger bowed low shimata i am in error i have been pressing you hard it is my duty to entertain a friend as well as instruct a pupil lift your glass bondosan until you do so the girl will not pour right now you ask me about the kamikaze tiger rocked backwards and forwards and his dark assassins eyes became introspective he didnt look up at bond he said it was nearly twenty years ago things were looking bad for my country i had been doing intelligence work in berlin and rome i had been far from the air raids and even farther from the front line and every night when i listened to the radio from my homeland and heard the bad news of the slow but sure approach of the american forces island by island airstrip by airstrip i paid no attention to the false news of the nazis but thought only that my country was in danger and that i was needed to defend it tiger paused and the wine turned sour in my mouth and the girls turned cold in my bed i listened to the accounts of this brilliant invention the corps of kamikaze that is the divine wind that saved my country from invasion by kublai khan in the thirteenth century by destroying his fleet i said to myself that that was the way to die no medals total death suicide if you like but at enormous cost to the enemy it seemed to me the most heroic form of personal combat that had ever been invented i was nearly forty i had lived fully it seemed to me that i could take the place of a younger man the technique was simple anyone can learn to pilot a plane the escorts of fighter planes led in to the attack it was then just a question of aiming yourself at the largest ship preferably an aircraft carrier that was bringing planes to the islands to attack the homeland you got the ship lined up below you and you went for the flight deck and the lift which is the heart of a carrier pay no attention to the bridge or the water line they are heavily armoured go for the vulnerable machinery of the flight deck you understand tiger was completely sent he was back there again fighting the war bond knew the symptoms he often visited this haunted forest of memory himself he lifted his glass the kneeling girl bowed and poured bond said yes go on tiger i forced the kempeitai to accept my resignation and i returned to japan and more or less bribed my way into a kamikaze training squadron they were very difficult to get into all the youth of the nation seemed to want to serve the emperor in this way at this time we were running out of aircraft and we were forced to use the more difficult baku that was a small plane made mostly of wood with a thousand pounds of explosive in the nose a kind of flying bomb it had no engine but was released from below the belly of a fighter bomber the pilot had a single joystick for controlling direction tiger looked up i can tell you bondosan that it was a terrible and beautiful thing to see an attack wave going off these young men in their pure white shifts and with the ancient white scarf that was the badge of the samurai bound round their heads running joyfully for their planes as if they were running to embrace a loved one the roar of the engines of the mother planes and then the takeoff into the dawn or into the setting sun towards some distant target that had been reported by spies or intercepted on the radio it was as if they were flying to their ancestors in heaven as indeed they were for of course none ever came back or were captured but what did it all achieve of course it frightened the american fleet all right and the british but you lost thousands of your best young men was it worth it is it worth writing one of the most glorious pages in your countrys history do you know that the kamikaze is the only unit in the history of air warfare whose claims were less than the truth the unit claimed as sunk or damaged naval craft from aircraft carriers downwards those actually sunk or damaged were you were lucky the surrender came before you were sent on a mission perhaps and yetbondosan it is one of my most cherished dreams today to come diving out of the sun into a hail of antiaircraft fire see the tiny terrified figures running for shelter from the flight deck of a wildly swerving carrier and know that you are about to kill a hundred or more of the enemy and destroy a million pounds worth of his fighting machine all by yourself and i suppose admiral ohnishi who invented the whole idea committed suicide when the surrender came naturally and in a most honourable fashion when you commit seppuku you invite two of your best friends to be present to finish you off if you fail the admiral executed the crosscut from left to right of the belly and then the upward cut to the breast bone most admirably but it did not kill him yet he refused the coup de grace he sat there contemplating his insides for a whole day before he finally died a most sincere gesture of apology to the emperor tiger waved a hand airily however i must not spoil your dinner i can see that some of our honourable customs offend your soft western susceptibilities here comes the lobster are they not splendid animals lacquer boxes of rice raw quails egg in sauce and bowls of sliced seaweed were placed in front of them both then they were each given a fine oval dish bearing a large lobster whose head and tail had been left as a dainty ornament to the sliced pink flesh in the centre bond set to with his chopsticks he was surprised to find that the flesh was raw he was even more surprised when the head of his lobster began moving off his dish and with questing antennae and scrabbling feet tottered off across the table good god tiger bond said aghast the damn things alive tiger hissed impatiently really bondosan i am much disappointed in you you fail test after test i sincerely hope you will show improvement during the rest of our journey now eat up and stop being squeamish this is a very great japanese delicacy james bond bowed ironically shimata he said i have made a mistake it crossed my mind that honourable japanese lobster might not like being eaten alive thank you for correcting the unworthy thought you will soon become accustomed to the japanese way of life said tiger graciously its their way of death thats got me a little bit puzzled said bond amiably and he handed his glass to the kneeling waitress for more sake to give him strength to try the seaweed advanced studies tiger and bond stood in the shade of the avenue of giant cryptomerias and observed the pilgrims slung with cameras who were visiting the famous outer shrine of ise the greatest temple to the creed of shintoism tiger said all right you have observed these people and their actions they have been saying prayers to the sun goddess go and say a prayer without drawing attention to yourself bond walked over the raked path and through the great wooden archway and joined the throng in front of the shrine two priests bizarre in their red kimonos and black helmets were watching bond bowed towards the shrine tossed a coin on to the wirenetting designed to catch the offerings clapped his hands loudly bent his head in an attitude of prayer clapped his hands again bowed and walked out you did well said tiger one of the priests barely glanced at you the public paid no attention you should perhaps have clapped your hands more loudly it is to draw the attention of the goddess and your ancestors to your presence at the shrine then they will pay more attention to your prayer what prayer did you in fact make im afraid i didnt make any tiger i was concentrating on remembering the right sequence of motions the goddess will have noted that bondosan she will help you to concentrate still more in the future now we will go back to the car and proceed to witness another interesting ceremony in which you will take part bond groaned in the parking place beyond the vast torii that guarded the entrance charsabancs were disgorging hordes of students while the conductresses shouted awri awri awri and blew whistles to help the drivers of other charsabancs to back in the giggling girls were severely dressed in dark blue with black cotton stockings the youths wore the handsome highcollared black uniform of japanese students tiger led the way through the middle of the crowd when they emerged tiger looked pleased did you notice anything bondosan only a lot of pretty girls rather too young for me wrong yesterday many of them would have stared and giggled behind their hands and said gaijin today you were not recognized as a foreigner your appearance is one thing but your comportment has also improved you exude more selfconfidence you are more at home tiger gave his golden sunburst of a smile the tanaka system it is not so foolish as you think wadakin on the road across the mountains to the ancient capital of kyoto was a little upland hamlet without distinction tiger gave decisive orders to the driver of the hired car and they arrived at a tall barnlike building in a back street there was a strong smell of cattle and manure the chief herdsman as he turned out to be greeted them he had the apple cheeks and wise kindly eyes of his counterparts in scotland and the tyrol tiger had a long conversation with him the man looked at bond and his eyes twinkled he bowed perfunctorily and led the way inside it was cool out of the sun there were rows of stalls in which vastly fat brown cows lay chewing the cud a gay small dog was licking the muzzle of one of them and being occasionally given a lick in return the herdsman lifted a barrier and said something to one of the cows which got unsteadily up on to legs that had become spindly through lack of exercise it ambled unsteadily out into the sunshine and looked warily at tiger and bond the herdsman hauled out a crate of beer bottles he opened one and handed it to bond tiger said peremptorily give it to the cow to drink bond took the bottle and walked boldly up to the cow who raised her head and opened her slavering jaws bond thrust the bottle between them and poured the cow almost ate the bottle in its delight and ran its harsh tongue gratefully over bonds hand bond stood his ground he was getting used to tigers ploys by now and he was determined to show at any rate an approximation of the kamikaze spirit whatever test tiger put him to the herdsman now handed bond a bottle of what appeared to be water tiger said this is shochu it is a very raw gin fill your mouth with it and spray it over the back of the cow and then massage it into the cows flesh bond guessed that tiger hoped he would swallow some of the gin and choke he closed his throat but lustily filled his mouth with the stuff compressed his lips and blew hard so that the vapour from the stuff would not go up his nostrils he wiped his hands across his lips that were already stinging with the harsh spirit and scrubbed energetically at the rough pelt the cow bent her head in ecstasy bond stood back now what he said belligerently whats the cow going to do for me tiger laughed and translated for the herdsman who also laughed and looked at bond with some respect money changed hands and with much happy talk between tiger and the herdsman and final bows they got back into the car and drove into the village where they were welcomed into a shuttered and discreet restaurant polished spotless and blessedly deserted tiger ordered and they sat in wonderful western chairs at a real table while the usual dimpling waitresses brought sake bond swallowed down his first flask at one long gulp to wash away the rasp of the gin he said to tiger and now what was that all about tiger looked pleased with himself you are about to eat what it was all about the finest most succulent beef in the world kobe beef but of a grade you wouldnt find in the most expensive restaurant in tokyo this herd is owned by a friend of mine the herdsman was a good man was he not he feeds each of his cows four pints of beer a day and massages them with shochu as you did they also receive a rich meal of oaten porridge you like beef no said bond stolidly as a matter of fact i dont that is unfortunate said tiger not looking as if it were for what you are about to eat is the finest steak that will be eaten today anywhere outside the argentine and you have earned it the herdsman was greatly impressed by your sincere performance with his cow and what does that prove said bond sourly and what honourable experience is awaiting me this afternoon the steak came it was accompanied by various succulent sidedishes including a saucer of blood which bond refused but the meat could be cut with a fork and was indeed without equal in bonds experience tiger munching with gusto answered bonds question i am taking you to one of the secret training establishments of my service he said it is not far from here in the mountains in an old fortified castle it goes under the name of the central mountaineering school it arouses no comment in the neighbourhood which is just as well since it is here that my agents are trained in one of the arts most dreaded in japan ninjutsu which is literally the art of stealth or invisibility all the men you will see have already graduated in at least ten of the eighteen martial arts of bushido or ways of the warrior and they are now learning to be ninja or stealersin which has for centuries been part of the basic training of spies and assassins and saboteurs you will see men walk across the surface of water walk up walls and across ceilings and you will be shown equipment which makes it possible for them to remain submerged under water for a full day and many other tricks besides for of course apart from physical dexterity the ninja were never the superhumans they were built up to be in the popular imagination but nevertheless the secrets of ninjutsu are still closely guarded today and are the property of two main schools the iga and the togakure from which my instructors are drawn i think you will be interested and perhaps learn something yourself at this place i have never approved of agents carrying guns and other obvious weapons in china korea and oriental russia which are so to speak my main beats the possession of any offensive weapon on arrest would be an obvious confession of guilt my men are expected to be able to kill without weapons all they may carry is a staff and a length of thin chain which can be easily explained away you understand yes that makes sense we have a similar commando training school for unarmed combat attached to headquarters but of course your judo and karate are special skills requiring years of practice how high did you get in judo tiger tiger picked his teeth reminiscently no higher than a black belt of the seventh dan i never graduated to a red belt which is from the eighth to the eleventh dan to do so would have meant abandoning all other forms of activity and with what object to be promoted to the twelfth and final dan on my death in exchange for spending the whole of my life tumbling about in the kodokan academy in tokyo no thank you that is the ambition of a lunatic he smiled no sake no beautiful girls worse still probably no opportunity in a whole lifetime to exercise my art in anger to tackle a robber or murderer with a gun and get the better of him in the higher realms of judo you are nothing but a mixture between a monk and a ballet dancer not for me back on the open dusty road some instinct made bond glance through the rear window between the dainty lace blinds that are both the hallmark of a truly sincere hired car and a dangerous impediment to the drivers vision far behind there was a solitary motorcyclist later when they turned up a minor road into the mountains he was still there bond mentioned the fact tiger shrugged he is perhaps a speed cop if he is anyone else he has chosen a bad time and place the castle was the usual horned roof affair of japanese prints it stood in a cleft between the mountains that must have once been an important pass for ancient cannon pointed out from the summit of giant slightly sloping walls of black granite blocks they were stopped at the gate to a wooden causeway across a brimming moat and again at the castle entrance tiger showed his pass and there was much hissing and deep bowing from the plainclothes guards and a bell clanged in the topmost tier of the soaring edifice which as bond could see from the inner courtyard was badly in need of a coat of paint as the car came to a stop young men in shorts and gym shoes came running from various doors in the castle and formed up behind three older men they bowed almost to the ground as tiger descended regally from the car tiger and bond also bowed brief greetings were exchanged with the older men and tiger then proceeded to fire off a torrent of staccato japanese which was punctuated by respectful hats from the middleaged man who was obviously the commandant of the team with a final hai tanakasan this official turned to the twentyodd students whose ages seemed to be somewhere between twentyfive and thirtyfive he called numbers and six men fell out of the ranks they were given orders and ran off into the castle tiger commented to bond they will put on camouflage clothes and go off into the mountains through which we have come if anyone is lurking about they will bring him to us and now we will see a little demonstration of an attack on the castle tiger fired off some more orders the men dispersed at the double and bond followed tiger out on to the causeway accompanied by the chief instructor with whom tiger had a long and animated discussion perhaps a quarter of an hour later there came a whistle from above them on the ramparts and at once ten men broke cover from the forest to their left they were dressed from head to foot in some black material and only their eyes showed through slits in the black hoods they ran down to the edge of the moat donned oval battens of what must have been some light wood such as balsa and skimmed across the water with a kind of skiing motion until they reached the bottom of the giant black wall there they discarded their battens took lengths of rope and a handful of small iron pitons out of pockets in their black robes and proceeded to almost run up the walls like fast black spiders tiger turned to bond you understand that it is nighttime in a few days you will have to be doing something similar note that the lengths of rope terminate in an iron hook which they throw up and catch in crevices between the stone blocks the instructor said something to tiger and pointed tiger nodded he said to bond the man at the end is the weakest of the team the instructor thinks he will soon fall the line of climbing men was now almost at the summit of the twohundredfoot wall and sure enough with only yards to go the end man lost his foothold and with arms and legs flailing and with a scream of terror fell back down the sheer black face his body hit once and then crashed into the calm waters of the moat the instructor muttered something stripped off his shirt clambered on to the rail of the causeway and dived the hundred feet down into the water it was a perfect dive and he swam in a swift crawl towards the body that lay ominously face downwards in the moat tiger turned to bond it is of no account he was going to fail the man anyway and now come into the courtyard the invaders have scaled the wall and they will now use bojutsu on the defenders that is fighting with the stave bond took a last glance at the instructor who was now towing the corpse which it certainly was to the shore by its black hood bond wondered if any of the students was going to fail his test at bojutsu failure was certainly total in tigers training camp back in the courtyard individual couples dancing and dodging were fighting furious single combats with thick staves about two yards long they swung and parried with two hands on the stave lunged at the belly using the stave as a lance or did complicated infighting with face almost pressed against face bond was astonished to see tremendous thrusts and whacks into the groin leaving the victim unmoved when he bond would have been writhing in agony he asked tiger about this tiger his eyes bright with the last of battle answered briefly that he would explain this later meanwhile the invaders were slowly being overcome by the defence black figures toppled unconscious or lay groaning with hands clutched to head or stomach or shin then there came a shrill blast on the whistle from one of the instructors and it was all over the defenders had won a doctor appeared and attended the fallen and those who were on their feet bowed deeply to one another and then in the direction of tiger tiger made a brief and fierce speech which he later told bond was of congratulation on the sincerity of the display and bond was then led into the castle to drink tea and view the museum of ninja armament this included spiked steel wheels the size of a silver dollar which could be whirled on the finger and thrown chains with spiked weights at each end used like the south american bolas for catching cattle sharp nails twisted into knots for defeating barefoot pursuers hollowed bamboo for breathing under water varieties of brass knuckles gloves whose palms were studded with very sharp slightly hooked nails for walking up walls and across ceilings and a host of similar rather primitive gadgets of offence and defence bond made appropriate noises of approval and amazement and reflected on the comparable russian invention used with much success in west germany a cyanide gas pistol that left no trace and a sure diagnosis of heart failure tigers much vaunted ninjutsu just wasnt in the same league out in the courtyard again the leader of the camouflaged troop reported the discovery of motorcycle tyre tracks that stopped and turned back a mile from the castle that had been the only trace of a tail then came to bond the blessed bows and farewells and they were on their way again bound for kyoto well bondosan what did you think of my training school i thought it was very sincere i can imagine that the skills that are learned would be most valuable but i would have thought that the black dress for night work and the various gadgets would have been as incriminating if you were caught as a pistol but they certainly went up that wall damned quick and that bojutsu business would be very effective against the usual nightprowler with a bicycle chain or a flick knife i must get swaine and adeney to make me a twoyardlong walking stick tiger sucked his teeth impatiently you speak like a man who only knows of the sort of fighting that goes on in a cheap western you would not get very far with your methods if you were trying to penetrate north korea dressed as a simple peasant with his staff james bond was rather exhausted by the day he was also sorry for the student who had died showing off for his and tigers delectation he said shortly none of your ninjas would last very long in east berlin and relapsed into a surly silence anatomy class to bonds unspeakable relief they put up that night at the smartest hotel in kyoto the miyako the comfortable bed airconditioning and westernstyle lavatory on which one could actually sit were out of this world better still tiger said that unfortunately he had to dine with the chief of police of the prefecture and bond ordered a pint of jack daniels and a double portion ofeggs benedict to be brought up to his room then from a belated sense of duty he watched the seven detectives a famous japanese television series failed to spot the villain and went to bed and slept for twelve hours the next morning hungover and consciencestricken he obediently fell in with tigers plans that they should visit the oldest whorehouse in japan before a quick drive to osaka for the days journey across the inland sea to the southern island of kyushu bit early for visiting a whorehouse had been his only comment tiger laughed it is a matter of deep regret to me that your baser instincts should always be in the ascendancy bondosan prostitution is now illegal in japan what we are about to visit is a national monument oh good show there was a deal of bowing and hissing at the whorehouse a spacious establishment in the now defunct red lamp street of the ancient capital and they were presented with handsomely bound descriptive booklets by the earnest curator they wandered over polished floors from chamber to chamber and gravely inspected the sword cuts in the wooden supports that had been inflicted according to tiger by samurai infuriated by lust and impatience bond inquired how many actual bedrooms there had been it seemed to him that the whole place was taken up by a vast kitchen and many diningrooms four rooms answered the curator thats no way to run a whorehouse commented bond you need quick throughput like a casino bondosan complained tiger please try and put out of your mind comparisons between our way of life and yours in former times this was a place of rest and recreation food was served and there was music and storytelling people would write tankas take that inscription on the wall it says everything is new tomorrow some man with a profound mind will have written that then he threw his pen away and reached for his sword and shouted when is room no going to be empty national monument indeed its like in the new african states where they pretend the cannibal stewpot in the chiefs hut was for cooking yams for the hungry children everyone tries to forget his rowdy past instead of being proud of it like we are of bloody morgan or nell gwynne for instance the great murderer and the great whore are part of our history you shouldnt try and pretend that your oldest whorehouse is a sort of stratfordonavon tiger uttered an explosive laugh bondosan your comments on our japanese way of life become more and more outrageous come it is time to cleanse your mind in the salubrious breezes of the inland sea the murasaki maru was a very modern oooton ship with all the luxuries of an ocean liner crowds waved her goodbye as if the ship was setting off across the atlantic instead of doing a day trip down the equivalent of a long lake there was much throwing of paper streamers by groups bearing placards to show whom they represented business outings schools clubspart of the vast travelling population of japan for ever on the move making an outing visiting relatives or shrines or just seeing the sights of the country the ship throbbed grandly through the endless horned islands tiger said that there were fine whirlpools like great lavatory pans specially designed for suicides between some of these meanwhile tiger and bond sat in the first class diningroom and consumed hamlets ham omelets and sake tiger was in a lecturing mood he was determined to correct bonds boorish ignorance of japanese culture bondosan i wonder if i will ever get you to appreciate the nuances of the japanese tanka or of the haiku which are the classical forms of japanese verse have you ever heard of basho for instance no said bond with polite interest whos he just so said tiger bitterly and yet you would think me grossly uneducated if i had never heard of shakespeare homer dante cervantes goethe and yet basho who lived in the seventeenth century is the equal of any of them what did he write he was an itinerant poet he was particularly at home with the haiku the verse of seventeen syllables tiger assumed a contemplative expression he intoned in the bitter radish that bites into me i feel the autumn wind does that not say anything to you or this the butterfly is perfuming its wings in the scent of the orchid you do not grasp the beauty of that image rather elusive compared to shakespeare in the fishermans hut mingled with dried shrimps crickets are chirping tiger looked at him hopefully cant get the hang of that one said bond apologetically you do not catch the stilllife quality of these verses the flash of insight into humanity into nature now do me a favour bondosan write a haiku for me yourself i am sure you could get the hang of it after all you must have had some education bond laughed mostly in latin and greek all about caesar and balbus and so on absolutely no help in ordering a cup of coffee in rome or athens after id left school and things like trigonometry which ive totally forgotten but give me a pen and a piece of paper and ill have a bash if youll forgive the bad joke tiger handed them over and bond put his head in his hands finally after much crossing out and rewriting he said tiger hows this it makes just as much sense as old basho and its much more pithy he read out you only live twice once when you are born and once when you look death in the face tiger clapped his hands softly he said with real delight but that is excellent bondosan most sincere he took the pen and paper and jotted some ideograms up the page he shook his head no it wont do in japanese you have the wrong number of syllables but it is a most honourable attempt he looked keenly at bond you were perhaps thinking of your mission perhaps said bond with indifference it is weighing on your mind the practical difficulties are bound to do so i have swallowed the moral principles involved things being as they are i have to accept that the end justifies the means then you are not concerned with your own safety not particularly ive had worse jobs to do i must congratulate you on your stoicism you do not appear to value your life as highly as most westerners tiger looked at him kindly is there perhaps a reason for that bond was offhand not that i can think of but for gods sake chuck it tiger none of your japanese brainwashing more sake and answer my question of yesterday why werent those men disabled by those terrific slashes to the groin that might be of some practical value to me instead of all this waffle about poetry tiger ordered the sake he laughed unfortunately you are too old to benefit i would need to have caught you at the age of about fourteen you see it is this way you know the sumo wrestlers it is they who invented the trick many centuries ago it is vital for them to be immune from damage to those parts of the body now you know that in men the testicles which until puberty have been held inside the body are released by a particular muscle and descend between the legs yes well the sumo wrestler will have been selected for his profession by the time of puberty perhaps because of his weight and strength or perhaps because he comes of a sumo family well by assiduously massaging those parts he is able after much practice to cause the testicles to reenter the body up the inguinal canal down which they originally descended my god you japanese said bond with admiration you really are up to all the tricks you mean he gets them right out of the way behind the bones of the pelvis or what not your knowledge of anatomy is as vague as your appreciation for poetry but that is more or less so yes then before a fight he will bind up that part of the body most thoroughly to contain these vulnerable organs in their hidingplace afterwards in the bath he will release them to hang normally i have seen them do it it is a great pity that it is now too late for you to practise this art it might have given you more confidence on your mission it is my experience that agents fear most for that part of the body when there is fighting to be done or when they risk capture these organs as you know are most susceptible to torture for the extraction of information dont i know it said bond from the heart some of our chaps wear a box when they think theyre in for a rough house i dont care for them too uncomfortable what is a box it is what our cricketers wear to protect those parts when they go out to bat it is a light padded shield of aluminium i regret that we have nothing of that nature we do not play cricket in japan only baseball lucky for you you werent occupied by the british commented bond cricket is a much more difficult and skilful game the americans say otherwise naturally they want to sell you baseball equipment they arrived at beppu in the southern island of kyushu as the sun was setting tiger said that this was just the time to see the famous geysers and fumaroles of the little spa in any case there would be no time in the morning as they would have to start early for fukuoka their final destination bond shivered slightly at the name the moment was rapidly approaching when the sake and sightseeing would have to stop above the town of beppu they visited in turn the ten spectacular hells as they are officially designated the stink of sulphur was disgusting and each bubbling burping nest of volcanic fumaroles was more horrific than the last the steaming mud and belching geysers were of different colours red blue and orange and everywhere there were warning notices and skulls and crossbones to keep visitors at a safe distance the tenth hell announced in english and japanese that there would be an eruption punctually every twenty minutes they joined a small group of spectators under the arc lights that pinpointed a small quiescent crater in a rock area bespattered with mud sure enough in five minutes there came a rumbling from underground and a jet of steaming grey mud shot twenty feet up into the air and splashed down inside the enclosure as bond was turning away he noticed a large red painted wheel heavily padlocked and surrounded by wirenetting in a small separate enclosure there were warning notices above it and a particularly menacing skull and crossbones bond asked tiger what it was it says that this wheel controls the pulse of the geyser it says that if this wheel were screwed down it could result in the destruction of the entire establishment it gives the explosive force of the volcano if the exhaust valve of the geyser were to be closed as the equivalent of a thousand pounds of tnt it is of course all a bit of nonsense to attract the tourists but now back to the town bondosanl since it is our last day together he added hastily on this particular voyage i have arranged a special treat i ordered it by radio from the ship a fugu feast bond cursed silently the memory of his eggs benedict the night before was intolerably sweet what new monstrosity was this he asked fugu is the japanese blowfish in the water it looks like a brown owl but when captured it blows itself up into a ball covered with wounding spines we sometimes dry the skins and put candles inside and use them as lanterns but the flesh is particularly delicious it is the staple food of the sumo wrestlers because it is supposed to be very strengthgiving the fish is also very popular with suicides and murderers because its liver and sex glands contain a poison which brings death instantaneously thats just what i would have chosen for dinner how thoughtful of you tiger have no fear bondosan because of the dangerous properties of the fish every fugu restaurant has to be manned by experts and be registered with the state they left their bags at a japanese inn where tiger had reserved rooms enjoyed the ofuro honourable bath together in the bluetiled miniature swimming pool whose water was very hot and smelled of sulphur and then totally relaxed went off down the street leading to the sea the restaurant had a giant blowfish hanging as a sign above the door and inside to bonds relief there were westernstyle chairs and tables at which a smattering of people were eating with the intense concentration of the japanese they were expected and their table had been prepared bond said now then tiger im not going to commit honourable suicide without at least five bottles of sake inside me the flasks were brought all five of them to the accompaniment of much tittering by the waitresses bond downed the lot tumbler by tumbler and expressed himself satisfied now you can bring on this blasted blowfish he said belligerently and if it kills me it will be doing a good turn to our friend the doctor in his castle a very beautiful white porcelain dish as big as a bicycle wheel was brought forward with much ceremony on it were arranged in the pattern of a huge flower petal upon petal of a very thinly sliced and rather transparent white fish bond followed tigers example and set to with his chopsticks he was proud of the fact that he had reached black belt standard with these instrumentsthe ability to eat an underdone fried egg with them the fish tasted of nothing not even of fish but it was very pleasant on the palate and bond was effusive in his compliments because tiger smacking his lips over each morsel obviously expected it of him there followed various sidedishes containing other parts of the fish and more sake but this time containing raw fugu fins bond sat back and lit a cigarette he said well tiger this is nearly the end of my education tomorrow you say i am to leave the nest how many marks out of a hundred tiger looked at him quizzically you have done well bondosan apart from your inclination to make western jokes about eastern customs fortunately i am a man of infinite patience and i must admit that your company has given me much pleasure and a certain amount of amusement i will award you seventyfive marks out of a possible hundred as they rose to go a man brushed past bond to get to the exit he was a stocky man with a white masko over his mouth and he wore an ugly leather hat the man on the train well welll thought bond if he shows up on the last lap to fukuoka ill get him if not ill reluctantly put it down to funny coincidence department but it looks like nought out of a hundred to tiger for powers of observation part two than to arrive appointment in samara at six in the morning a car from the prefect of police in fukuoka came for them there were two police corporals in the front seat they went off northwards on the coast road at a good pace after a while bond said tiger were being followed i dont care what you say the man who stole my wallet was in the fugu restaurant last night and hes now a mile behind on a motorcycle or ill eat my hat be a good chap and tell the driver to dodge up a sideroad and then go after him and get him ive got a sharp nose for these things and i ask you to do what i say tiger grunted he looked back and then issued rapid instructions to the driver the driver said hai briskly and the corporal at his side unbuttoned the holster of his m automatic tiger flexed his powerful fingers they came to a track on the left which went into the scrub the driver did a good racing change and pulled in out of sight of the road he cut his engine they listened the roar of a motorcycle approached and receded the driver reversed sharply on to the road and tore off in pursuit tiger issued more sharp instructions he said to bond i have told him to try warning the man with his siren and if he doesnt stop to ride him into the ditch well im glad youre giving him a chance said bond beginning to have qualms i may be wrong and he may only be a fuller brush man in a hurry they were doing eighty along the winding road they soon came up with the mans dust and then there was the machine itself the man was hunched over the handlebars going like hell the driver said something tiger translated he says its a cc honda on that he could easily get away from us but even japanese crooks are men of discipline he will prefer to obey the siren the siren wailed and then screamed the white mask gleamed as the man glanced over his shoulder he braked slowly to a stop his right hand went inside his jacket bond had his hand on the doorlatch he said watch out tiger hes got a gun and as they pulled up alongside he hurled himself out of the door and crashed into the man knocking him and his machine to the ground the corporal beside the driver took a flying leap and the two bodies rolled into the ditch almost immediately the corporal got to his feet he had a bloodstained knife in his hand he threw it aside and tore at the mans coat and shirt he looked up and shook his head tiger shouted something and the corporal began slapping the mans fece as hard as he could from side to side the masko was knocked off and bond recognized the snarling rictus of death he said sickened stop him tigerl the mans dead tiger walked down into the ditch he picked up the mans knife and bent down and slit the right sleeve of the corpse up to the shoulder he looked and then called bond down he pointed to a black ideogram tattooed in the crook of the mans arm he said you were right bondosan he is a black dragon he stood up and his face contorted spat out shimata the two policemen were standing by looking politely baffled tiger gave them orders they searched the mans clothing and extracted various commonplace objects including bonds wallet with the five thousand yen stillintact and a cheap diary they handed everything to tiger and then hauled the corpse out of the ditch and stuffed it roughly into the boot of the car then they hid the motorcycle in some bushes and everyone dusted themselves and got back into the car after a few moments tiger said thoughtfully it is incredible i these people must have a permanent tail on me in tokyo he riffled through the diary yes all my movements for the past week and all the stoppingplaces on our journey you are simply described as a gaijin but he could have tele phoned a description this is indeed an unfortunate business bondosan i apologize most deeply you may already be incriminated i will naturally absolve you from your mission it is entirely my fault for being careless i have not been taking these people seriously enough i must talk with tokyo as soon as we get to fukuoka but at least you have seen an example of the measures doctor shatterhand takes for his protection there is certainly more to this man than meets the eye at some time in his life he must have been an experienced intelligence agent to have discovered my identity for instance which is a state secret to have recognized me as his chief enemy to have taken the appropriate countermeasures to ensure his privacy this is either a great madman or a great criminal you agree bondosan looks mighty like it im really getting quite keen to have a sight of the fellow and dont worry about the mission this was probably just the jolt i needed to get the wind under my tail the headquarters of the local department of the sosaka the cid forthe southern island of kyushu was just off the main street of fukuoka it was a sternlooking building in yellow lavatory brick in a style derived from the german tiger confirmed that it had been the headquarters of the kempeitai the japanese gestapo before and during the war tiger was received with pomp the office of the chief of the cid was small and cluttered superintendent ando himself looked to bond like any other japanese salaryman but he had a military bearing and the eyes behind the rimless spectacles were quick and hard bond sat patiently smoking while much conversation went on a blownup aerial mosaic of the castle of death and the surrounding country was produced from a riling cabinet and laid out on the desk superintendent ando weighed down the corners with ashtrays and other hardware and tiger called him over with a respect bond noticed that was not lost on the superintendent it crossed bonds mind that he had heaped much on on tiger or alternatively that tiger had lost much face visavis bond by the business of the black dragon agent tiger said please to examine this photograph bondosan the superintendent says that a clandestine approach from the landward side is now very difficult the suicides pay local peasants to lead them through these marshlands he pointed and there are recognized breaches in the walls surrounding the property which are constantly changed and kept open for the suicides every time the superintendent posts a guard at one of them another is made known to the peasants by the castle guards he says he is at his wits end twenty bodies have been fetched to the mortuary in the past week the superintendent wishes to hand in his resignation naturally said bond and then perhaps honourable fugu poisoning lets have a look at first glance bonds heart quailed he might just as well try and storm windsor castle singlehanded the estate covered the whole expanse of a small promontory that jutted out into the sea from a rocky coast and the twohundredfoot cliff round the promontory had been revetted with giant stone blocks down to the breaking waves to form an unbroken wall that sloped slightly up to gunports and the irregularlysited tiled watchtowers from the top of this wall there appeared to be a tenfoot drop into the park heavily treed and shrubbed between winding streams and a broad lake with a small island in its centre steam appeared to be rising from the lake and there were occasional wisps of it among the shrubbery at the back of the property stood the castle protected from the lowlying countryside by a comparatively modest wall it would be over this wall that the suicides gained access the castle itself was a giant fivestoreyed affair in the japanese tradition with swooping winged roofs of glazed tile dolphinshaped finials decorated the topmost storey and there was a profusion of other decorative devices small balconies isolated turrets and gazebos so that the whole blackpainted edifice edged here and there with what tiger said was gold paint gave the impression of a brilliant attempt to make a stage setting for dracula bond picked up a large magnifying glass and ran over the whole property inch by inch but there was nothing more to be gleaned except the presence of an occasional diminutive figure at work in the park or raking the gravel round the castle bond laid down the glass he said gloomily thats not a castle thats a fortress how am i supposed to get into the bloody place the superintendent asks if you are a good swimmer i have had a complete outfit sent down from my ninjutsu establishment the seaward wall would present no problems i can swim well enough but how do i get to the base of the wall where do i start from the superintendent says there is an ama island called kuro only half a mile out to sea whats an ama island they exist at different places round japan i believe there are some fifty such settlements the ama are a tribe whose girls dive for the awabi shellsthat is our local abalone a clam it is a great delicacy they sometimes dive for pearl oysters they dive naked some of them are very beautiful but they keep themselves very much to themselves and visitors to their islands are completely discouraged they have their own primitive culture and customs i suppose you could compare them to seagipsies they rarely marry outside the tribe and it is that which has made them a race apart sounds intriguing but how am i going to make a base on this kuro island i may have to wait days for the weather to be right tiger spoke rapidly to the superintendent and there was a lengthy reply ah so desu ka said tiger with interest and enthusiasm he turned to bond it seems that the superintendent is distantly related to a family on kuro it is a most interesting family there is a father and a mother and one daughter she is called kissy suzuki i have heard of her when she was seventeen she became famous in japan by being chosen to go to hollywood to make a film they wanted a japanese diving girl of great beauty and someone had heard of her she made the film but hated hollywood and longed only to return to her ama life she could have made a fortune but she retired to this obscure island there was a great todo in the press at the time and it was judged that she had behaved most honourably they christened her the japanese garbo but kissy will now be twentythree and everyone has forgotten about her the superintendent says that he could arrange for you to stay with this family they seem to have some obligation towards him he says it is a simple house but comfortable because of the money this girl earned in hollywood the other houses on the island are nothing but fishermens shacks but wont the rest of the community resent me being there no the people of the island belong to the shinto religion the superintendent will speak to the shinto priest and everything will be okay all right so i stay on this island and then one night i swim across to the wall how do i get up it you will have the ninja outfit it is here you have seen how it is used you will use it it is very simple as i saw from the man who fell into the moat then what do i do you hide up in the grounds and wait for an opportunity to kill him how you do that is up to you as i told you he goes about in armour a man in armour is very vulnerable you only have to knock him off his feet then you will throttle him with the ninja chain you will be wearing round your waist if his wife is with him you will throttle her too she is certainly involved in all this business and anyway she is too ugly to live then you escape over the wall and swim back to kuro there you will be picked up by the police launch which will visit the place at once the news of the death will quickly get round bond said doubtfully well it all sounds very simple but what about these guards the place is crawling with them you must just keep out of their way as you can see the park is full of hidingplaces thanks very much in one of those poison bushes or up one of those trees i dont want to blind myself or go mad the ninja clothing will give you complete protection you will have a black suit for night and a camouflage one for the day you will wear the swimming goggles to protect your eyes all this equipment you will tow over in a plastic bag which will be provided my dear tiger youve thought of everything but id much rather have just one little gun that would be crazy bondosan you know perfectly well that silence will be essential and with a silencer which would be very heavy to swim with the speed of the bullet would be so much reduced that you might not pierce the armour no my friend use ninjutsu it is the only way oh all right said bond resignedly now lets have a look at a photograph of this chap has the superintendent got one it had been taken from a long way away with a telephoto lens it showed a giant figure in full medieval chain armour with the jagged winged helmet of ancient japanese warriors bond studied the photograph carefully noting the vulnerable spots at neck and joints a metal shield protected the mans groin a widebladed samurai sword hung from his waist but there was no sign of any other weapon bond said thoughtfully he doesnt look as daft as he ought to probably because of the dracula setting have you got one of his face perhaps he looks a bit madder in the raw the superintendent went to the bottom of his file and extracted what looked like a blownup copy of doctor guntram shatterhands passport photograph and handed it over bond took it nonchalantly then his whole body stiffened he said to himself god almighty god almighty yes there was no doubt no doubt at all he had grown a drooping black moustache he had had the syphilitic nose repaired there was a goldcapped tooth among the upper frontals but there could be no doubt bond looked up he said have you got one of the woman startled by the look of controlled venom on bonds face and by the pallor that showed through the walnut dye the superintendent bowed energetically and scrabbled through his file yes there she was the bitch the flat ugly wardress face the dull eyes the scrapedback bun of hair bond held the pictures not looking at them thinking ernst stavro blofeld irma bunt so this was where they had come to hide and the long strong gut of fate had lassoed him to them they of all people he of all people a taxiride down the coast in this remote corner of japan could they smell him coming had the dead spy got hold of his name and told them unlikely the power and prestige of tiger would have protected him privacy discretion are the heartbeat of japanese inns but would they know that an enemy was on his way that fate had arranged this appointment in samara bond looked up from the pictures he was in cold control of himself this was now a private matter it had nothing to do with tiger or japan it had nothing to do with magic it was ancient feud he said casually tiger could the superintendent inquire what his detectives have made of that black dragon agent and of his belongings i am particularly interested to know whether he may have telephoned or telegraphed my description or my purpose in coming down here there was a long and electric silence in the room tiger examined bonds face with piercing interest before he passed the inquiry on to the superintendent the superintendent picked up the receiver of an oldfashioned telephone on a double hook he spoke into it then a japanese habit blew sharply into the mouthpiece to clear the line and spoke again at length he said ah so desu ka many times then he put down the receiver when he had finished talking tiger turned to bond again with the same piercing appraisal of bonds face he said the man came from these parts he has a police record fortunately he was poorly educated and is known as nothing more than a stupid thug on the first page of the diary he wrote down his assignment which was only to follow me to my destination and then report to his master it seems unlikely that he was provided with funds for expensive communications but what is it bondosan is it that you know these people james bond laughed it was a laugh that grated even to bond it sounded harsh and false in the small room he had immediately made up his mind to keep his knowledge to him self to reveal the true identity of doctor shatterhand would be to put the whole case back into official channels the japanese secret service and the cia would swarm down to fukuoka blofeld and irma bunt would be arrested james bonds personal prey would be snatched from him there would be no revenge i bond said good lord no i but i am something of a physiognomist when i saw this mans face it was as if someone had walked over my grave i have a feeling that whether i succeed or not the outcome of this mission is going to be decisive for one or the other of us it will not be a drawn game but now i have a number of further questions with which i must worry you and the superintendent they are small matters of detail but i want to get everything right before i start tiger looked relieved the raw animalism in bonds face had been so different from the stoical ironical face of the bondosan for whom he had come to have so much affection he gave his great golden smile and said but of course my friend and i am pleased with your worries and with the trouble you are taking to make sure of everything in advance you will forgive me if i quote you one last japanese proverb it says a reasonable number of fleas is good for a dog otherwise the dog forgets he is a dog good old basho said bond kissy suzuki james bond went through the rest of the morning like an automaton while he tried on his ninja equipment and watched each item being carefully packed into a floatable plastic container his mind was totally occupied with the image of his enemy this man blofeld the great gangster who had founded spectre the special executive for counterintelligence terrorism revenge and extortion the man who was wanted by the police of all the nato countries the man who had murdered tracy bonds wife for less than a day a bare nine months ago and in those nine months this evil genius had invented a new method of collecting death as tiger had put it this cover as the swiss doctor shatterhand as a rich botanist must have been one of the many he had wisely built up over the years it would have been easy a few gifts of rare plants to famous botanical gardens the financing of a handful of expeditions and all the while in the back of his mind the plan one day to retire and cultiver son jardin and what a garden a garden that would be like a deadly flytrap for human beings a killing bottle for those who wanted to die and of course japan with the highest suicide statistics in the world a country with an unquenchable thirst for the bizarre the cruel and the terrible would provide the perfect last refuge for him blofeld must have gone off his head but with a monstrous calculating madness the madness of the genius he undoubtedly was and the whole demoniac concept was on blofelds usual grand scale the scale of a caligula of a nero of a hitler of any other great enemy of mankind the speed of execution was breathtaking the expenditure fabulous the planning down to the use of the black dragon society meticulous and the cover as impeccable as the piz gloria clinic which less than a year before bond had helped to destroy utterly and now the two enemies were lined up again but this time david was spurred on to kill his goliath not by duty but by blood feud and with what weapons nothing but his bare hands a twoinch pocket knife and a thin chain of steel well similar weapons had served him before surprise would be the determining factor bond added a pair of black flippers to his equipment a small supply of pemmicanlike meat benzedrine tablets a plastic flask of water then he was ready they motored down the main street to where the police launch was waiting at the jetty and set off at a good twenty knots across the beautiful bay and round the headland into the sea of genkai tiger produced sandwiches and a flask of sake for each of them and they ate their luncheon as the jagged green coast with its sandy beaches passed slowly by to port tiger pointed out a distant dot on the horizon kuro island he said cheer up bondosan you seem preoccupied think of all those beautiful naked women you will soon be swimming with and this japanese greta garbo with whom you will be passing the nights and the sharks who will already be gathering at the news of my swim to the castle if they do not eat the amas why should they eat a bit of tough englishman look at the two fish eagles circling that is an excellent augury one alone would have been less propitious four would have been disastrous for with us four is the same as your thirteen the worst number of all but bondosan does it not amuse you to think of that foolish dragon dozing all unsuspecting in his castle while st george comes silently riding towards his lair across the waves it would make the subject for a most entertaining japanese print youve got a funny sense of humour tiger it is merely different from yours most of our funny stories involve death or disaster i am not a picturedaddy a professional storyteller but i will tell you my favourite it concerns the young girl who comes to the toll bridge she tosses one sen a very small piece of money to the watchman and walks on the watchman calls after her hey you know that the toll for crossing the bridge is two sen the girl answers but i do not intend to cross the bridge i intend only to go halfway and then throw myself into the river tiger laughed uproariously bond smiled politely i must save that one up for london theyll split their sides over it the small speck on the horizon grew larger and soon revealed itself as a horned island about five miles in circumference with steep cliffs and a small harbour facing north on the mainland doctor shatterhands small peninsula reached out into the sea and the fortresslike black wall soared up out of the breaking waves above it were the tops of trees and behind them in the distance the winged roof of the topmost storey of the castle broke the skyline the formidable silhouette reminded bond vaguely of photographs of alcatraz taken from sealevel he shivered slightly at the thought of the nights swim across the halfmile channel and of the black spider that would then scale those soaring fortifications ah well he turned his attention back to kuro island it appeared to be made of black volcanic rock but there was much green vegetation right up to the summit of a small peak on which there was some kind of a stone beacon when they rounded the headland that formed one arm of the bay a crowded little village and a jetty appeared out to sea thirty or more rowing boats were scattered and there was the occasional glint of pink flesh in the sunlight naked children were playing among the big smooth black boulders that tumbled like bathing hippos along the shoreline and there were green nets hung up to dry it was a pretty scene with the delicate remoteness the fairyland quality of small fishing communities all the world over bond took an immediate liking to the place as if he was arriving at a destination that had been waiting for him and that would be friendly and welcoming a group of village elders grave gnarled old men with the serious expressions of simple people on important occasions led by the shinto priest was on the jetty to welcome them the priest was in ceremonial robes a darkred threequarterlength kimono with vast hanging sleeves a turquoise skirt in broad pleats and the traditional shining black hat in the shape of a blunt cone he was a man of simple dignity and considerable presence middleaged with a round face and round spectacles and a pursed judging mouth his shrewd eye took them in one by one as they came ashore but they rested longest on bond superintendent ando was greeted with friendship as well as respect this was part of his parish and he was the ultimate source of all fishing permits reflected bond ungraciously but he had to admit that the deference of the bows was not exaggerated and that he was lucky in his ambassador they proceeded up the cobbled path of the main street to the priests house a modest weatherbeaten affair of stone and carpentered driftwood they entered and sat on the spotless polished wood floor in an arc in front of the priest and the superintendent made a long speech punctuated by serious hais and ah so desu kas from the priest who occasionally let his wise eyes rest thoughtfully on bond he made a short speech in return to which the superintendent and tiger listened with deference tiger replied and the business of the meeting was over save for the inevitable tea bond asked tiger how his presence and mission had been explained tiger said that it would have been of no use lying to the priest who was a shrewd man so hehad been told most of the truth the priest had expressed regret that such extreme measures were contemplated but he agreed that the castle across the sea was a most evil place and its owner a man in league with the devil in the circumstances he would give the project his blessing and james bond would be allowed to stay on the island for the minimum time necessary to accomplish his mission the priest would invite the suzuki family to accord him an honourable welcome bond would be explained away to the elders as a famous gaijin anthropologist who had come to study the ama way of life bond should therefore study it but the priest requested that bond should behave in a sincere manner which means explained tiger with a malicious grinthat you are not to go to bed with the girls in the evening they walked back to the jetty the sea was a dark slate colour and mirrorcalm the little boats bedecked with coloured flags which meant that it had been an exceptional days fishing were winging their way back the entire population of kuro perhaps two hundred souls was lined up along the shore to greet the heroines of the day the older people holding carefully folded shawls and blankets to warm up the girls on their way to their homes where according to tiger they would be given hot basinbaths to get back their circulation and remove all traces of saltitwas now five oclock they would be asleep by eight said tiger and out again with the dawn tiger was sympathetic you will have to adjust your hours bondosan and your way of life the ama live very frugally very cheaply for their earnings are small no more than the price of sparrows tears as we say and for heavens sake be very polite to the parents particularly the father as for kissy he left the sentence hanging in the air eager hands reached for each boat and with happy shouts pulled it up on the black pebbles big wooden tubs were lifted out and rushed up the beach to a kind of rickety market where according to tiger the awabi were graded and priced meanwhile the chattering smiling girls waded in through the shallows and cast modestly appraising glances at the three mainland strangers on the jetty to bond they all seemed beautiful and gay in the soft evening lightthe proud rather coarsenippled breasts the gleaming muscled buttocks cleft by the black cord that held in place the frontal triangle of black cotton the powerful thong round the waist with its string of oval lead weights through which was stuck an angular steel pick the white rag round the tumbled hair and below the laughing dark eyes and lips that were happy with the luck of the day at that moment it all seemed to bond as the world as life should be and he felt ashamed of his cityslicker appearance let alone the black designs it concealed one girl rather taller than the rest seemed to pay no attention to the men on the jetty or to the police launch riding beside it she was the centre of a crowd of laughing girls as she waded with a rather long perhaps studied stride over the shiny black pebbles and up the beach she flung back a remark at her companions and they giggled putting their hands up to their mouths then a wizened old woman held out a coarse brown blanket to her and she wrapped it round herself and the group dispersed the couple the old woman and the young one walked up the beach to the market the young one talked excitedly the old one paid attention and nodded the priest was waiting for them they bowed very low he talked to them and they listened with humility casting occasional glances towards the group on the jetty the tall girl drew her blanket more closely round her james bond had guessed it already now he knew this was kissy suzuki the three people the splendidly attired priest the walnutfaced old fisherwoman and the tall naked girl wrapped in her drab blanket came along the jetty the girl hanging back in a curious way they were a homogeneous trio and the priest might have been the father the women stopped and the priest came forward he bowed to bond and addressed him tiger translated he says that the father and mother of kissy suzuki would be honoured to receive you in their humble abode for whose poverty they apologize they regret that they are not accustomed to western ways but their daughter is proficient in english as a result of her work in america and will endeavour to convey your wishes to them the priest asks if you can row a boat the father who previously rowed for his daughter is stricken with rheumatism it would be of great assistance to the family if you would deign to take his place bond bowed he said please convey to his reverence that i am most grateful for his intercession on my behalf i would be most honoured to have a place to lay my head in the home of suzukisan my needs are very modest and i greatly enjoy the japanese way of life i would be most pleased to row the family boat or help the household in any other way he added sotto voce tiger i may need these peoples help when the time comes particularly the girls how much can i tell her tiger said softly use your discretion the priest knows therefore the girl can know she will not spread it abroad and now come forward and let the priest introduce you dont forget that your name here is taro which means first son todoroki which means thunder the priest is not interested in your real name i have said that this is an approximation of your english name it doesnt matter nobody will care but you must try to assume some semblance of a japanese personality for when you get to the other side this name is on your identity cardand on your miners union card from the coal mines of fukuoka you need not bother with these things here for you are among friends on the other side if you are caught you will show the card that says you are deaf and dumb all right tiger talked to the priest and bond was led forward to the two women he bowed low to the mother but he remembered not to bow too low as she was only a woman and then he turned to the girl she laughed gaily she didnt titter or giggle she actually laughed she said you dont have to bow to me and i shall never bow to you she held out her hand how do you do my name is kissy suzuki the hand was icecold bond said my name is taro todoroki and i am sorry to have kept you here so long you are cold and you ought to go and have your hot bath it is very kind of your family to accept me as your guest but i do not want to be an imposition are you sure its all right whatever the kannushisan the priest says is all right and i have been cold before when you have finished with your distinguished friends my mother and i will be happy to lead you to our house i hope you are good at peeling potatoes bond was delighted thank god for a straightforward girl at last no more bowing and hissing he said i took a degree in it and i am strong and willing and i dont snore what time do we take out the boat about five thirty when the sun comes up perhaps you will bring me good luck the awabi shells are not easy to find we had a lucky day today and i earned about thirty dollars but it is not always so i dont reckon in dollars lets say ten pounds arent englishmen the same as americans isnt the money the same very alike but totally different is that so you mean ah so desti ka the girl laughed you have been well trained by the important man from tokyo perhaps you will now say goodbye to him and we can go home it is at the other end of the village the priest the superintendent and tiger had been talking together ostensibly paying no attention to bond and the girl the mother had been standing humbly but with shrewd eyes watching every expression on the two faces bond now bowed again to her and went back to the group of men farewells were brief dusk was creeping up over the sea and the orange ball of the sun had already lost its brilliance in the evening haze the engine of the police boat had been started up and its exhaust bubbled softly bond thanked the superintendent and was wished good fortune in his honourable endeavours tiger looked serious he took bonds hand in both of his an unusual gesture for a japanese he said bondosan i am certain you will succeed so i will not wish you luck nor will i say sayonara farewell i will simply say a quiet banzai to you and give you this little presento in case the gods frown upon your venture and through no fault of yours things go wrong very wrong he took out a little box and gave it to bond the box rattled bond opened it inside was one long brownish pill bond laughed he gave it back to tiger and said no thanks tiger as basho said or almost said you only live twice if my second life comes up i would rather look it in the face and not turn my back on it but thanks and thanks for everything those live lobsters were really delicious i shall now look forward to eating plenty of seaweed while im here so long see you in about a week tiger got down into the boat and the engine revved up as the boat took the swell at the entrance to the harbour tiger raised a hand and brought it swiftly down with a chopping motion and then the boat was round the seawall and out of sight bond turned away the priest had gone kissy suzuki said impatiently come along todorokisan the kannushisan says i am to treat you as a comrade as an equal but give me one of those two little bags to carry for the sake of the villagers who will be watching inquisitively we will wear the oriental face in public and the tall man with the dark face cropped hair and slanting eyebrows the tall girl and the old woman walked off along the shore with their angular japanese shadows preceding them across the smooth black boulders one golden day dawn was a beautiful haze of gold and blue bond went outside and ate his bean curd and rice and drank his tea sitting on the spotless doorstep of the little cutstone and timbered house while indoors the family chattered like happy sparrows as the women went about their housework bond had been allotted the room of honour the small sittingroom with its tatami mats scraps of furniture house shrine and a cricket in a small cageto keep you company as kissy had explained here his futon had been spread on the ground and he had for the first time and with fair success tried sleeping with his head on the traditional wooden pillow the evening before the father an emaciated greybeard with knotted joints and bright squirrel eyes had laughed with and at him as kissy translated bonds account of some of his adventures with tiger and there was from the first a complete absence of tension or selfconsciousness the priest had said that bond should be treated as a member of the family and although his appearance and some of his manners were strange kissy had apparently announced her qualified approval of him and the parents followed her lead at nine oclock under the threequarter moon the father had beckoned to bond and had hobbled out with him to the back of the house he showed him the little shack with the hole in the ground and the neatly quartered pages of the asahi shimbun on a nail and the last of bonds private fears about life on the island was removed his flickering candle showed the place to be as spotless as the house and at least adequately salubrious after the soft movements in the other two rooms had ceased bond had slept happily and like the dead kissy came out of the house she was wearing a kind of white cotton nightdress and a white cotton kerchief bound up the thick black waves of her hair she wore her equipment the weights and the heavy flat angular pick over the white dress and only her arms and feet were bare bond may have shown his disappointment she laughed teasing him this is ceremonial dress for diving in the presence of important strangers the kannushisan instructed me to wear it in your company as a mark of respect of course kissy i believe that is a fib the truth of the matter is that you consider that your nakedness might arouse dishonourable thoughts in my impious western mind that is a most unworthy suspicion however i accept the delicacy of your respect of my susceptibilities and now lets cut the cackle and get going well beat the awabi record today what should we aim at fifty would be good a hundred would be wonderful but above all you must row well and not let me drown and you must be kind to david whos david asked bond suddenly jealous at the thought that he would not be having this girl to himself wait and see she went back indoors and brought out the balsa wood tub and a great coil of fine quarterinch rope she handed the rope to bond and hoisted the tub on her hip leading the way along a small path away from the village the path descended slowly to a small cove in which one rowingboat covered with dried reeds to protect it from the sun was drawn high up on the flat black pebbles bond stripped off the reeds and laid them aside and hauled the simple locallymade craft down to the sea it was constructed of some heavy wood and lay low but stable in the deeply shelving totally transparent water he loaded in the rope and the wooden tub kissy had gone to the other side of the little bay and had undone a string from one of the rocks she began winding it in slowly and at the same time uttering a low cooing whistle to bonds astonishment there was a flurry in the water of the bay and a big black cormorant shot like a bullet through the shallows and waddled up the beach to kissys feet craning its neck up and down and hissing apparently in anger but kissy bent down and stroked the creature on its plumed head and down the outstretched neck at the same time talking to it gaily she came towards the boat winding up the long line and the cormorant followed clumsily it paid no attention to bond but jumped untidily over the side of the boat and scrambled on to the small thwart in the bows where it squatted majestically and proceeded to preen itself running its long bill down and through its breast feathers and occasionally opening its wings to the full extent of their fivefoot span and flapping them with gentle grace then with a final shimmy through all its length it settled down and gazed out to sea with its neck coiled backwards as if to strike and its turquoise eyes questing the horizon imperiously kissy climbed into the boat and settled herself with her knees hunched decorously between bonds outstretched legs and bond slid the heavy narrowbladed oars into their wooden rowlocks and began rowing at a powerful even pace more or less under kissys direction due north he had noticed that kissys line to the cormorant ended with a thin brass ring perhaps two inches in diameter round the base of the birds neck this would be one of the famous fishing cormorants of japan bond asked her about it kissy said i found him as a baby three years ago he had oil on his wings and i cleaned him and cared for him and had him ringed the ring has had to be made larger as he grew up now you see he can swallow small fish but the big ones he brings to the surface in his beak he hands them over quite willingly and occasionally he gets a piece of a big one as a reward he swims a lot by my side and keeps me company it can be very lonely down there particularly when the sea is dark you will have to hold the end of the line and look after him when he comes to the surface today he will be hungry he has not been out for three days because my father could not row the boat i have been going out with friends so it is lucky for him that you came to the island so this is david yes i named him after the only man i liked in hollywood an englishman as it happens he was called david niven he is a famous actor and producer you have heard of him of course i shall enjoy tossing him a scrap or two of fish in exchange for the pleasure he has given me in his other incarnation the sweat began to pour down bonds face and chest into his bathing pants kissy undid the kerchief round her hair and leant forward arid mopped at him gently bond smiled into her almond eyes and had his first closeup of her snub nose and petalled mouth she wore no makeup and did not need to for she had that rosytinted skin on a golden background the colours of a golden peach that is quite common in japan her hair released from the kerchief was black with darkbrown highlights it was heavily waved but with a soft fringe that ended an inch or so above the straight fine eyebrows that showed no signs of having been plucked her teeth were even and showed no more prominently between the lips than with a european girl so that she avoided the toothiness that is a weak point in the japanese face her arms and legs were longer and less masculinethan is usual with japanese girls and the day before bond had seen that her breasts and buttocks were firm and proud and that her stomach was almost flat a beautiful figure equal to that of any of the star chorus girls he had seen in the cabarets of tokyo but her hands and feet were rough and scarred with work and her fingernails and toenails although they were cut very short were broken bond found this rather endearing ama meansseagirl orseaman and kissy wore the marks of competing with the creatures of the ocean with obvious indifference and her skin which might have suffered from constant contact with salt water in fact glowed with a golden sheen of health and vitality but it was the charm and directness of her eyes and smile as well as her complete naturalness for instance when she mopped at bonds face and chest that endeared her so utterly to bond at that moment he thought there would be nothing more wonderful than to spend the rest of his life rowing her out towards the horizon during the day and coming back with her to the small clean house in the dusk he shrugged the whimsy aside only another two days to the full moon and he would have to get back to reality to the dark dirty life he had chosen for himself he put the prospect out of his mind today and the next day would be stolen days days with only kissy and the boat and the bird and the sea he must just see to it that they were happy days and lucky ones for her and her harvest of seashells kissy said not much longer and you have rowed well she gestured to the right to where the rest of the ama fleet was spread out over the ocean with us it is first come first served with the sites we choose today we can get out as far as a shoal most of us know of and we shall have it to ourselves there the seaweed is thick on the rocks and that is what the awabi feed on it is deep about forty feet but i can stay down for almost a minute long enough to pick up two three awabi if i can find them that is just a matter of luck in feeling about with the hands among the seaweed for you rarely see the shells you only feel them and dislodge them with this she tapped her angular pick after a while i shall have to rest then perhaps you would like to go down yes they tell me you are a good swimmer and i have brought a pair of my fathers goggles these bulbs at the sides she showed him have to be squeezed to equalize the pressure between the glasses and the eyes you will perhaps not be able to stay down long to begin with but you will learn quickly how long will you be staying on kuro only two or three days im afraid oh but that is sad what will david and i do for a boatman then perhaps your father will get better that is so i must take him to a cure place at one of the volcanoes on the mainland otherwise it will mean marrying one of the men on kuro that is not easy the choice is not wide and because i have a little money from my film work and a little is a lot on kuro the man might want to marry me for the wrong reasons that would be sad and how is one to know perhaps you will go back into films her expression became fierce never i hated it they were all disgusting to me in hollywood they thought that because i am a japanese i am some sort of an animal and that my body is for everyone nobody treated me honourably except this niven she shook her head to get rid of the memories no i will stay on kuro for ever the gods will solve my problems she smiled like they have today she scanned the sea ahead another hundred yards she got up and balancing perfectly despite the swell tied the end of the long rope round her waist and adjusted the goggles above her forehead now remember keep the rope taut and when you feel one tug pull me up quickly it will be hard work for you but i will massage your back when we get home this evening i am very good at it i have had enough practice with my father now bond shipped the oars gratefully behind him david began shifting on his feet craning his long neck and hissing impatiently kissy tied a short line to the wooden tub and put it over the side she followed slipping decorously into the water and clasping her white dress between her knees so that it did not flower out around her at once david dived and disappeared without a ripple the line tied to bonds thwart began paying out fast he picked up the coil of kissys rope and stood up his joints cracking kissy pulled down her goggles and put her head underwater in a moment she came up she smiled yes it looks fine down there she rested in the water and began making a soft cooing whistle through pursed lips to fill her lungs to the uttermost bond assumed then with a brief wave of the hand she put down her head and arched her hips so that bond had a brief sight of the black string cleaving her behind under the thin material suddenly like a fleeting white wraith she was gone straight down her feet twinkling behind her in a fast crawl to help the pull of the weights bond paid out fast keeping an anxious eye on his watch david appeared below him bearing a halfpound silvery fish crosswise in his beak damn the bird this was no time to get mixed up with retrieving fish from the extremely sharplooking beak but with a contemptuous glance the cormorant tossed the fish into the floating tub and disappeared like a black bullet fifty seconds bond started nervously when the tug came he pulled in fast the white wraith appeared far below in the crystal water and as she came up bond saw that her hands were tight against her sides to streamline her body she broke surface beside the boat and held out two fat awabi to show him and then dropped them into the tub she held on to the side of the boat to regain her breath and bond gazed down at the wonderful breasts taut beneath their thin covering she smiled briefly up at him began her cooing whistle and then came the exciting arch of the back and she was gone again an hour went by bond got used to the routine and had time to watch the nearest of the fleet of other boats they covered perhaps a mile of sea and from across the silent water there came the recurrent eerie whistlea soft seabird sound of the diving girls the nearest boat rocked in the slow swell perhaps a hundred yards away and bond watched the young man at the rope and caught an occasional glimpse of a beautiful golden body shiny as a seal and heard the excited chattering of their voices he hoped he would not disgrace himself when it came to his turn to dive sake and cigarettes not a good mixture to train on the pile of awabi was slowly growing in the tub and amongst them perhaps a dozen leaping fish occasionally bond bent down and retrieved one from david once he dropped a slippery fish and the bird had to dive for it again this time he received an even haughtier look of scorn from the turquoise eyes then kissy came up her stint done and climbed not so decorously this time into the boat and tore off her kerchief and goggles and sat panting quietly in the stern finally she looked up and laughed happily that is twentyone very good now take my weights and pick and see for yourself what it is like down there but i will pull you up anyway in thirty seconds give me your watch and please do not lose my tegane my pick or our days fishing will be over bonds first dive was a clumsy affair he went down too slowly and barely had time to survey the grassy plain scattered with black rocks and clumps of posidonia the common seaweed of all the oceans when he felt himself being hauled up he had to admit to himself that his lungs were in terrible shape but he had spied one promising rock thick with weed and on his next dive he got straight to it and clung searching among the roots with his right hand he felt the smooth oval of a shell but before he could get the pick to it he was being pulled up again but he got the shell on his third try and kissy laughed with pleasure as he dropped it into the tub he managed to keep the diving up for about half an hour but then his lungs began to ache and his body to feel the cold of the october sea and he came up for the last time simultaneously with david who shot past him like a beautiful gleaming black fish with green highlights and as a mark of approval pecked gently at his hair as bond deposited his fifth shell in the tub kissy was pleased with him she had a rough brown kimono in the boat and she rubbed him down with it as he sat with bowed head and heaving chest then while he rested she hauled the wooden tub inboard and emptied its contents into the bottom of the boat she produced a knife and cut one of the fish down the middle and fed the two halves to david who was riding expectantly beside the boat he swallowed the pieces in two great gulps and set to preening his feathers contentedly later they stopped for a lunch of rice with a few small bits of fish in it and dried seaweed which tasted of salty spinach and then after a short rest in the bottom of the boat the work went on until four oclock when a small chill breeze came from nowhere and got between them and the warmth of the sun and it was time to make the long row home kissy climbed for the last time into the boat and gave several soft tugs at davids line he surfaced some distance from the boat and as if this was a wellworn routine rose into the air and circled round them again and again before making a low dive and skiing in to the side of the boat on his webbed feet he flapped his way over the side and went to his perch where he stood with wings magnificently outstretched to dry and waited in this lordly stance for his boatman to take him back home to his cove kissy changed with extreme propriety into her brown kimono and dried herself inside it she announced that their haul was sixtyfive awabi which was quite wonderful of these bond was responsible for ten which was a very honourable first catch ridiculously pleased with himself bond took a vague bearing on the island which because of the drifting of the boat was now only a speck on the horizon and gradually worked himself into the slow unlaboured sweep of a scottish gillie his hands were sore his back ached as if he had been thrashed with a wooden truncheon and his shoulders were beginning to sting with sunburn but he comforted himself with the reflection that he was only doing what he would have had to do anyway get into training for the swim and the climb and what would come afterwards and he rewarded himself from time to time with a smile into kissys eyes they never left him and the low sun shone into them and turned the soft brown to gold and the speck became a lump and the lump an island and at last they were home the six guardians the next day was as golden as the first and the haul of awabi went up to sixtyeight largely thanks to bonds improved diving the evening before kissy had come back from selling her shells at the market and had found bond writhing on the floor of his room with cramps in his stomach muscles and her mother clucking helplessly over him she had shooed her mother away spread the soft futon on the floor beside him and had pulled off his bathing pants and rolled him on to the futon face downwards then she had stood upright on his back and had walked softly up and down his spine from his buttocks to his neck and the ache had slowly gone she told him to lie still and brought him warm milk then she led him into the tiny bathhouse and poured hot and then tepid water over him from an awabi tub until all the salt was out of his skin and hair she dried him softly rubbed warm milk into his sunburn and his chafed hands and led him back to his room telling him with gentle sternness to go to sleep and to call her if he awoke in the night and needed anything she blew out his candle and left him and he went out to the nightsong of the cricket in its cage like a light in the morning nothing remained of his aches except the soreness of the hands and kissy gave him the rare treat of an egg beaten up in his rice and bean curd and he apologized for his bad manners of the night before she said todorokisan you have the spirit of ten samurai but you have the body of only one i should have known that i had asked too much of that single body it was the pleasure of the day it made me forget everything else so it is i who apologize and today we will not go so far instead we will keep close to the cliffs of the island and see what we can find i will do the rowing for it is a small distance but you will be able to do more diving because the place that i know of which i havent visited for many weeks is inshore and the water is at the most twenty feet deep and so it had been and bond had worn a shirt to protect him from the sun and his tally of shells had gone up to twentyone and the solitary shadow of the day had been the clear view he had had of the black fortress across the straits and the chunky yellowandblack warning balloon that flew the column of black ideograms above it during one of their rests bond casually asked kissy what she knew of the castle and he was surprised by the way her face darkened todorokisan we do not usually talk about that place it is almost a forbidden subject on kuro it is as if hell had suddenly opened its mouth half a mile away across the sea from our home and my people the ama are like what i have read about your gipsies we are very superstitious and we believe the devil himself has come to live over there she didnt look at the fortress but gestured with her head even the kanushisan does not deny our fears and our elders say that the gatjins have always been bad for japan and that this one is the incarnation of all the evil in the west and there is already a legend that has grown up on the island it is that our six jizo guardians will send a man from across the sea to slay this king of death as we call him who are these guardians jizo is the god who protects children he is i think a buddhist god on the other side of the island on the foreshore there are five statues the sixth has been mostly washed away they are rather frightening to see they squat there in a line they have rough bodies of stone and round stones for heads and they wear white shirts that are changed by the people every month they were put there centuries ago by our ancestors they sit on the line of low tide and as the tide comes up it covers them completely and they keep watch under the surface of the sea and protect us the ama because we are known as the children of the sea at the beginning of every june when the sea is warm after the winter and the diving begins every person on the island forms into a procession and we go to the six guardians and sing to them to make them happy and favourable towards us and this story of the man from kuro where did it come from who knows it could have come from the sea or the air and thus into the minds of the people where do stories like that come from it is widely believed ah so desu ka said bond and they both laughed and got on with the work on the third day when bond was as usual eating his breakfast on the doorstep kissy came to the doorway and said softly come inside todorokisan mystified he went in and she shut the door behind him she said in a low voice i have just heard from a messenger from the kannushisan that there were people here yesterday in a boat from the mainland they brought presentos cigarettes and sweets they were asking about the visit of the police boat they said it came with three visitors and left with only two they wanted to know what had happened to the third visitor they said they were guards from the castle and it was their duty to prevent trespassers the elders accepted the presentos but they showed shirankao which is the face of him who knows nothing and referred the men to the kannushisan who said that the third visitor was in charge of fishing licences he had felt sick on the way to the island and had perhaps lain down in the boat on the way back then he dismissed the men and sent a boy to the top of the high place to see where the boat went and the boy reported that it went to the bay beside the castle and was put back into the boathouse that is there the kannusbisan thought that you should know these things she looked at him piteously todorokisan i have a feeling of much friendship for you i feel that there are secret things between you and the kannushisan and that they concern the castle i think you should tell me enough to put me out of my unhappiness bond smiled he went up to her and took her face in both his hands and kissed her on the lips he said you are very beautiful and kind kissy today we will not take the boat out because i must have some rest lead me up to the high place from which i can take a good look at this castle and i will tell you what i can i was going to anyway for i shall need your help afterwards i would like to visit the six guardians they interest me as an anthropologist kissy collected their usual lunch in a small basket put on her brown kimono and ropesoled shoes and they set off along a small footpath that zigzagged up the peak behind the crouching grey cluster of the village the time of the camellia was almost past but here there were occasional bushes of wild camellias in red and white and there was a profusion of these round a small grove of dwarf maples some of which already wore their flaming autumn colours the grove was directly above kissys house she led him in and showed him the little shinto shrine behind a rough stone torь she said behind the shrine there is a fine cave but the people of kuro are afraid of it as it is full of ghosts but i explored it once and if there are ghosts there they are friendly ones she clapped her hands before the shrine bent her head for a moment and clapped them again then they went on up the path to the top of the thousandfoot peak a brace of gorgeous copper pheasants with golden tails fled squawking over the brow and down to a patch of bushes on the southern cliff as they approached bond told kissy to stay out of sight while he went and stood behind the tall cairn of stones on the summit and gazed circumspectly round it and across the straits he could see over the high fortress wall and across the park to the towering blackandgold donjon of the castle it was ten oclock there were figures in blue peasant dress with high boots and long staves moving busily about the grounds they occasionally seemed to prod into the bushes with their staves they wore black maskos over their mouths it crossed bonds mind that they might be doing the morning rounds looking for overnight prey what did they do when they found some halfblinded creature or a pile of clothes beside one of the fumaroles whose little clouds of steam rose here and there in the park take them to the doctor and in the case of the living what happened then and when he bond got up that wall tonight where was he going to hide from the guards well sufficient unto the day at least the straits were calm and it was cloudless weather it looked as if he would get there all right bond turned away and went back to kissy and sat with her on the sparse turf he gazed across the harbour to where the ama fleet lay sprawled across the middle distance he said kissy tonight i have to swim to the castle and climb the wall and get inside she nodded i know this and then you are going to kill this man and perhaps his wife you are the man who we believe was to come to kuro from across the sea and do these things she continued to gaze out to sea she said dully but why have you been chosen why should it not be another a japanese these people are gaijins i am a gaijin it will cause less trouble for the state if the whole matter is presented as being trouble between foreigners yes i see and has the kannushisan given his approval yes and if and after will you come back and be my boatman again for a time but then i must go back to england no i believe that you will stay for a long time on kuro why do you believe that because i prayed for it at the shrine and i have never asked for such a big thing before i am sure it will be granted she paused and i shall be swimming with you tonight she held up a hand you will need company in the dark and i know the currents you would not get there without me bond took the small dry paw in his he looked at the childish broken nails his voice was harsh he said no this is mans work she looked at him the brown eyes were calm and serious she said and she used his first name tarosan your other name may mean thunder but i am not frightened of thunder i have made up my mind and i shall come back every night at midnight exactly and wait among the rocks at the bottom of the wall i shall wait for one hour in case you need my help in coming home these people may harm you women are much stronger in the water than men that is why it is the ama girls who dive and not the ama men i know the waters round kuro as a peasant knows the fields round his farm and i have as little fear of them do not be stiffnecked in this matter in any case i shall hardly sleep until you come back to feel that i am close to you for a time and that you may need me will give me some peace say yes tarosan oh all right kissy said bond gruffly i was only going to ask you to row me to a starting point down there somewhere he gestured to the left across the straits but if you insist on being an extra target for the sharks the sharks never trouble us the six guardians look after that we never come to any harm years ago one of the amas caught her rope in a rock underwater and the people have talked of the accident ever since the sharks just think we are big fish like themselves she laughed happily now it is all settled and we can have something to eat and then i will take you down to see the guardians the tide will be low by then and they will want to inspect you they followed another little path from the summit it went over the shoulder of the peak and down to a small protected bay to the east of the village the tide was far out and they could wade over the flat black pebbles and rocks and round the corner of the promontory here on a stretch of flat stony beach five people squatted on a square foundation of large rocks and gazed out towards the horizon except that they werent people they were as kissy had described stone pedestal bodies with large round boulders cemented to their tops but rough white shirts were roped round them and they looked terrifyingly human as they sat in immobile judgement and guardianship over the waters and what went on beneath them of the sixth only the body remained his head must have been destroyed by a storm they walked round in front of the five and looked up at the smooth blank faces and bond for the first time in his life had a sensation of deep awe so much belief so much authority seemed to have been invested by the builders in these primitive faceless idols guardians of the blithe naked ama girls that bond had a ridiculous urge to kneel and ask for their blessing as the crusaders had once done before their god he brushed the impulse aside but he did bow his head and briefly ask for good fortune to accompany his enterprise and then he stood back and watched with a pull at his heartstrings while kissy her beautiful face strained and pleading clapped to attract their attention and then made a long and impassioned speech in which his name recurred at the end when she again clapped her hands did the round boulderheads briefly nod of course not but when bond took kissys hand and they walked away she said happily it is all right todorokisan you saw them nod their heads no said bond firmly i did not they crept round the eastern shore of kuro and pulled the boat up into a deep cleft in the black rocks it was just after eleven oclock and the giant moon rode high and fast through wisps of mackerel cloud they talked softly although they were out of sight of the fortress and half a mile away from it kissy took off her brown kimono and folded it neatly and put it in the boat her body glowed in the moonlight the black triangle between her legs beckoned and the black string round her waist that held the piece of material was an invitation to untie it she giggled provocatively stop looking at my black cat why is it called that guess bond carefully pulled on his ninja suit of black cotton it was comfortable enough and would give warmth in the water he left the headshroud hanging down his back and pushed the goggles that belonged to kissys father up his forehead the small floating pack he was to tow behind him rode jauntily in the waters of the creek and he tied its string firmly to his right wrist so that he would always know it was there he smiled at kissy and nodded she came up to him and threw her arms round his neck and kissed him full on the lips before he could respond she had pulled down her goggles and had dived into the quiet mercury sea the lovesome spot kissys crawl was steady and relaxed and bond had no difficulty in following the twinkling feet and the twin white mounds of her behind divided excitingly by the black cord but he was glad he had donned flippers because the tug of his floating container against the wrist was an irritating brake and for the first half of the swim they were heading diagonally against the easterly current through the straits but then kissy slightly changed her direction and now they could paddle lazily in towards the soaring wall that soon became their whole horizon there were a few tumbled rocks at its base but kissy stayed in the water clinging to a clump of seaweed in case the moon might betray her gleaming body to a sentry or a chance patrol though bond guessed that the guards kept clear of the grounds during the night so that the suicides would have free entry bond pulled himself up on the rocks and unzipped the container and extracted the packet of iron pitons then he climbed up a few feet so that he could stow his flippers away in a crack between the granite blocks above high water mark and he was ready to go he blew a kiss to the girl she replied with the sideways wave of the hand that is the japanese sign of farewell and then was off across the sea again a luminous white torpedo that merged quickly into the path of the moon bond put her out ofhis thoughts he was getting chilled in his soaking black camouflage and it was time to get moving he examined the fitting of the giant stone blocks and found that the cracks between them were spacious as in the case of tigers training castle and would probably provide adequate toeholds then he pulled down his black cowl and towing the black container behind him began his climb it took him twenty minutes to cover the two hundred feet of the slightly inclined wall but he only had to use his pitons twice when he came to cracks that were too narrow to give a hold to his aching toes and then he was at one of the gunports and he slithered quietly across its six feet of flat masonry and cautiously looked over the edge into the park as he had expected there were stone steps down from the gunport and he crept down these into the dark shadows at its base and stood up against the inside of the wall panting quietly he waited for his breath to calm down and then slipped back his cowl and listened not a wisp of wind stirred in the trees but from somewhere came the sound of softly running water and in the background a regular glutinous burping and bubbling the fumaroles bond a black shadow among the rest edged along the wall to his right his first task was to find a hideout a base camp where he could bivouac in emergency and where he could leave his container he reconnoitred various groves and clumps of bushes but they were all damnably wellkept and the undergrowth had been meticulously cleared from their roots and many of them exuded a sicklysweet poisonous nightsmell then up against the wall he came upon a leanto shed its rickety door ajar he listened and then inched the door open as he had expected there was a shadowy jumble of gardeners tools wheelbarrows and the like and the musty smell of such places moving carefully and helped by shafts of moonlight through the wide cracks in the planked walls he got to the back of the hut where there was an untidy mound of used sacking he reflected for a moment and decided that though this place would be often visited it had great promise he untied the cord of the container from his wrist and proceeded methodically to move some of the sacks forward so as to provide a nest for himself behind them when it was finished and final touches of artistic disarray added he parked his container behind the barrier and crept out again into the park to continue what he planned should be a first quick survey of the whole property bond kept close to the boundary wall flitting like a bat across the open spaces between clumps of bushes and trees although his hands were covered with the black material of the ninja suit he avoided contact with the vegetation which emitted a continually changing variety of strong odours and scents amongst which he recognized as a result of ancient adventures in the caribbean only the sugary perfume of dogwood he came to the lake a wide silent shimmer of silver from which rose the thin cloud of steam he remembered from the aerial photograph as he stood and watched it a large leaf from one of the surrounding trees came wafting down and settled on the surface near him at once a quick purposeful ripple swept down on the leaf from the surrounding water and immediately subsided there were some kind of fish in the lake and they would be carnivores only carnivores would be excited like that at the hint of a prey beyond the lake bond came on the first of the fumaroles a sulphurous bubbling pool of mud that constantly shuddered and spouted up little fountains from yards away bond could feel its heat jets of stinking steam puffed out and disappeared wraithlike towards the sky and now the jagged silhouette of the castle with its winged turrets showed above the treeline and bond crept forward with the added caution alert for the moment when he would come upon the treacherous gravel that surrounded it suddenly through a belt of trees he was facing it he stopped in the shelter of the trees his heart hammering under his ribcage close to the soaring blackandgold pile reared monstrously over him and the diminishing curved roofs of the storeys were like vast batwings against the stars it was even bigger than bond had imagined and the supporting wall of black granite blocks more formidable he reflected on the seemingly impossible problem of entry behind would be the main entrance the lowish wall and the open countryside but didnt castles always have an alternative entrance low down for a rearward escape bond stole cautiously forward laying his feet flat down so that the gravel barely stirred the many eyes of the castle glittering white in the moonlight watched his approach with the indifference of total power at any moment he had expected the white shaft of a searchlight or the yellowandblue flutter of gunfire but he reached the base of the wall without incident and followed it along to the left remembering from ancient schooling that most castles had an exit at moat level beneath the drawbridge and so it was with the castle of doctor shatterhand a small nailstudded door arched and weatherbeaten its hinges and lock were cracked and rusty but a new padlock and chain had been stapled into the woodwork and the stone frame no moonlight filtered down to this corner of what must once have been a moat but was now grassed over bond felt carefully with his fingers yes the chain and lock would yield to the file and jemmy in his conjurers pockets would there be bolts on the inner side probably not or the padlock would not have been thought necessary bond softly retraced his steps across the gravel stepping meticulously in his previous footmarks that door would be his target for tomorrow now keeping righthanded but still following the boundary wall he crept off again on his survey once something slithered away from his approaching feet and disappeared with a heavy rustle into the fallen leaves under a tree what snakes were there that really went for a man the kingcobra black mamba the sawscaled viper the rattlesnake and the fer de lance what others the remainder were inclined to make off if disturbed were snakes day or night hunters bond didnt know among so many hazards there werent even the odds of russian roulette when all the chambers of the pistol were loaded there was not even a one in six chance to bank on bond was now on the castle side of the lake he heard a noise and edged behind a tree the distant crashing in the shrubbery sounded like a wounded animal but then down the path came staggering a man or what had once been a man the brilliant moonlight showed a head swollen to the size of a football and only small slits remained where the eyes and mouth had been the man moaned softly as he zigzagged along and bond could see that his hands were up to his puffed face and that he was trying to prise apart the swollen skin round his eyes so that he could see out every now and then he stopped and let out one word in an agonizing howl to the moon it was not a howl of fear or of pain but of dreadful supplication suddenly he stopped he seemed to see the lake for the first time with a terrible cry and holding out his arms as if to meet a loved one he made a quick run to the edge and threw himself in at once there came the swirl of movement bond had noticed before but this time it involved a great area of water and there was a wild boiling of the surface round the vaguely threshing body a mass of small fish were struggling to get at the man particularly at the naked hands and face and their sixinch bodies glittered and flashed in the moonlight once the man raised his head and let out a single terrible scream and bond saw that his face was encrusted with pendent fish as if with silvery locks of hair then his head fell back into the lake and he rolled over and over as if trying to rid himself of his attackers but slowly the black stain spread and spread around him and finally perhaps because his jugular had been pierced he lay still face downwards in the water and his head jigged slightly with the ceaseless momentum of the attack james bond wiped the cold sweat off his face piranha the south american freshwater killer whose massive jaws and flat razorsharp teeth can strip a horse down to the bones in under an hour and this man had been one of the suicides who had heard of this terrible death he had come searching for the lake and had got his face poisoned by some pretty shrub the herr doktor had certainly provided a feast for his victims unending dishes for their delectation a true banquet of death james bond shuddered and went on his way all right blofeld he thought thats one more notch on the sword that is already on its way to your neck brave words bond hugged the wall and kept going gunmetal was showing in the east but the garden of death hadnt quite finished the display of its wares all over the park a slight smell of sulphur hung in the air and many times bond had had to detour round steaming cracks in the ground and the quaking mud of fumaroles identified by a warning circle of whitepainted stones the doctor was most careful lest anyone should fall into one of these liquid furnaces by mistake but now bond came to one the size of a circular tenniscourt and here there was a rough shrine in the grotto at the back of it and dainty touch a vase with flowers in it chrysanthemums because it was now officially winter and therefore the chrysanthemum season they were arranged with some sprigs of dwarf maple in a pattern which no doubt spelled out some fragrant message to the initiates of japanese flower arrangement and opposite the grotto behind which bond in his ghostly black uniform crouched in concealment a japanese gentleman stood in rapt contemplation of the bursting mudboils that were erupting genteelly in the simmering soup of the pool james bond thought gentleman because the man was dressed in the top hat frockcoat striped trousers stiff collar and spats of a high government official or of the father of the bride and the gentleman held a carefully rolled umbrella between his clasped hands and his head was bowed over its crook as if in penance he was speaking in a soft compulsive babble like someone in a highly ritualistic church but he made no gestures and just stood humbly quietly either confessing or asking one of the gods for something bond stood against a tree black in the blackness he felt he should intervene in what he knew to be the mans purpose but how to do so knowing no japanese having nothing but his deaf and dumb card to show and it was vital that he should remain a ghost in the garden not get involved in some daft argument with a man he didnt know about some ancient sin he could never understand so bond stood while the trees threw long black arms across the scene and waited with a cold closed stone face for death to walk on stage the man stopped talking he raised his head and gazed up at the moon he politely lifted his shining top hat then he replaced it tucked his umbrella under one arm and sharply clapped his hands then walking as if to a business appointment calmly purposefully he took the few steps to the edge of the bubbling fumarole stepped carefully over the warning stones and went on walking he sank slowly in the glutinous grey slime and not a sound escaped his lips until as the tremendous heat reached his groin he uttered one rasping arrghh and the gold in his teeth showed as his head arched back in the rictus of death then he was gone and only the top hat remained tossing on a small fountain of mud that spat intermittently into the air then the hat slowly crumpled with the heat and disappeared and a great belch was uttered from the belly of the fumarole and a horrible stench of cooking meat overcame the pervading stink of sulphur and reached bonds nostrils bond controlled his rising gorge honourable salaryman had gone to honourable ancestors his unknown sin expiated as his calcined bones sank slowly down into the stomach of the world and one more statistic would be run up on blofelds abacus of death why didnt the japanese air force come and bomb this place to eternity set the castle and the poison garden ablaze with napalm how could this man continue to have protection from a bunch of botanists and scientists and now here was he bond alone in this hell to try and do the job with almost no weapon but his bare hands it was hopeless i he was scarcely being given a chance in a million tiger and his prime minister were certainly exacting their pound of flesh in exchange for their precious magic one hundred and eightytwo pounds of it to be exact cursing his fate cursing tiger cursing the whole of japan bond went on his way while a small voice whispered in his ear but dont you want to kill blofeld dont you want to avenge tracy isnt this a godgiven chance you have done well tonight you have penetrated his defences and spied out the land you have even found a way into his castle and probably up to his bedroom kill him in his sleep tomorrow i and kill her too while youre about it and then back into kissys arms and in a week or two back over the pole to london and to the applause of your chief come on somewhere in japan a japanese is committing suicide every thirty minutes all through the year dont be squeamish because youve just seen a couple of numbers ticked off on a sheet in the ministry of health a couple of points added to a graph snap out of it get on with the job and bond listened to the whisper and went on round the last mile of wall and back to the gardeners hut he took a last look round before going in he could see a neck of the lake about twenty yards away it was now gunmetal in the approaching dawn some big insects were flitting and darting through the softly rising steam they were pink dragonflies pink ones dancing and skimming but of course the haiku of tigers dying agent that was the last nightmarish touch to this obscenity of a place bond went into the hut picked his way carefully between the machines and wheelbarrows pulled some sacks over himself and fell into a shallow sleep full of ghosts and demons and screams something evil comes this way the dreamed screams had merged into real ones when four hours later bond awoke there was silence in the hut bond got cautiously to his knees and put his eye to a wide crack in the rickety planking a screaming man from his ragged blue cotton uniform a japanese peasant was running across his line of vision along the edge of the lake four guards were after him laughing and calling as if it were a game of hideandseek they were carrying long staves and now one of them paused and hurled his stave accurately after the man so that it caught in his legs and brought him crashing to the ground he scrambled to his knees and held supplicating hands out towards his pursuers still laughing they gathered round him stocky men in high rubber boots their faces made terrifying by black maskos over their mouths black leather nosepieces and the same ugly black leather soupplate hats as the agent on the train had worn they poked at the man with the ends of their staves at the same time shouting harshly at him in voices that jeered then as if at an order they bent down and each man seizing a leg or an arm picked him off the ground swung him once or twice and tossed him out into the lake the ghastly ripple surged forward and the man now screaming again beat at his face with his hands and floundered as if trying to make for the shore but the screams rapidly became weaker and finally ceased as the head went down and the red stain spread wider and wider doubled up with laughter the guards on the bank watched the show now satisfied that the fun was over they turned away and walked towards the hut and bond could see the tears of their pleasure glistening on their cheeks he got back under cover and heard their boisterous voices and laughter only yards away as they came into the hut and pulled out their rakes and barrows and dispersed to their jobs and for some time bond could hear them calling to each other across the park then from the direction of the castle came the deep tolling of a bell and the men fell silent bond glanced at the cheap japanese wristwatch tiger had provided it was nine oclock was this the beginning of the official working day probably the japanese usually get to their work half an hour early and leave half an hour late in order to gain face with their employer and show keenness and gratitude for their jobs later bond guessed there would be an hours luncheon break work would probably cease at six so it would only be from six thirty on that he would have the grounds to himself meanwhile he must listen and watch and find out more about the guards routines of which he had presumably witnessed the first the smelling out and final dispatch of suicides who had changed their minds or turned fainthearted during the night bond softly unzipped his container and took a bite at one of his three slabs of pemmican and a short draught from his waterbottle god for a cigarette an hour later bond heard a brief shuffling of feet on the gravel path on the other side of the lake he looked through the slit the four guards had lined up and were standing rigidly to attention bonds heart beat a little faster this would be for some form of inspection might blofeld be doing his rounds getting his reports of the nights bag bond strained his eyes to the right towards the castle but his view was obstructed by an expanse of white oleanders that innocent shrub with its attractive clusters of blossom that is used as a deadly fish poison in many parts of the tropics dear pretty bush bond thought i must remember to keep clear of you tonight and then following the path on the other side of the lake two strolling figures came into his line of vision and bond clenched his fists with the thrill of seeing his prey blofeld in his gleaming chain armour and grotesquely spiked and winged helmet of steel its visor closed was something out of wagner or because of the oriental style of his armour a japanese kabuki play his armoured right hand rested easily on a long naked samurai sword while his left was hooked into the arm of his companion a stumpy woman with the body and stride of a wardress her face was totally obscured by a hideous beekeepers hat of darkgreen straw with a heavy pendent black veil reaching down over her shoulders but there could be no doubt bond had seen that dumpy silhouette now clothed in a plastic rainproof above tall rubber boots too often in his dreams that was her that was irma bunt bond held his breath if they came round the lake to his side one tremendous shove and the armoured man would be floundering in the water but could the piranhas get at him through chinks in the armour unlikely and how would he bond get away no that wouldnt be the answer the two figures had almost reached the line of four men and at this moment the guards dropped to their knees in unison and bowed their foreheads down to the ground then they quickly jumped up and stood again at attention blofeld raised his visor and addressed one of the men who answered with deference bond noticed for the first time that this particular guard wore a belt round his waist with a bolstered automatic bond couldnt hear the language they were speaking it was impossible that blofeld had learned japanese english or german probably the latter as a result of some wartime liaison job the man laughed and pointed towards the lake where a collapsed balloon of blue clothing was jigging softly with the activities of the horde of feasting piranhas within it blofeld nodded his approval and the men again went down on their knees blofeld raised a hand in brief acknowledgement lowered his visor and the couple moved regally on bond watched carefully to see if the file of guards when they got to their feet registered any private expressions of scorn or hilarity once the masters back was turned but there was no hint of disrespect the men broke ranks and hurried off about their tasks with disciplined seriousness and bond was reminded of dikko hendersons illustration of the automatic antlike subservience to discipline and authority of the japanese that had resulted in one of the great crimes of the century if only dear dikko were here now what a tremendous boost his fists and his surging zest would add to this lunatic operation the crime had concerned said dikko a modest suburban branch of the imperial bank it had been a normal day of business when a man wearing an officiallooking armband had presented himself to the manager of the bank he was from the ministry of health an outbreak of typhus was feared and he would be obliged if the manager would line up his staff in the courtyard so that he could administer the official antidote the manager bowed and complied and after everything had been locked up the fourteen staff assembled and listened carefully to the short lecture on health delivered by the man with the armband then everyone had bowed in acknowledgement of the wisdom of the ministry of health and the official had bent to his small suitcase and produced fifteen glasses into which he measured medicine from a bottle he handed a glass to each person and advised them to swallow the mixture at one gulp as otherwise it might damage their teeth now he had said according to dikkos version all together one two three and down went the honourable medicine and down fell the honourable local manager and staff of the imperial bank of japan the medicine had been neat cyanide the ministry of health official had removed the keys from the trouserpocket of the prone manager had loaded up his car with two hundred and fifty million yen and had driven cheerfully from the scene of what was to become known as the teigin case after the suburb in which it took place and here bond reflected was the same total obedience to authority but in this case the tacit approval and sympathy of the black dragon philosophy was operating blofeld told them to do such things as he had witnessed a couple of hours before he was invested with power from certain depart ments of state he had dressed for the part his orders were obeyed and there was honourable job to be done honourable job which resulted in much publicity in the newspapers and this was a powerful gaijln who had powerful squeeze in high places and a wide face and if people wanted to kill themselves why worry if the castle of death with perhaps an occasional extra push was not available they would choose the railways or the trams here was a public service almost a subdepartment of the ministry of health so long as their maskos and nosepieces protected them from the poisons in the garden the main thing was to do their jobs conscientiously and perhaps one day they would get a minister of selfdestruction appointed in the diet then the great days of the black dragon koan would come again to save the country of the rising sun from the creeping paralysis of demokorasu and now the two strolling figures were coming back into bonds line of vision but this time from the left they had rounded the end of the lake and were on their way back perhaps to visit other groups of guards and get their reports tiger had said there were at least twenty guards and that the property covered five hundred acres five working parties of four guards each blofelds visor was up and he was talking to the woman they were now only twenty yards away they stopped at the edge of the lake and contemplated with relaxed curiosity the still turbulent mass of fish round the floating doll of blue cloth they were talking german bond strained his ears blofeld said the piranhas and the volcanic mud are useful housekeepers they keep the place tidy the sea and the sharks are also useful but often the sharks do not complete the job that spy we put through the question room he was almost intact when his body was found down the coast the lake would have been a better place for him we dont want that policeman from fukuoka coming here too often he may have means of learning from the peasants how many people are crossing the wall that will be many more nearly double the number the ambulance comes for if our figures go on increasing at this rate there is going to be trouble i see from the cuttings kono translates for me that there are already mutterings in the papers about a public inquiry and what shall we do then lieber ernst we shall obtain massive compensation and move on the same pattern can be repeated in other countries everywhere there are people who want to kill themselves we may have to vary the attractions of the opportunities we offer them other people have not the profound love of horror and violence of the japanese a really beautiful waterfall a handy bridge a vertiginous drop these might be alternatives brazil or somewhere else in south america might provide such a site but the figures would be much smaller it is the concept that matters liebe irma it is very difficult to invent something that is entirely new in the history of the world i have done that if my bridge my waterfall yields a crop of only perhaps ten people a year it is simply a matter of statistics the basic idea will be kept alive that is so you are indeed a genius lieber ernst you have already established this place as a shrine to death for evermore people read about such fantasies in the works of poe lautreamont de sade but no one has ever created such a fantasy in real life it is as if one of the great fairy tales has come to life a sort of disneyland of death but of course she hastened to add on an altogether grander more poetic scale in due course i shall write the whole story down then perhaps the world will acknowledge the type of man who has been living among them a man not only unhonoured and unsung but a manblofelds voice rose almost to a scream whom they hunt down and wish to shoot like a mad dog a man who has to use all his wiles just to stay alive why if i had not covered my tracks so well there would be spies on their way even now to kill us both or to hand us over for official murder under their stupid laws ah well liebe irma the voice was more rational quieter we live in aworld of fools in which true greatness is a sin come it is time to review the other detachments they turned away and were about to continue along the lake when blofeld suddenly stopped and pointed like a dog directly at bond that hut among the bushes the door is open i have told the men a thousand times to keep such places locked it is a perfect refuge for a spy or a fugitive i will make sure bond shivered he huddled down dragging sacks from the top of his barrier to give extra protection the clanking steps approached entered the hut bond could feel the man only yards away could feel his questing eyes and nostrils there came a clang of metal and the wall of sacks shook at great thrusts from blofelds sword then the sword slashed down again and again and bond winced and bit his lip as a hammerblow crashed across the centre of his back but then blofeld seemed to be satisfied and the iron steps clanged away bond let out his breath in a quiet hiss he heard blofelds voice say there is nothing but remind me to reprimand kono on our rounds tomorrow the place must be cleared out and a proper lock fitted then the sound of the steps vanished in the direction of the oleander clump and bond gave a groan and felt his back but though many of the sacks above him had been sliced through his protection had been just deep enough and the skin across his spine wasnt broken bond got to his knees and rearranged the hideout massaging his aching back as he did so then he spat the dust from the sacking out of his mouth took a swallow from the waterbottle assured himself through his slit that there was no movement outside and lay down and let his mind wander back over every word that blofeld had uttered of course the man was mad a year earlier the usual quiet tones that bond remembered so well would never have cracked into that lunatic hitler scream and the coolness the supreme confidence that had always lain behind his planning much of that seemed to have seeped away perhaps bond hoped partly because of the two great failures he bond had done much to bring about in two of blofelds most grandiose conspiracies but one thing was clear the hideout was blown tonight would have to be the night ah well once again bond ran over the hazy outline of his plan if he could gain access to the castle he felt pretty confident of finding a means to kill blofeld but he was also fairly certain that he himself would die in the process dulce et decorum est and all that jazz but then he thought of kissy and he wasnt so sure about not fearing for himself she had brought a sweetness back into his life that he thought had gone for ever bond dropped off into an uneasy watchful sleep that was once again peopled by things and creatures out of nightmareland oubliette at six oclockinthe evening the deep bell tolled briefly from the castle and dusk came like the slow drawing of a violet blind over the day crickets began to zing in a loud chorus and geckos chuckled in the shrubbery the pink dragonflies disappeared and large horned toads appeared in quantities from their mud holes on the edge of the lake and so far as bond could see through his spyhole seemed to be catching gnats attracted by the shining pools of their eyes then the four guards reappeared and there came the fragrant smell of a bonfire they had presumably lit to consume the refuse they had collected during the day they went to the edge of the lake and raked in the tattered scraps of blue clothing and amidst delighted laughter emptied long bones out of the fragments into the water one of them ran off with the rags presumably to add them to the bonfire and bond got under cover as the others pushed their wheelbarrows up the slope and stowed them away in the hut they stood chattering happily in the dusk until the fourth arrived and then without noticing the slashed and disarrayed sacks in the shadows they filed off in the direction of the castle after an interval bond got up and stretched and shook the dust out of his hair and clothes his back still ached but his overwhelming sensation was the desperate urge for a cigarette all right it might be his last he sat down and drank a little water and munched a large wedge of the highlyflavoured pemmican then took another swig at the waterbottle he took out his single packet of shinsei and lit up holding the cigarette between cupped hands and quickly blowing out the match he dragged the smoke deep down into his lungs it was bliss another drag and the prospect of the night seemed less daunting it was surely going to be all right he thought briefly of kissy who would now be eating her bean curd and fish and preparing the nights swim in her mind a few hours more and she would be near him but what would have happened in those few hours bond smoked the cigarette until it burned his fingers then crushed out the stub and pushed the dead fragments down through a crack in the floor it was seven thirty and already some of the insect noises of sundown had ceased bond went meticulously about his preparations at nine oclock he left the hideout again the moon blazed down and there was total silence except for the distant burping and bubbling of the fumaroles and the occasional sinister chuckle of a gecko from the shrubbery he took the same route as the night before came through the same belt of trees and stood looking up at the great batwinged donjon that towered up to the sky he noticed for the first time that the warning balloon with its advertisement of danger was tethered to a pole on the corner of the balustrade surrounding what appeared to be the main floor the third or centre one of the five here from several windows yellow light shone faintly and bond guessed that this would be his target area he let out a deep sigh and strode quietly off across the gravel and came without incident to the tiny entrance under the wooden bridge the black ninja suit was as full of concealed pockets as a conjurers tail coat bond took out a pencil flashlight and a small steel file and set to work on a link of the chain occasionally he paused to spit into the deepening groove to lessen the rasp of metal on metal but then there came the final crack of parting steel and using the file as a lever he bent the link open and quietly removed the padlock and chain from its stanchions he pressed lightly and the door gave inwards he took out his flashlight and pushed farther probing the darkness ahead with his thin beam it was as well he did so on the stone floor where his first step past the open door would have taken him lay a yawning mantrap its rusty iron jaws perhaps a yard across waiting for him to step on the thin covering of straw that partially concealed it bond winced as in his imagination he heard the iron clang as the sawteeth bit into his leg below the knee there would be other such boobytraps he must keep every sense on the alert bond closed the door softly behind him stepped round the trap and swept the beam of his torch ahead and around him nothing but velvety blackness he was in some vast underground cellar where no doubt the food supplies for a small army had once been stored a shadow swept across the thin beam of light and another and another and there was a shrill squeaking from all around him bond didnt mind bats or believe the victorian myth that they got caught in your hair their radar was too good he crept slowly forward watching only the rough stone flags ahead of him he passed one or two bulky arched pillars and now the great cellar seemed to narrow because he could just see walls to right and left of him and above him an arched cobwebby roof yes here were the stone steps leading upwards he climbed them softly and counted twenty of them before he came to the entrance a wide double door with no lock on his side he pushed gently and could feel and hear the resistance of a ricketysounding lock he took out a heavy jemmy and probed its sharp jaws notched round some sort of a crossbolt and bond levered hard sideways until there came the tearing sound of old metal and the tinkle of nails or screws on stone he pushed softly on the crack and with a hideously loud report the rest of the lock came away and half the door swung open with a screech of old hinges beyond was more darkness bond stepped through and listened his torch doused but he was still deep in the bowels of the castle and there was no sound he switched on again more stone stairs leading up to a modern door of polished timber he went up them and carefully turned the metal door handle no lock this time he softly pushed the door open and found himself in a long stone corridor that sloped on upwards at the end was yet another modern door and beneath it showed a thin strip of light bond walked noiselessly up the incline and then held his breath and put his ear to the keyhole dead silence he grasped the handle and inched the door open and then satisfied went through and closed the door behind him leaving it on the latch he was in the main hall of the castle the big entrance door was on his left and a wellused strip of red carpet stretched away from it and across the fifty feet of hall into the shadows that were not reached by the single large oil lamp over the entrance the hall was not embellished in any way save for the strip of carpet and its roof was a maze of longitudinal and cross beams interspersed with latticed bamboo over the same rough plasterwork as covered the walls there was still the same castlesmell of cold stone bond kept away from the carpet and hugged the shadows of the walls he guessed that he was now on the main floor and that somewhere straight ahead was his quarry he was well inside the citadel so far so good the next door obviously the entrance to one of the public rooms had a simple latch to it bond bent and put his eye to the keyhole another dimly lit interior no sound he eased up the latch inched the door ajar and then open and went through it was a second vast chamber but this time one of baronial splendour the main reception room bond guessed where blofeld would receive visitors between tall red curtains edged with gold fine setpieces of armour and weapons hung on the white plaster walls and there was much heavy antique furniture arranged in conventional groupings on a vast central carpet in royal blue the rest of the floor was of highly polished boards which reflected back the lights from two great oil lanterns that hung from the high timbered roof similar to that of the entrance hall but here with the main beams decorated in a zigzag motif of dark red bond looking for places of concealment chose the widely spaced curtains and slipping softly from one refuge to the next reached the small door at the end of the chamber that would he guessed lead to the private apartments he bent down to listen but immediately leaped for cover behind the nearest curtains steps were approaching bond undid the thin chain from around his waist wrapped it round his left fist and took the jemmy in his right hand and waited his eyes glued to a chink in the dustysmelling material the small door opened halfway to show the back of one of the guards he wore a black belt with a holster would this be kono the man who translated for blofeld he had probably had some job with the germans during the war in the kempeitai perhaps what was he doing he appeared to be riddling with some piece of apparatus behind the door a light switch no there was no electric light apparently satisfied the man backed out bowed deeply to the interior and closed the door he wore no masko and bond caught a brief glimpse of a surly sliteyed brownish face as he passed bonds place of concealment and walked on across the reception chamber bond heard the click of the far door and then there was silence he waited a good five minutes before gently shifting the curtain so that he could see down the room he was alone and now for the last lap bond kept his weapons in his hands and crept back to the door this time no sound came from behind it but the guard had bowed oh well probably out of respect for the aura of the master bond quietly but firmly thrust the door open and leaped through ready for the attacking sprint a totally empty totally featureless length of passageway yawned at his dramatics it stretched perhaps twenty feet in front of him it was dimly lit by a central oil lamp and its floor was of the usual highly polished boards a nightingale floor no the guards footsteps had uttered no warning creaks but from behind the facing door at the end came the sound of music it was wagner the ride of the valkyries being played at medium pitch thank you blofeld thought bond most helpful cover and he crept softly forward down the centre of the passage when it came there was absolutely no warning one step across the exact halfway point of the flooring and like a seesaw the whole twenty feet of boards swivelled noiselessly on some central axis and bond arms and legs flailing and hands scrabbling desperately for a grip found himself hurtling down into a black void the guard the fiddling about behind the door he had been adjusting the lever that set the trap the traditional oubliette of ancient castles and bond had forgotten as his body plunged off the end of the inclined platform into space an alarm bell triggered by the mechanism of the trap brayed hysterically bond had a fractional impression of the platform relieved of his weight swinging back into position above him then he crashed shatteringly into unconsciousness bond swam reluctantly up through the dark tunnel towards the blinding pinpoint of light why wouldnt someone stop hitting him what had he done to deserve it he had got two awabis he could feel them in his hands sharpedged and rough that was as much as kissy could expect of him kissy he mumbledstop it stop it kissy the pinpoint of light expanded became an expanse of strawcovered floor on which he was crouching while the open hand crashed sideways into his face piff paff with each slap the splitting pain in his head exploded into a thousand separate pain fragments bond saw the edge of the boat above him and desperately raised himself to grasp at it he held up the awabis to show that he had done his duty he opened his hands to drop them into the tub consciousness flooded back and he saw the two handfuls of straw dribble to the ground but the blows had stopped and now he could see indistinctly through a mist of pain that brown face those slit eyes kono the guard and someone else was holding a torch for him then it all came back no awabis no kissy something dreadful had happened everything had gone wrong shimata i have made a mistake tiger the clue clicked and total realization swept through bonds mind careful now youre deaf and dumb youre a japanese miner from fukuoka get the record straight to hell with the pain in your head nothings broken play it cool bond put his hands down to his sides he realized for the first time that he was naked save for the brief vee of the black cotton ninja underpants he bowed deeply and straightened himself kono his hand at his open holster fired furious japanese at him bond licked at the blood that was trickling down his face and looked blank stupid kono took out his small automatic gestured bond bowed again got to his feet and with a brief glance round the strawstrewn oubliette into which he had fallen followed the unseen guard with the torch out of the cell there were stairs and a corridor and a door kono stepped forward and knocked and then bond was standing in the middle of a small pleasant librarytype room and the second guard was laying out on the floor bonds ninja suit and the appallingly incriminating contents of his pockets blofeld dressed in a magnificent black silk kimono across which a golden dragon sprawled stood leaning against the mantelpiece beneath which a japanese brazier smouldered it was him all right the bland high forehead the pursed purple wound of a mouth now shadowed by a heavy greyblack moustache that drooped at the corners on its way perhaps to achieving mandarin proportions the mane of white hair he had grown for the part of monsieur le comte de bleuville the black bulletholes of the eyes and beside him completing the picture of a homely couple at ease after dinner sat irma bunt in the full regalia of a highclass japanese lady the petit point of a single chrysanthemum lying in her lap waiting for those pudgy hands to take it up when the cause of this unseemly disturbance had been ascertained the puffy square face the tight bun of mousy hair the thin wardress mouth the lightbrown almost yellow eyes by god thought bond dully here they are within easy reach they would both be dead by now but for his single criminal error might there still be some way of turning the tables if only the pain in his head would stop throbbing blofelds tall sword stood against the wall he picked it up and strode out into the room he stood over the pile of bonds possessions and picked them over with the tip of the sword he hooked up the black suit he said in german and what is this kono the head guard replied in the same language his voice was uneasy and his eyeslits swivelled with a certain respect towards bond and away again it is a ninja suit herr doktor these are people who practise the secret arts of ninjutsu their secrets are very ancient and i know little of them they are the art of moving by stealth of being invisible of killing without weapons these people used to be much feared in japan i was not aware that they still existed this man has undoubtedly been sent to assassinate you my lord but for the magic of the passage he might well have succeeded and who is he blofeld looked keenly at bond he is tall for a japanese the men from the mines are often tall men my lord he carries a paper saying that he is deaf and dumb and other papers which appear to be in order stating that he is a miner from fukuoka i do not believe this his hands have some broken nails but they are not the hands of a miner i do not believe it either but we shall soon find out blofeld turned to the woman what do you think my dear you have a good nose for such problems the instincts of a woman irma bunt rose and came and stood beside him she looked piercingly at bond and then walked slowly round him keeping her distance when she came to the left profile she said softly with awe du lieber gott she went back to blofeld she said in a hoarse whisper still staring almost with horror at bond it cannot be but it is the scar down the right cheek the profile and the eyebrows have been shaved to give that upward tilt she turned to blofeld she said decisively this is the english agent this is the man bond james bond the man whose wife you killed the man who went under the name of sir hilary bray she added fiercely i swear it you have got to believe me lieber ernst blofelds eyes had narrowed i see a certain resemblance but how has he got here how has he found me who sent him the japanese geheimdienst they will certainly have relations with the british secret service i cannot believe it if that was so they would have come with warrants to arrest me there are too many unknown factors in this business we must proceed with great circumspection and extract the whole truth from this man we must at once find out if he is deaf and dumb that is the first step the question room should settle that but first of all he must be softened up he turned to kono tell kazama to get to work the question room there were now ten guards in the room they stood lined up against the wall behind kono they were all armed with their long staves kono fired an order at one of them the man left his stave in an angle of the wall and came forward he was a great boxlike man with a totally bald shining head like a ripe fruit and hands like hams he took up his position in front of bond his legs straddled for balance and his lips drawn back in a snarling smile of broken black teeth then he swung his right hand sideways at bonds head and slapped him with tremendous force exactly on the bruise of bonds fall bonds head exploded with fire then the left hand came at him and bond rocked sideways through a mist of blood he could see blofeld and his woman blofeld was merely interested as a scientist but the womans lips were parted and wet bond took ten blows and knew that he must act while he still had the purpose and the strength the straddled legs offered the perfect target so long as the man had not practised the sumo trick through a haze bond took aim and as another giant blow was on its way kicked upwards with every ounce of force left to him his foot slammed home the man gave an animal scream and crashed to the ground clasping himself and rolling from side to side in agony the guards made a concerted rush forward their staves lifted and kono had his gun out bond leaped for the protection of a tall chair picked it up and hurled it at the snarling pack of guards one of the legs caught a man in the teeth and there was the sound of splintering bone the man went down clutching his face halt it was the hitlerian scream bond had heard before the men stood stock still and lowered their staves kono remove those men blofeld pointed down at the two casualties and punish kazama for his incompetence get new teeth for the other one and enough of this the man will not speak with ordinary methods if he can hear he will not withstand the pressure of the question room take him there the rest of the guards can wait in the audience chamber alsomarsch kono fired off orders to which the guards reacted at the double then kono gestured to bond with his gun opened a small doorway beside the bookcase and pointed down a narrow stone passage now what bond licked the blood from the corners of his mouth he was near the end of his tether pressure he couldnt stand much more of it and what was this question room he mentally shrugged there might still be a chance to get at blofelds throat if only he could take that one with him he went ahead down the passage was deaf to the order from kono to open the rough door at the end had it opened for him by the guard while the pistol pressed into his spine and walked forward into a bizarre room of roughly hewn stone that was very hot and stank disgustingly of sulphur blofeld and the woman entered the door was closed and they took their places in two wooden armchairs beneath an oil lamp and a large kitchen clock whose only unusual feature was that at each quarter the figures were underlined in red the hands stood at just after eleven and now with a loud iron tick the minute hand dropped one span kono gestured for bond to advance the twelve paces to the far end of the room where there was a raised stone pedestalseat with arms it dripped with drying grey mud and there was the same volcanic filth on the floor all round it above the stone seat in the ceiling there was a wide circular opening through which bond could see a patch of dark sky and stars konos rubber boots squelched after him and bond was gestured to sit down on the stone throne in the centre of the seat there was a large round hole bond did as he was told his skin flinching at the hot sticky surface of the mud he rested his forearms wearily on the stone arms of the throne and waited his belly crawling with the knowledge of what this was all about blofeld spoke from the other end of the room he spoke in english he said in a loud voice that boomed round the naked walls commander bond or number in the british secret service if you prefer it this is the question room a device of my invention that has the almost inevitable effect of making silent people talk as you know this property is highly volcanic you are now sitting directly above a geyser that throws mud at a heat of around one thousand degrees centigrade a distance of approximately one hundred feet into the air your body is now at an elevation of approximately fifty feet directly above its source i had the whimsical notion to canalize this geyser up a stone funnel above which you now sit this is what is known as a periodic geyser this particular example is regulated to erupt volcanically on exactly each fifteenth minute in every hour blofeld looked behind him and turned back you will therefore observe that you have exactly eleven minutes before the next eruption if you cannot hear me or the translation that will follow if you are a deaf and dumb japanese as you maintain you will not move from that chair and at the fifteenth minute past eleven you will suffer a most dreadful death by the incineration of your lower body if on the other hand you leave the seat before the death moment you will have demonstrated that you can hear and understand and you will then be put to further tortures which will inevitably make you answer my questions these questions will seek to confirm your identity how you come to be here who sent you and with what purpose and how many people are involved in the conspiracy you understand you would not prefer to give up this playacting very well on the off chance that your papers are perhaps partially correct my chief guard will now briefly explain the purpose of this room in the japanese language he turned to the guard kono sag ihm auf japanisch den zweck dieses zimmers kono had taken up his position by the door he now harangued bond in sharp japanese sentences bond paid no attention he concentrated on regaining his strength he sat relaxed and gazed nonchalantly round the room he had remembered the final hell at beppu and he was looking for something ah yes there it was i a small wooden box in the corner to the right of his throne there was no keyhole to it inside that box would undoubtedly be the regulating valve for the geyser could that bit of knowledge be put to some use bond tucked it away and racked his tired brain for some kind of a plan if only the agonizing pulse in his head would stop he rested his elbows on his knees and gently lowered his bruised face into his hands at least that guard would now be in even worse agony than he kono stopped talking the clock uttered a deep iron tick it ticked nine times more bond looked up at the blackandwhite clockwork face it said a deep angry grumble sounded from deep down beneath him it was followed by a hard buffet of very hot breath bond got to his feet and walked slowly away from the stinking stone vent until he reached the area of the floor that was not wet with mud then he turned and watched the grumble had become a faraway roar the roar became a deep howl that swelled up into the room like an express train coming out of a tunnel then there was a mighty explosion and a solid jet of grey mud shot like a gleaming grey piston out of the hole bond had just left and exactly penetrated the wide aperture in the ceiling the jet continued absolutely solid for perhaps half a second and searing heat filled the room so that bond had to wipe the sweat from his forehead then the grey pillar collapsed back into the hole and mud pattered on to the roof of the place and splashed down into the room in great steaming gobbets a deep bubbling and burping came up the pipe and the room steamed the stench of sulphur was sickening in the total silence that followed the tick of the clock to was as loud as a gongstroke bond turned and faced the couple under the clock he said cheerfully well blofeld you mad bastard ill admit that your effects man down below knows his stuff now bting on the twelve shedevils and if theyre all as beautiful as fraulein bunt well get noel coward to put it to music and have it on broadway by christmas how about it blofeld turned to irma bunt my dear girl you were right it is indeed the same britischer remind me to buy you another string of the excellent mr mikimotos grey pearls and now let us be finished with this man once and for all it is beyond our bedtime yes indeed lieber ernst but first he must speak of course irmchen but that can be quickly done we have already broken his first reserves the second line of defence will be routine come back up the stone passage back into the library irma bunt back to her petit point blofeld back to his stance by the mantelpiece his hand resting lightly on the boss of his great sword it was just as if they had returned after taking part in some gracious afterdinner entertainment a game of billiards a look at the stamp albums a dull quarter of an hour with the home movies bond decided to hell with the fukuoka miner there was a writingdesk next to the bookshelves he pulled out its chair and sat down there were cigarettes and matches he lit up and sat back inhaling luxuriously might as well make oneself comfortable before one went for the big sleep he tapped his ash on to the carpet and crossed one knee over the other blofeld pointed to the pile of bonds possessions on the floor kono take those away i will examine them later and you can wait with the guards in the outer hall prepare the blowlamp and the electrical machine for further examination in case it should be necessary he turned to bond and now talk and you will receive an honourable and quick death by the sword have no misgivings i am expert with it and it is razorsharp if you do not talk you will die slowly and horribly and you will talk just the same you know from your profession that this is so there is a degree of prolonged suffering that no human can withstand well bond said easily blofeld you were never stupid many people in london and tokyo know of my presence here tonight at this moment you might argue your way out of a capital charge you have a lot of money and you could engage the best lawyers but if you kill me you will certainly die mister bond you are not telling the truth i know the ways of officialdom as well as you do therefore i dismiss your story in its entirety and without hesitation if my presence here was officially known a small army of policemen would have been sent to arrest me and they would have been accompanied by a senior member of the cia on whose wanted list i certainly feature this is an american sphere of influence you might have been allowed to interview me subsequent to my arrest but an englishman would not have featured in the initial police action who said this was police action when in england i heard rumours about this place i thought the whole project smelled of you i obtained permission to come and have a look but my whereabouts is known and retribution will result if i do not return that does not follow mister bond there will be no trace of your ever having seen me no trace of your entry into the property i happen to have certain information that fits in with your presence here one of my agents recently reported that the head of the japanese secret service the koanchosakyoku a certain tanaka came down in this direction accompanied by a foreigner dressed as a japanese i now see that your appearance tallies with my agents description where is this man i would like to question him he is not available very convenient a red fire began to burn deep in the black pools of blofelds eyes you forget that it is not i who am being interrogated mister bond it is you now i happen to know all about this tanaka he is a totally ruthless man and i will hazard a guess that fits the facts and that is made almost into a certitude by your crude evasions this man tanaka has already lost one senior agent whom he sent down here to investigate me you were available on some business concerned with your profession perhaps and for a consideration or in exchange for a favour you agreed to come here and kill me thus tidying up a situation which is causing some embarrassment to the japanese government i do not know or care when you learned that doctor guntram shatterhand was in fact ernst stavro blofeld you have your private reasons for wanting to kill me and i have absolutely no doubt that you kept your knowledge to yourself and passed it on to no one for fear that the official action i have described would take the place of your private plans for revenge blofeld paused he said softly i have one of the greatest brains in the world mister bond have you anything to say in reply as the americans say it had better be good bond took another cigarette and lit it he said composedly i stick to the truth blofeld if anything happens to me you and probably the woman as an accessory will be dead by christmas all right mister bond but i am so sure of my facts that i am now going to kill you with my own hands and dispose of your body without more ado on reflection i would rather do it myself than have it done slowly by the guards you have been a thorn in my flesh for too long the account i have to settle with you is a personal one have you ever heard the japanese expression kirisute gomen bond groaned spare me the lafcadio hearn blofeld it dates from the time of the samurai it means literally killing and going away if a low person hindered the samurais passage along the road or failed to show him proper respect the samurai was within his rights to lop off the mans head i regard myself as a latterday samurai my fine sword has not yet been blooded yours will be an admirable head to cut its teeth on he turned to irma bunt you agree mein liebchen the square wardress face looked up from its petit point but of course lieber ernst what you decide is always correct but be careful this animal is dangerous you forget mein liebchen since last january he has ceased to be an animal by a simple stroke of surgery on the woman he loved i reduced him to human dimensions the dominant horrific figure stood away from the mantelpiece and took up his sword let me show you blood and thunder bond dropped his lighted cigarette and left it to smoulder on the carpet his whole body tensed he said i suppose you know youre both mad as hatters so was frederick the great so was nietzsche so was van gogh we are in good in illustrious company mister bond on the other hand what are you you are a common thug a blunt instrument wielded by dolts in high places having done what you are told to do out of some mistaken idea of duty or patriotism you satisfy your brutish instincts with alcohol nicotine and sex while waiting to be dispatched on the next misbegotten foray twice before your chief has sent you to do battle with me mister bond and by a combination of luck and brute force you were successful in destroying two projects of my genius you and your government would categorize these projects as crimes against humanity and various authorities still seek to bring me to book for them but try and summon such wits as you possess mister bond and see them in a realistic light and in the higher realm of my own thinking blofeld was a big man perhaps six foot three and powerfully built he placed the tip of the samurai sword which has almost the blade of the scimitar between his straddled feet and rested his sinewy hands on its boss looking up at him from across the room bond had to admit that there was something larger than life in the looming imperious figure in the hypnotically direct stare of the eyes in the tall white brow in the cruel downward twist of the thin lips the squarecut heavily draped kimono designed to give the illusion of bulk to a race of smallish men made something huge out of the towering figure and the golden dragon embroidery so easily to be derided as a childish fantasy crawled menacingly across the black silk and seemed to spit real fire from over the left breast blofeld had paused in his harangue waiting for him to continue bond took the measure of his enemy he knew what would be coming justification it was always so when they thought they had got you where they wanted you when they knew they were decisively on top before the knockout even to an audience on the threshold of extinction it was pleasant reassuring to the executioner to deliver his apologia purge the sin he was about to commit blofeld his hands relaxed on the boss of his sword continued the tone of his voice was reasonable selfassured quietly expository he said now mister bond take operation thunderball as your government dubbed it this project involved the holding to ransom of the western world by the acquisition by me of two atomic weapons where lies the crime in this except in the erewhon of international politics rich boys are playing with rich toys a poor boy comes along and takes them and offers them back for money if the poor boy had been successful what a valuable byproduct might have resulted for the whole world these were dangerous toys which in the poor boys hands or let us say to discard the allegory in the hands of a castro could lead to the wanton extinction of mankind by my action i gave a dramatic example for all to see if i had been successful and the money had been handed over might not the threat of a recurrence of my attempt have led to serious disarmament talks to an abandonment of these dangerous toys that might so easily get into the wrong hands you follow my reasoning then this recent matter of the bacteriological warfare attack on england my dear mister bond england is a sick nation by any standards by hastening the sickness to the brink of death might britain not have been forced out of her lethargy into the kind of community effort we witnessed during the war cruel to be kind mister bond where lies the great crime there and now this matter of my socalled castle of death blofeld paused and his eyes took on an inward look he said i will make a confession to you mister bond i have come to suffer from a certain lassitude of mind which i am determined to combat this comes in part from being a unique genius who is alone in the world without honour worse misunderstood no doubt much of the root cause of this accidie is physical liver kidneys heart the usual weak points of the middleaged but there has developed in me a certain mental lameness a disinterest in humanity and its future an utter boredom with the affairs of mankind so not unlike the gourmet with his jaded palate i now seek only the highly spiced the sharp impact on the taste buds mental as well as physical the tickle that is truly exquisite and so mister bond i came to devise this useful and essentially humane project the offer of free death to those who seek release from the burden of being alive by doing so i have not only provided the common man with a solution to the problem of whether to be or not to be i have also provided the japanese government though for the present they appear to be blind to my magnanimity with a tidy outoftheway charnelhouse which relieves them of a constant flow of messy occurrences involving the trains the trams the volcanoes and other unattractively public means of killing yourself you must admit that far from being a crime this is a public service unique in the history of the world i saw one man being disgustingly murdered yesterday tidying up mister bond tidying up the man came here wishing to die what you saw done was only helping a weak man to his seat on the boat across the styx but i can see that we have no contact i cannot reach what serves you for a mind for your part you cannot see further than the simple gratification of your last cigarette so enough of this idle chatter you have already kept us from our beds far too long do you want to be hacked about in a vulgar brawl or will you offer your neck in the honourable fashion blofeld took a step forward and raised his mighty sword in both hands and held it above his head the light from the oil lamps shimmered on the blade and showed up the golden filigree engraving bond knew what to do he had known as soon as he had been led back into the room and had seen the wounded guards stave still standing in the shadowed angle of the wall but there was a bellpush near the woman she would have to be dealt with first had he learned enough of the thrusts and parries of bojutsu from the demonstration at the ninja training camp bond hurled himself to the left seized the stave and leaped at the woman whose hand was already reaching upwards the stave thudded into the side of her head and she sprawled grotesquely forward off her chair and lay still blofelds sword whistled down inches from his shoulder bond twisted and lunged to his full extent thrusting his stave forward in the groove of his left hand almost as if it had been a billiard cue the tip caught blofeld hard on the breastbone and flung him against the wall but he hurtled back and came inexorably forward swishing his sword like a scythe bond aimed at his right arm missed and had to retreat he was concentrating on keeping his weapon as well as his body away from the whirling steel or his stave would be cut like a matchstick and its extra length was his only hope of victory blofeld suddenly lunged expertly his right knee bent forward bond feinted to the left but he was inches too slow and the tip of the sword flicked his left ribs drawing blood but before blofeld could withdraw bond had slashed twohanded sideways at his legs his stave met bone blofeld cursed and made an ineffectual stab at bonds weapon then he advanced again and bond could only dodge and feint in the middle of the room and make quick short lunges to keep the enemy at bay but he was losing ground in front of the whirling steel and now blofeld scenting victory took lightning steps and thrust forward like a snake bond leaped sideways saw his chance and gave a mighty sweep of his stave it caught blofeld on his right shoulder and drew a curse from him his main sword arm bond pressed forward lancing again and again with his weapon and scoring several hits to the body but one of blofelds parries caught the stave and cut off that one vital foot of extra length as if it had been a candleend blofeld saw his advantage and began attacking making furious forward jabs that bond could only parry by hitting at the flat of the sword to deflect it but now the stave was slippery in the sweat of his hands and for the first time he felt the cold breath of defeat at his neck and blofeld seemed to smell it for he suddenly executed one of his fast running lunges to get under bonds guard bond guessed the distance of the wall behind him and leaped backwards against it even so he felt the swordpoint fan across his stomach but hurled back by his impact with the wall he counterlunged swept the sword aside with his stave and dropping his weapon made a dive for blofelds neck and got both hands to it for a moment the two sweating faces were almost up against each other the boss of blofelds sword battered into bonds side bond hardly felt the crashing blows he pressed with his thumbs and pressed and pressed and heard the sword clank to the floor and felt blofelds fingers and nails tearing at his face trying to reach his eyes bond whispered through his gritted teeth die blofeld die and suddenly the tongue was out and the eyes rolled upwards and the body slipped down to the ground but bond followed it and knelt his hands cramped round the powerful neck seeing nothing hearing nothing in the terrible grip of blood lust bond slowly came to himself the golden dragons head on the black silk kimono spat flame at him he unclasped his aching hands from round the neck and not looking again at the purple face got to his feet he staggered god how his head hurt what remained to be done he tried to cast his mind back he had had a clever idea what was it oh yes of course he picked up blofelds sword and sleepwalked down the stone passage to the torture room he glanced up at the clock five minutes to midnight and there was the wooden box mudspattered down beside the throne on which he had sat days years before he went to it and hacked it open with one stroke of the sword yes there was the big wheel he had expected he knelt down and twisted and twisted until it was finally closed what would happen now the end of the world bond ran back up the passage now he must get out get away from this place but his line of retreat was closed by the guards he tore aside a curtain and smashed the window open with his sword outside there was a balustraded terrace that seemed to run round this storey of the castle bond looked around for something to cover his nakedness there was only blofelds sumptuous kimono coldly bond tore it off the corpse put it on and tied the sash the interior of the kimono was cold like a snakes skin he looked down at irma bunt she was breathing heavily with a drunken snore bond went to the window and climbed out minding his bare feet among the glass splinters but he had been wrong the balustrade was a brief one closed at both ends he stumbled from end to end of it but there was no exit he looked over the side a sheer hundredfoot drop to the gravel a soft fluted whistle above him caught his ear he looked up only a breath of wind in the moorings of that bloody balloon but then a lunatic idea came to him a flashback to one of the old douglas fairbanks films when the hero had swung across a wide hall by taking a flying leap at the chandelier the helium balloon was strong enough to hold taut fifty feet of framed cotton strip bearing the warning sign why shouldnt it be powerful enough to bear the weight of a man bond ran to the corner of the balustrade to which the mooring line was attached he tested it it was taut as a wire from somewhere behind him there came a great clamour in the castle had the woman woken up holding on to the straining rope he climbed on to the railing cut a foothold for himself in the cotton banner and grasping the mooring rope with his right hand chopped downwards below him with blofelds sword and threw himself into space it worked there was a light night breeze and he felt himself wafted gently over the moonlit park over the glittering steaming lake towards the sea but he was rising not falling the helium sphere was not in the least worried by his weight then blueandyellow fire fluttered from the upper storey of the castle and an occasional angry wasp zipped past him bonds hands and feet were beginning to ache with the strain of holding on something hit him on the side of the head the same side that was already sending out its throbbing message of pain and that finished him he knew it had for now the whole black silhouette of the castle swayed in the moonlight and seemed to jig upwards and sideways and then slowly dissolve like an icecream cone in sunshine the top storey crumbled first then the next and the next and then after a moment a huge jet of orange fire shot up from hell towards the moon and a buffet of hot wind followed by an echoing crack of thunder hit bond and made his balloon sway violently what was it all about bond didnt know or care the pain in his head was his whole universe punctured by a bullet the balloon was fast losing height below the softly swelling sea offered a bed bond let go with hands and feet and plummeted down towards peace towards the rippling feathers of some childhood dream of softness and escape from pain obit m writes as your readers will have learned from earlier issues a senior officer of the ministry of defence commander james bond cmg rnvr is missing believed killed while on an official mission to japan it grieves me to have to report that hopes of his survival must now be abandoned it therefore falls to my lot as the head of the department he served so well to give some account of this officer and of his outstanding services to his country james bond was born of a scottish father andrew bond of glencoe and a swiss mother monique delacroix from the canton de vaud his father being a foreign representative of the vickers armaments firm his early education from which he inherited a firstclass command of french and german was entirely abroad when he was eleven years of age both his parents were killed in a climbing accident in the aiguilles rouges above chamonix and the youth came under the guardianship of an aunt since deceased miss charmian bond and went to live with her at the quaintlynamed hamlet of pett bottom near canterbury in kent there in a small cottage hard by the attractive duck inn his aunt who must have been a most erudite and accomplished lady completed his education for an english public school and at the age of twelve or thereabouts he passed satisfactorily into eton for which college he had been entered at birth by his father it must be admitted that his career at eton was brief and undistinguished and after only two halves as a result it pains me to record of some alleged trouble with one of the boys maids his aunt was requested to remove him she managed to obtain his transfer to fettes his fathers old school here the atmosphere was somewhat calvinistic and both academic and athletic standards were rigorous nevertheless though inclined to be solitary by nature he established some firm friendships among the traditionally famous athletic circles at the school by the time he left at the early age of seventeen he had twice fought for the school as a lightweight and had in addition founded the first serious judo class at a british public school by now it was and by claiming an age of nineteen and with the help of an old vickers colleague of his father he entered a branch of what was subsequently to become the ministry of defence to serve the confidential nature of his duties he was accorded the rank of lieutenant in the special branch of the rnvr and it is a measure of the satisfaction his services gave to his superiors that he ended the war with the rank of commander it was about this time that the writer became associated with certain aspects of the ministrys work and it was with much gratification that i accepted commander bonds postwar application to continue working for the ministry in which at the time of his lamented disappearance he had risen to the rank of principal officer in the civil service the nature of commander bonds duties with the ministry which were incidentally recognized by the appointment of cmg in must remain confidential nay secret but his colleagues at the ministry will allow that he performed them with outstanding bravery and distinction although occasionally through an impetuous strain in his nature with a streak of the foolhardy that brought him in conflict with higher authority but he possessed what almost amounted to the nelson touch in moments of the highest emergency and he somehow contrived to escape more or less unscathed from the many adventurous paths down which his duties led him the inevitable publicity particularly in the foreign press accorded some of these adventures made him much against his will something of a public figure with the inevitable result that a series of popular books came to be written around him by a personal friend and former colleague of james bond if the quality of these books or their degree of veracity had been any higher the author would certainly have been prosecuted under the official secrets act it is a measure of the disdain in which these fictions are held at the ministry that action has not yeti emphasize the qualificationbeen taken against the author and publisher of these highflown and romanticized caricatures of episodes in the career of an outstanding public servant it only remains to conclude this brief in memoriam by assuring his friends that commander bonds last mission was one of supreme importance to the state although it now appears that alas he will not return from it i have the authority of the highest quarters in the land to confirm that the mission proved one hundred per cent successful it is no exaggeration to pronounce unequivocally that through the recent valorous efforts of this one man the safety of the realm has received mighty reassurance james bond was briefly married in to teresa only daughter of marcange draco of marseilles the marriage ended in tragic circumstances that were reported in the press at the time there was no issue of the marriage and james bond leaves so far as i am aware no relative living m g writes i was happy and proud to serve commander bond in a close capacity during the past three years at the ministry of defence if indeed our fears for him are justified may i suggest these simple words for his epitaph many of the junior staff here feel they represent his philosophy i shall not waste my days in trying to prolong them i shall use my time sparrows tears when kissy saw the figure blackwinged in its kimono crash down into the sea she sensed that it was her man and she covered the two hundred yards from the base of the wall as fast as she had ever swum in her life the tremendous impact with the water had at first knocked all the wind out of bond but the will to live so nearly extinguished by the searing pain in his head was revived by the new but recognizable enemy of the sea and when kissy got to him he was struggling to free himself from the kimono at first he thought she was blofeld and tried to strike out at her its kissy she said urgently kissy suzuki dont you remember he didnt he had no recollection of anything in the world but the face of his enemy and of the desperate urge to smash it but his strength was going and finally cursing feebly he allowed her to manhandle him out of the kimono and paid heed to the voice that pleaded with him now follow me tarosan when you get tired i will pull you with me we are all trained in such rescue work but when she started off bond didnt follow her instead he swam feebly round and round like a wounded animal in everincreasing circles she almost wept what had happened to him what had they done to him at the castle of death finally she stopped him and talked softly to him and he docilely allowed her to put her arms under his armpits and with his head cradled between her breasts she set off with the traditional backward legstroke it was an amazing swim for a girl half a mile with currents to contend with and only the moon and an occasional glance over her shoulder to give her a bearing but she achieved it and finally hauled bond out of the water in her little cove and collapsed on the flat stones beside him she was awoken by a groan from bond he had been quietly sick and now sat with his head in his hands looking blankly out to sea with the glazed eyes of a sleepwalker when kissy put an arm round his shoulders he turned vaguely towards her who are you how did i get here what is this place he examined her more carefully youre very pretty kissy looked at him keenly she said and a sudden plan of great glory blazed across her mind you cannot remember anything you do not remember who you are and where you came from bond passed a hand across his forehead squeezed his eyes nothing he said wearily nothing except a mans face i think he was dead i think he was a bad man what is your name you must tell me everything my name is kissy suzuki and you are my lover your name is taro todoroki we live on this island and go fishing together it is a very good life but can you walk a little i must take you to where you live and get you some food and a doctor to see you you have a terrible wound on the side of your head and there is a cut on your ribs you must have fallen while you were climbing the cliffs after seagulls eggs she stood up and held out her hands bond took them and staggered to his feet she held him by the hand and gently guided him along the path towards the suzuki house but she passed it and went on and up to the grove of dwarf maples and camellia bushes she led him behind the shinto shrine and into the cave it was large and the earth floor was dry she said this is where you live i live here with you i had put away our bed things i will go and fetch them and some food now lie down my beloved and rest and i will look after you you are ill but the doctor will make you well again bond did as he was told and was instantly asleep the painfree side of his head cradled on his arm kissy ran off down the mountain her heart singing there was much to be done much to be arranged but now she had got her man back she was desperately determined to keep him it was almost dawn and her parents were awake she whispered to them excitedly as she went about warming some milk and putting together a bundle of futon her fathers best kimono and a selection of bonds washing things nothing to remind him of his past her parents were used to her whims and her independence her father merely commented mildly that it would be all right if the kannushisan gave his blessing then having washed the salt off herself and dressed in her own simple brown kimono she scampered off up the hill to the cave later the shinto priest received her gravely he almost seemed to be expecting her he held up his hand and spoke to the kneeling figure kissychan i know what i know the spawn of the devil is dead so is his wife the castle of death has been totally destroyed these things were brought about as the six guardians foretold by the man from across the sea where is he now in the cave behind the shrine kannushisan he is gravely wounded i love him i wish to keep him and care for him he remembers nothing of the past i wish it to remain so so that we may marry and he may become a son of kuro for all time that will not be possible my daughter in due course he will recover and go off across the world to where he came from and there will be official inquiries for him from fukuoka perhaps even from tokyo for he is surely a man of renown in his own country but kannushisan if you so instruct the elders of kuro they will show these people shirankao they will say they know nothing that this man todoroki left swimming for the mainland and has not been heard of since then the people will go away all i want to do is to care for him and keep him for myself as long as i can if the day comes when he wishes to leave i will not hinder him i will help him he was happy here fishing with me and my davidbird he told me so when he recovers i will see that he continues to be happy should not kuro cherish and honour this hero who was brought to us by the gods would not the six guardians wish to keep him for a while and have i not earned some small token for my humble efforts to help todorokisan and save his life the priest sat silent for a while with his eyes closed then he looked down at the pleading face at his feet he smiled i will do what is possible kissychan and now bring the doctor to me and then take him up to the cave so that he can tend this mans wounds then i will speak to the elders but for many weeks youmust be very discreet and the gaijin must not show himself when all is quiet again he may move back into the house of your parents and allow himself to be seen the doctor knelt beside bond in the cave and spread out on the ground a large map of the human head with the sections marked with figures and ideograms his gentle fingers probed bonds wounds for signs of fracture while kissy knelt beside him and held one of bonds sweating hands in both of hers the doctor bent forward and lifting the eyelids one by one gazed deeply into the glazed eyes through a large readingglass on his instructions kissy ran for boiling water and the doctor proceeded to clean the cut made by the bullet across the terrible swelling of the first wound caused by bonds crash into the oubliette then he tapped sulpha dust into the wound and bound up the head neatly and expertly put surgical plaster over the cut across the ribs and stood up and took kissy outside the cave he will live he said but it may be months even years before he regains his memory it is particularly the temporal lobe of his brain where the memory is stored that has been damaged for this much education will be necessary you will endeavour all the time to remind him about past things and places then isolated facts that he will recognize will turn into chains of association he should undoubtedly be taken to fukuoka for an xray but i think there is no fracture and in any case the kannushisan has ordained that he is to remain under your care and his presence on the island to be kept secret i shall of course observe the instructions of the honourable kannushisan and only visit him by different routes and at night but there is much you will have to attend to for he must not be moved in any way for at least a week now listen carefully said the doctor and gave her minute instructions which covered every aspect of feeding and nursing and left her to carry them out and so the days ran into weeks and the police came again and again from fukuoka and the official called tanaka came from tokyo and later a huge man who said he was from australia arrived and he was the most difficult of all for kissy to shake off but the face of shirankao remained of stone and the island of kuro kept its secret james bonds body gradually mended and kissy took him out for walks at night they also went for an occasional swim in the cove where they played with david and she told him all the history of the ama and of kuro and expertly parried all his questions about the world outside the island winter came and the ama had to stay ashore and turn their hands to mending nets and boats and working on the smallholdings on the mountain side and bond came back into the house and made himself useful with carpentry and odd jobs and with learning japanese from kissy the glazed look went from his eyes but they remained remote and faraway and every night he was puzzled by dreams of a quite different world of white people and big cities and halfremembered faces but kissy assured him that these were just nightmares such as she had and that they had no meaning and gradually bond came to accept the little stoneandwood house and the endless horizon of sea as his finite world kissy was careful to keep him away from the south coast of the island and dreaded the day when fishing would begin again at the end of may and he would see the great black wall across the straits and memory might come flooding back the doctor was surprised by bonds lack of progress and resigned himself to the conclusion that bonds amnesia was total but soon there was no cause for further visits because bonds physical health and his apparently complete satisfaction with his lot showed that in every other respect he was totally recovered but there was one thing that greatly distressed kissy from the first night in the cave she had shared bonds futon and when he was well and back in the house she waited every night for him to make love to her but while he kissed her occasionally and often held her hand his body seemed totally unaware of her however much she pressed herself against him and even caressed him with her hands had the wound made him impotent she consulted the doctor but he said there could be no connexion although it was just possible that he had forgotten how to perform the act of love so one day kissy suzuki announced that she was going to take the weekly mailboat to fukuoka to do some shopping and in the big city she found her way to the local sexshop called the happy shop that is a feature of all selfrespecting japanese towns and told her problem to the wickedlooking old greybeard behind the innocent counter containing nothing more viciously alluring than tonics and contraceptives he asked her if she possessed five thousand yen which is a lot of money and when she said she did he locked the street door and invited her to the back of the shop the sex merchant bent down and pulled out from beneath a bench what looked like a small wired rabbithutch he put this on the bench and kissy saw that it contained four large toads on a bed of moss next he produced a metal contraption that had the appearance of a hotplate with a small wire cage in the middle he carefully lifted out one of the toads and placed it inside the cage so that it squatted on the metal surface then he hauled a large car battery on to the bench put it alongside the hotplate and attached wires from one to the other then he spoke some encouraging endearments to the toad and stood back the toad began to shiver slightly and the crosses in its dark red eyes blazed angrily at kissy as if it knew it was all her fault the sex merchant his head bent over the little cage watched anxiously and then rubbed his hands with satisfaction as heavy beads of sweat broke out all over the toads warty skin he reached for an iron teaspoon and a small phial gently raised the wire cage and very carefully scraped the sweatbeads off the toads body and dripped the result into the phial when he had finished the phial contained about half a teaspoon of clear liquid he corked it up and handed it to kissy who held it with reverence and great care as if it had been a fabulous jewel then the sex merchant disconnected the wires and put the toad which seemed none the worse for its experience back in its hutch and closed the top he turned to kissy and bowed when this valuable product is desired by a sincere customer i always ask them to witness the process of distillation otherwise they might harbour the unworthy thought that the phial contained only water from the tap but you have now seen that this preparation is the authentic sweat of a toad it is produced by giving a toad a mild electric shock the toad suffered only temporary discomfort and it will be rewarded this evening with an extra portion of flies or crickets and now he went to a cupboard and took out a small pillbox here is powder of dried lizard a combination of the two inserted in your lovers food at the evening meal should prove infallible however to excite his mind as well as his senses for an extra thousand yen i can provide you with a most excellent pillowbook what is a pillowbook the sex merchant went back to his cupboard and produced a cheaply bound and printed paper book with a plain cover kissy opened it her hand went to her mouth and she blushed furiously but then being a careful girl who didnt want to be cheated she turned some more of the pages they all contained outrageously pornographic closeup pictures most faithfully engraved of the loveact portrayed from every possible aspect very well she whispered she handed back the book please wrap up everything carefully she took out her purse and began counting out the notes out in the shop the wickedfaced old man handed her the parcel and bowing deeply unlocked the door kissy gave a perfunctory bob in return and darted out of the shop down the street as if she had just made a pact with the devil but by the time she went to catch the mailboat back to kuro she was hugging herself with excitement and pleasure and making up a story to explain away her acquisition of the book bond was waiting for her on the jetty it was the first day she had been away from him and he had missed her painfully they talked happily as they walked handinhand along the foreshore among the nets and boats and the people smiled to see them but looked through them instead of greeting them for had not the priest decreed that their gaijin here did not officially exist and the priests edict was final back at the house kissy went happily about preparing a highly spiced dish of sukiyaki the national dish of beef stew this was not only a great treat for they seldom ate meat but kissy didnt know if her lovepotions had any taste and it would be wise not to take any chances when it was ready with a trembling hand she poured the brown powder and the liquid into bonds portion and stirred it well then she brought the dishes in to where the family awaited squatting on the tatami before the low table she watched surreptitiously as bond devoured every scrap of his portion and wiped his plate clean with a pinch of rice and then after warm compliments on her cooking drank his tea and retired to their room in the evenings he usually sat mending nets or fishing lines before going to bed as she helped her mother wash up she wondered if he were doing so now kissy spent a long time doing her hair and making herself pretty before her heart beating like a captured bird she joined him he looked up from the pillowbook and laughed kissy where in gods name did you get this she giggled oh that i forgot to tell you some dreadful man tried to make up to me in one of the shops he pressed that into my hand and made an assignation for this evening i agreed just to get rid of him it is what we call a pillowbook lovers use them arent the pictures exciting bond threw off his kimono he pointed to the soft futon on the floor he said fiercely kissy take off your clothes and lie down there well start at page one winter slid into spring and fishing began again but now kissy dived naked like the other girls and bond and the bird dived with her and there were good days and bad days but the sun shone steadily and the sea was blue and wild irises covered the mountainside and everyone made a great fuss as the sprinkling of cherry trees burst into bloom and kissy wondered what moment to choose to tell bond that she was going to have a baby and whether he would then propose marriage to her but one day on the way down to the cove bond looked preoccupied and when he asked her to wait before they put the boat out as he had something serious to talk to her about her heart leaped and she sat down beside him on a flat rock and put her arms round him and waited bond took a crumpled piece of paper out of his pocket and held it out to her and she shivered with fear and knew what was coming she took her arms from round him and looked at the paper it was one of the rough squares of newspaper from the spike in the little lavatory she always tore these squares herself and discarded any that contained words in english just in case bond pointed kissy what is this word vladivostok what does it mean it has some kind of a message for me i connect it with a very big country i believe the country is called russia am i right kissy remembered her promise to the priest she put her face in her hands yes tarosan that is so bond pressed his fists to his eyes and squeezed i have a feeling that i have had much to do with this russia that a lot of my past life was concerned with it could that be possible i long so terribly to know where i came from before i came to kuro will you help me kissy kissy took her hands from her face and looked at him she said quietly yes i will hep you my beloved then i must go to this place vladivostok and perhaps it will awaken more memories and i can work my way back from there if you say so my love the mailboat goes to fukuoka tomorrow i will put you on a train there and give you money and full directions it is advertised that one can go from the northern island hokkaido to sakhalin which is on the russian mainland then you can no doubt make your way to vladivostok it is a great port to the south of sakhalin but you must take care for the russians are not friendly people surely they would do no harm to a fisherman from kuro kissys heart choked her she got up and walked slowly down to the boat she pushed the boat down the pebbles into the water and waited at her usual place in the stern for him to get in and for his knees to clasp hers as they always did james bond took his place and unshipped the oars and the cormorant scrambled on board and perched imperiously in the bows bond measured where the rest of the fleet lay on the horizon and began to row kissy smiled into his eyes and the sun shone on his back and so far as james bond was concerned it was a beautiful day just like all the other days had been without a cloud in the sky but then of course he didnt know that his name was james bond and compared with the blazing significance to him of that single russian word on the scrap of paper his life on kuro his love for kissy suzuki were in tigers phrase of as little account as sparrows tears
