 nara prefecture japan spring present masashigi kusunoki the sensei of this dojo was making tea he knelt on the reed tatami his kimono light gray on dark gray swirled around him as if he were the eye of a great dark whirlpool he poured steaming hot water into an earthen cup and as he took up the reed whisk to make the pale green froth the form of tsutsumu shadowed the open doorway beyond his bent body the polished wooden floor on the dojo stretched away gleaming and perfect kusunoki had his back to the doorway he faced the edge of the shoji screen and the large window through which could be seen the cherry trees in full blossom clouds come to walk the earth marching up the densely wooded slopes of yoshino their oblique branches as green as the hills beyond covered with ancient moss the scent of cedar was very strong now as it almost always was in this section of nara prefecture save during those few weeks of winter when the snow lay heavy through the ridges and rises of the terrain kusunoki never tired of that view it was steeped in the history of japan it was here that minamoto no yoshitsune sought the shelter of these fortresslike mountains in order to defeat the treachery of the shogun his brother it was here that the great doomed emperor godaigo assembled his troops and ended his exile beginning his attempt to return to the throne here too where shugendo developed the way of mountain ascetics a peculiar fusion of buddhism and shinto mount omine was out there and on its slopes congregated the yamabushi the wandering selfmortifying adherents of this syncretic religion he looked now at the tea its color lightening as the spume rose and he saw all there was to see beyond that thin pane of glass behind him tsutsumu was about to announce himself softly but seeing the sensei kneeling unaware froze his tongue for a long time he contemplated the figure on the tatami and as he did so his muscles began to lose their relaxedness he had been alert now he was ready his mind sought the many pathways toward victory while his eyes drank in the utter stillness in the other the hands must be moving tsutsumu told himself because i know he is preparing the tea yet he might as well be a statue for all i can see of it he knew the time to be right and unbidden he rose unfurling himself like a sail before the wind taking two swift silent strides he crossed the threshold and was within striking distance his body torqued with the first onset of intrinsic energy at that instant kusunoki turned and extending the hot cup of tea said it is always an honor to invite a pupil so quick to learn into my study his eyes locked onto tsutsumu and the student felt as if he had hit against an invisible impenetrable wall all the fire of the energy he had banked for so long now at last turned loose was stifled held momentarily in thrall then dissipated tsutsumu shivered involuntarily he blinked as an owl might in daylight he felt intensely vulnerable without that which had always been his the sensei was smiling pleasantly come he said and tsutsumu saw that another cup of tea had somehow materialized let us drink together to show respect and our mutual good intentions the student smiled awkwardly and shakily sat on the tatami facing kusunoki between them was a break in the reed mats that was far more than an architectural or an esthetic delineation it was the space between host and guest always observed tsutsumu took the cup and holding it carefully and correctly in both hands prepared to drink the warmth of the tea rushed into his palms he bowed to his sensei touched the curved rim of the cup to his lips and drank the intensely bitter beverage it was very good and he closed his eyes for an instant forgetting where he was and even who he was to the extent that that was possible he tasted the earth of japan and with it all things japanese history and legend honor and courage the weight of kami hovering and above all duty giri then his eyes opened and all was as it had been before he felt again the uncomfortableness of being so far from home he was from the north and nara was an alien place to him he had never liked it here yet he had come and had stayed for two long years giri tell me kusunoki said what is the first thing we assess in combat our opponent tsutsumu said immediately the exchange of attitude and intention tells us where we are and how we are to proceed indeed kusunoki said as if this were a new concept to him and he was mulling it over in his mind so we think of victory no the student said we concern ourselves with not being defeated the sensei looked at him with his hard black eyes that seemed ripped from a hawks fierce face good he said at last very good indeed tsutsumu sipping his tea slowly wondered what this was all about words and more words the sensei was asking him questions to which any good pupil must know the answers be careful he cautioned himself remembering the instantaneous dissolution of his attacking force be on guard so here we equate defeat with the end of life the student nodded in handtohand we are on the death ground as sun tzu has written we must fight always now kusunoki allowed a full smile but sun tzu has also written to subdue the enemy without fighting shows the highest level of skill thus what is supreme is to attack the enemys strategy pardon me sensei but it seems to me sun tzu was speaking solely about war in that instance well kusunoki said evenly isnt that what we are also talking about tsutsumu felt his heart skip a beat and it was with a great personal effort that he kept himself calm war forgive me sensei but i do not understand kusunokis face was benign as he thought and sun tzu also wrote that those skilled in war can make themselves invincible but cannot cause an enemy to be vulnerable there are many faces war may take on many guises is this not so it is sensei tsutsumu said his pulse in his throat we can ask what war can be made here his arm drifted through the air like a cloud describing an arc toward the wonder and peace of the wooded hillsides visible through the window in yoshino where the history of japan lives and thrives one might think war an outmoded concept here among the cherry trees and the cedars his great black eyes fixed on tsutsumu and the pupil felt a muscle along his inner thigh begin to tremble yet war has come to this indomitable fortress of nature and thus it must be dealt with now tsutsumu was truly terrified this was no ordinary invitation to sit at the senseis feet and sip tea while speaking of mundane matters the substance of daily lessons there is a traitor here in yoshino kusunoki said what yes it is true kusunoki nodded his head sadly you are the first i have spoken to about it i observe you in class you are quick quick and intelligent now you will work with me on this matter you will spy for me among the students you will begin now have you observed anything out of the ordinary that might help us in identifying the spy tsutsumu thought furiously he was not unaware of the amazing opportunity being afforded him and was immensely grateful for it he felt as if a great weight had been taken off his chest now he must make the most of this opening i seem to remember he began yes yes there is something the woman he used a most unflattering inflection has been seen here late into the evening hours what has she been doing there was no need to name her the dojo contained only one woman a choice of the sensei that was not popular with his pupils though none dared voice their displeasure where he could hear nevertheless he knew about it tsutsumu shrugged who knows sensei certainly she was not practicing i see kusunoki seemed engulfed in thought tsutsumu sought to press his advantage of course there has been much talk lately concerning her a great deal of talk she is not liked no sensei tsutsumu confirmed most of the students do not feel she has a place here within the sanctity of the dojo it goes against tradition they feel this kind ofahtraining should not be open to a woman they believe the student bowed his head as if reluctant to go on forgive me sensei but there has even been some talk that her presence here was the reason that you left your high position within the gyokku ryu they say she came to you there that on her behalf you went to the council of jonin and sought their vote for her entry into the ryu they say it is because you could not muster enough votes within your own council that you left his head raised all because of her invincibility lies in the defense kusunoki thought the possibility of victory is attack to his pupil he said it is true that i was once jonin in the gyokku ryu that much is common knowledge but the reasons for my departure are my own no one else knows them not even the other members of the council my greatgreatgrandfather was one of the founders of gyokku it took much thought on my part to make the decision it took much time i understand sensei tsutsumu said thinking that what he had just been told was an utter lie he was certain within his own heart that kusunoki had indeed jeopardized his entire career for this one woman inexplicably good kusunoki nodded i thought you might the black eyes closed for a moment and the student breathed an inaudible sigh of relief he felt a trickle of sweat creeping like an insect down the indentation of his spine and he struggled to keep his body still perhaps i have been wrong about her after all the sensei said with a great deal of elation tsutsumu recognized the sadness in the others voice if what you have gleaned is indeed the truth then we must deal with her swiftly and ruthlessly tsutsumus head swung around at the mention of the word we yes sensei he said thinking softly softly now knowing he was moving in trying to keep his jubilation in check any way i may serve you is an honor that is why i first came here and i have not wavered in that resolve kusunoki nodded it is as i suspected there are few one can trust even in this day and age when i ask for your opinions now when i ask for you to take action both of these must be given willingly and faithfully tsutsumu could barely contain his euphoria outwardly he showed nothing you have but to ask me he said muhonnin kusunoki said leaning forward this is all i ask the word traitor had only begun to register on tsutsumus brain when he felt the incredible pain engulf him and looking down saw the senseis hand gripping him just below the collarbone it was not a strike he had yet mastered and staring bewilderedly at it trying to fathom its secrets he died a froth of pink saliva bubbling between his trembling lips kusunoki watching life escape like a puff of invisible smoke took his hand away from the corpse without his support it swayed and fell to one side the pink drool staining the tatami on which tsutsumu knelt behind the sensei a shadow appeared to move behind the shoji and then a figure emerged hearing the pad of bare feet the sensei said you heard it all yes you were correct all along he was the traitor the voice was light pleasingly modulated female she wore a dark brown kimono designed with gray plovers within circles of black her gleaming black hair was drawn tightly back from her face kusunoki did not turn around at her silent approach instead he was staring at the ricepaper scroll hung in a niche along one bare wall just below it was an earthenware bud vase in which he had placed one perfect day lily at dawn this morning as he did every morning of his adult life he had gone walking in the wilderness strolling the slopes through glades still dark and misty with remnants of the night past rushing streams etched with the last silvered thorns of moonlight in search of this one flower that would reflect its mood of peace and contemplation all through the day plucking it carefully he had made his way back to the precincts of his dojo on the ricepaper scroll a zen master of the eighteenth century had written in flowing characters rock and wind only they remain through generations but you allowed him to get so close to you kusunoki smiled up at her and said i allowed him the luxury of cutting his own throat that is all he watched her as she sank down on her knees he was conscious of the fact that she chose a spot near his right hand and not directly in front of him often times dictate that one becomes more intimate with ones enemies than with friends this is a necessary lesson of life urge you to listen well friends engender obligations and obligations entangle life always remember complication breeds desperation but what is life without obligation kusunoki smiled that is an enigma even sensei may not unravel he nodded toward the fallen form now we must find the source from which this muhonnin sprang is that so important her head turned slightly so that the flat curve of her cheek was outlined in the soft light filtered by the shoji he has been neutralized we should return to our work you are not yet privileged to all that goes on here kusunoki said seriously the martial and the military arts are but two it is essential that we discover the source of the infiltration you should not have destroyed him so quickly then the sensei closed his eyes ah rash youth the voice was soft almost gentle but when the eyes snapped open the female felt her insides fluttering involuntarily drilled by that basilisk gaze he was professional you will learn someday not to waste valuable time on men like him they must be dispatched as quickly and as efficiently as possible they are dangerous highly volatile and they will not talk therefore we go onward his hands folded into his lap you must return to the source his source the people who sent him who trained him represent a very great threat to japan he paused his nostrils quivering as if he sensed some telltale vibration when he spoke again his voice had lost its hard edge his eyelids drooped there is more hot water tea is waiting obediently she went past him grasping the tea pot and pouring while the light went out of the sky and purple clouds obscured the terraced mountains carefully she brought the tiny cups toward him on a black lacquered tray a small flock of golden herons lifting off from racing water painted there delicately she set the tray down began to use the whisk with practiced strokes her wa her harmony was very strong and this was what kusunoki felt engulfing him at that moment he was very proud of what he had helped to create six seven eight the female turned the whisk creating the pale green froth on the tenth stroke her delicate fingers dropped the whisk and in the same motion were inside the wide sleeve of her kimono reversing the motion the short perfectly honed steel blade flashed upward biting into the back of kusunokis neck either her strength was at such a level or the blade was so superb that seemingly without effort the steel bit through flesh and bone severing the spinal column in a grotesque gesture the head came forward and down hanging only by the thin length of skin at the neck as if the sensei was deep in meditational prayer then crimson blood spurted upward from the severed arteries fountaining the room spattering the tatami where they both knelt the senseis torso jerked spasmodically its legs tangling beneath it as it tried to leap forward like a frog the female knelt rooted to the spot her eyes never left the body of her teacher once when he lay on his side and one leg spasmed a last time she felt something inside herself trembling like a leaf before a rising wind and she felt one tear lying hotly along the arch of her cheek then she hardened her heart strengthened her will and dammed up her emotions with that elation filled her it works she thought feeling her heart thundering within her rib cage jahd without it she would never have been able to mask her intent from him she understood that quite clearly as she stared down at her handiwork she thought its nothing personal nothing like what that bastard muhonnin tsutsumu had in mind i am no traitor but i had to prove myself i had to know and therefore i had to take on the best she got up and moving like a wraith across the tatami avoiding the spattered stains that had already begun to seep away across the floor onto other tatami went to him you were the best she thought staring down at her mentor now i am she bent and wiped the blood his blood from her weapon it left a long scar on the fabric of his kimono the last thing she did there was to strip him and reverently fold the precious garment as if it were the national flag soon it disappeared into an inner pocket then she was gone and with her absence came the rain book one shih new york tokyo hokkaidq spring present drowsing justine tomkin became aware of the nightblack shadow that slowly pierced the sunlight like the blade of a sword her mouth opened wide and she tried to scream as she saw the face and recognized saigo the images of blood and carnage a deathhunt too frightening to contemplate the odor of the grave had pervaded this once peaceful room in her fathers house on long island so full of childhood memories of a teddy bear with one eye missing and a plaid gingham giraffe her powerful scream was muffled by the thick wind of saigos passage as if he could control all gods elements with a wave of his hand his torso expanded extending through the light streaming down through the great glass dome in the ceiling an opalescent mist rising about him as if his connection to the earth was not meant for her eyes he bent over her prostrate form and while her mind screamed wake up wake up he slowly began to work his magic on her the icy menace in his eyes as dead as stones somehow transferring itself into her heart she felt the horror squirming there like a palmful of live worms an unholy bond was forming which she was powerless to deflect now she was part of him she would do his bidding like a servant take up his fallen katana and slay his enemy for him she felt the cool haft of the heavy katana beneath her curling fingers as she drew it upward off the floor she wielded it just as saigo would have had he not been dead and before her stood nicholas his vulnerable back to her she raised the katana its shadow already beginning to slice through the sunlight striking his spine nicholas my one and only love her mind whirled in a sick fury and her last thought before she began the lethal downward strike was not her own ninja betrayer this is your death justine jerked awake she was in a sweat her heart was thumping uncomfortably as loudly as a blacksmith strikes his anvil slowly she ran a shaking hand through her damp hair pulling it back away from her eyes then with a great indrawn breath that halfway through turned into a wracking shudder she clamped both arms about her body and began to rock back and forth as she had when she had been a child frightened by dreams welling up from the pitch blackness of the night blindly she reached out to the empty spot beside her in the large double bed and fear touched her heart anew it was not the terror of her own private nightmare which reared up at her this was a new fright and she twisted grabbing up a pillow from beside her where normally nicholas would have been and holding it tightly to her breast squeezed it as if this gesture might bring him back to her arms and the safety of america for nicholas was on the other side of the pacific and justine was quite certain now the fear she now felt was for him what was happening in japan what was he doing at this moment and what danger was amassing itself against him in a moment she lunged for the phone a little cry filling the silence of the room ladies and gentlemen we are beginning our descent into narita airport please make sure your seat back is in the upright position and that your tray table is closed and secured all hand luggage must be stowed under the seat in front of you welcome to tokyo japan while the unseen flight attendant repeated her short speech in japanese nicholas linnear opened his eyes he had been dreaming of justine thinking of yesterday when they had driven out of the city to get away as they often did from the pressurized life they led within the steel and smoked glass canyons of manhattan outside their house in west bay bridge they had doffed shoes and socks and despite the early spring chill loped across the white sand running down to the sea after her the cerulean waves cutting off her feet and ankles in violent foam catching up with her long dark hair in his face as he turned her around linking them a softly feathered wing coming down at the close of night his hard burnished arm around her pulling her to him the feel of her like liquid against flesh heated by the sun and more whisper of the salt wind oh nick i dont think ive ever been happy before not ever because of you i have no more sadness in me she was voicing the knowledge that he had saved her from the many demons that life held in its fisted claw not the least of which was her own masochistic self an ego robbed so she said by the domineering specter of her father she put her head on his shoulder kissing the side of his neck i wish you didnt have to go i wish we could be here in the surf together forever wed turn blue he laughed not wanting to catch her abruptly melancholy mood he felt his love for her like a gently purling river in the night hidden from sight yet present nonetheless anyway dont you think its better that were both so busy before the wedding no time to get cold feet and back out he was joking again but she lifted her head and he stared into her extraordinary eyes highly intelligent yet possessing an odd kind of naivete he had found so alluring when he had first met her he still did he watched the several crimson motes floating like a hint of her soul in the midst of her left iris her eyes were hazel that day more green than brown and he found himself feeling grateful mat the harrowing events of the past year had not altered the essence of her for through those eyes he could still see her heart do you ever dream of it he asked do you ever find yourself back in the house with the daikatana in your hands with saigo in your mind you took all that he did the strange kind of hypnosis away she said thats what you told me he nodded thats what i did well then she took his hand and led him from the chilly curling wavelets up above the hightide mark strewn with the dark wrack of sea grape and odd bits of ashy wood as perfectly smooth as stones she turned her face up toward the sun im glad winters over im happy to be out here again with everything returning to life justine he said seriously i just wanted to know whether there had been any he broke off searching for an english equivalent to the japanese thought any echoes of the incident after all saigo programmed you to kill me with my own sword you never speak of it why should i the light turned her eyes dark concealing all their delicate colors theres nothing to say there was silence for a time and they were engulfed by the rhythmic suck and pull of the sea along whose edge they had begun to walk again near the flat horizon a trawler hung as if suspended in a gulf of piercing blue she was looking out there as if the oceans expanse contained within it her future ive always known that life isnt safe but up until the time i met you i had no reason to care one way or another its no secret that i was once as selfdestructive as my sister is her eyes broke away from the glitter of the horizon she stared down at her laced fingers i wish to god it had never happened but oh it did he got hold of me its like when i had chicken pox as a kid it was so bad i almost died it left scars but i survived ill survive now her head lifted i must survive you see because theres us to think about nicholas had stared into her eyes was she keeping something from him he could not say and he did not know why it should worry him she laughed suddenly her face becoming that of a college girl innocent and carefree the light dusting of freckles over her creamy skin catching the warming sunlight she had a pure laugh untainted by sarcasm or cynicism there were no danger signs in it as there were in many people i wont have you here beside me tomorrow she said so lets make the most of today she kissed him tenderly is that very oriental he laughed i think it is yes her long artists fingers traced the line of his jaw pausing at last to touch the tender flesh of his lips youre more dear to me than i thought anyone could ever be justine if youd travel to the ends of the earth id find you again that sounds like the unrealistic statement of a little girl but i mean it to his astonishment he saw that she did and he saw in her eyes at that moment something he had never seen there before he recognized the determination of the samurai woman that he had encountered years ago in his mother and aunt it was a peculiar combination of fierceness and loyalty that he thought nearly impossible for the occidental spirit to attain he was warmed by how proud of her he felt he smiled ill only be gone for a short time hopefully no more than a month ill make sure you dont have to come after me her face had turned serious its no joke nick japan is at the ends of the earth as far as im concerned that countrys terribly alien anywhere in europe i may be somewhat of a foreigner but still and all i can trace my roots back there theres at least some feeling of belonging japans as opaque as a stone it frightens me im half oriental he said lightly do i frighten you i think yes at times you used to but not so much now her arms slid around him oh nick everything would be perfect if only you werent going he held her tightly wordlessly he wanted to say that hed never let her go but that would have been a lie because in less than twentyfour hours he would do just that as he boarded the plane bound for tokyo too his eastern side and his training made him a private man inward directed the enigma of the blank wall nicholas suspected that his father the colonel had been much the same way though he had been fully occidental both father and son had secrets even from the women they loved the most in life he took a deep breath now felt the change in pressure the ozoned air so thin and dry it clung to the back of the nose the sp was banking to the left in a slow lazy arc chasing the streaking cloud layer until pale green fields striped with perfectly regimented furrows began to appear then in the distance the snowcapped crown of fujiyama majestic and immutable he was home again then they were into the heavy smog layer lying like a pall over a festive party drifting in an everwidening circle from the intensely industrialized areas of the swarming metropolis christ the stockymuscled man beside him said craning his neck for a better look i shouldve brought my goddamned gas mask a pudgy finger stabbed out at what lay beyond the perspex window theyve got an inversion layer worse than the san fernando valley his lined aggressive face was absorbed in the disappearance of the rising landscape outside he had the eyes nicholas thought of a seasoned roman general canny and weary at the same time both were a result of hardfought experience battles on two arenas the huns in front and the political infighting behind the mans hair was short cropped a gunmetal gray he was dressed in a handmade lightweight business suit of a conservative cut he was a man who over the years had become accustomed to a measured degree of luxury but the twist of his nose the thickness of the lips indicated that such had not always been the case he had not been born to money raphael tomkin millionaire industrialist for whom nicholas now worked he was the man whom saigo had been paid to kill and though nicholas had protected him defeating saigo this was the same man who nicholas was certain had ordered the death of detective lieutenant lew croaker nicholas best friend nicholas watched the profile of tomkins powerful face without seeming to american power nicholas had come to learn was often merely skin deep and for him to incise beneath that layer to the soft interior was not difficultbut tomkin was atypical of his fellow board chairmen his wa was very strong indeed proof of his inner determination and rock solidness this interested nicholas intensely because his vow to himself and to the kami of his dead friend was to gain access to the interior of this man and once having possession of that knowledge sow the seeds of his slow destruction he recalled his thoughts on learning that tomkin had ordered croakers seemingly accidental death in a car crash just outside key west croaker had been there on his own time and only nicholas also knew that he had been running down the one solid lead in the angela didion homicide she had been a highfashion model who had once been raphael tomkins mistress a modern rendering of a wellknown tactic of ieyasu tokugawa greatest of all of japans shogun whose family ruled for more than a thousand years keeping tradition alive safe from dilution from the west to come to know your enemy first you must become his friend and once you become his friend all his defenses come down then can you choose the most fitting method of his demise nicholas vow of revenge had led him despite justines fervent arguments to accept tomkins offer of employment a year ago and from the first day on the job all their energies had been directed toward this moment tomkin had been brewing this proposed merger of one of his divisions with that of one of sato petrochemicals kobun any deal with the japanese was a difficult enough task but this kind of complex merger of two highly sophisticated entities was utterly exhausting tomkin had admitted that he needed help desperately and who better than nicholas linnear halforiental born and raised in japan to render that assistance the wheels bumped briefly against the tarmac and they were down feeling the drag as the captain put the four powerful jet engines into reverse thrust now as they unstrapped and began to reach for their coats in the overhead compartment nicholas watched tomkin something had happened to him since he had first made his vow in coming to learn about raphael tomkin in gaining his trust and thus his friendship a gift the industrialist did not give often nicholas had come to see him for what he really was and it was clear that he was not the ogre that his daughters justine and gelda were convinced he was in the beginning he had sought to communicate this new aspect of tomkin to justine but these discussions inevitably ended in bitter fights and at length he gave up trying to convince her of her fathers love for her too much bad blood had gone on between them for her ever to change her mind about him she thought he was monstrous and in one way at least she was correct nicholas thought as they walked off the plane though increasingly it had become more difficult for him to believe that tomkin was capable of murder certainly no man in his position got there by turning the other cheek to his enemies or those whom he had to climb over broken careers bankruptcies the dissolutions of marriages this was the detritus that such a man as raphael tomkin must leave behind him in his wake he was smart and most assuredly ruthless he had done things that nicholas could never even have contemplated and yet these seemed a long way from ordering a death in cold blood a life snuffed out with olympian disdain his genuine love for his daughters should have precluded such a psychotic decision yet all the evidence croaker had unearthed had led directly back to raphael tomkin summoning his bodyguard and authorizing him to end angela didions life why what spark had ignited him to do such a desperate thing nicholas still did not know but he meant to find out before he meted out his revenge on this powerful and complex man perhaps this quest for knowledge would delay the time of his vengeance but that had no real meaning for him he had taken in with his mothers milk the concept of infinite patience time was as the wind to him passing unseen in a continuous stream secrets held within its web enactment inevitable but coming only at the propitious moment as musashi wrote crossing at a ford thus he had set for himself the task of first coming to understand his enemy raphael tomkin to peer into every nook and cranny of his life stripping away flesh and bone until at length the soul of the man lay revealed to him because only in understanding the why of the murder could nicholas find salvation for himself for what he himself must eventually do if he should fail to understand tomkin if he should rashly hurl himself down the narrow bloodred path of vengeance he would be no better than his enemy he could not do such a thing his cousin saigo had known just that about nicholas and using it had caused the death of nicholas friends for mad saigo had no such compunctions concerning murder he had learned how to destroy life through kanaku na ninjutsu and later through the feared kobudera but somewhere along the line the forces he was attempting to tame had taken him over using him for their own evil designs saigo had possessed the power only to become possessed by it in the end he had been too weak of spirit and it had driven him mad nicholas took a deep breath and shook his head to clear his mind of the past saigo was a year dead but he was back in japan and so the past had begun to crowd in on him like a host of kami chittering in his ear all clamoring for attention at once so many memories so many sensations cheong the colonel itami his aunt whom he knew he must eventually see and always yukio sad doomed yukio beautiful yukio stunning his adolescent mind when they had first met at the keiretsu party the first contact between them had been electric with sexual promise her warm firm thigh between his legs as they danced through the chandeliered room staring into each others eyes oblivious of the glare the young saigo leveled at them from his place at his fathers side though she be dead at saigos hands still her kami continued to haunt him though he loved justine with all his heart still his spirit danced that first dance with yukio in a kind of private glowing world where death held no dominion the mind was an awesomely powerful instrument and if the dead could ever be said to have been resurrected nicholas had brought yukio back from her watery grave with the power of his memories and now his feet were back on his native soil for the first time in over ten years it seemed like centuries closer to yukio now to all that had happened to him dance yukio im holding you tight and as long as i do nothing can come between us nothing can harm you anymore good afternoon gentlemen a young japanese woman stood bowing before them sato petrochemicals welcomes you to japan just behind her and to the left was a young japanese male in a dark business suit and wraparound sunglasses he reached out and took their bag claim checks they had just cleared customs and immigration junior will take care of your luggage her smile was sweet wont you follow me please nicholas hid his surprise at being met by a woman of course he would not tell tomkin this but it did not bode well for their coming negotiations he might find this creature charming and tomkin might not care either way but to any japanese this would constitute a serious insult the more important the emissary of the company who met you the higher your status in the eyes of that company in japan women were very far down the executive ladder indeed she took them through the congested heart of narita past scurrying tour groups their leaders brandishing stiff calligraphied banners to rally them just as generals on the ancient battlefields of japan had once done with their troops past regimented schoolchildren uniformed and gaping at all the incredibly tall gaijin stumbling bewilderedly by them around old couples with brown paper shopping bags sidestepping one brilliantly colored bridal party being seen off on their honeymoon tomkin was huffing by the time the young woman brought them out into the vapid sunshine and across to the waiting limousine she paused as she held the back door open for them i am miss yoshida mr satos administrative assistant she said please forgive the discourtesy of my not introducing myself earlier but i felt it prudent to remove all of us from that tumult most expeditiously nicholas smiled inwardly at the endearing awkwardness of her english he watched her as she bowed again returning her gesture automatically murmuring there was no discourtesy miss yoshida both mr tomkin and i appreciate your thoughtfulness in idiomatic japanese if she was at all startled by his use of her language she gave no outward sign of it her eyes were like glass set in her oval seamless face in any other country she might have made millions putting that countenance on display before the camera but not here sato petrochemicals was her second family and she owed it all the loyalty she devoted to her blood family nicholas knew what it asked of her she performed flawlessly and without question this too was tradition handed down from the time of the tokugawa shogunate wont you please take advantage of the cars comforts jesus i could use some real comfort tomkin growled as he ducked his head and entered the black gleaming limo that trips a ball breaker nicholas laughed pretending it was a mysterious gaijin jest relieving miss yoshida of her embarrassment she laughed lightly in concert with him her voice musical she wore a rather severely cut business suit of raw silk its forest green contrasting nicely with the toffeecolored blouse with its deep maroon string tie at the tiny rounded collar on one lapel she wore a discreet gold and lacquer pin emblazoned with the feudal design of sato petrochemicals on the lobes of her ears were gleaming emerald studs it must feel good to be home again linnearsan she said pronouncing it rinnearu it would not have been good manners for nicholas to have acknowledged her oblique reference she had cleverly told him that she had been briefed on his background without ever having said it outright he smiled the years have melted away he said now that i am back it seems only moments since i left miss yoshida turned her beautiful face away from him junior was emerging from the terminal loaded down with their luggage her eyes returned to his and her voice lowered became less formal for an instant there will be a car for your use she said should you desire to light joss sticks nicholas struggled to hide his surprise he now knew the extent of the briefing miss yoshida had been given on him not only had she said that sato would provide transportation for him if he chose to visit his parents graves but also that he would want to light joss sticks on his mothers stone it was not widely known that cheong had been at least half chinese joss stick was a peculiarly chinese term though the japanese being also buddhist lit incense at the graves of family and friends miss yoshidas eyes lowered i know i have no right to offer but if it will be easier for you to be accompanied on such a journey i would make myself available that is terribly kind nicholas said watching junior approach out of the corner of his eye but i could not ask such an enormous inconvenience of you it is no bother she said i have a husband and a child buried not far away i would go in any case her eyes met his but he could not say whether she was telling the truth or simply employing a japanese lie in order to make him feel more comfortable with her offer in either case he determined he would take her up on it when a lull in the negotiations permitted it i would be honored miss yoshida inside the car as junior hurled them into the stifling traffic on the outskirts of the city tomkin leaned forward staring out the graytinted windows at the growing expanse of the steel and glass forest rising from the borders of the farmers green fields jesus he said its just like new york when the hellre they gonna stop building i come twelve thousand miles and i feel like i never left home he sat back with a sudden lurch a smirk on his face except of course that you and ire the tallest creatures for a thousand miles eh nick nicholas gave his employer the semblance of a nod and in the same motion said to miss yoshida in the front of the car gaijin are often rude without meaning to be eh he shrugged his shoulders what else can you expect from illbred children miss yoshida covered her bowlike lips with the palm of her hand but her mirth was obvious in her sparkling eyes what the hellre you two chattering about tomkin growled feeling left out just informing the natives that it isnt only height thats outsized on foreign devils nicholas lied but hed struck the right chord hah tomkin guffawed youre damn straight very good nicky just over an hour later the three of them stepped off the high speed elevator at the summit on the triangular shinjuku suiryu building all of tokyo lay shimmering like a dusky multifaceted jewel beneath them suspended six hundred and sixty feet fiftytwo stories in the air nicholas was amazed at the profusion of ultramodern skyscrapers that had sprung up in his absence they shot from the bedrock pavement like a mandarins glittering fingernails lifting the shinjuku district of downtown tokyo into the dome of the heavens tomkin grimaced as he stopped them and pulling nicholas close beside him whispered coming here always reminds me of cod liver oil when i was a kid my father insisted i take two spoonfuls every morning he kept telling me it was for my own good just like he did when he beat me if he found me dumping the stuff down the toilet then id have to gag on that vile stuff anyway he grunted heavily huh you can eat your raw fish with these barbarians nick ive still got the taste of cod liver oil in my mouth miss yoshida led them through a set of woodpaneled doors the oversized knobs carved into the sato crest down a corridor softly lit by indirect lighting edo period ukiyoe prints by hiroshige the master of rain hokusai the master of the countryside and kuniyoshi the master of japanese myth hung on the walls a dove gray carpet was beneath their feet acting as a damper for the bustle of work going on all around them drifting out from a multitude of office doorways teletypes chattered softly and in another section a battery of electronic typewriters were going full speed miss yoshida stopped them before another set of doors these were of thick slabs of ash burl fitted together with wide wooden pegs in the traditional japanese manner the handles were of roughly worked black wrought iron reminding nicholas of the riakon the inns of the countryside he had stayed in mr sato knew you would have a strenuous trip miss yoshida said such a journey is fatiguing even to the strongest of constitutions that is why junior has gone on to the okura with your luggage he will see to your rooms her arm raised her hand held palm upward it was a simple gesture yet elegant for all that here you may relax without concern or worry now her cherry blossom lips pursed in a smile if you will be so kind as to follow me tomkins angry voice checked her what the hells going on here his eyes were belligerent i didnt come halfway round the world to scorch my flesh in some sitz bath while the big man goes about his business he tapped his black crocodile attachй case ive got a merger to consummate he snorted this other stuff can wait as far as im concerned miss yoshidas face showed nothing of what she must be feeling the smile was still on her face and to her credit it had not frozen there mr tomkin she began let me assure you that sato tomkins strident voice overrode her quiet controlled tones i want to see sato now he cant keep me cooling my heels like some goddamned functionary raphael tomkin waits for no one i assure you mr tomkin no disrespect is intended miss yoshida pressed on struggling to contend with this irrational outburst my task is to serve you to help you relax to put your mind into the proper frame of i dont need you or anyone else to tell me what my frame of mind is tomkin thundered taking a step toward her now you get sato in here or nicholas stepped forward coming between them he could see that despite herself miss yoshidas face had gone ashen beneath the artful cosmetics her hands were shaking what dyou think youre doing nick nicholas ignored tomkin using his own powerful frame to move his employer back at the same time he composed his face smiling easily projecting his own relaxation in order to shortcircuit the womans obvious alarm please excuse the gaijin he said in japanese not wanting to use tomkins name hes had a long uncomfortable trip he lowered his voice and went on keeping the pressure on tomkin as he did so the truth is miss yoshida his piles are bothering him and hes like a dog whos sat on a warrior anthill he snaps at anyone and everyone he grinned and he hasnt the sense to be cordial to so dutiful a blossom but in his pain seeks out to blindly crush the beauty before him miss yoshida gave tomkin a wary look before she bowed thanking nicholas satosan will be with you shortly she said his wish is only for your comfort and ease before the rigors of negotiations begin understand completely yoshidasan nicholas said kindly it is most thoughtful of satosan to be concerned with our total wellbeing please be so kind as to extend our compliments to him he bumped his muscular shoulder against tomkins struggling form and as for the gaijin leave him to me miss yoshida bowed again relief flooding her face this time she made no attempt to mask her feelings thank you linnearsan i cannot think what satosan would say to me if he knew i had not performed as he had anticipated half running she squeezed by them both and hurried back down the corridor tomkin felt a lessening of the awesome pressure brought to bear on him and broke away his face flushed he raised a sausagelike finger you owe me an explanation nick and it goddamned well better be a good one or shut up it was not said particularly loudly but some hidden tone seemed to strike tomkins nervous system his mouth snapped shut youve done enough damage to us already nicholas said struggling as miss yoshida had to keep his emotions under control damage what are you you lost us incalculable face with that woman well both count ourselves lucky if she hasnt gone straight to sato with the affront the last was a lie miss yoshida was so frightened of offending the guests shed do no such thing but tomkin would never know that and some fear was good for him right now nicholas pushed by him he found himself in a rather small dimly lighted room with a cedar slatboarded floor along one wall was a row of spacious metal lockers he went over to one and opened it inside he found not only a terrycloth robe but comb and brush an entire array of toiletry items off to the right an open archway led into a mirrored bathroom with sinks urinals and a row of toilet stalls nicholas could hear the muffled sounds of water dripping as if within the walls to the left of the row of lockers was a plain wooden door the baths he surmised must be beyond the air was moist and warm decidedly inviting he began to disrobe tomkin came in behind him he stood rigidly in the middle of the room glaring at him willing nicholas to face him nicholas went methodically on with what he was doing his long lean muscles rippling consciously letting tomkin steam after a time tomkin said listen you bastard dont you ever do that to me again his voice was thick with pentup fury are you listening to me he said finally get your clothes off nicholas folded his trousers hung them over the metal hanger he was naked now stripped of the layers that civilization dictated he must wear it was clear he possessed an innate animal quality that was almost frightening justine had felt it the first moment she had seen him moving naked across the room like a wraith a dancer a nocturnal predator even when he made so mundane a move as putting one foot in front of the other he used his body as an instrument achieving a confluence of grace and power answer me civilly dammit tomkins voice had risen a function of not only his anger but his abrupt fear of the man standing in front of him he was nonplussed in his world of corporate business nakedness was a state of vulnerability yet looking at nicholas linnear now tomkin felt only his own vulnerability so acutely that he was aware of the thunder of his heart pumping his accelerated pulse nicholas turned to face tomkin you hired me for a specific purpose kindly allow me to do my job without interference there was no anger in his voice now he had that under control your job is not to insult me tomkin said in a more normal tone of voice as he struggled to control his runaway pulse youre in japan now nicholas said simply im here to help you stop thinking like a westerner you mean loss of face again tomkin snorted and hooked a spatulate thumb at the closed door that was just a girl what the fuck do i care what she thinks of me she is in fact seiichi satos personal representative nicholas said in a calming tone that makes her important this lie was essential now to keep tomkin under control if he should even suspect the slight that had been dealt them there would be no stopping him as such here she is part of sato himself and therefore no less important you mean i should bow and scrape to her after sato didnt even have the courtesy to meet us himself you have been over here many times nicholas said evenly it astonishes me that you have learned nothing at all about japanese customs he gestured this treatment is accorded to only the highest dignitaries do you have any idea what this setup the japanese bath must cost with space at such a high premium in tokyo nicholas sighed stop thinking with your western ego and try a little acceptance that will go a long way here he reached into his locker brought out a fluffy white towel embroidered with a dark blue triple wheel the emblem of sato petrochemicals tomkin was silent for a moment then abruptly he grunted and began to undress it was as close to an apology as he was going to come when he too was naked he drew out his towel and the key to the locker dont use it nicholas said why not they stared at each other for a moment then tomkin nodded loss of face right nicholas smiled opening the wooden door beside the bank of lockers come on he said they stepped into a chamber perhaps twenty feet square the floor was the same cedar slats but here the walls were of gleaming blue tile the ceiling of smaller tile was a mosaic whose center was the interlocking wheel pattern of the companys logo the room was taken up by two enormous bathtubs both now filled with steaming water two young women stood in attendance without hesitation nicholas stepped in front of them allowing them to pour scalding water over him then begin rubbing him down with soapy sponges after a moment spent taking this in tomkin followed him this i understand he said allowing the woman to wash him first get clean then let the heat relax you they were rinsed off carefully shampoo provided for them then dripping their flesh steaming walked to one of the steaming tubs here the water was even hotter making tomkin cringe they discovered niches within the walls of the tub so that they could sit with just their heads out of the water tomkins face was red beads of sweat rolling freely down his cheeks he found that if he moved it made the heat intolerable nicholas eyes were closed his body relaxed there was no sound save the soft hypnotic lapping of the wavelets their own bodies created in languid movements within the bath the tiled walls were stippled with moisture tomkin put his head back against the wood stared up at the sato triple wheel when i was a kid he said i remember i hated to take a bath i dont know why didnt think it was manly or something there was a fag kid in school always smelled like hed come from the bath jesus i hated him beat his brains out one day after class his chest moved up and down slowly with his breath i thought you know that itd make me some kind of hero with the other kids but it didnt his voice lapsed for a moment before resuming the drip of the water was like a metronome i remember my father coming after me throwing me into the tub scrubbing me with that kind of powdered cleanser ajax or something it hurt like hell i can tell you cry he said i can just hear his voice itll do you a world of good he said tomorrow youll take a bath on your own so i wont have to clean you this way again yes tomkin nodded my father certainly taught me the wisdom of keeping clean he closed his eyes for a moment as if picturing the scene all over again nicholas looked at him and thought of his dead friend lew croaker had been so certain that tomkin had had angela didion murdered that obsession had a peculiarly japanese flavor to it because it sprang from croakers blind obedience to the dictates of the law nick his friend had once told him i dont give a rats ass what angela didion did or what her rep was she was a human being just like all us slobs what im doing well i figure its something she deserves if she cant get justice then no one at all deserves it what croaker termed justice nicholas knew as honor croaker knew where his duty lay and he had died in that pursuit it was a samurais death nicholas knew that very well but it somehow did not ease the sadness that welled up in him in odd quiet moments or erase the emptiness he felt inside him as if a vital part of him had been abruptly severed nick you and craig allonge get along well tomkin was speaking of the companys chief financial operations officer you know that rely on him a great deal besides me he knows more about the real running of tomkin industries than anyone hes close to its heart if tomkin was trying to make a point he did not finish instead he seemed to veer onto a tangent craigs going through a particularly hard time now hes moved out of his house he and his wife arent quite seeing eye to eye since she told him about her lover tomkin moved involuntarily and sucked in his breath with the searing heat its a helluva situation craig told me he wanted to move into a hotel in town but i wouldnt hear of it hes staying with me until he decides what to do i told him id help him with the divorce if thats what he wanted ill also pay for a counselor if he thinks theres any chance of a reconciliation he closed his eyes but more important for the moment he needs a real friend im his boss i cant be his friend too not in this way you like him and i know he thinks the world of you and you know the real meaning of friendship nicholas settled back in the scalding water thinking westerners are so unpredictable they bluster one minute insensitively ignoring civilized courtesies then the next show an inordinate amount of insight and caring ill do what i can as soon as we get back he said at length tomkin turned his head toward nicholas and when he spoke his voice had unaccountably softened nicky he said are you going to marry my daughter nicholas halfdreaming nevertheless heard the touch of desperation in the other mans voice and wondered at it yes he said immediately of course as soon as we get back to the states youve discussed it with justine he smiled you mean have i proposed yes he heard tomkin exhale deeply and opened his eyes looked at the other man we have your blessing tomkins face darkened and he gave a harsh bark that nicholas recognized as an anguished laugh oh yes for all the good it might do you but dont tell justine christ she might decide not to marry you just to spite me i think those days are over oh youre wrong about that nothing will ever be right between me and my daughters again theres too much bitterness on their part too much resentment of the way they think ive interfered in their lives rightly or wrongly im not even sure i know which now time to break the mood nicholas thought and he clambered slowly out of the tub tomkin followed and they went through another door into a steam room they sat on hexagonal tiles while the long vertical pipe coughed and belched pockets of water that ran down gurgling into the drain then with a great gout of sound the steam began to shout from the open end of the pipe and talk became impossible precisely five minutes after they entered a warning bell rang they could no longer see one another though they sat fairly close together periodically the pipe running along the tiled wall to their left screamed like a banshee delivering forth a new cloud of steam which wrapped itself around their shoulders with a new wave of heat nicholas touched tomkin on his beefy shoulder and they went out through the second door set into the far wall they were in a fairly large dimly lighted room that smelled faintly of birch and mentholated camphor four long padded tables were aligned along the periphery of the room two tables were occupied by dark lumps that they soon could make out as bodies a young woman stood by each table gentlemen a male figure sat up on the table to their right he bowed slightly i trust you are more relaxed than when you entered our doorway sato tomkin said it took you but feeling the pressure of nicholas hand on his arm he changed in midsentence thiss a helluva way to greet us the okura couldntve done as well oh no we cannot come up to that standard but seiichi sato nodded his head in acknowledgement of the compliment linnearsan he said turning slightly it is an honor to meet you at last i have heard much about you he swung his legs around lay back down tell me are you pleased to be back home my home is now america satosan nicholas said carefully much has changed in japan since i left but i trust there is more that has remained the same you missed your calling linnearsan sato said you should have been a politician nicholas wondered who was lying on the table against the far wall lie down please gentlemen sato said you have not yet completed your course in relaxation they did as he bade and immediately two more young women emerged from the semidarkness nicholas felt the splash and roll of oil then skilled hands kneading his muscles perhaps you are already wondering why these girls are not japanese linnearsan jo not think i am not nationalistic however i am a realist as well these girls are from taiwan he chuckled theyre blind linnearsan could you tell that the prevailing explanation is that their affliction allows them a more sensitive sense of touch i am inclined to agree ever since my first trip to taiwan in i have dreamed of bringing taiwan masseuses here to japan what do you think linnearsan superb nicholas grunted the girl was turning his rocklike muscles to butter beneath her talented fingers and palms he breathed deeply into the expansion experiencing an almost dizzying sense of exhilaration i was obliged to remain in taiwan for ten days while we juryrigged a deal that was falling through i assure both you gentlemen that the only worthwhile features of that country are its cuisine and its extraordinary blind masseuses for a time then there was only the soft somnolent slap of flesh against flesh the sharp camphor smell of the liniment that somehow increased the overall sense of drowsiness nicholas mind returned to the mysterious fourth man he was well acquainted with the convoluted byways of japanese business structure so different and alien to westerners he knew that despite the fact sato was this keiretsus enterprise groups president still there were many layers many men in power and there were those in the highest reaches of power in japan who the outsider and even most japanese never saw or knew about was this one of those men if so nicholas had to believe tomkins admonition of extreme care on the long trip across the pacific this deal with sato petrochemicals is potentially the biggest ive ever put together nick he had said the merging of my sphynx silicon division and satos nippon memory chip kobun is going to bring untold profits over the next twenty years to tomkin industries you know american manufacturers theyre so goddamned slow on the uptake thats why i decided to start up sphynx two and a half years ago i got fed up with relying on these bastards i was always three to six months behind schedule because of them and by the time i got their shipment the japs had already come out with something better like everything else theyve been taking our basic designs and making the product better and at a far lower price they did it to the germans with thirtyfivemillimeter cameras they did it to us and the europeans with cars now theyre gonna do it to us again with computer chips unless we get off our asses you better than anyone nick know how goddamned hard it is for a foreign company to get a toehold in japan but now ive got something they want want badly enough to allow me fiftyone percent interest in my own company thats unheard of over there i mean they took ibm to the cleaners when they opened up in tokyo nicholas recalled the incident well japans allpowerful ministry of international trade and industry known more colloquially as miti had sprung up after world war ii to essentially help guide japans economy back onto sound footing in the s mitis chief minister shigeru sahashi became the samurai bent on discouraging what he saw as a massive invasion of american capital into japan he also saw the enormous potential worldwide market coming for computers japan had no computer technology whatsoever at the time sahashi used ibms desire to open up japan for its trade to effectively create a national computer industry miti already had set policies severely limiting the involvement of foreign companies in japans economy the ministry was so powerful that in effect it could exclude all foreign participation without its consent sahashi allowed the formation of ibmjapan but as soon as the fledgling company was set up he set about showing them what they had stepped into ibm of course held all the basic patents that japan required to begin its own homegrown industry in a now historic meeting with ibmjapan sahashi told them we will take every measure possible to obstruct the success of your business unless you license ibm patents to japanese firms and charge them no more than a fivepercent royalty when the understandably appalled ibm officers indignantly accused the japanese through him of having an inflated inferiority complex sahashi said we do not have an inferiority complex toward you we only need time and money to compete effectively stunned the americans were faced with the difficult choice of having to withdraw ibm completely from a major part of its planned worldwide expansion or capitulating to mitis total domination they chose to submit and for years afterward sahashi would proudly recount the details of his triumphant negotiations i learned from that fiasco tomkins voice had brought nicholas back im not so greedy that ill put one foot in the trap before i know what the hells going on im going to use the japs not the other way around i wont spend dollar one on a japanese company until the deals set ive got the patented advance but theres no way i can manufacture this newtype chip in america without the costs making sales prohibitive sato can give me that he controls japans sixth largest konzern he can manufacture this thing cheaply enough to make this venture profitable in a big way he laughed and i do mean big nick believe it or not were looking at a net profit of a hundred million dollars within two years his eyes were on fire you heard me right one hundred million nicholas might have been sleeping when the hands lifted from his muscles he felt better than he had in years he heard muffled movement in the room and then satos commanding voice now we shower and dress for business in fifteen minutes miss yoshida will fetch you he stood up a thick black shadow nicholas twisted his head to try to get a good look at him but all he could discern was that sato was not tall by american standards behind him the specter of the fourth man stirred and got to his feet nicholas shifted his gaze but satos bulk was between him and the mysterious stranger very little business the japanese industrialist was saying now of course you must still be fatigued by your journey and it is after all late in the day but still he bowed formally to them both it is monday and the preliminaries cannot wait do you agree tomkinsan lets get on with it by all means even though he was closer to nicholas tomkins voice sounded odd and muffled excellent sato said shortly his bullet head nodded until then when they were alone nicholas sat up the towel draped across his loins youve been very quiet he said into the gloom in the brief pause the girls shuffled away rustling like reeds in the wind tomkin slid off the table just getting a feel for the territory he wrapped himself in his large towel sato seemed busy talking to you i let him whats it to me right i was thinking about who was with him any ideas nicholas said as they walked through into the shower room tomkin shook his head you know jap industry god alone knows how they run things here and it wouldnt surprise me to learn that even he gets confused once in a while tomkin shrugged his beefy shoulders whoever he was hes a big one to be allowed into satos inner sanctum like that seiichi satos office was almost entirely western in aspect comfortable sofas and chairs grouped around a low black lacquer coffee table with the ubiquitous sato logo etched into its center and farther away toward the sheets of window looking out or tokyo a large rosewood and brass desk low cabinets all atop deep pile champagne colored carpet woodblock prints were on the walls all nicholas saw from twentiethcentury artists yet as he accompanied tomkin across the expanse of carpet nicholas noticed a halfopen door beyond which he saw a tokonoma a traditional niche into which was placed fresh flowers every day in a small simple arrangement above it on the wall was an old scroll with some of its original gilt powder still on it nicholas could not read the inscription as the angle was too acute but he knew it would be a zen saying written by an ancient master seiichi sato came around from behind his desk in quick confident strides he was as nicholas had gathered a rather short man though not overly so through his ralph lauren suit nicholas could make out the great bulge of muscles across his shoulders and upper arms like a mantle of iron and he thought the man works out religiously he searched satos face pockmarked and rather angular with slab cheeks that rose high into his eye sockets and a wide sleek forehead topped by coarse brushcut hair there was nothing subtle about the mans physiognomy nor was he a particularly handsome individual but what his face lacked in beauty and subtlety it more than made up for by the sheer force of its inner drive and strength of will his spirit was enormously powerful smiling sato held his hand out to each of them in a very american form of greeting behind his great looming shoulder nicholas was amazed to see the summit of fujiyama he knew on clearer days it was visible from the top of the new international trade center building at hamamatsucho station where the monorail leaves for haneda but here in the heart of shinjuku fantastic come sato said gesturing the sofa offers more comfort for the weary traveler when they were seated sato made a small noise in the back of his throat no more than if he were clearing the passage but immediately a figure appeared through the halfopen door to the tokonoma the man was fairly tall and rail thin he had about him the air of the sea changeless and formidable he could have been ten years older than sato in his sixties but that was difficult to judge his hair was graying and wispy almost frondlike he wore a neat immaculately clipped mustache that was yellowed by smoke tar along its lower rim he came across to them in jerky almost somnambulent strides as if he did not quite have total control of all his muscles as he came close nicholas saw that something had been done to his right eye for the lid was permanently locked in a semiopen position and the gleaming orb within though his own and not a piece of glass was clouded and milky like a damaged agate allow me to introduce mr tanzan nangi the oneeyed man bowed formally and nicholas returned it he was dressed in a charcoal gray suit with a faint pinstripe brilliantly white shirt and a plain gray tie nicholas recognized him immediately as one of the old school conservative and wary of any foreign businessman perhaps not unlike sahashi of miti nangisan is chairman of the daimyo development bank that was all sato had to say both nicholas and tomkin knew that almost all multimanufacturing keiretsu in japan were ultimately owned by one bank or another because that was where all the money resided it was quite logical the daimyo development bank owned sato petrochemical miss yoshida brought in a tray laden with a steaming porcelain pot and four delicate cups carefully she knelt beside one end of the coffee table and using a reed whisk slowly prepared the green tea nicholas watched her noting the competence the strength held tightly in check the grace of the fingers as they handled the implements when all of the men had been served she rose and silently left at no time had she looked directly at anyone nicholas felt nangis hard stare and knew he was being sized up he had no doubt that the bureaucrat knew all about him he would never come to a meeting such as this without being properly briefed and nicholas also knew that if he was indeed as conservative as he appeared outwardly he would hold no love for one such as nicholas linnear halforiental halfenglish in nangis eyes he would be below the status of gaijin together as was traditional they lifted their small cups brought the pale green froth to their lips drank contentedly with amusement nicholas saw tomkin wince slightly at the intensely bitter taste now tomkin said abruptly setting his cup down and hunching forward as if he were a football lineman ready to leap across the line of scrimmage at the sound of the snap lets get down to business nangi who held his upper torso as stiffly as he used his legs carefully extracted a filigreed platinum case from his inside breast pocket and opening it extracted a cigarette with a pair of thin pincerlike fingers just as carefully he clicked a matching lighter and inhaled deeply smoke hissed from his wide nostrils as he turned his head softlee softlee catchee monkey he said the words as if they had the bitterest taste on his tongue isnt that how the british often put it out here in the far east mr linnear inwardly appalled nicholas nevertheless held his anger in check there was nothing but the hint of a benign smile on his lips as he said i believe some of the old colonials may have used that phrase borrowed from the chinese corrupted nangi corrected nicholas nodded his acquiescence it was quite true that was a long time ago nangisan he continued times have changed and brought with them modern more enlightened values indeed nangi puffed away apparently annoyed that he had no ready rejoinder to that sato stepped in to guide the conversation away from the friction mr tomkin you and mr linnear are only just arrived here mr greydon your legal counsel is not due until tomorrow morning shall we then limit ourselves to agreeing to the outlines of the merger there is time enough for details i the percentage split afforded nippon memory in this country is totally unacceptable nangi broke in he ground out the stump of his cigarette began almost immediately on another one its a case of attempted robbery pure and simple considering the revolutionary nature of the new chip sphynx is bringing to this merger nicholas said before tomkin could open his mouth i hardly think a fiftyonefortynine split is a high price to pay think of the enor i am a banker mr linnear nangis clipped voice was as cold as his blinkless stare though our keiretsu owns many different kinds of konzerns including trust and insurance companies trade and real estate associations as well as the sato petrochemical group they are all linked by two factors he puffed casually at his cigarette certain he had once again regained control of the conversation one they are all dependent on the money the daimyo development bank makes for them two they are all based on profitability when that goes so too do they and profitability is precisely what this merger is offering you nangisan it affords us no ready capital and i know nothing of computer chips nangi said shortly as if dismissing the subject to understand the tremendous importance of what we have nicholas said evenly its essential to get an overview the computer memory chip is a tiny slice of silicon that for want of more accurate terminology is composed of microscopic bins within which are stored bits of information for instance the most common chip a k ram is composed of sixtyfour thousand bins in a space about the same size as your fingertip nangi crossed his legs at the knee and continued to smoke as if he were at a social tea he said nothing and nicholas went on ram stands for random access memory these chips are most often used because they are very fast and when a computer is at work speed is essential the problem with rams is that when power is cut off to them they lose all their memory and they have to be reprogrammed from scratch thats why roms were invented these are readonly memory chips which are totally nonvolatile that means their bins are either filled or empty permanently that of course is their drawback they must be taken out of the computer in order to be reprogrammed for years the computer technicians dream has been for a nonvolatile ram a speedy readily reprogrammable chip that wont lose its memory when the power is turned off nicholas looked at everyone before he went on no one seemed bored recently the industry has come up with a partial solution to the problem esquared proms or electrically erasable programmable readonly memory chips the problem with them is that theyre just too slow to replace rams in the heart of a computer xicor one of our competitors has even gone one step further theyre beginning to combine a ram with an esquared prom to allow the ram to do all the fast calculations then to transfer its memory to the esquared prom just before the power is cut but they are unwieldy expensive and still cannot do a full range of functions further disk or tape datastorage systems mechanical switches or just rams with battery backups can still do much of what this tandem chip can do nicholas put his hands together and concentrated on the banker in other words nangisan the elusive nonvolatile ram which will change the face of the computer industry for all time was still not available until now his eyes lit up sphynx has it satosans own people have validated the test data there can be no doubt we have it and we are offering it to you on an exclusive basis nicholas shrugged his shoulders resignedly naturally such a monumental discovery cannot remain exclusive for long imitations will surely come but in the meantime sphynxsato will have the head start that is essential to cornering the market our production plants will already be in full swing filling orders while the other konzerns are still scrambling to work out the electronics there is your profitability base tomkin said within two years we should be looking at a combined net profit of one hundred and fifty million dollars thats thirtysix billion six hundred and sixty million yen nangi said he stubbed out his butt with the formality of an aloof professor confronted by a group of vociferous but inferior pupils do not attempt to teach me about money mr tomkin but this is all in the future and these are your figures not ours their astronomical nature is problematical tomkin apparently had had enough now look sato he said pointedly ignoring the banker i came here in good faith thinking we had a deal to iron out i am prepared for problems along the way thats part of all business ventures he gestured but not this nonsense im hearing talk here like im in the middle of a miti meeting nangisan was viceminister of miti sato said with a kind of wolfish smile until seven years ago when as a ronin he helped found daimyo and quite directly of course sato petrochemicals im not surprised tomkin said furious but you can tell him for me that this isnt a case of the foreign devil trying to undermine japans economic balance eachve uss got something the other wants and needs ive got the goods and youve got the wherewithall to manufacture it at the right price its profits for all he abruptly switched his gaze to the bankers odd masklike face get it nangisan i understand quite well nangi said that you come here wanting a good sized piece of our keiretsus property in misawa land we have already designated for niwa mineral minings new expansion land is at a premium here the expense unimaginable for such as you who sprawl like hedonists in your multiacre estates with pools and stables and gatehouses it is what you ask us to give up it is what you always expect us to give up his eyes were glittery as hard as obsidian and for what the technology of the future but i ask you directly will this new technology ease the enormous land problem here will it make japan more independent of the fuelrich nations who seek to bleed us dry will it free us from our heinous obligation to the united states to be its guardpost against the encroachment of communism in the far east he rose up even straighter an adder about to strike times have indeed changed as you yourself pointed out we are no longer your vanquished foe subject to the blind acceptance of your demands listen to this tomkin said im bringing you the key to millions and youre preaching reactionary politics at me his stubby forefinger pointed at his own chest im nonpolitical see im a businessman thats the beginning and the end of it right there you wanna pull this i gotta think about going elsewhere like to mitsubishi or toshiba for instance what you must try to understand sato said calmly is that historically its a difficult position for us to be in japan has not nearly the space and er elbow room attendant with what the united states has there is therefore quite a different attitude toward foreign companies who want a slice of the japanese pie but thats just it tomkin said angrily im not interested in japan last year the big three us supercomputer companies sold only two mainframes to japan out of a total output of sixtyfive its the world market im thinking of and so should you youre so busy erecting what you call safeguards to your business that youve all got a severe case of tunnel vision these socalled safeguards are nothing more than barriers to international trade he was just beginning to hit his stride now i think its high time japan came out of its global infancy and owned up to its responsibilities as a nation of the world nangi appeared unruffled if as you say these safeguards were precipitously withdrawn the effect on the japanese economy would be disastrous but beyond that the overall effect on american imports into this country would increase byno more than uhm eight hundred million dollars even you mr tomkin can see that would hardly be a drop in the bucket in solving your countrys massive trade deficit i think you guysd better wise up tomkin said his face beginning to flush around the jowls your reactionary insular trade policiesre beginning to isolate you from the rest of the world community youre much too dependent on foreign energy sources to allow that stop flooding our market with your products while hindering our own from sale here or youre likely to become prosperous orphans in the international arena why must the japanese be constantly castigated nangi said for manufacturing superior products we have no armhold on your american public no one has made them buy our products the simple and for you sad fact is we make things better and more cheaply americans trust our knowhow more than they do the advances of their own companies but tomkin was far from finished right now he said softly sato petrochemicals is not one of the six major japanese computer firms it is my understanding that you are looking for an entree into that charmed circle sphynxs nonvolatile ram is your key my sources tell me that miti has ordered a project meant for completion by a machine capable of performing ten billion operations a second which would make it a hundred times faster than the stateoftheart supercomputer cray research currently has on the market miti has allocated up to two hundred million dollars a year for the project he paused neither of the japanese had made a move and tomkin knew he had scored with them further he said we know of another ministryfinanced project to build a supercomputer capable of understanding human speech making it incredibly easy to use he laced his fingers together now lets get down to the bottom line which is that our nonvolatile ram would give sato the edge in both projects miti would be forced to come to you for help and that would mean the big six over here would become the big seven he looked from one foreign face to another one bleak forbidding countenance to the next theyre just businessmen he told himself nothing more nangi said nothing which in tomkins opinion was a giant step forward proposals and counterproposals must not be made in haste sato said the war is often lost through the impulsiveness of an intemperate nature as sun tzu so wisely tells us when the strike of a hawk breaks the body of its prey it is because of timing he stood up and bowed as nicholas and tomkin rose automatically nangi rose awkwardly stood swaying slightly at tomorrow afternoons meeting sato continued we will discuss this further when associates and legal counsel are all present to add their wisdom to our own for now i would hope you will find time to enjoy our city they murmured their assent and he said good my car will be at the okura at two pm tomorrow to bring you here he bowed again formally and nangi did the same until tomorrow gentlemen i wish you a restful evening then he took nangi out of the room before another word could be spoken that goddamned sonuvabitch nangi tomkin paced his hotel room why didnt my people brief me about him back and forth while nicholas watched that bombshell he laid on us about having been a miti viceminister christ do you think hell actually block the merger nicholas ignored tomkins agitated state tomkin answered his own question i know hes for sure gonna try to sweeten their percentage nicholas had picked up a large square buff envelope off the writing desk he flicked its stiff corner with a fingernail stop playing and tell me what you think goddamn it nicholas looked up patience tomkin he said softly i told you in the beginning that pulling this merger off would require patience perhaps more patience than you have bullshit tomkin came over to where nicholas was standing his eyes narrowed you saying theyre outmaneuvering me nicholas nodded trying to at least the japanese are never open about negotiation they wont come to terms until the very last instant because theyre looking to see what will happen in the interim nine out of ten times they feel something will occur to their benefit so until then theyll do their best to keep us off balance you mean like nangi tomkin said thoughtfully put a fox in the henhouse and see what evolves nicholas nodded again quite right perhaps they reasoned the friction would bring out your real anxiety in making the deal and they could negotiate better terms tomorrow or monday he tapped the envelope against his finger the japanese knew that you never come to a negotiation showing your true nature to deal effectively with you they must find this out its called to move the shade its from the warrior miyamoto musashis guide to strategy he wrote it in but all good japanese businessmen apply his principles to their business practices to move the shade tomkin said thoughtfully what is it when you cannot see your opponents true spirit you make a quick decisive feint attack as musashi writes he will then show his long sword today we can transform that into meaning his negotiation spirit thinking he has seen your spirit but you have shown him nothing of value and he has instead revealed his inner strategy to you and thats just what happened a few minutes ago with sato and nangi nicholas shrugged that depends on how much they actually drew you out tomkin touched the tips of his fingers to his temple well it doesnt matter worth a damn he said a little breathily i have you nick and between us were gonna squeeze these bastards into the box i have waiting for them musashis strategy or not like the disparity in profit figures nicholas said sardonically you told me sphynxs share would come to a hundred million but the figures you gave sato indicate that sphynx and the sato kobun will be splitting a hundred and fifty million between them ah whats fifty mil more or less tomkin said massaging his temple with some force he grimaced goddamn migraines he looked at nicholas wearily my doctor says its purely a product of the world i live in he made a rueful smile you know what he prescribed a permanent palm springs vacation he wants me to rot by the side of a pool like the rest of those flyblown palms he winced at the pain but he ought to know all right hes writing a book called fifteen ways to a migrainefree life he thinks its going to be a bestseller everyone gets migraines these days he says god bless stress tomkin went and sat down on the edge of the plush sofa he opened the small refrigerator just beyond poured himself a drink whatve you got there its a handdelivered invitation i got one as well tomkin put down his drink lets see it he tore open the flap pulled out a stiff engraved card its in goddamned kanji he said angrily pushing it back at nicholas whats it say you and i it seems are invited to satos wedding its on saturday tomkin grunted downed the remainder of his drink in one gulp christ he murmured just what we need now he looked up as he poured himself another how about you nicholas shook his head and tomkin shrugged just trying to get your liver in shape these sonsabitches drink their suntory scotch like it was water you go out with them of an evening youd better be prepared for the onslaught i wouldnt worry about that nicholas said coldly im well aware of their habits sure sure tomkin said just trying to be friendly you did all right on the battlefield with those two jokers he gestured with his glass you speak to justine yet nicholas shook his head she didnt want me to take this trip at all well thats only natural im sure shes missing you nicholas watched tomkin wade through his second scotch on the rocks and wondered if that was an antidote to his migraines its more than that he said slowly when saigo got to her he used saiminjutsu on her a littleknown art even among ninja a kind of hypnosis wasnt it in a way in western terms but it went way beyond that he sat down next to tomkin she tried to kill me it was the hypnotic suggestion saigo planted within her but still he shook his head my healing broke the saiminjutsu spell but the deep remorse she feels i was not able to erase she blames herself but its not her fault how many times have i assured her of that tomkin swirled the dregs of his drink around and around shes a tough one take it from me i know shell get over it nicholas was thinking of how badly justine had taken his decision to work for her father her bitterness toward what she saw as her fathers manipulation of her life up until just several years ago was understandable to him they were he felt two people unable to communicate with each other tomkin had expected certain things from her and not finding them had reacted in his typical overbearing manner justine simply could not forgive him for his various intrusions into her life repeatedly he had used bribes or threats to discourage a succession of boyfriends my fathers a master manipulator nick she had told him over and over again hes a bastard without a heart or a conscience hes never cared about anyone but himself not me certainly not gelda not even my mother yet nicholas knew justine was blind to the kind of men she had been attracted to they had been manipulators all far worse than her father ever had been no wonder tomkin had been so hostile toward him when they had first met he naturally assumed that nicholas was another in the long line bent on using his daughter it was impossible to make justine see that it was his very love for her that obliged him to interfere in an area that up until now she had been unable to handle this did not absolve tomkin but it seemed a realistic starting point for the two of them to come together and possibly understand each other the tirade that had followed nicholas announcement of his going to work for tomkin industries if only temporarily had been followed by days of uncomfortable silence justine had simply not wanted to talk about it further but in the last days before his departure it had seemed to nicholas as if she had relented a bit and was more at ease with his decision after all she had said as she saw him off its only for a while isnt it what he said now setting his concern for her back in its niche in the shadows of his mind i asked who satos marrying tomkin said nicholas looked down at the invitation a woman named akiko ofuda do you know anything about her tomkin shook his head shes the newest major interest in your partners life nicholas said seriously i think its time you thought about hiring a new team of researchers with great difficulty tanzan nangi turned fully around at his back the snowclad slopes of fujiyama were fast disappearing into a vast golden haze the consistency of bisque tokyo buzzed at his feet like a giant pachinko machine i dont like him he said his voice like chalk scraping a blackboard tomkin nangi arched an eyebrow as he extracted a cigarette from its case you know very well whom i mean sato gave him a benevolent smile of course you dont my friend isnt that why you assigned miss yoshida a woman to meet them at the airport tell me which japanese business associate of ours you would have insulted in that fashion none i can tell you you even disapprove of the amount of responsibility i accord her here because it is as you say mans province and not the traditional way you have always run this kobun as you have seen fit i begrudge you nothing as you know quite well but as for these iteki i saw no earthly reason why we should lose valuable manhours by reassigning an upperechelon executive for their convenience oh yes sato said tomkin is a gaijin and nicholas linnear is something far worse to you hes only half oriental and then it has never been determined to anyones satisfaction how much of that is japanese are you saying that i am a racist nangi said blowing out smoke not in the least sato sat back in his swivel chair merely a patriot he shrugged but in the end what does cheong linnears lineage mean to us its a potential lever nangis odd triangular eyes blazed with a dark light we are going to need every weapon in our arsenal to bring down these brash iteki these barbarians who think of us as so much rice they can gobble up nangis shoulders quivered at odd moments as if they had a will of their own do you think it means anything to me that his father was colonel linnear the roundeyed savior of japan his face screwed up in contempt how could any iteki feel for us seiichi tell me that sit down old friend sato said softly taking his eyes off the older man to save him face you already hurt enough as it is nangi said nothing but walking awkwardly managed to sit at right angles to sato his back erect his thin buttocks against the very edge of the chair sato knew that nangi was lucky to be alive but of course life was a relative thing and this thorny enigma was never far from his thoughts even now after thirtyeight years did the man tied to the iron lung think life was worthwhile so too sato sometimes wished to crawl inside his friends head for just the moment it would take to learn the answer to the riddle and in those moments shame would suffuse him precisely the same kind of shame he had felt when his older brother gotaro had found him sitting sexually aroused by their fathers book of shunga erotic prints there was no privacy in japan it was often said the crowding because of the lack of space that had existed for centuries the building materials oiled paper and wood that the islands frequent and devastating earthquakes the seasonal typhoons dictated be used in order to facilitate speedy rebuilding these factors went a long way in guiding the flow of japanese society because real privacy as a westerner understands it is physically impossible the japanese have developed a kind of inner privacy that outwardly manifests itself by the manylayered scheme of formality and politeness that each individual lives by because it is his only bulwark against the encroachment of chaos that was why the thought of stepping into someone elses mind especially so close a friend brought the sweat of shame out on sato now he riffled through the file they had compiled on tomkin industries in order to cover his intense discomfort as for tomkin we should not underestimate him nangisan he said now nangi looked up as he heard the note of weariness in the younger mans voice how so his blustering barbarian ways cannot mask for long his keen mind he hit us squarely when he said that were much too dependent on foreign energy sources to allow ourselves to become isolated from the rest of the world nangi waved away satos words a mere stab in the dark the mans an animal nothing more sato gave a deep sigh and yet hes quite correct why else would we be laboring so long and hard on tenchi eh it is something that is critically draining our financial resources it is the most desperate gamble japan has taken since pearl harbor in many ways it is more crucial to this countrys future than the war ever was we were able to rebound from that defeat sato shook his head but if tenchi should fail or if buddha forbid we should be found out then i fear that there will be nothing left of our beloved islands but atomic ash tsutsumus dead along with kusunoki the voice was flat and cold it might have been conveying the message here are ten pounds of rice before or after by contrast this voice was heavy thick with foreign inflection that is the only thing that matters before there was a muffled curse in a language the first man could not understand are you certain absolutely certain i was thorough enough to do an anal search he had nothing on him there was a slight pause do you wish me to withdraw still the voice was emotionless as if all feeling had been trained out of it certainly not stay just where you are any sudden movement on your part could only bring down suspicion and these people are not to be underestimated theyre fanatics exceptionally dangerous fanatics yesi know you have your orders adhere to them the dojos bound to be in turmoil for the next few days at least even they need time to gather themselves they havent picked kusunokis successor yet have they there are meetings going on to which i am not privy as yet there have been no announcements but tension is high all through the dojo good now is the time to burrow in get as close as you dare strike in the midst of this confusion our tactics are more efficient in this atmosphere kusunokis death has turned them into alarmists they see hostiles in the movement of the shadows then be especially bold the danger has increased and has your dedication to the goals of the motherland therefore decreased i will not waver from the cause you know that good then this conversation is at an end a light went on atop the scarred metal desk dim and buzzing coldly fluorescent emanating from an ancient khaki gooseneck lamp that had been functionally ugly when new and now was lightyears away from that this fitful pale mauve illumination revealed a face no more unusual than an accountants or a professors black eyes above sloped slavic cheekbones were penetratingly intelligent to be sure but his fine tufted hair the liver spots high on his domed forehead and the rather weak chin all combined to paint a portrait of a bland unremarkable man nothing could be further from the truth his slenderfingered hand came away from the phone already his mind was racing he did not like the sudden murder of the sensei he knew well kusunokis power and was astonished that the sensei had been overpowered at all still he was trained to use any and all unforeseen circumstance to his benefit and striking swiftly and surely during times of confusion was standard procedure contrary to what his brethren back home espoused he enjoyed working with these locals while he would never invite one to marry his daughter if he had one he could admire their expertise their dogged persistence and above all their rabid fanaticism this fascinated him it was also his secret weapon against political assassination back home while his position among all his brethren was most secure simply because he fed them a steady diet of fear and secrecy two elements which never failed to catch their attention still one found it good practice to keep shuffling the cards keeping options open finding the soft spots in ones superiors private lives that would turn the key in the lock of ones future that was a lesson he had learned well and hard he turned away from the phone activating the portable but very powerful k computer terminal rechecking the myriad random elements he had thrown at the original program still it was holding up his grunt in the otherwise silent room told of his satisfaction with an effort he rose and lumbered to the door as thick and impenetrable as a bank vault dialing the combination he let himself out nicholas left the dazzling glitter of the enormous hotel behind him a city within a city and took the immaculate silent subway into the asakusa district the blankfaced jostling throng who rode along with him with their fashionable clothes and frenchstyle makeup were outwardly very different from the members of the war generation yet nicholas could not forget what happened here as it did throughout all of tokyo on march the firebombing by american warplanes here in the asakusa district people sought the sanctuary of the great and beloved buddhist temple of kannon the goddess of pity built in the seventeenth century this was thought safe because it had survived all the great fires of tokyo as well as the most infamous earthquake of but as hundreds crowded inside the long arching timbers so lovingly wrought by artisans of the fabled past caught fire the gray slat roof which had been such a staunch landmark for hundreds of years collapsed inward crushing the already burning throng outside the ancient stately gingko trees of the surrounding gardens burst into crackling torches pinwheels of sparks arcing into the howling crimson night running along street gutters like voracious predators asakusa like the rest of the city bore no scars from that time nicholas realized the japanese had been very careful about that in this downtown area of tokyo more than in any other place in the city perhaps the ethos of japans splendiferous edo period still held sway crowds clouded the gates of kaminarimon streaking its great twostory vermillion face with their darting shadows a scarlet and ebon ricepaper lantern of gigantic proportions swung between the two redfaced wooden statues of the gods of wind and thunder the bodyguards of kannon who though she failed her people once in the incinerator of the war was worshiped and loved still dodging those japanese on the run nicholas took the stonepaved nakamisedori passing sweet and souvenir shops piled high with wares on impulse he turned down a near side street strolling slowly through the relative gloom he stopped abruptly in front of a tiny storefront that spelled out yonoya in kanji inside glass shelves were lined with the slightly oily boxwood combs nicholas remembered yukio slowly rhythmically stroking her hair with such a comb how soft and long and shining were those tresses thick and lustrous once he had asked her if all orientals had such beautiful hair and she had laughed embarrassed pushing him from her only the ones who can afford these she said still laughing she showed him the exquisitely handcarved implement feel it she offered sticky he said immediately but guaranteed never to tangle your hair nicholas she had said in her singsong voice this boxwood is brought all the way from kyushu the southern island it is cut and steamed to remove any imperfections and then dried for more than a week above a boxwoodshaving fire then the lengths are tied together and bamboo hoops slipped over the bundles and they are left to dry for thirty years to ensure that they are completely dry before being carved in the shop in asakusa where i buy these their craftsmen have studied for twenty years they sit for ten or twelve hours at a time immobile except for their working hands to shape these combs nicholas had been fascinated then just as he was fascinated now even with such an everyday implement as a comb he thought we take exceptional care and artistry in its manufacture could a westerner any westerner ever fully understand the reasons why or would they think us mad to devote such time and intense effort to such a small and seemingly insignificant matter again on impulse he entered the shop and bought a comb for justine as he waited for the saleswoman to reoil the boxwood carefully wrap it in three separate layers of highgrade rice paper and then place it into its handsanded cedar box his eyes traced the forms of the combs lying in artistic display with each meticulously rounded corner with each matched tooth end he again saw yukio in front of the mirror her pale hand rising and falling like a tide through the river of her dark hair he saw that ebon cascade highlighted against the snowwhite kimono its crimson edges moving like flowing blood he leaned forward and hands on her delicate shoulders turned her around lifting her so that she rose soft rustle of silk like the bittersweet drift of heavenly cherry petals in midapril when it seemed the ancient gods of japan returned filling the scented air with their ethereal presence the feel of her the sight of her the scent of her all combined to transfix him so that he experienced again his deepseated fear of what she brought out in him the intensity of sexual feeling he was barely eighteen it was he had had no experience with women especially one as powerful as yukio it was as if she held him in a tender spell and now her palm came up to stroke his cheek and he shuddered at the fiery lick the caress engendered in him as was usual with them she had to take the first few steps sliding her fingertips back along her own body pushing the rim of the kimono away from her shoulders it parted with a rustle revealing the inside slopes of her hardnippled breasts nicholas breath caught in his throat and his belly contracted painfully with a slither the soft white kimono slid down her arms the line of crimson along its verge flickering like flame and now she was bare the light striping her throwing into deep shadow the erotic dells of her torso hiding as it revealed nicholas felt the terror filling him up as like a sorceress she moved freeing his own sexuality drawing out his own ribboning desire he could deny her nothing at moments like this and yet there was a deeply buried sadness in her as she reached between his thighs caught gentle hold of him stroking is that all you can think of he said thickly its all i have she said in a moan guiding him slowly refocusing nicholas gaze lit upon the empty space in the display case caused by the present he had bought justine yukio was gone just as the boxwood comb was gone from the case the spotlights glare was harder in just that spot magnifying the nothingness he wondered what had ever become of yukios magical boxwood comb had saigo hurled it after her into the straits of shimonoseki had she been wearing it when he clubbed her stunning her then binding her for the long rowboat ride across those haunted waters or had some small child found the artifact among her abandoned belongings and was wearing it today nicholas found that his eyes were full of tears despite his vow never to relive the moment when his evil cousin had told him of yukios death he had done it his heart was breaking anew he felt her loss as keenly this moment as he had a year ago perhaps this was one wound that time would never heal blindly he received the exquisitely wrapped package signed the american express receipt it was as if yukios kami had appeared at his side linking arms with him and standing by his side was now looking down at the display of boxwood combs with him and for that moment it was as if death had been banished from the world of man as if there was no dark barrier between life and death the unknown becoming suddenly known and accepted did he walk with the dead or had yukio crossed over to live again at his side with a start nicholas found himself alone again in the shop the saleswoman was looking at him oddly not certain whether to smile or frown at the peculiar expression on his face back on the nakamisedori he returned to the precincts of the sensqji temple where rice crackers and tortoiseshell sticks were still sold just as they had been a hundred years before he wanted to stay immersed in the past unwilling as yet to let go of the last sweetly painful tendrils of his waking dream at a streetside stall he paused to buy a confection made of egg and flour poured into a dollshaped mold before bean jam was squeezed on and the whole was grilled with the deftly economical movements of the ancient vendor but once holding the tiny cake in his hand he found that he had no taste for food especially sweets the past was like the taste of ash in his mouth he had thought that with saigos death the detritus of his earlier life would dry up and blow away like the soft shed skin of a snake but he saw now on his return to japan that this was not so it could not be there was a certain continuity to life that was not to be denied as nicholas father the colonel had often said this is the only true lesson of history and those who do not heed it perish because of their ignorance now at the doorway to the sensqji temple he gave the unwanted food to an old man with a back as thin and bent as a saplings trunk in a high wind the old man in a black snapbrim hat and western dress nodded his thanks but made no effort to smile as nicholas went into the temple itself echoes and the ripples of history seemed to reach out from the dim incensefilled interior with its high vaulting ceiling and cool stone floor to remind him once again of all that he dare not forget when he reemerged into the spangled night of shitamachi tokyos downtown the old man was still where nicholas had left him one hand curled around the thick copper rim of the huge vessel used to burn incense nicholas had had enough of old japan and the tangled web of memories it had unearthed in him he longed for the spark and dazzle of the new tokyo the soaring ugly buildings so new the lacquer had not yet dried in their towering gallerylike lobbies he longed for the bustle of the young japanese so chic and beautiful in their wideshouldered jackets their loose blousey shirts and their highwaisted trousers underground he took the ginza line nine stops transferring to the hibiya line for the short trip to roppongi he emerged from the subway exit and went west toward shibuya he took the all glass elevator in the ishibashi building to the top floor and entered the ironclad doors of jan jan from its southeasterly facing floortoceiling windows he could make out the floodlit stone walls of the russian embassy the air was alive with the percussive rhythms of rock music the yellow magic orchestra and an english group called japan it was well after midnight and the place was jumping cigarette smoke blued the pale walls the intense spot lighting striking like arrows straight down from the enormously high acoustic baffled ceiling dappled the springy wooden dance floor turning it into a rippling tigers pelt around the central dance floor rose three tiers of clear plexiglas tables and midnight blue velourcovered banquettes waitresses moved quickly and efficiently in amongst the crowd there was movement heat sound in crushing waves the electricity of modern life nicholas mind was engaged as he moved slowly through the bouncing energetic throng his eyes roved across the sea of young painted faces seeing the laughter the selfengrossment observing slickwinged hairstyles arms entangled around waists and buttocks whirling torsos dervishes of the night enraptured by a combination of the musical pulse the boost of liquor and perhaps illicit drugs and above all the narcotizing sense of eternal youth the concept of mortality had no place here and if it came would never be recognized for just an instant nicholas wondered what it was he was searching for then he thought of justine and knew that he would not find it here when akiko ofuda saw nicholas walk in through jan jans high edo period portals she turned her head partly away into the shadows her heart was beating fast bewildered she fought to understand the reason for his abrupt appearance did he know anything could he but no she thought calming herself it was too early his presence must be merely a coincidence a jest of the gods she rose from where she had been sitting at a table along the second tier and walked slowly lithely circling the perimeter of the lightstreaked dance floor she kept him in sight all the while watching him clandestinely but carefully what she saw was a ruggedly angular face that had nothing of the classical beauty about it it was far too odd and distinctive for that the long upswept eyes hinted of his oriental blood as did his prominent cheekbones but he had a good solid anglosaxon chin that was as western as his father he was black haired and wideshouldered with the odd narrow hips of a dancer and the thickly muscled legs of the serious athlete akiko found herself longing to strip him naked to admire the sight of those overlays of long sinewy muscle but other than this it was difficult to say what she thought of him on first sight so many conflicting emotions swirled inside her contending for ascendancy how she hated him she was struck anew by the force of it seeing him so abruptly in so unforeseen a manner brought the full shock of the secret emotions she had been harboring for so long into the forefront she trembled in rage even while her eyes drank in the emanations of his power it was evident even from such a distance the lift of his head the rolling liquid stride the minute movements of his shoulders and upper arms these all spoke of the extreme danger leashed tightly inside this man but as she herself moved keeping pace with him she felt an odd elation begin to suffuse her and she thought what extraordinary karma i must possess to gain this added advantage over him from the start her pulse beat hard within her as her eyes drank him in noting his strength the intensity of his spirit oh but she longed for that moment when he first saw her unconsciously her fingers rose to her cheek softly stroking the taut flesh there she experienced an almost giddy sensation at the intensity of her longing and a part of her wanted to draw it out as long as possible after all this time she did not want the end to come so soon certainly not until the time of her own choosing oh yes it had been a stroke of genius suggesting to sato that he invite the gaijin to the wedding especially this linnear she had whispered in his ear late one night we all know his familys history think what face it will give you to have him present at such an event yes yes nicholas she crooned silently as she stalked him high above his head the time is coming soon when i will look directly in your eyes and see that strength crumble and fly away like gray ash in the wind she felt intoxicated her throat constricted the muscles in her thighs trembling with the flutter of her heart as she felt herself drawn inexorably toward him but she used all her training to restrain herself from destroying in an instant of ecstatic gloating everything she had worked for for so long now she broke away from his orbit walking more quickly ignoring the glances of those she passed the lust of the men the envy of the women she had become inured to that it was time to pick up yoki sato would soon be home from the wars akiko watched yoki out of the comer of her eye as they sped through the center of tokyo and out again she is a magnificent creature akiko thought i have chosen well she had found yoki some weeks ago and when she was certain of her choice had struck up a conversation with her that had led to an odd at least akiko saw it as that kind of friendship its borders were the night when as far as yoki was concerned they both emerged like nocturnal birds akiko had once asked yoki what occupied her during the day oh on and off im a saleslady she had said you know door to door perfumes and cosmetics otherwise i watch television not only dramas but programs where i learn calligraphy flower arranging even the tea ceremony in a culture where percent of the population watched tv at least once a day that was perhaps not surprising yet it nevertheless chilled akiko that her country was teaching its population by proxy she had learned the tea ceremony from her mother and she remembered watching the older womans face listening to the tone of her voice seeing the patterns on her kimono moving just so here and not at all there resolving to memorize every detail no matter how tiny for those her mother had once told her were all that would be noticed could the emissions of an electronic cathode ray tube provide such teaching she was sure it could not and she found herself disgusted when she thought of the number of women being taught in such an impersonal manner but outwardly she showed none of this disdain yoki was important to her at least for the next several hours the limo pulling up onto the gravel verge of the twostory house pushed her thoughts back to the present seiichi sato lived just north of ueno park in uguisudani in taitoku a block and a half to the southwest was wide kototoidori the avenue that curled like a serpent around two sides of the park beyond the high tops of the carefully pruned cypress stood stark and utterly black against the faintly pink and yellow glow from the ginza and shinjuku nightspots the trees were the natural markers of the tokugawa shogun graveyard across the myriad railroad tracks in the northern end of ueno satos house was large by tokyo standards built on the ken principle the standard sixfoot unit of construction it was made of bamboo and cypress the threelayered roof was of terra cotta tile the far end of the house contained a great notch to accommodate a morethanonehundredyearold cryptomeria whose boughs overgrew the sheltering eightfoot fence swaying over the road itself the driver came around and opened the rear door for them and akiko took her charge inside seiichi sato sipped hot sake from a tiny porcelain cup and contemplated the void he did this sometimes in moments of intense stress to clear his mind but mainly he used this form of mental exercise when he was impatient in a land where patience was not merely a virtue but a way of life sato had had to teach himself this attitude as if he were some form of alien in his own culture yet he had worked diligently even obsessively at it and he knew that his patience had won him all that he held dear today he was in the sixtatami room space being defined in japanese houses by the number of reed mats the wood floor could contain with only a small table a cotton futon and a drawered nagahibachi of burl paulownia wood dating from the early part of the nineteenth century a recess in the right top of the long brazier allowed for the heating of sake as well as food sato wore only a white cotton kimono its bold crimson square reproduced the crest of the danjuro line of kabuki actors he looked calm and assured his cool eyes staring at a spot not within the realm of the physical world a soft knock on the fusuma made him blink but otherwise he did not move now he unlocked his thoughts and allowed the keen sense of anticipation to enfold him like a cloak on a chill winters eve he reached out and moved the paper door an inch to the right just the pronounced curve of the front half of akikos eye gazed at him from beneath a halflowered lid the sable darkness dusted along the delicate flesh was like the painting of dusk across a changing sky the coal black iris was like the heart of some deeply buried treasure despite himself sato felt the quickness of his pulse the heat of his own breath firing in his throat you are late his voice was breathy as he began their ritual i thought you would not come akiko heard the thickness in his voice and smiled to herself i always come she whispered i cannot do otherwise you are free to walk away satos heart constricted as he said those words give my love to you freely and i am bound by it i will never leave you the script had been developed over a period of months to provide them both with a degree of excitement and intrigue within the carefully prescribed boundaries of societal courtship of course there were aspects about their courtship minor ones to be sure that had satos mother been alive she would have disapproved of in the most vociferous language sato bowed his head and opening the fusuma farther moved back on his knees and shins to allow her entrance as akiko entered the dual kanji ideograms for sobi hovered in the center of satos being like a feudal daimyos banner for she did indeed possess sublime beauty and despite their ritualistic dialog he knew it was he who was bound to her for all time body and spirit for a time they knelt facing one another satos large capable hands held palms up akikos smaller ones resting lightly in his locked their eyes stared within and through sato contemplating the karma that had brought them together felt the essence of her stirring a lacquered kite rising above rooftops and rustling crowns of cypress and pine a strong gust took it suddenly and it shot straight for his heart lodging there like a broken wing what are you thinking the question startled him was it just because of the abrupt sound from out of the silence of the beating of their hearts he asked himself from deep within him came a secret fear that somehow in some unfathomable way her mind had pierced his flesh peering into his inviolable thoughts and in that split instant a brief shudder contracted the muscles ridged along his gently arched back and he blinked his eyes searching hers as if she were a stranger then her lips bowed into a smile and her white even teeth showed you are so solemn this night she laughed and he saw the play of light along the side of her throat the small shadow lying in the hollow like a teardrop he said nothing and after studying his granitelike countenance for a moment she made a move to rise i will but his fingers curled around her wrist stopped her and perched like a bird her lips opened satosan slowly he brought her back down to her knees then drew himself upward the fabric of his kimono winked and rippled as his shoulders squared and akiko was abruptly aware of his strength and even more his power this night is special he said thickly there will only be one like it in all our lives he paused for a moment as if collecting his thoughts so our lives will be truly bound by the laws of the amida buddha his eyes raked her face does this mean nothing to you i have thought of little else all day then stay at that moment his fingers let go their grip and her arm freed drifted down to her lap her perfect lacquered nails overlapped as her fingers interlaced a streak of light lying along the gleaming surface of each beyond which he could not see on this most special of nights send my gift away her face as composed as a porcelain mask disclosed nothing of her inner feelings sato could scarcely discern the rise and fall of her breasts as she breathed her wa was as unruffled as the still skin of a mountain lake reflecting rather than revealing he was disconcerted surely you must know it is you who i desire akiko turned her head as if he had struck her a physical blow then you hate the gift i bear you have hated all the gifts that i have brought you since no trembling sato silently railed against the trap he had entered i have dishonored you with my desire to please you akiko wrung her hands like an aggrieved little girl sato leaned forward i have loved each and every gift i have treasured the thought behind them he had regained control of his voice if not his emotions there is only honor in what you have brought me knowing his eyes slid away from her staring fixedly at the tatami between them knowing that you have never been with a man understanding my desires he took a deep breath and wanting to bring me happiness in this sphere her head lowered it is my duty i but his hand shot out again covering hers but tonight we are so close to being joined seeing you and what you ask her head snapped up and then what of our wedding night will we make a mockery of tradition will we degrade the path that is ours do you want that sato felt her nails digging into his calloused flesh and knew she was right he grasped at the fluttering of his intense desire for her choking it off his head nodded on his thick neck and he whispered through dry lips it is your gift that i desire akiko stood by the nagahibachi feeling its heat suffuse her she paid only the most minimal attention to the work her hands were doing cooking the soba the buckwheat noodles preparing the soybased sauce in small porcelain cups pouring the rest into a tiny matching pitcher setting out the green horseradish and chopped cucumber on a saucerlike plate the soba when done was lifted in tiny portions into rectangular stacking trays of black lacquer normally she would be waited upon as would be sato but this was part of her gift to him and at this time of the night servants were enjoined from this side of the house akiko served the food and more hot sake she observed thai sato and yoki were talking in low intimate tones she had prepared the girl well yoki knew what to expect and what was expected of her akiko rose and walked silently to the edge of the fitsuma she paused with a delicate hand on the light wooden frame the sound of them washed over her before she slid the paper door shut behind her but she did not leave the house instead she moved to the left entering a smaller twotatami room carefully closing the fusuma she slid across the reed mats on her knees until she reached the shoji common with the room within which sato and yki reclined the screen was actually composed of many long and narrow vertical panels decorative and pleasing to the eye some time ago just after she had been introduced into the household akiko had secretly altered the nature of one of these panels so that it became removable by a subtle manipulation of its thin wooden border through this rift she now gazed upon sato and yoki they had finished their soba the sake was almost gone they were very close together kneeling at her spyhole akiko settled herself for what was to come satos back was to her she saw the movement of his arm and then the soft slide of yokis kimono for akiko knew better than to present the girl to sato in her westernstyle clothes back and down exposing one soft white shoulder akiko held her breath as the rich play of the girls muscles was revealed satos eyes were drawn to yokis breasts the brown and gray kimono lay like wings on the tatami on either side of her her thighs still partially wrapped then satos head bent down and forward and with a soft cry yokis head went back her fingers caressing his ears as his tongue streaked hotly across her nipples akiko crossed her arms over her own breasts feeling the hot stiffness there like points of fire her mouth was dry and she longed for sake to slake her thirst she had almost given in to sato tonight that had shocked her like a lightning bolt out of the blue it had been relatively easy to keep him at arms length all these long weeks she had been disgusted by the lust clouding his eyes but this night had been different yoki was now completely naked satos open mouth licked and sucked at her flesh with such intensity that akiko could feel her own flesh heating tingling just as if it were she he was making love to why what had been different akiko searched her mind analyzing as sun hsiung had taught her to do so long ago quarter your memory then divide it into eighths sixteenths and so on eventually he had told her you will find the detail you have been seeking for your senses are the most sensitive of receptors they record everything it is only your conscious mind which filters out what it believes to be all the important data the lesson you must learn and it is a most difficult one is that your conscious mind often makes the wrong choice now as her eyes drank in the erotic movements unfolding just beyond the aperture in the shoji akiko began the quartering search of her memory for she was well attuned to her own emotions as she was to others tonight just like all nights she had sprung the right trap to ensnare sato so that she could slip away from his advances she had been filled with elation at the frustration she was causing him but that feeling had been shortlived why rock musics primal pulse so full of anger aggression and lust sizzled in her blood like alcohol a room blue with smoke making figures as indistinct as priests inside a temple wreathed in incense lit for the dead she stalked a tiger there lithe full of a terrifying atavistic power it magnetized her spooked her for now she had traced the loosening of her sexual emotions to the moment when she had been circling nicholas linnear like a hungry jackal summoning up the image of him within the confines of exotic jan jan she experienced again the triphammer beat of her heart the tiny trembling of her inner thigh muscles and the powerful compulsion to approach him again as they had at the nightclub her fingers rose up to touch the flushed flesh of her cheek as if to assure herself that it was still there it had not been that long she must always keep that in mind a stranger to herself she must learn to become her own best friend she had never been able to do that before on the advent of her rebirth she had vowed to herself that she would try but first unfinished business and that involved nicholas linnear oh yes most surely it did akikos eyes opened wide sato and yoki were entangled on the futon the folds of their kimonos rippled about the edges of their working flesh like the seas waves upon the shore concealing and revealing at once the panting bellows of their breaths rose toward her like a flock of gulls pulling her onward as a third member as it fueled the furnace of their passion she saw satos erection large and reddish from the stroking ministrations of his partner yokis eyes were fluttered closed in pleasure and her soft breasts heaved into satos calloused palms as his head slid down and down until his open mouth touched the insides of her heated thighs unconsciously akiko strained forward and when she saw his tongue flick out to caress the flesh there she gasped silently a line of warm sweat trickled like a serpents tail down the deep indentation of her spine staining her kimono marking it with her lust her palms traced a circular pattern inward across her own spreadapart thighs until lifting the material of her kimono she encountered bare flesh now instead of her own fingertips she felt satos flickering tongue in maddening repetition as it moved across yokis damp thighs his hands behind her knees for an instant lifting her legs yokis thighs akikos thighs there was no difference there to the touch what had been done to her had not marred the silkiness of the flesh but she knew should sato see what lay along the inside hidden skin there he might call off the wedding and that she could not afford afterward well then he would have no choice but to accept her satos mouth moved upward covering the curling black hair covering yokis high mound akiko could see the other girls hips trembling with excitement and the building of her orgasm satos head burrowed down into the heat and the wet and yoki threw her head back the thin cords at the side of her neck standing out her lips open her teeth bared her thighs trembled uncontrollably and ail the while akikos deft fingers were opening up her own petals making gentle circular sweeps in concert with the movements of satos head she felt him but it was not enough she needed more the sensations touched her beading like rain but what she craved was a torrent a tidal wave to lift her off her feet and tumble her helterskelter into the arms of ecstasy it would not come and she increased the pressure of her fingers beginning to dig into the soft folds pulling them apart pressing harder against her clitoris satos head came up his chest was heaving like a bulls his great male form arched itself above yokis supple female one shadowing her from the diffuse light streaking her face so that she appeared to be wearing some bizarre makeup and now she drew him upward rubbing him against her until she had no other choice but to arch up and impale herself on him thrusting her hips wildly off the futon the breath whooshing out of her with an audible rush the mounds of her breasts quivering with the strength of the sensations running rampant through her how akiko longed to feel what she was feeling the tide gathering calling running inward from the vast depths of the sea toward her like a blanket of night blotting out all thought all pain all memories in the shooting inundation of vibrating pleasure sato was stroking down to meet yokis frantic thrusting their hips hot in contact the warm salty sweat dripping down from satos bulging muscles beading along the girls rippling skin she began to cry out her arms enfolding him drawing him all the way down on her so that to akiko it seemed as if he was burying her with his mass the rhythmic grunting picked up in tempo and the motion of their hips became ragged and indistinct yoki was sighing out her passion in great long jets her face unlined and taut the heels of her hands jammed against satos powerful muscular buttocks urging him to thrust himself even deeper into her going going going yokis voice held the edge of hysteria and something more whatever it was akiko longed for it just as she longed for the release from the bunched tension ribboning her thighs and stomach her muscles were knotted and the pain came roaring at her just as it always did at these sessions she bit her lower lip in an effort not to cry out her heart hammered threatening to burst its cage of bone and slippery membrane to explode like a sad sun in her constricted throat please she moaned to herself please please please though initially she had felt more than she ever had before though she thought she might experience the blessed relief of the clouds and rain this night was no different from all the rest she heard satos animal grunting as he shot in rapid fire into yokis spasming depths it was too much for akiko to bear and she fell back slamming her shoulder against the floor beneath the tatami her eyes rolled up in their sockets she heard the rushing of a sharp wind so briefly she was uncertain of its existence pain and a terrible longing transported her to a black plain she heard sun hsiung saying there is a way and if you are patient i will teach it to you to scrutinize the enemys external appearance so that you may be able to discern his inner mind then unconsciousness took her nicholas rose promptly just before six am awakened by his own inner clock he took a quick shower turning the water on first scaldingly hot then needle cold emerging from the bathroom his skin glowing from the tough toweling he folded down into the lotus position facing the window and tokyo he took three long deep breaths then he dissolved into himself and expanded outward until his being filled the universe and he was wholly a part of everything the discreet knock on the door brought him out of his deep meditation he had been waiting for it his eyes focused on the spires of the city and breathing normally again he rose he ate his breakfast of green tea and rice cakes silently then dressed lightly a small black bag slung over one shoulder he went out of the hotel it was just after ten oclock he walked two blocks east then south and found himself in toranomoncho past the small immaculately tended park on the far side of sakuradori he came to sanchome the third area designation in toranomon there were no exact street addresses in tokyo a peculiarity that nonplussed all foreign visitors rather the vast city was divided up into first ku or wards then zones such as the ginza finally into cho within chd were numbered chome and block designations on the oddshaped thirteenth block nicholas found what he was searching for the building overlooked a small ancient temple and just beyond atago hill inside he changed cut of his street clothes reaching into the black bag he toted he withdrew a pair of white cotton widelegged pants these were kept up by a drawstring over this he drew on a loosefitting jacket of the same color and material this closed by means of a separate belt of black cotton tied low on the hips finally he stepped into the hakama the traditional black divided skirt worn now only by those who had mastered kendo kyudo sumo or held dan black belt ranking in aikido this too was tied low on the hips to give a further feeling of centralization handed down from the time of the samurai thus dressed in his gi nicholas went up a flight of perfectly polished wooden stairs in his mind he heard the click clackclick of wooden bokken clashing against each other and it was suddenly last summer he and lew croaker were in a new york dojo and he was watching the look in his friends eyes as for the first time croaker saw the flash of kenjutsu nicholas had always been slow to find friendship principally because that concept in its eastern form meant a great deal more than it did in the west for him as for all orientals friendship meant duty the upholding of a friends honor bonds of iron no westerner could fathom but lew croaker within nicholas orbit had learned those definitions and had chosen to be nicholas friend they had promised each other that after croaker returned from key west and finally wrapped up the angela didion murder they would go fishing for blues or shark off montauk now that would never happen croaker was dead and nicholas missed him with a fierceness that was almost physical pain he knew that he should clear his mind in preparation for what was waiting for him at the top of the stairs but he could not get the memory of his friend out of his mind what turned out to be their final goodbye was a poignant moment full of the kind of hushed feeling two japanese friends might express they had been at michita the japanese restaurant in midtown nicholas frequented their shoes were just outside the tatami rooms wooden lintel croakers heavy western work shoes lined up next to nicholas featherlight loafers they knelt opposite one another there was steaming tea and hot sake in tiny earthen cups between them sushi and tonkatsu were coming what time are you leaving nicholas said im taking the midnight plane croaker grinned lopsidedly its the cheapest flight but they both knew that he had wanted to get into key west under cover of darkness the subdued clatter of the restaurant went on around them as if for once it had no power to touch them they were an island of silence inviolable abruptly croaker had looked up nick the food came and he waited until they were alone again there isnt much but ive got some stocks bonds and such in a safety deposit box he slid a small key in a brown plastic case across the low table youll take care of things if he picked up his chopsticks pushed raw tuna around with the blunt ends as white as bones well if it all doesnt work out for me down there nicholas took the key he felt honored they fell to eating and the atmosphere seemed to clear when they were through and had ordered more sake nicholas said promise me one thing lew i know how you feel about tomkin i think its a blind spot i know what i know nick hes a goddamned shark eating up everything in his path i mean to stop him and this leads my only way all i mean is dont let this passion of yours lead you around by the nose once you get down there take your time look around size up the situation you telling me how to do my job now dont be so touchy i just mean that lifes more often shades of gray than it is all black and white tomkins not the prince of evil thats the role youve assigned him its just possible that he didnt have angela didion murdered do you believe that i dont think it matters what i believe now nicholas did not know whether that was true because he had become involved he had accepted croakers abrupt death so far away in key west he was here now in japan because of it gin so long nick croaker had grinned in the multicolored street lights just outside the restaurant he had half stuck out his hand then thinking better of it had bowed instead nicholas returned the gesture and they had both laughed into the night as if warding off any kind of trepidation their last moments together had been so casual in the manner of most men parting for a short time despite what croaker had given nicholas neither man believed anything would happen to the cop in florida and now it seemed to nicholas that there had been so little time to savor what they had for one such as nicholas so guarded so hidden within himself such occurrences were rare indeed he found now that he liked to remember their times together running scenes back in his minds eye as if they were clips from a favorite film he shook his head now as he reached the head of the stairs more certain than ever that the path he had chosen for himself was the right one he could not allow the murder of his friend to go unavenged giri bound him it was as all who had come before him had discovered stronger even than life itself the sensei of this dojo was sitting at the kamiza the upper seat of the aikido mat which was made up of a series of tatami of uncovered rice straw padding he was a man of indeterminate middle years with a dour countenance a wide slash of a mouth and cats eyes he had burly shoulders and narrow waist and hips he appeared almost hairless his name was kenzo this bit of information had been given to nicholas along with a letter of introduction by fukashigi nicholas sensei in new york he is a hard one fukashigi had said but i can think of no other to suit your array of er unconventional bujutsu he knew that nicholas was a ninja just as he knew that there was a whole range of subdisciplines in which nicholas could be his sensei kenzo will not know what you are nicholas but he will understand the scope of your knowledge and he will work with you behind kenzo nicholas saw a raised dais flanked by a pair of seventeenthcentury daikatana the longest and most lethal of the samurai swords a traditional ceremonial drum and hanging on the wall between them a ricepaper scroll that read all things appear but we cannot see the gate from which they come all men value the knowledge of what they know but really do not know only those who fall back upon what knowledge cannot know really know nicholas recognized the words of laotse barefooted he went upon the tatami performing the ritsurei bowing before the sensei then he presented fukashigis letter kenzo seemed to take a long time reading not once did he look up at nicholas at length he carefully folded the sheets returning them to their envelope he put the packet aside and placing his hands on the tatami bent forward in the zarei the sitting bow folding his legs beneath him nicholas returned the salutation and just at the far apex of his bow the short stick came hurtling at him there was just the hint of a blur at the periphery of his vision and if he had taken the time to think he would surely have been rendered unconscious instead his right arm lifted reflexively even as his torso shifted to the right away from the trajectory of the oncoming attack the stick struck the leading edge of his forearm bouncing end over end like a pinwheel but already kenzo had leapt forward using nicholas own anticipated momentum as he swung to the left using a punishing shomen uchi a straight blow to the head to try to bring nicholas to the mat in so doing kenzo had grabbed hold of his right wrist and immediately nicholas used an immobilization a yonkyo a twist of his own wrist so that now he was gripping the senseis left forearm he dug his thumb deeply into the embedded nerve center running up the inside of the arm but instead of backing away from the pressure which would have allowed nicholas to bring the now outstretched arm into alignment kenzo moved into the paralyzing hold sacrificing one arm in order not to lose the contest a second short stick appeared from somewhere and he slammed it down hard on nicholas shoulder nicholas gave up the yonkyo but instead of moving into a second immobilization as kenzo suspected he would he employed an atemi a percussive moving out of the aikido discipline as the sensei already had the stiffened fingertips jammed themselves into the space just below kenzos collarbone digging for the nerve juncture there the senseis head jerked spastically up and away and nicholas bore down but now the short stick was between their straining bodies hammering against nicholas rib cage nicholas moved in even closer aware that kenzo was attempting to swing the stick in a short arc in order to assault the muscles directly over the heart this he must not allow he tried two quick dorsal kites before switching back to immobilizations nothing worked and slowly the wooden stick began to arc its way closer to the left side of his chest power was slipping away from him and he felt his centrism now as a separate entity far away and almost useless he cursed himself knowing that he would lose loss of sleep the time imbalance had conspired to sap his concentration what reserves he still possessed were being rapidly depleted by the repeated tambo attacks blood was singing in his ears bringing with it the first telltale signs of disorientation physical coordination would soon follow he knew unless he did something to forestall it and then a lesson in kendo leapt into his mind and remembering musashis red leaves cut he set his spirit toward gaining control of kenzos stick instead of defending himself he broke his hands completely free and rushed toward the tambo attacks in a blur he grasped the slippery cylinder twisting it down and to the left breaking the set of the senseis wrist as he did so disrupting the energy flow long enough to deliver a vicious liver kite kenzo rocked back on his knees swaying and nicholas followed through only to come up against the stone wall of the senseis calloused fist pain flamed through him and he gritted his teeth pulling inward and down digging the heel of his hand into kenzos shoulder using the others momentum to rock him off his haunches the moment the senseis shoulder touched the tatami nicholas broke off his torso was bathed in sweat his heart pounded and with each breath he took pain etched itself through his tissues he thought about how close he had come to defeat ichiro kagami was in a surly mood he was a man of unusually calm and controlled disposition a virtue that had awarded him with the vice presidency of finance for sato petrochemicals but today he had been unable to concentrate on any of the fine points being hammered out between this kobun and the american microchip company he was enormously grateful when satosan had given the attending executives the signal to leave the proceedings before his lack of concentration became a liability after almost an hour of staring out the window at the misty rain forming in odd prismatic patterns against the windows behind him he had had enough he swiveled around his fingertip stabbing at the intercom he told his secretary to cancel all his upcoming appointments for the rest of the day he told her where he could be found if an unforeseen emergency required sato to get in touch with him then he got up tokyo looked bleak and steel gray all the gaiety of hanami that prevailed throughout the city for the past several days dissipated by the weather but the cherry blossom viewing had provided no happiness for kagami this year his face was a bleak mask as he walked out of his office the soft lights the beautiful ukiyoe prints did not soothe his mind he came to the ironclad door and pushed through inside in the locker room he began to disrobe everything would be fine kagami told himself were it not for his brother toshiro brotherinlaw really if the truth be told he thought sourly but kagamis wife was heramochi currently enjoying meting out the ordeals she had had to endure from kagamis mother she held the pursestrings several notches too tightly he thought as he padded naked along the wooden slats into the baths while a young woman her bland flat face beaded in sweat from the heat and the exertion cleansed him kagami thought about his wife it was not that she begrudged him his geisha did not the monthly bills come to her and did she not pay them without a word of protest precisely on the fifteenth of every month she did all that a wife should and yet the manner in which she doled out tiny portions of the salary the oseibo and ochugen the yearend and midyear gifts from those in his department currying favor and promotion left a bad taste in his mouth and more often than not sent him scurrying to anmitsu where all his favorite women resided yet it was toshiro even more than his wife who got under his skin kagami reflected as he transferred to the second bath alone kagami inhaled the steam rising off the surface of the water it was so hot that when he moved his limbs even a little they began to burn toshiro was a farmer and as such he was far wealthier than kagami himself was of course he did not have the plethora of benefits that sato petrochemicals provided its family of employees but still at years end toshiros bank account swelled to unnatural proportions and it irked kagami no end that at least in part he was subsidizing his brotherinlaw kagami thought of the idiocy of it japan was no more than percent rural and dropping fast yet the farmers still held as much political power as they did just after world war ii when the country was percent rural that was because there had been no electoral redistribution and the liberal democratic party which had held power almost constantly since then did all they could to keep the farm vote loyal that meant subsidizing the inefficient farmers kagami had read in time magazine that the average american farm was acres by comparison the average japanese farm was acres how was that for efficiency kagami had to snort in derision and as if that werent enough there was the rice problem japanese farmers produced much more per year than the country could possibly consume since this shortgrained variety was not favored worldwide and because to export it would require a second subsidy to bring down the price that the first government subsidy raised the excess went totally to waste kagami knew that the government spent over twenty billion dollars per year on such subsidies much of that money came from selling imported wheat to japanese millers at exorbitant prices but even that wasnt enough tax money as well was used shortchanging housing and muchneeded roadwork throughout the country and now the greatest insult of all was that toshiro had come hat in hand for a loan of money kagami knew that toshiro was a profligate he spent whatever he made and more it was often said that the japanese were good savers one could certainly not judge that by toshiros behavior women he was a widower and gambling had become his passions he had hired others to run his farms and they had been derelict in their duty at least that was how toshiro had put it kagami snorted again more likely toshiro had been remiss in his hiring it served him right and kagami would have derived much clandestine pleasure from his brotherinlaws plight had it not been for the request for the loan of course there was no question about giving it to him kagamis wife had been quite clear about that you have no choice she had stated flatly after toshiro had left last night he is your brother there are family ties to think of duty her eyes flashed i shouldnt have to remind you of such basic matters it was no good telling her that had the situation been reversed they would not have seen one sen from toshiro who cared for no one but himself after all had he ever sent a gift for kens graduation or tamikos thirteenth birthday oh the children never knew presents arrived for them on the appropriate days ostensibly from toshiro but kagami knew that his wife secretly traveled to daimaru to purchase them herself with his money kagami closed his eyes felt the heavy pulse of his blood through his veins it was really too much it strained the boundaries of duty sighing he rose and walked dripping across the room down the short hall and into the steam room he wanted to be quite relaxed before his massage as kagami sat down on the tiled bench and put his head back against the moisturestreaked wall he thought about a massage he had once gotten in korea business had dictated he travel there in his younger years but nothing could get him back now he shuddered inwardly at the recollection of their form of massage torture more like it he should have known better the koreans were barbarians in everything they tried to do the tokugawa shogun had called them garliceaters that was in and they had progressed not at all since then except that they had learned how to take graft from the americans dirty people without a sense of honor kagami shook his head wanting to clear his mind of koreans and toshiro and all other negative influences this had begun as an evil day but he was determined that it should end otherwise the steam pipe to his left hissed and coughed new mist began to form in the room the heat rose and kagami began to sweat he had forgotten to cool off in the shower before coming in here he had toshiro to thank for that as well it was just as well he put his hands on his belly too much fat there these days maybe his extra sweating would do him some good his eyes closed he was completely relaxed the door opened kagami did not open his eyes but he was aware of a brief lessening of the intense heat a momentary thinning of the humid atmosphere then the swirling clouds of steam enveloped him once more he did not wonder who had come in members of the upperechelon management team were in and out of this section of the floor all through the day and even on into the night after the rest of the building was closed and dark the men rarely spoke to one another here understanding implicitly the nature of the renewing process that ultimately led to a more productive workday for all of them kagami felt a presence no more than a shadow perhaps as it passed something caused him to open his eyes he could not immediately say what it was a premonition perhaps or a subtle change in the environment he saw a figure across the room made indistinct by the steam mist seemed to flow around the form changing its shape even as kagami looked the figure was standing and now it came forward in an odd gliding gait that seemed all liquid as if the being before him had no bones or hard muscle kagami wiped the sweat from his eyes he felt the absurd urge to pinch himself to make certain he had not somehow fallen asleep lulled by the heat and the peacefulness for now he could discern much of the figure and it appeared to him as if it might be female but surely not he admonished himself even the blind taiwanese girls were forbidden in the steam room kagamis mouth dropped open and he gasped appearing out of the layers of mist was the unmistakable patch of female pubic hair dark as night beads of water clinging in its curls like pearls on the bed of the sea this is monstrous he thought indignantly what gross breach of protocol i must lodge a protest with satosan the naked hips swung back and forth minutely as the woman came toward him and kagami felt the first faint stirrings in his lower belly there was something so intensely sexual made all the more powerful because there was an absence of flaunting the sexuality seemed to have an existence all its own lacing the steamy atmosphere so that despite himself kagami felt the blood pooling in his loins the telltale thickening of his penis and all the while his mind was outraged for with the excitement came the unmistakable yet totally unfamiliar sensation of being goaded into desire against his will now he could see more of the torso the high coneshaped breasts the dark nipples hard and distended the flat slightly curved stomach he could no longer hide his erection and he put his hands down between his thighs trying to cover his embarrassment that was when he first sensed the danger she stopped in front of him and standing straightbacked thrust her legs out jeweled water dripped from the fringe of tight curls onto her firm columns of flesh kagami found himself straining forward to see the central vertical ribbon natures most beautiful route he gasped and began to choke on his own saliva bile came rushing up from his grinding stomach and his mind stunned blanked out all he could do was stare at the inner flesh of her thighs slackjawed while his erection withered on the vine then stupefaction still dominant on his face he raised his gaze upward to the womans head saw only a pair of dark enigmatic eyes behind a spread fan of gilt red and jet who he began abruptly finding his voice but now the fan was moving coming away revealing the soft smile on her face a beautiful face it made kagami sigh with its exquisite line and youth then lagging far behind recognition came flooding him like a spotlight and in his minds eye the oval highcheeked face turned into a painted demons mask you the scream bubbled out of his open mouth like a geyser the fan struck him edge on twisting at the very last instant wielded by a master it sliced through sweating skin and warm flesh scraping most painfully along the cheekbone kagami was slow to recoil the strike was so unexpected so skillfully administered and with such a razor sharp edge that he was barely aware of what had taken place kagamis first thought was to protect his genitals and thus he offered no real resistance the great gilt fan flicked out again again again he cried out each time he was cut but he steadfastly refused to bring his hands away from between his thighs the torso of the woman flowed toward him like smoke borne on the gentle wind of a cloudless summers day her presence seemed to fill the room blotting out all light all air it was as if she were sucking all life into herself creating only the ultimate blackness of a vacuum before her kagami shrank before her cowering and trembling filaments of pain streaking through him like tracers he was appalled at how much blood was around him how hard his heart beat in his ears how small his penis had become cupped in his protective palms then the fan flickered with a brief whistle kagamis eyes bulged and his mouth opened wide he felt the fierce bite of steel across his windpipe the atlas vertebrae of his neck his mind screamed hysterically and at last he understood the ultimate goal of this attack his hands came up his fingertips trying desperately to fend off the attack a fan his mind gibbered a fan his head whipped back and forth and he began to climb up the slick tiles of the wall anything to get away to regain life his problems with his wife with toshiro now seemed laughable to him how trivial they were compared to the primeval struggle for life for life i will not die his mind screamed at him save me wildly he flung out his fists trying to strike back at his assailant but he had no training and the lurid image of what he had seen on the insides of her thighs rose within him and he despaired he knew what she was though all logic all tradition cried out to him that it could not be so kagami knew what it was that had a grip on him he felt in the midst of a nightmare from which he would never awake yet still he fought on because hope was all he had now and for a time it sustained him he clung to life he held it to him he exulted in the knowledge of his existence then the forged steel blades struck once more and what little oxygen was seeping through to him through his strangling windpipe ceased blood rushed to nowhere lungs heaved fearfully then fitfully as carbon dioxide filled them and through their porous fibers the whole body kagamis eyelids fluttered his eyes began to cross he saw her fearful visage before him his ineffectual fingers slid against her sweatstreaked flesh like a child digging into sand his mind the last to go tried to fight on not comprehending that the body to which it was still attached was already falling into a dreamless depthless slumber with his last ounce of strength kagami stared at that face projecting his bitter hatred as if that were a physical weapon and in truth it was a rage of such depth that it convulsed already dying muscles his fingers clenched grabbing but it was a futile gesture for his lower belly was rippling his eyes rolling up into his head blinding him leaving only the unseeing whites to stare blankly up at the steaming tiles the drifting mist the rivulets of blood circling one another mazelike as they slowly slid down the drain in the center of the otherwise empty room nangi stood up walking on his stiff ungainly legs away from the conference table it was the signal for a break in the proceedings while tomkin rose heavily and left the room nicholas strolled to one of the high windows overlooking shinjuku beads of rain swirled downward upon the sea of umbrellas taking what was left of the delicate cherry blossoms strewing them along the gutters or park walkways where they were soon ground to fine dust underfoot nicholas stared blankly at the mistenshrouded city for the past three and a half hours they had beenlocked like deadly combatants on the field of battle sato nangi suzuran their attorney masuto ishii vice president of operations and satos righthand man bolstered by three of satos division heads tomkin greydon the tomkin industries counsel and himself now it was rush hour with hordes of people racing homeward or to dinner rendezvous along the brightlit tokyo side streets but up here in satos spacious offices there was no movement at all inwardly nicholas sighed sometimes even he found dealing with the japanese a trying experience their seeming reluctance to come to any decision though an obvious negotiating tactic was often taken to an extreme patience was one thing but nicholas was often convinced that weeks even months from now sato and nangi would still be reworking the same points they had all brought up within the first hour and a quarter of this initial agenda there had seemed some hope of a break an hour ago when the division heads oito vice president of acquisitions kagami vp of finance and sosuro vp of research and development had made their profuse excuses and with a double round of formal bowing had taken their leave nicholas had seen the subtle hand sign sato had given them and had taken heart his belief then had been that the negotiations were about to reach a level that the japanese who were usually more comfortable bolstered by a contingent of executives thought should be limited strictly to the principals but what had followed had been disappointing yet another one of the seemingly endless discussions batting around the same major areas of difference one was the monetary split between sphynx and nippon memory the other was somewhat more bewildering to nicholas since it was a topic about which he had not been briefed prior to the negotiating session this concerned where the sphynxsato manufacturing plant should be built apparently tomkin had done almost eighteen months of cost estimates comparing construction timetables weather pattern analyses production and shipping logistics all of which pointed to building the plant in misawa on land owned by the keiretsu the plants only neighbor in this small town in the extreme northwest of honshu japans main island was an american army base but as sato had pointed out during the opening negotiations that piece of land had already been designated for use as an expansion site for the keiretsus niwa mining kobun around and around it had gone with no side gaining or giving any ground it was maddening nicholas thought now ordinarily it wouldnt matter much in different times he was confident that they could outlast sato and nangi nicholas own patience would have ensured that however he was recalling the discussion he had had with tomkin just before they had left the hotel to get into the limo sato had sent for them he had been struck by the paleness of the other man but tomkin had only dismissed his query disdainfully just a bout with the flu he had said if youd been up all night with diarrhea you wouldnt look in the pink either iron man just keep calm no matter what happens in there nicholas had advised theyll do everything they can to slow down the pace to equivocate while subtly needling us theyll want to get a glimpse inside our guard so they can study our strategy also they will need to know just how far they can push us to go beyond that would lose them great face he had shrugged its strictly sop tomkins haggard face leaned into his so that he could smell the others sour breath rising from his empty roiling intestines then you do something to shake em out of their standard operating procedure nick i dont give a goddamn how you do it just get it done im not one of those candyasses coming to japan hat in hand begging for an operating license fine then all we have to do is wait them out do i have to tell you again that patience is everything here its the one quality they cannot conceive of in a foreign devil dont worry ill get you what you want from them but tomkins voice changed and he clung onto nicholas arm like a child no no he breathed you dont understand nicky there isnt any time this deals got to be set by next week the latest his brown eyes turned inward i i have commitments i cant turn my back on therere great sums of money dependent on this merger loans that come due payments to be made above all payments debts to be fulfilled then refocusing the eyes came to rest on nicholas face you wont let me down nicky not now why youre almost my soninlaw nicholas turned away from the rainstreaked window as he heard tomkin return in a moment he felt the big mans presence beside him nows the time nicky tomkin whispered i almost hit nangi a couple of minutes ago theyre like goddamned mules it doesnt mean anything nicholas began theyre doing just what i told you they would do its only a matter of but tomkin had him by the coat sleeve now nicky we cant afford to wait you know that youve seen the reports for christs sake well be eaten alive back home then lets give them misawa we can build no tomkins tone was sharp misawas a nonnegotiable point no matter what understand nicholas took a hard look at his boss are you all right maybe i should call a doctor tomkin winced goddamned japanese bug im getting it from the inside as well as the outside he gave a short bark as if to dispel nicholas concern whatsamatter linnear dont you think i know the flu when i got it nicholas stared hard at him for another minute then gave a curt nod okay sit down at the table ill be there in a moment i want to be the last one then shut up and let me do the talking whatre you gonna say dont you like surprises not with a multimilliondollar merger tomkin muttered but did as he was told nicholas turned back to the blurred cityscape and thought of nothing behind him silence had settled over the room he could smell the tobacco from the fresh cigarette nangi had lit hear the soft whir of the central airconditioning nothing else strategy he went back to the master musashi what was called for here was a variation of existing attitudenonexisting attitude he had been taught that in battle when one takes up the katana whenever one springs strikes hits even parries the enemys sword one must cut the enemy in the same movement if one thinks only of springing striking hitting or parrying without the inner sense of cutting no damage will be done nicholas took three deep breaths he turned and went back to the conference table where the other five men were patiently awaiting him he now knew what he had to do but he required a clue to the japanese strategy before he could decide how to do it he looked to nangi who was in the process of tapping his cigarette on the edge of the ceramic ashtray before him like a conductor bringing the assembled to order perhaps we have covered as much ground today as it is possible to he said in a neutral tone of voice sato shook his head immediately in my experience bargaining is often difficult pathways are often locked for long periods at a time then quite suddenly are free i think we should continue nicholas watched this charade with intense interest he had encountered this bear and badger strategy before he knew it well in fact when he had been working for sam goldmans advertising agency in new york he had suggested just this line to take on a recalcitrant client it had worked quite well goldman had been the bear on that one the hard man that had made the client instinctively want to bring nicholas into his camp nicholas had played the badger the soft man to perfection before tomkin had a chance to respond nicholas said as far as i can see were at a total impasse i agree with nangisan i dont see where further discussion at this time will do any of us any good you want to break this off sato said somewhat incredulously so startled that he neglected to use the polite form of address nicholas nodded unless you can come up with a more constructive suggestion id say the best thing for all of us would be to cool off for a while the thing was to confuse the roles side with the bear rebuff the badger my feeling is sato said quietly that a recess will only solidify our respective positions the next time we meet i fear well be even further apart more committed to making a stand none of us i think wants a confrontation nicholas said carefully weve come here to work together for mutual profit he paused fully expecting tomkin to chime in with a statement reiterating the urgency of starting up the chipmanufacturing process but the other was silent we are all by now aware of the necessity for speed in setting up the sphynxsato kobun nicholas said i must tell you that there has already been a certain amount of er clandestine activity around our main sphynx locations in connecticut and in silicon valley we are quite frankly in a similar situation to the one in which you find yourselves here we are small with to be sure an enormous growth potential but for today we are overshadowed by the three or four giants who would literally give up half their net profits for the past five years to gain the secrets of the new sphynx tpram the totally programmable random access memory chip if you are having security difficulties ishii said rising to the bait you surely cannot expect us to lift a hand to help you not after the scandals of last year and the year before he was referring to the members of a number of japans most prominent computer companies being caught in their attempts at industrial spying in silicon valley you misunderstand me entirely nicholas said his tone as well as his words deliberately abrasive what i mean is that if attempts at industrial espionage against us are beginning in america it is only reasonable and prudent to expect the same situation to arise here other than the property in misawa which i think we are all agreed is perfect for our joint venture if of course you were not already in the process of greatly expanding the niwa mineral mining kobun what is available is a small but adequate tract in the middle of the keiyo industrial belt in chiba prefecture ishii nodded he was a bearlike individual roughly handsome with short bristly hair and clever eyes a soft brown color the muscles of his arms and chest rippled his suit jacket there is our perfect site nangi smiled thinly sensing the comer into which the gaijin had painted himself ishiisan is quite correct as you know keiyo is built on landfill reclaimed from tokyo bay it is close to the center of the city close to sato petrochemicals main offices and plants the logistics of shipment and transceiving would be greatly simplified and as such would more than compensate for the higher real estate cost of the land itself nangi sat back pleased with the way in which the negotiations were progressing but only nicholas could read that subtle display in a face that was in all ways perfectly serene he allowed a small silence to build before he leaned forward and directing his words at nangi in particular said but that is what worries me the most keiyos nearness to tokyo that closeness combined with the fact that our plant would be virtually surrounded by our larger and more powerful competitors fills me with alarm satosans konzern could not employ enough personnel to stave off the inevitable security problems nor would we want him to the cost as well as the added activity would surely be counterproductive to the new kobuns best interests while by contrast when we set up shop in misawa a small town far to the north of any major industrial center we would have as neighbors only niwa and the us army base neither of which as far as i can see pose any security threat to the sphynx tpram secrets he glanced down at several sheets of paper before him as if they pertained to what he was about to say and gentlemen as far as the lost land to niwa is concerned i have spoken to mr tomkin and he has agreed since at the time of our merger niwa will be one of our sister companies whose welfare we must take partial responsibility for to finance the purchase of new acreage so that the kobuns plans for immediate expansion will not be delayed in any way he spread his hands watching the awe suffuse the japanese faces now what could be fairer than a commotion just outside the office door caused him to break off several voices had been raised in alarm or anger then riding above these dominantly male voices was a higherpitched female voice much closer than the others now it was laced with an emotion close to hysteria in a moment the door had burst inward and miss yoshida halfstumbled in strands of black hair had come undone from her perfect coif and now drifted untended over her ears and eyes her face was pinched and all color seemed to have faded from her cheeks she bent at satos ear at first nangi who was still smarting from nicholas remarks paid her no attention he was far too angry but as miss yoshida continued with her whispered report as the sallowness of satos skin became more apparent he turned his withering gaze away he said nothing but watched carefully as miss yoshida her tale of woe completed stood up her eyes darted about the room like a pair of frightened plovers never coming to rest for long never looking any of the men around the table in the eye after a moment sato said to ishii please inform koten that he is needed then as the executive departed he leaned over and spoke for a moment into nangis ear the older mans body stiffened and he jerked away from sato as if the other were giving off an electric shock he turned his head you will excuse us now gentlemen i really must insist this meeting is at an end please see miss yoshida on the way out and she will schedule our next session but satos hand was on his arm if you dont mind nangisan i would like linnearsan to accompany us what nangis exclamation a breach at least as far as he was concerned of ironclad etiquette that history dictated could not be broken was quickly stifled he wanted to say that this was none of the gaijins business that taking him in on such a matter of utter privacy was dangerous but he had been taught never to argue with a family member whether business or blood in front of outsiders thus despite his bitter opposition he held his tongue merely bowed his head curtly please linnearsan sato said by way of explanation there has been a terrible tragedy i know of your skills he held up a hand as nicholas began to protest denials are really quite unnecessary he put his palms flat on the conference table but before we go i must have your own assurance that what you will see and hear will also be held strictly private nicholas understood the privilege he was being accorded and began to nod his head no member of my company will make such a unilateral promise tomkin said abruptly what you are asking could ultimately result in actions detrimental to tomkin industries he cannot make such a pledge i can nicholas said and i do you have my word satosan that i will reveal nothing of this to any outside party does that include the police what the hell is this tomkin cried whatre you two trying to pull he stood up cmon nick lets get out of here nicholas made no move to rise his gaze was locked with satos you ask for a great deal his voice was soft but nevertheless carried quite distinctly in the room miss yoshida had come out of her anxietyfilled reverie and now stood just behind sato staring fixedly at the two of them even tomkin had been silenced hai satos head nodded yes but it is no more than any business associate would ask of another this is family now you understand hai nicholas head bobbed as satos had a moment before my pledge stands it includes everyone well tomkin began i want no part of this nick if you think he froze as nicholas looked up at him the force of will behind those dark eyes so powerful he sat back down without a word when he had done so nicholas turned his head back to sato that goes for tomkinsan as well sato bowed good he stood up please follow me they were met at the elevator by ishii and another japanese this second man was enormous he was dressed in montsuki and hakama his blueblack hair was intricately coiffed in ichomage marking him as yokozuna a sumo grand champion sato introduced him as koten there was no doubt that he was a bodyguard nicholas stopped them in the corridor before the steam room the steam had been turned off in the room but still sato suggested they take off their jackets before entering miss yoshida draped each one carefully folded over her left arm she remained outside the door an odd glazedeye guard no one else was around jesus christ tomkin said when he saw the body half sprawled across the tile bench please be careful of the blood sato said and they all stayed on the perimeter of the room kagamisan was found just moments before miss yoshida interrupted our meeting nangi standing swaying slightly on his walking stick said nothing do you see his cheek sato asked the left one tomkin looked at sato hed had enough of staring at the mess lying across the room you sure dont seem broken up sato turned to him he is dead tomkinsan karma there is nothing i can do that will bring him back but he was with us for many years and i will miss him the privacy of grief is something that is understood here tomkin turned his head away put his hands in his pockets sato watched for a time then slowly redirected his gaze linnearsan his voice was quiet nicholas had not moved from the time he had entered the steam room and caught sight of the corpse his gaze had been immediately drawn to the mans left cheek it looks to me like a character kanji satos voice floated in the room all i see is blood nangi said curtly he was cut at least a dozen times without a word nicholas went carefully across the wet tile floor pink stringy puddles were everywhere but he moved with such care and grace that they were left undisturbed tomkin had seen nicholas move in such a way before the night in his office building when saigo had come to kill him with an abrupt movement like the skim of an insect across a still lake nicholas removed a handkerchief and carefully wiped away the trickles of semicoagulated blood from kagamis left cheek the breath whistled through nangis half open lips it u a character ink whats it mean tomkin asked wushing nicholas said he could not believe what he was seeing the blood pounded in his temples like a hammer on an anvil he felt lightheaded as if reality were slipping away from him thats chinese i know sato said and old chinese at that but without seeing the character i dont know what it means nicholas turned around his face pale it had been a decided effort to break away from the sight of this bloody crimson character glowing with evil intent he looked at all of them wushing he said slowly are a series of ritual punishments of chinese criminal law there was silence for a time sato looked from nicholas to the pathetic drained corpse of his employee and friend when he looked back again he said theres more isnt there nicholas nodded his eyes were sad he had never thought to say this in his life he turned back and again gazed at the glyph etched into human flesh terrible and mocking this is mo he said it means tattooing of the face and it is the first of the mutilating punishments taught at the tenshin shoden katori his heart was breaking as he turned back to them he could look at the glowing character no more that is the ninja ryu from which i came nicholas was on his way to tomkins room when the call came through that fragile line connecting them so tenuously justines voice thin and stretched out by the electronics of the medium made it seem as if he had been away from her for weeks i miss you so nick west bay bridge isnt the same without you id love to be in a foreign place with you japans not foreign he said without thinking its too much like home even now after all this time belatedly he heard the terror in her voice but he could do nothing about it my soul is japanese he said i told you that when we first met outwardly perhaps i am my fathers son but inside the kami of my mother resides i can no more do anything about it than i can pull the clouds down from the sky i wouldnt want to there was silence for a time the gentle wheezing of the unquiet wire unable to hide from him the soughing of her breath you wont want to stay will you her voice as tiny as a childs he laughed permanently good god no whatever gave you that idea please let me come nick i can be on a plane tonight i promise i wont be in the way i just want to be near you to hold you again justine he said as gently as he could its just not possible theres too much to do here wed have no time together not even at night this isnt a ninetofive business i think i liked you better when you were doing nothing im happier now justine nick please let me come i wont be its out of the question ill be home soon enough that singing down the wire as if kami hovering were growing restless the truth is im frightened nick ive been having a recurring dream a kind of premonition im scared something awful is going to happen to you and ill be left here her voice choked off abruptly then therell be no one justine he said quietly everythings fine and its going to stay that way as soon as i get back well get married nothings going to prevent that silence he pushed the thought of the murder out of his mind justine i heard you her voice was so still he had to strain to hear her i love you he said hanging up the phone was there something more he could have said he wondered sometimes her irrationality was impossible to control fears in the night phobias the terror of darkness these were all alien to him and he had difficulty understanding the fixity of their power over others not like him nick what the hells going on here grayfaced tomkin hung onto the door frame leading from the bedroom of the suite to the large bath i come to tokyo to negotiate a straightahead business merger and suddenly were involved with a weird cultlike murder i couldve gone to southern california if id wanted that nicholas smiled thinly at the semblance of humor sat down on the corner of the kingsize bed they were back at the okura it was late in the evening and neither had eaten since breakfast which for tomkin had been nothing more than tea and toast which he had immediately vomited up lets eat first nicholas said well talk afterwards the hell we will tomkin said as he came unsteadily into the bedroom you seem to know more about this what did you call it wushing yeah youre the expert give me an explanation nicholas ran his fingers through his hair traditionally there are five punishments each one a response to a more serious offense therefore each punishment is more severe than the last so whats that got to do with sato petrochemicals i dont know for a moment tomkin peered down at the younger man then he went slowly to his dresser and pulled on a pair of faded jeans a blue chambray workshirt he slipped on a pair of shiny black handstitched moccasins i guess youre as hungry as a bear nicholas looked up arent you frankly the sight of food nauseates me im running a lowgrade fever so that doesnt surprise me ill let this thing run its course he paused and dont look at me like that you remind me of my mother when you do im perfectly all right the phone rang and tornkin went to answer it he spoke in low tones for some time then cradled the receiver that was greydon he wanted permission to go up to misawa to see his son apparently the boys stationed at the air base there hes a fighter pilot and is scheduled to go up on one of the first test runs of those new fs weve just imported i think greydon feels theres some danger hes quite right nicholas said stationed at misawa puts those supersonic jets just air miles from the soviet unions pacific coast and vladivostok tomkin shrugged his shoulders so what harm can they possibly do those fs have nuclear capacity nicholas said and the russiansre worried as hell about them which is why weve seen an increased soviet military buildup in the kuriles over the past year of an alarming size the kuriles the kurile islands theyre the chain just to the north of hokkaido japans most northerly island the one where the winter olympics were held in in effect they connect the southeast of russia to japan in a series of steppingstones the kuriles had been japanese territory until they were seized the japanese say illegally in at the close of the war quite naturally they want them back nicholas got up from the bed recent reports tell us that there are over forty thousand russian troops currently stationed in the kuriles quite recently they sent in a squadron of twelve supersonic mig fighterbombers to replace the subsonic migs which they obviously felt were overmatched by the fs theyve got an air base on etorufu or as they call it iturup you sure seem to know a lot about this it concerns japan tomkin nicholas said evenly so it concerns me the situations serious grey dons got every right to be anxious i hope you gave him the weekend off weve only got the wedding tomorrow and negotiations wont resume until monday hes booking his flight now tomkin said archly that meet with your approval if greydons son doesnt make it back from that flight youll be happy you let him see the kid there was silence for a time the phone rang again but neither of them made a move to answer it in a moment it stopped and the tiny red light on the base began to wink on and off i told you before tomkin said at last that my old man was a real sonuvabitch i cant tell you how much i hated him sometimes he put his palms together as if he were praying but i loved him too nick no matter what he did to me or my mother he was my father do you understand it was a rhetorical question and nicholas remained silent tomkin sighed i guess in some ways i turned out just like him years ago i could not have believed such a thing possible but the passing time his voice fell off time has way of molding people to its own ends you remember chris i know justine mustve told you about him he was the last of her boyfriends before she met you he was the biggest bastard of the lot he was sexy as hell he seduced her made her move to san francisco she was using her real name tomkin then she got a monthly stipend from me it was very generous and she took it all it his eyes slid away for a moment searching perhaps for a place to hide he took a deep shuddering breath it made me feel better that she took it all it assuaged my guilt for all the years id accepted her presence her demands on my time only when it suited me they were fucking like bunnies out there the relationship was all sex or so i thought justine wanted more money then more still finally i hired a team of detectives to find out just what the hell was going on two weeks later i took the corporate jet and flew out i presented my darling daughter with all the evidence i packed her up and took her home that afternoon before chris got back tomkin seemed to be having difficulty breathing as the emotions surged within him the shit was using my money he stopped abruptly his eyes wide and feverish justines money to finance an ongoing cocaine deal he was a user himself and besides he was unfaithful to her every day of their relationship he made a disgusted sound she hates me for interfering though thats a helluva laugh isnt it he was slowly killing her with his infidelities and his craziness hed beat her and his throat seized up on him he ran a hand through his damp hair but at least she has you now nicky thats the most important thing for all this time tomkin had not taken his eyes off nicholas he was a shrewd man with an acute analytical mind his intolerance of foreign custom and his lack of patience in no way negated that fact now its your turn youre dragging your feet about something his voice was quiet with more strength in it than had been apparent for several days he sounded almost like a father i think youd better tell me what it is because i have a funny feeling in my gut it has to do with that wo ching or whatever you call it tomkin nick youve got a duty to me youve gotta tell me what you know all of it nicholas sighed i had hoped not to tell you why for christs sake ive got a right to know if im putting my neck on the chopping block nicholas nodded yes you do he looked directly at tomkin but the simple truth is ive got nothing definite no cold facts and figures like the soviet buildup in the kuriles here as happens often in japan there is nothing but legend legend tomkin laughed uneasily what is this the start of a vampire movie he cocked an ear jesus i hear the wolves howling nick it must be a full moon tonight wed better stay indoors and hang up all the garlic stop it nicholas said shortly this is precisely why id hoped not to tell you tomkin proffered an upraised palm all right he crossed back to the bed sat down i promise to be a good boy and listen nicholas stared at him for a moment before beginning at the tenshin shoden katori ryu where i received my ninjutsu training where the wushing was taught this legend was told and believed in the old days when only the ainu inhabited the nippon islands and true civilization had not yet spread southeast from china ninjutsu was in its infancy on the asian continent it was still too early in the disciplines life for there to have been sensei true masters or even as there are now jonin ryu patriarchs simply because the differentiated schools of ninjutsu were barely formed there was much more ritual then more superstition the thinkingamong what sennin adepts existed was rigid and unyielding principally because the forces they were working with were still so newly strange and deadly potent thus any deviation was summarily condemned wholesale nicholas paused here to pour himself a glass of water he drank half of it and continued as the legend goes there was one sennin more powerful than the rest his name was hsing which has many meanings in kanji his meant shape it is said that hsing walked only in the darkness that it was his only lover his devotion to his craft caused him to be celibate and also unlike his compatriots he took only one pupil a strange wildhaired boy from the steppes far to the north where the mongols dominated this student of hsings it was whispered could not speak any civilized dialect nor could he read mandarin yet he conversed fluently with hsing no one knew how yet the other sennin began to suspect that hsing was slowly expanding his scope of ninjutsu knowledge experimenting in the darker unknown aspects which the others shunned iis power grew even greater and at last in fear or perhaps simple envy the other sennin massed against him and destroyed him nicholas eyes were alight and although it was now deepest night outside and though the lamps in the suite were turned low still tomkin saw him clearly every detail etched against the light glow for a moment the bustling modern world had faded and the mistshrouded asian past was being recreated before him plunging him into a world of arcane laws the murderous sennin nicholas continued were content with driving off the wildhaired student shouting derisively to him that he should return to the northern steppes from whence he had come but they had not reckoned with hsings power apparently his death had come too late for he had already created from his pupil akuma what the japanese call an evil spirit a demon with jit suryoku superhuman powers oh please nick thiss you asked to hear this tomkin kindly have the courtesy to hear the legend through but this is the stuff of fairy tales hsing had taught the pupil all he knew about jaho nicholas said ignoring him a kind of magic oh theres nothing supernatural about this im not speaking now of spells and incantations demons out of some fictitious hell dreamed up by the mind of man saigo had studied the kobudera that is jaho he practiced saiminjutsu on your daughter that too is a form of jaho tomkin nodded okay i can accept that but whats all this got to do with the murder nicholas took a deep breath the only recorded instance of death in conjunction with the first four wushing the fifth ritual punishment is death concerns hsings pupil who began a series of just such murders in kaifeng bloody horrific terrifying they enacted a perverse poetic justice on those who had destroyed his sennin he had become mahdzukai a sorcerer akiko ofuda wore a snowwhite kimono heavy with handstitched brocade over it she wore a light silk dress the precise shade of the last of the cherry blossoms bobbing in the breeze above her head her hair was hidden beneath the ornate tresses of a gleaming wig these swirls and complex loops were surmounted by a tsunokakushi the hornhider a ceremonial white hat with wide brim said to be worn to hide whatever bad parts of a woman existed her eyes were large and clear through the delicate makeup her face was very white her lips a startling splash of crimson she wore no earrings or other jewelry in her right hand was clutched a closed fan saturday had dawned bright and clear with just a hint of the crispness of march the preceding month the enormous crimson camphorwood torii symbol of the shinto shrine rose over the heads of the still assembling guests who according to the final count of rsvps were going to number over five hundred morning mist still clung to the steep hillsides feathering the boles of the cedars and fir obscuring the sapphire glint of the lake far below at the guests backs huddled the dense and hazy superstructure of the northwestern edge of tokyo the four buildings of the temple spread out in a rough horseshoe their cedarbeamed canted roofs with the raised ribs striping the sunlight into shadow and gloss the guests milled about chattering among themselves commenting on the fine weather gossiping about late arrivals or even in one or two instances forging the underpinnings of an important deal a great majority of the countrys foremost business and bureaucratic leaders were in attendance seiichi sato looked from the beautiful face of his bride to the milling throng of guests as he recognized a face from business he recited to himself the mans name and position then filled in the appropriate slot on an imaginary pyramid in his mind the structure he was forming was important to him the face he gained at this marriage would go a song way toward furthering the prestige of the keiretsu while akikos parents were dead the name ofuda still ranked as most prestigious tracing its origins all the way back to the time of leyasu tokugawa that first ofuda tatsunosuke was his name was a great daimyo an ingenious tactical commander whose genius for victory on the field of battle was called on many times by leyasu it pained him to know that akiko had never known her parents that she had no relatives in fact save the gravely ill aunt whom she visited so frequently in kyushu sato had a brief somber flash of gotaros broad smiling face sato knew well the grief at a family cut off at the waist how gotaro would have loved this day how his smile would have driven the morning mist into the lake how his great barking laugh so like a triumphant shout would have echoed and reechoed through these woods so that even the small creatures in their burrows might know the extraordinary joy of this day sato passed a hand quickly across his eyes using the pads of his fingers to wipe away the specks of wetness there why do this to yourself he asked silently gotaro is gone kare wa gaikoku ni itte i masu satos mother had said when he brought her the news he has gone abroad and never said another word she had already lost her husband now the death of her oldest son was too much for her to bear she did not survive the war though she was not burned by the bombs the war had devoured her from within no sato said to himself now do not be like your mother kare wa shinde shimai mashita banish gotaros kami he is dead and gone and he turned to masuto ishii speaking to him of business matters of import to both of them in order to banish his sorrow or at the very least to keep it at bay on this happiest of days not far away tanzan nangi stood with his back ramrod straight his bony knuckles enwrapping the white jade dragon capping his hardwood cane pain girdled him from standing so long but he would not move it had been his duty to be among the first to arrive here no one else was sitting so he could not either further he would not lose face to these priests nangi would have preferred of course for sato to have had this ceremony in a christian church the vestments the sacraments the soft latin litany that he could understand fully and respond to were comforts to him that arcane shintoism could not be ghosts and spirits were not nangis way and spending ones life placating a bewildering variety of kami seemed farcical to him he believed fervently in christ the resurrection and holy salvation he was with a younger man in the eye of one of the main eddies they enjoyed almost constant attention from both newly arriving guests and those who had been there for some time who having observed a proper interval now were returning to seek advice from nangi or tidbits of news of miti from riuichi yano the new minister he was nangis protegd and nangis last official act before he left that organization six years ago had been to assure that yano would succeed him as he smiled and spoke thoughtfully answering all questions as best he could nangi kept a sharp eye out for the gaijin he wished to monitor their movements from the time they arrived one could divine much from observing the enemy at play akiko too had one eye out for the gaijin but only for one nicholas this was the moment and her eyes were like cameras ready to record the event to drink in expressions and emotions she felt her pulse racing her heartbeat seemed to flutter her kimono she used her training to calm herself to gather her resources for the beginning of her revenge she forced herself to concentrate on satos presence beside her she looked his way saw instead ishii staring at her with hooded eyes he smiled and nodded turned back to his murmured conversation with sato there was a rustling through the assembled guests just the tiniest of ripples but akiko her senses finely attuned shifted her gaze the mask of a smile was frozen on her intensely crimson lips her white face perfect as she saw the throng begin to part at its farthest reaches ah sato said turning tomkin and linnear are here at last slowly as if in a dream she had composed innumerable times akiko raised one hand her fingers spreading open her fan of gilt red and jet so that only the edge of one eye could be seen the rest of her face was hidden softly she thought softly dont give away too much not yet give him time to approach come closer nicholas she willed him drawn to her come closer and begin the destruction of your life she could distinguish the two gaijin now one broader than the other but both tall towering above the other guests she could pick out nicholas features as the gaijin continued to make their way through the throng tomkin wore a dark pinstripe with white shirt and rep tie nicholas had chosen a less conservative suit of sea green linen a gray shirt and a tie as blue as an ocean trough his widecheeked face was still in shadow as the two passed through the long stand of tall bamboo but akiko could already discern the odd tilted eyes neither truly caucasian nor oriental they gave him a quality she could not understand once again she felt the same kind of magnetic wave she had experienced in jan jan and she had to will herself to remain where she was at satos side now they were very close indeed nicholas face sprang into the sunlight as if abruptly brought into focus in the center of a lens the gusting wind took a lock of his dark hair sent it curling down across his forehead automatically his hand came up to push it away a bar of shadow racing across those strong confident features not for long akiko whispered to herself the moment was almost at hand and she knew that she had orchestrated it to perfection a sense of intense excitement of ecstasy almostgyred within her fueling her for what was about to happen the tiny pink tip of her tongue flicked out to moisten her lip as she watched the litheness with which he moved the low center of gravity which propelled him with such controlled power the training of dance or sumo in her minds eye he became the great tiger lord of the earth padding with great stealth and coordination through the dense forest prepared at any instant to make his prodigious killing leap onto the back of a lesser animal turning to flee his presence now the moment was here at last akiko waited until his gaze slid up turning from sato to her he was understandably curious he had never seen her before and he must want to know what kind of woman sato was about to marry she felt the intensity of his gaze he held on her fan then her eye their eyes locked and for an unfathomable instant akiko felt suspended in time and space all the preparations the arduous years flew by her again in the brilliant flash of a film montage to culminate here now with a firm hand she lowered her fan exposing her face when nicholas emerged from the limousine that had brought them out of tokyo he was first struck by the natural beauty of the setting on the way they had skirted the large lake moving away from its placid mistcovered surface as they began to wind their way up toward the cliff upon which the shinto shrine was situated it was not surprising to him that the priests had chosen this spot to build their temple shintoism was an attuning of the soul toward nature lifes currents karma ones life was a part of a much vaster skein in which every living thing human animal vegetable and mineral played its role nicholas spirit expanded outward his heart soaring as he put his feet down on the loamy pineneedled earth the wind was fresh and warmth was already creeping into the air soon the mist would disappear from the boles of the pines and the skin of the lake the view would be fantastic then he was aware of the wings rushing by overhead the rustling of the great branches the concerted sway of the stand of bamboo the buzz of insects was in his ears as the breeze flapped his jacket then lastly he recognized the stir within the crowd it was subtle and he was doubtful whether tomkin was even aware of it but nicholas knew the gaijin were here even him nangi had made it eminently clear that many did not consider him a japanese as he passed through them looking from face to face he wondered what they privately thought of colonel linnear nicholas father were they proud of how he had helped in the rebuilding of japan when he was brought in by mac arthurs scap forces or did they secretly revile his memory because he was a foreign devil at work in japan there was no accurate way of knowing and nicholas preferred to believe that at least some of them like sato still honored his memory nicholas knew that his father had been a great man that he had fought long and hard against some deadly opposition to create a new and democratic superstructure for the postwar nation to rebuild itself jesus these bastardsre small tomkin whispered to him out of the side of his mouth i feel like a bull in a china shop they were heading toward sato nicholas could see him clearly with koten the giant sumo looking grotesque in a suit not far away and by his side a slim elegant woman in the traditional brides garb nicholas tried to get a good look at her but she was holding a ceremonial fan spread across her face the tsunokakushi hid the top of her head completely if this were any other country tomkin said softly i wouldnt even be here i still feel like shit face said nicholas yeah tomkin tried to cover his sour expression with a smile face is gonna kill me one of these days now they had come almost all the way through the mingling guests nicholas could see nangi off to the right amid a dense swirl of darksuited men it looked as if the higher echelons of seven or eight ministries were present they stopped a few feet away from sato and his bridetobe tomkin took one step forward about to greet sato and congratulate him nicholas was gazing at akiko wondering what features lay behind the mask of the golden fan then almost magically in response to his wish the fan came down and all the breath left his lungs he stepped backward a pace as if pushed by an invisible hand his eyes opened wide and his lips parted no it was a whisper that seemed a shout to him blood rushed uncontrollably in his ears and the beating of his heart seemed painful tears broke the corners of his long eyes trembling with the enormous force of his emotions the past was rising up like a haunted demon to inexplicably confront him again but the dead could not rise their bodies were laid to rest and were decomposed by the elements earth air fire water she had been murdered by saigo because she belonged to nicholas body and soul and could never be his he had drowned her in the straits of shimonoseki where the kami of the heik clan etched the backs of the crabs into human countenances she was gone and yet here she was standing a foot away from him it was impossible but true yukio marianas islands north pacific ocean spring what tanzan nangi remembered most vividly about the war were the red skies there seemed no gentle color left in the world when the sun rose over the vast heaving bosom of the pacific only slashes of fierce orange and crimson like the vast tentacles of some monstrous sea creature emerging from the seabed at the suns slow dawning the long nights of the engines thrumming the constant vibration of the mighty screws of the carrier as it plowed southward past the small black humps of the bonin islands gave way grudgingly to days filled with blinding light cloud cover hung far off and mocking at the edge of the horizon they were only a thousand nautical miles from tokyo yet the weather here was so much different there was a great deal of speculation on the part of the men as to what their destination would be they were not part of a fleet they had no escort they had even put to sea in the dead of night when only a scattering of bare bulbs burned here and there along the great military harbor casting hard shadows across the gently rippling water hunched guards spoke in whispers and studiously ignored the careful progress of the carrier out into open waters they were traveling under sealed orders that much captain noguchi had told them he had meant it to squelch rumors but it only had the opposite effect where were they bound at night after all lights had been extinguished the men huddled in their cramped windowless quarters to discuss issues and destinations it had been gotaro sato who had been certain they were bound for the marianas most of the other men found that idea preposterous the marianas were far too close to japan for there to be any fighting and this was most definitely a war mission of the highest priority as captain noguchi had made clear to them in his speech but the idea of the marianas piqued nangis imagination and after the men broke up he sought gotaro out gotaro sato was a bear of a man thicknecked and roundfaced he had wide shrewd eyes that revealed nothing but far from emotionless he was given to wild bursts of great good humor he had the ability of knowing when a dose of his absurd wit he was a prankster would cool tensions or allay fears and in those dark days deep in the final months of the war there was plenty of both the allies had already won two long extremely hard fought campaigns the first in the solomons late in and more recently in new guinea everyone knew they were heading inexorably toward japan and they looked toward their leaders for a supreme strategy to alter the tide of the bitter conflict they went up on deck gotaro took out a cigarette then thought better of lighting up the pacific lay dark and foreboding all around them and not for the first time nangi experienced an eerie chill he was a brave man and the thought of death in battle a samurais proud end did not disturb him yet out here with only the depths of the sea surrounding him so very far from any land mass his stomach was never calm its the marianas gotaro said staring south the way they were headed and ill tell you why if the americans are not already there they soon will be we have an air base there the islands are no more than fifteen hundred nautical miles from home his head turned as a sudden gust of wind came up feathering his short hair can you imagine a better target for the allies to base and fuel their own planes for bombing runs into japan i cant there was no humor in him now as he leaned his elbows on the metal bars of the top rail the sea hissed by far below them despite himself nangi felt a terrible despair engulfing him then there can be no doubt the war is surely lost no matter what the imperial command tells us gotaro turned to him his eyes bright amid the shadows of the carriers many tiered superstructure the proximity to so much reinforced metal was chilling coming as they did from a culture intent on building structures of wood and rice paper have faith at first nangi was not sure that he had heard the other man correctly faith he said after a pause and when gotaro nodded said faith in what our emperor the imperial command the zaibatsu tell me which of our many traditional icons shall i bow down to tonight he heard the bitterness in his voice but he did not care this night so far from home so close to the utter alienness of the battle lines seemed meant for a venting of emotion long bottled up greed got us into this mad war he rushed on before the other could answer his rhetorical questions the blind ambition of the zaibatsu who persuaded the government that japan was not a large enough area for their empire expand expand expand they counseled and the war seemed like a superb excuse to carve out the niche we had long been seeking in asia but gotarosan answer me this did they attempt to get a sense of our enemy before the attack on pearl harbor was ordered he shook his head oh no no not a jot of ink was put to paper not a moment of research was applied he smiled grimly history gotaro if they had known or understood anything about american history they would have perhaps been able to anticipate the response to their attack nangis gaze dropped the fierceness went out of his voice now what will happen to us in the end have faith gotaro said again trust in god god now nangi began to understand he turned toward gotaro youre a christian arent you the big man nodded my family does not know i cannot think that they would understand nangi stared at him for a time but why because gotaro said softly for me there is no more fear at on the morning of march nangi was summoned to the captains cabin for a briefing dressed smartly in his pressed uniform he moved down the silent narrow corridors up the ringing metal companionways he might have had the entire carrier to himself the kami of the ancient shogun seemed to walk with him a descending line of invincible samurai with the wiles of the fox the strength of the tiger that he of all the men on board should be summoned seemed a clear sign of his karma though he disagreed with the war his soul still belonged to japan now that they were in the thick of it what frightened him was the specter of defeat perhaps he was to be a part of the new strategy perhaps the war was not yet lost he rapped softly on the captains whitepainted door with his knuckles then went in he was surprised to find gotaro there as well please be seated major captain noguchi said after the traditional formalities had been dispensed with nangi took a chair next to gotaro you know major sato noguchi said in his clippsd tones his bullet head bobbed good a steward appeared bringing a tray of sake he set it down in the center of noguchis desk and departed it is the middle of march in what we all fear may be the last year of the war noguchi was quite calm his eyes boring into first nangi then gotaro magnified through the circular lenses of his steelrimmed spectacles he was a powerfully built man who emitted confidence and energy he had intelligent eyes beneath heavy brows a wide thicklipped mouth and odd splayed ears that stuck out from his closecropped head like mushroom caps the european playwright shakespeare wrote that these days are the ides an evil time noguchi smiled at least they were for julius caesar he spread his long delicately fingered hands on his desk top and perhaps they will be so for the allies he had the habit of looking directly at you when he spoke instead of away as so many of his fellow upperechelon officers did nangi felt instinctively that this was one source of the confidence he instilled in his men within the month the cherry blossoms will again come to the slopes and valleys of our homeland his eyes blazed with light the enemy threatens the extinction of the cherry blossom as he threatens our very lives his chest heaved as if he had gotten something hard and ugly off his mind at this very moment the mechanics are preparing another kind of cherry blossom for you two majors i see the perplexed look on your faces i will explain he got up from behind his desk and set about pacing back and forth in the small cabin as if he was beginning to generate too much energy to be held to a sitting position we have precisely one hundred fifty planes on board all save one are mitsubishi g me bombers the ones the enemy calls bettys in an inexplicable form of derision his closed fist slammed the desk making the tiny cups quiver and rock where even the sea could not but no more not now that we have the oka he turned toward them one of our mitsubishis has been modified beneath its fuselage is another smaller craft a singleseat midwing monoplane of a length of just over nineteen feet and with a wingspan of sixteen feet fifteen inches the oka will be bome aloft by the mitsubishi mother plane at an altitude of feet the two craft will separate the oka will be able to cruise up to fifty miles at an effective airspeed of two hundred thirty miles per hour when it comes within sighting distance of its target the pilot will cut in its three solidfuel rocket motors the craft will then be flying at almost six hundred miles per hour noguchi was standing directly in front of them now his cheeks red from the height of his emotion for a period of nine seconds the oka will have a total thrust of pounds a great rush of momentum and then his head lifted up and his eyes went opaque as his lenses caught the light reflecting it back at them in a dazzle then you will become the avenging sword of the emperor opening up the side of an american warship nangi remembered this quite clearly noguchi did not ask either of them if they understood but of course they did the oka was a rocket bomb manned for supreme accuracy yamatodamashii noguchi said now returning to his seat behind his desk the japanese spirit will be our bulwark against the superior material force of the allies that and the oka attacks will quickly demoralize the advancing enemy we will blunt their coining attack on the philippines noguchi began to pour the sake handed a gleaming porcelain cup to each of them and lifting his made this toast a man has only one death that death may be as weighty as fujiyama or it may be as light as feather down it all depends on the way he uses it it is the nature of every japanese to love life and hate death to think of his family and care for his wife and children only when a man is moved by higher principles by junsuisei the purity of resolve is this not so then there are things which he must do they all drank together nangi saw that there were tears in the corners of gotaros eyes at the time he supposed they were because of either his christianity or his ignorance what captain noguchi had used for their fond farewell masquerading as his own words nangi recognized as an excerpt from a letter famous in chinese history it had in fact been written in bc by ssuma chien noguchi put down his cup you two are privileged to be the first to war test this new and devastating weapon against the allies you are the first two recruits in what will come to be known as shimpu tokubetsu kogekitai the divine wind special attack force this is your opportunity to follow in major odas footsteps to become a reincarnation of shimpu the divine winds of and which drowned the invading mongol hordes rescuing nippon from their destruction both nangi and gotaro indeed everyone in the japanese imperial navy had heard the story of the pilot oda who had taken his ki fighter into the side of an american b bomber tearing the larger airship in two thus saving an entire japanese convoy he had been a sergeant then in death he had been promoted twice major sato noguchi was saying now you have been selected to guide the first oka to its flaming destiny major nangi you will pilot the mother ship he glanced down at a sheaf of papers we have been informed of an allied sighting a battleship and a destroyer the vanguard no doubt of a larger fleet heading toward the marianas the destroyer is your target the ships are now he consulted his dispatches again three hundred fifty miles southwest of the island of guam when you leave this cabin you will go directly abovedecks your flight gear will be waiting for you you will take off at will be in the conning tower to observe you firsthand he stood up the briefing was over the predawn air was chill with a gusting inconstant wind quartering in from the northeast nangi and gotaro clad in their flight suits walked across the vast expanse of the carriers open deck before them loomed the humpbellied shape of the twin aircraft as disfigured as a leper i have more flight time than you nangi said they should have chosen me for the oka gotaro smiled there are few like you left tanzan most of them coming up now are raw recruits with little or no training with that in mind with the war having so completely depleted us do you think it a wise decision to test this flying bomb with a veteran pilot he shrugged his shoulders what possible good would it do when those who will follow the true members of shimpu tokubetsu kdgekitai will know nothing he shook his head no my friend they have made the correct choice he was upwind of nangi when he abruptly stopped and turned to face him his body blocked the fierce bite of the wind from nangis face gotaro produced a white square from a pocket luminous in the werelight here he said this is for you a hachimaki he tied it around nangis helmet there with that ancient symbol of determination and derringdo you look just like the other meaning of shimpu do you know it nangi shook his head in tokyo these days ive heard the term is used in a humorous way to describe the daredevil taxi drivers kamikaze gotaro laughed i would have called you that in noguchis cabin but it is surely too lighthearted a word for him this is quite a solemn moment for him nangi squinted up at his friend and for you gotarosan knowing what must be the end of this mission i have faith my friend the big man said i have no thought but to serve my country theyre mad if they think this oka will frighten the americans more likely knowing them as i do they will laugh at it they have no concept of seppuku the warriors way of death so much the worse for them gotaro said for this has surely been a war of misunderstanding i cannot think of what will happen to us or what may come after i have my duty to perform in all else i put my trust in god the wind was picking up as the high bowl of the heavens began to lighten pitch black fading to a deep cerulean down low in the east where the sea met the sky there were already the first fugitive streaks of pink rising gotaro reached out listen my friend captain noguchi was right we all love life that too is our duty but there are higher principles than self that is one of the first teachings of christianity the mechanics took over as they came up on the halftarpaulined planes they took them through a brief but explicit tour of the tandem units there wasnt much to see actually the twinengined mitsubishi had been stripped down to accommodate the intrusive hump of the stubby oka it had also been converted so that one man the pilot could fly it satisfactorily beneath was the cherry blossom when nangi poked his head inside he was inwardly appalled it appeared to be nothing more than a flying coffin with almost no equipment only a steering mechanism and a speaking tube to allow communication with the pilot of the mitsubishi the mechanics explained that gotaro would sit in the larger craft with nangi until their target was sighted then he would slide down through the modified bomb bay doors into the tiny cockpit of the oka all phases of the mission were gone over in detail and then the two majors were asked to repeat the drill by that time it was they climbed into the mitsubishi the sea was a sheet of flame reflecting along its vast rippling skin the rising of the bloodred sun for a time all blue was banished from the sky as the lurid tendrils of light floated higher for nangi and gotaro there was only the monotonous thrumming of the twin engines the steady vibration now nangi began to understand the desperation of his country this was a plane he was quite used to and the differences in flight were considerable it had been stripped down in more ways than the mechanics had cared to mention of course there was no armament that had been apparent on the ground at first inspection but a great deal of the inner insulation of the plane was also gone nangi supposed that some of this was essential in order to offset the fully loaded weight pounds of the oka there were over pounds of high explosive in its nose and yet the farther he flew this new plane the more he became convinced that even more than was strictly necessary had been taken out he thought of what gotaro had said about the sad state of japans military manpower didnt it follow then that the same might hold true for materiel were they already down to cannibalizing planes would that mean that by years end untrained teenagers would have rifles shoved into their soft fists and be cast off from the japanese shore in rowboats to meet the advancing enemy nangi shuddered at the thought and made a minor course correction just behind him gotaro acting as navigator for the moment studied the aerial map of the north pacific he glanced at his watch and leaning forward to make certain nangi could hear him over the ferocious din of the aircraft engines said we should be sighting them in just under ten minutes approximately two hundred fifty miles southwest of guam he looked at his map again that will put them and us almost directly over the marianas trench that is supposed to be the deepest depression on earth i know nangi had to yell to be heard im trying not to think about it i read somewhere that scientists have guessed it might be more than forty thousand feet deep he shuddered dont worry gotaro said lightly neither you nor i will touch water on this mission just over six minutes later gotaro touched nangis shoulder pointed south the unbroken skin of the pacific seemed placid and so flat it might have been a sheet of gunmetal solid and unyielding then following the others finger nangi saw the two tiny specks he made another minor course adjustment time gotaro said in his ear nangi was trimming airspeed wait he called but when he turned his head his friend was already gone nangi could picture him slithering down the makeshift tunnel into the dark cramped coffinlike cockpit here i am nangi heard gotaros voice emerging through the top end of the speaking tube he lowered the flaps and they began their descent he kept gotaro informed every step of the way were at thirtyfive thousand feet i can just make out some definition in the target ive got the destroyer gotaro said just get me there on time ill do the rest nangis skilled hands were busy bringing the plane down on course he felt keenly the hachimaki wound tightly around his helmet and he said satosan yes my friend what was there to say twentynine thousand feet and closing were right on target he put his hand up to touch the white cloth fluttering slightly in the chill air the sky was enormous off to the left dark cumulus clouds were building along the horizon and nangi was mindful of the first abrupt shift in wind direction still rich sunlight splattered the target area the sea stretched away limitless twentyeight thousand nangi said and put his hand on the oka release lever ill give you a secondbysecond countdown gotaro must have heard something in his voice because he said take it easy now my friend dont worry unlike you i have no faith to believe in nangi shored up his emotions the altimeter was hovering near the cutoff point soon the oka would be but a swiftly falling blossom dropping toward the bosom of the pacific it is time we said our goodbyes the droning of the wind and then drifting up to him from the speaking tube came gotaros voice today in flower tomorrow scattered by the wind such is our blossom life how can we think its fragrance lasts forever there were tears in nangis eyes as he pulled the lever goodbye he whispered a moment later the rockets came on abruptly the mitsubishi canted over horribly at first nangi thought they had been hit by enemy fire but they were still too far away from their target for the ships guns and the sky had been clear of enemy aircraft then with one wingtip pointing toward the roof of the heavens the nose went almost straight down and he knew with a sudden chilling certainty what had occurred the wind was moaning through the stripped down fuselage as he leaned forward screaming into the speaking tube gotaro gotaro im stuck in here still plastered to your underbelly the rockets are misfiring i cant bring the nose up frantically he worked at the controls but it was useless he knew that they were not meant to correct for pounds of thrust they were hurtling out of control heading toward the flat bed of the sea at a heartstopping six hundred miles an hour still nangi did not give up hope and he did what he could to slow their terrific rate of descent the rockets cut off after nine seconds but their tremendous initial thrust had done thek damage get back up here nangi cried as he tried to regain control of the aircraft i dont want you in the belly when we hit the water there was no answer but nangi was too busy at the controls to repeat his urgent message now that the rockets were off some semblance of control returned to the plane but they were dangerously close to the sea and nangi realized there was no hope of pulling out of the spin the mitsubishis twin engines just could not cope with the powerful thrust of the rockets misdirected fire the airframe was juddering dangerously and because of the acute horizontal angle with which they were dropping he was afraid a wing would crack off if that happened he knew there would be no chance for them at all the ungainly craft would plunge like a stone into the wall of the ocean crushing them instantaneously so nangi abandoned the impossible task of pulling them out of the dive and instead redirected his attention to rectifying the angle if he could level them off somewhat they would have a chance of survival the oka would be sheared off as they hit but as long as gotaro was out of there that would be all right the stubby plane would take the brunt of the force out of the windscreen the sky was pinwheeling merging with the sea back and forth like a funhouse ride the fuselage was screaming as the force of gravity applied pressure to the riveted joints the sea was clear of the enemy and there was nothing on the horizon but the storm piling up purple and yellow like a bruise they were very close to the water now and nangi began to hear a high thin wailing above the rest of the sounds inundating him and he began to sweat the top wing had still not come down far enough and now the stress on it was horrendous there were only seconds left before he knew it would shear off plunging them to their death he did not want to be crushed inside this steel coffin and he worked even more frantically at the controls he felt a pressure on his back then gotaros big hand gripping his shoulder and he thought it took him long enough he was angry with himself and with gotaro because of the added anxiety it had caused him the sea was coming up fast and now he thought it doesnt matter if the angle doesnt kill us the explosives in the nose of the oka surely will but still he worked on and the upper wing grudgingly began to level off they were now no more than five hundred feet off the water and nangi wondered if he had left it too late because they were falling falling like a leaf in a storm the sea coming off its twodimensional plane breaking up into light peaks and dark troughs the dark blue almost black and the last thought whirling around his brain were over the marianas trench and if we sink we just might go on forever then the pacific came up and slammed them so hard all the breath went out of nangis lungs like a balloon bursting he heard the shriek of ten thousand demons then a quick searing flash of heat and his tiny world collapsed in on him bolts of pain imploding nailing him to a cross of agony it must have been gotaro who pulled him out of the ruined twisted cockpit because nangi never remembered climbing out himself many years later he would have recurring nightmares about those few terrible confused moments no true images coming only vague impressions unease terror the sense of suffocation of immobility then the bright sky was above him a harsh wind scouring his cheeks and the rocking motion of the waves far out at sea he opened his eyes to a red haze pain lanced through his head and when he tried to move he could not lie still someone said close beside him lie still samurai his breathing was labored and he fought to speak but something seemed to be clogging his voice box his throat felt lined in fire and his mouth was full of cotton he had a sense of heat again flames running along his cheeks like tears a great crackling filled his ears and the stench of smoke clogged his nostrils choking him he vomited and someone held his head wiping his mouth with a smudged white cloth unwound from his head his vision began to clear and he saw rearing up over them blotting out everything what he took to be the black fluke of an immense sea creature he began to whimper an irrational fear turning his skin wet and cold then his head cleared and he saw it for what it was the tail section of the mitsubishi he closed his eyes and lost consciousness when he opened his eyes again the first thing he noticed was that he had lost some depth perception one eyes out gotaro said from beside him and dont try to move somethings happened to your legs nangi was silent for a time digesting this at last he said one word explosives gotaro smiled at him thats what took me so long down in the oka i was working the nose loose i jettisoned it at about eighteen thousand feet it made quite a bang didnt notice gotaro shook his head you were too busy his smiled washed over nangi again easing his pain you saved us you know the minute those rockets misfired i was certain we were dead we would have been but for what you did nangi closed his eyes saying three words had depleted all the strength that was left him when he awoke again gotaro was bent over his legs trying to do something whats going on nangi said gotaro turned quickly away from what he was doing just checking on your wounds his eyes slid away from nangis toward the heaving sea no land what gotaro said no none at all i thought we might be close enough to one of the marianas but i dont think thats the case now noguchi will find us soon enough yes gotaro said i suppose he will hell want to know what went wrong all the viceadmirals and admirals in the imperial navy will want to know theyve got to get us back safe and sound gotaro said nothing his gaze roving this way and that across the water wheres that storm we saw before it was difficult for nangi to talk and he was monstrously thirsty but he would not give it up in the silence the thought of the awesome yawning trench falling away below them would fill his mind with dark twistings and his stomach would lurch and he would begin to retch in irrational terror the wind hasnt shifted yet gotaro said absently its still hanging in the northwest clearly his mind was on other matters what they were nangi could not guess nor would he ask there was a silence between them then just the wind whistling a constant force against them like an invisible wall and the long upanddown motion caused by the swell of the sea sickeningly regular nangi longed to see even one gull pulling and swooping across the barren horizon harbinger of land he was still wet and the wind crawling through the rents and gaps in his uniform caused his skin to raise itself in gooseflesh his bladder was uncomfortably full and grunting with the effort he turned heavily away from gotaro urinated awkwardly trusting for the wind and the motion to take it away from them it was true something was wrong with his legs he willed them to work and they would not painfully he raised himself up and grabbed at his flesh he could feel nothing his legs might have been made of wood to take his mind off the numbing thought of paralysis he began to look around him for the first time he noticed what it was they were riding on it was part of the heavily baffled bulkhead from the mitsubishi in this case the modifications had worked to their advantage all the heavy insulation against ground and air fire which would have pulled them down into the sea had been stripped away replaced by lightweight baffling that trapped air in its webbing nangi grunted to himself noguchi and the admirals would be happy with that knowledge he thought ironically even if their precious cherry blossom refused to fall exhausted he lay back down closing his eyes but the lurch and drag of the heaving tide was not conducive to rest he looked at gotaro he was sitting crosslegged still as a statue perhaps he was praying perhaps he felt no fear if that were the case nangi envied him fatigue and shock caused his mind to wander he was no longer aware of whether he was awake or asleep on the borderline in twilight cerebration all the black unnameable fears he had been harboring took hold gaining ascendancy in his world he was aware of his own isolation of himself as a lone bobbing speck totally exposed and defenseless he saw himself on the makeshift raft felt the pain of his wounds even the intermittent bursts of warmth amid the otherwise chill of the unforgiving wind and abruptly he was no longer alone for rising like some demon phantasm from the bottomless depths of the sea below him was a terrifying shape oh and how the waves rose higher all about him as if an invisible storm had come up great black pyramids built and crested dangerously high pulling him downward spinning him into cavernous troughs as endless as tunnels terrified he clung to the rough surface of his raft his heart beating triphammer hard paining his chest as he waited for what he knew must come and then it did breach the water a monstrous creature from the lightless ocean depths so enormous it blotted out the stars in the sky a kraken with glowing eyes and gaping jaws and long writhing tentacles like cables nangis eyes bulged and he screamed gotaro shook him awake tanzan tanzan he called urgently in his ear wake up wake up now nangis eyes flew open he was drenched in sweat which cooling in the gusting wind sent chill shivers running through him it took him several minutes to focus his good eye then he saw the look on his friends face were in trouble what is it nangi had to talk around his tongue which seemed swollen and recalcitrant the enemy i wish i had made a sighting gotaro said anyone his arms held nangi close his warmth calming the others almost constant shivers i held off telling you because i thought i could do something about it but now he shrugged you have some wounds how serious they are i cannot tell but youve been losing some blood of course nangi thought angry that he had not realized it himself that explained the weakness the brief periods of warmth he felt ive tried everything i know to staunch the loss of blood ive brought it down to a trickle but still his eyes were very sad i dont understand nangi said am i dying at that moment their makeshift raft gave a shuddering lurch apparently gotaro was prepared for it because he grabbed nangi hard with one arm held on with the other still such was the force of the jar that they both slewed around on the hard surface of thebulkhead gotaros face was very close to nangis nangi could see the reflection of his own frightened face in the curve of the ebon iris look out there gotaros voice sounded like a death knell to nangi as his gaze followed his friends lead no his voice was a sharp bark a terrorfilled exhalation for there just off their starboard flank was the great black triangular fin of a hunting shark as nangi watched bile caught in his throat the slightly curved fin swung around and now it headed straight toward them it loomed large so large and nangi could imagine the size of the beast beneath thirty feet forty its gaping jaws his eyes squeezed shut at the next lurch his stomach turning over and he was retching again what little there was left in him spewing up all over himself and gotaro no he moaned oh no but he was far too weak to raise his voice it was his worst nightmare come to life death held no terror for him but this thats why i was trying to stop the bleeding so completely he picked us up over an hour ago when you were still gushing i thought if i could stop it in time hed get tired of hanging around and go after something else i couldnt on the sharks third pass a section of three tubular baffles already weakened by the crash broke away something at least ten feet in front of the slashing dorsal fin snapped the baffles in two beneath the unquiet surface of the ocean nangi began to shiver anew and this time even gotaros human warmth couldnt deflect him his teeth began to chatter and he felt blood leaking from his ruined eye this is no way for a warrior to die he whispered the wind took his words flung them away from him like a hateful child he put his weary head against gotaros shoulder and at last broke down fully im afraid satosan not of death itself but the manner in which it has come ever since i was a child the depths of the sea have terrified me it is an uncontrollable fear even a warrior must feel fear gotaros deep rumbling voice filled nangis ear a samurai must have his nemesis just as he must do battle his arms closed more tightly about his friend as the bulkhead rocked and shuddered metal shrieked and then was silent the sea climbed around them the fin moved away from them and swung in a tight arc this nemesis may come in many forms many guises gotaro continued as if nothing at all had happened he may be a human foe of flesh and blood or then again he may be the force of an avenging kami or even a demon light was fast going out of the sky the encroaching night seemed vast and close at the same time so that one had the uncomfortable sensations of utter isolation and intense claustrophobia at the same time the clouds were too near for there to be any stars visible the darkness when it came would be absolute the world is full of demons gotaro said his eyes on the approaching fin because life is haunted by creatures who cannot experience it as we can as their envy turns inevitably to hatred they gain in evil power one hand reached out like a bar of iron to grip the bafflings as tightly as he could or so my grandmother would tell me at night i could never understand whether it was to frighten me or to make me more aware that one must fight in life always fight to get what one wants it was very bad this time the bulkhead screaming and canting at an extreme enough angle to allow a wave to wash over them nangi felt them sliding sideways and beside him gotaro desperately scrabbling to halt their slide nangi too did what he could to help it did not seem much to him when they were righted gotaro gathered nangi back to him as protectively as a mother will a small child the raft still shuddered and groaned complaining in the aftermath gotaro felt for the rift forming beneath them as he said i thank god now that my younger brother seiichi is being taken care of by her shes very old now but so very wise i think shes the only one with enough force of will to stop him from illegally enlisting hes almost sixteen and god knows the war would chew him up and destroy him utterly abruptly his voice changed and he said tanzan you must promise me you will look seiichi up when you get home my grandmothers house in higashiyamaku in kyoto just off the southern edge of maruyama park nangis vision was going in and out of focus there was a pain in his head like a steel spike hammered home and it made all coherent thought an effort i know it well the park he could see the cryptomeria and cherry trees youthful and vibrant their myriad leaves shivering in the warm breeze of summer bright shirts of the children contrasting with the precise patterns of kimonos and oiled paper parasols music drifting over the carefully mowed grass mingling with the laughter the lord is my shepherd i shall not want nangi heard the strange litany as if from a great distance yet he felt the vibrations from gotaro running through him as if they were connected and some of his terror abated knowing that this great bear of a man was here beside him and he thought somehow some way well make it until noguchi finds us pray for me my friend and abruptly gotaro was no longer beside him nangi felt the chill wind tearing at him mercilessly and he rocked alone on the baffled bulkhead a muffled splash came to him and his good eye began to burn as he turned his head this way and that there was just enough illumination to see the foam from gotaros powerful kicks as he swam away from the rocking raft come back nangi called oh satosan please come back then he gasped his ragged breath coming like fire as he spotted the great curved dorsal fin rising out of the water it drew him as it repulsed him and the fear and loathing stuck in his throat as if it were a physical thing he wanted nothing more in the world than to kill the monster and he cried aloud his fists beating impotently against his useless thighs as he saw the black shape cutting through the crests of the waves gotaro reared up once as the thing hit spinning up and around half out of the water hurled there by the force of primitive nature nangis vision blurred with bitter tears and he struck at himself over and over as his head bent the wind moaning in his ears like the voices of the damned after a long long time he began to pray to a god he did not know or understand but to whom he now turned for solace and the continuation of life book two chun hsing washington new york tokyo key west spring present c gordon minck head of red station sat a dizzying eight feet above floor level his hydraulic cranelift chair set at maximum there was nothing much between him and the fall straight down to the hardwood floor and that was the way minck liked it he thought best and most creatively when there was a sense of danger his was the only office in the building six short blocks from the white house without walltowall carpeting that was because minck wanted nothing in here to dampen sound he was a fanatic on the keenness of the six senses had been for years ever since he had graduated at the top of his unit from the elite fairchild academy tucked away in rural virginia most of those who made it through its awesomely grueling curriculum called the place the bonebreaker minck was continually asked the importance of the sixth sense and his answer was always the same intuition is everything while many of his fellow station leaders spent more and more time at their increasingly sophisticated computer consoles minck spent less and less and he could see the difference these other men were becoming gray worms their lined worried faces lit by the green phosphor light racked by increasingly debilitating headaches until made aware of the insidiously malignant effects of the consoles they began to hire assistants to relay the computer information to them they apparently were not disturbed overmuch by the need to replace these assistants every six months or so or by the rising budgetary expense of the maximum security sanatorium housing them within a stones throw of the national zoo an enormous sprawling mansion over two hundred years old and designated a national landmark every year the smithsonian attempted to get it opened to the public being ignorant of its real purpose and every year they were denied there were no computer terminals anywhere in mincks offices they were strictly verboten however there were a number of printout stations one of which was in his spacious office two of the walls below the sixteenfoot ceiling were given over to enormous rectangular panels that resembled windows more than anything else this was deliberate in fact they were giant projection screens composed of a particular chemical amalgam able to take the rearprojected holograms so that they blossomed to life with an astonishing reality the holograms of course changed from time to time but mostly as now they were of two views of moscow of dzerzhinsky square to be more accurate the great open plaza dotted with bundled astrakhaned pedestrians and in the street behind them one black zil limousine caught as it entered the black blobby hole in the forbidding facade of the structure known with fear throughout the world as lubyanka prison and headquarters for the kgb on the other wall was the second view of the square minck knew for a fact that some of the cells within lubyanka looked out on this other building across the square where children strolled with their parents hand in hand too young yet to know or comprehend how close they really were to the one true embodiment of evil left on earth minck was gazing meditatively now at this second edifice once again he opened up his mind his memories trying to find any trace of the hatred the fear he had once experienced upon looking out at this same view oh not so expansive of course the slitted windows in the outer cells in lubyanka were not those of a hotel but minck remembered it had been winter then the sky grayed with clouds stretched like sinews lights were always on in the vast city as night swept in off the frozen steppes to the north for its eighteenhour stay and everywhere the noise of the city was muffled by the ubiquitous snow turning even the most normal of sounds strange and unreal increasing mincks sense of disassociation how he had come to hate the snow for it had brought him to lubyanka his wrists manacled snow had hidden the icy patch in the street on which he had skidded he would have eluded them otherwise without doubt for they were mathematically minded drilled to precision but as with all kgb underlings lacking the concept of intuition intuition equaled freedom in mincks mind and his intuition would have saved him that chill night in moscow except for the snow snyeg the russians called it in any language he hated it he continued to stare at the building that had been his last look at moscow before they pulled him from the holding cell and began the interviews from then on his home was a windowless space of not more than fifteen square feet with a plywood cot bolted to the wall and a hole down which to wash his waste products the stench was appalling as was the cold heat was unheard of in the inner cells sightless like a rat in the dark minck fought to retain his senses against the numbing effects his interviewers were inducing in him and to that end he conjured up in his mind memories of the view from his holding cell for a time certain that it was the last sliver of the world he would ever see he observed the young russian couples walking the families trudging through the last of the spring snows for these holograms revolved with the seasons and felt the clear space within him the embers of passionate hate and terror that consumed him that for the instant before he crossed over the border into neutral territory had caused him to pause to consider wildly returning and killing them all singlehanded and like a careful cowboy on a dry and dusty plain minck kicked over these glowing ashes nurturing the essence of that hate protorov he gave his whole attention to the crenellated building in the hologram that had come to mean even more to him than its sinister sister structure across the square the moscow childrens world department store his eyes closed in easy meditation his finger depressed one of a series of studs recessed into the left arm of his chair tanya he said softly into the void of the room two directives one get that doctor kidd whats his christian name timothy on the phone if hes not at the park avenue office try mount sinai hospital get him out of rounds what pseudonym shall we use as imprimatur the voice that emerged from the hidden speaker system was husky with just a trace of a foreign slur oh lets be ingenious today shall we use the department of international export tariffs very good second minck said since our time seems to be rapidly running out invade arrts and call up the file on linnear nmn nicholas it was justines first day on the job and she was uncomfortable as a cat on a hot tin roof for more than three years she had been more or less happily ensconced in her own onewoman company delivering freelance advertising concepts to mediumrange accounts while she had not amassed a fortune her talents were such that even in an uncertain economy she had managed to do quite well of course from time to time she had received offers to join agencies but the comfort of working for herself had always outweighed the increased security that working for someone else would give her but meeting rick millar had begun to change all that just over six weeks ago mary kate sims had phoned justine in frantic need of a project designer mary kate worked for millar soames robberts one of the newer agencies with a high profile and even higher net yearly bookings two of their best designers were down with the flu and would justine be a dear and fill in on the american airlines project it was a rush job but mary kate said she could guarantee justine a sizable bonus for ontime delivery justine took the project working on it eighteen hours a day for almost a week but ten days later into three or four of her own projects one of which was giving her fits she had forgotten all about mary kate and her american airlines package until the call from rick millar the head of the agency apparently american had loved justines idea so much they were turning what had been a new york regional into a national campaign the firm of millar soames robberts had received a sizable bonus and a longterm contract with american rick said that he had loved justines idea before the agency had submitted it to american justine did not know whether or not to believe him he made a lunch date with her the following week they met at la cфte basque a superb french restaurant that justine had read about several times in gourmet but had never actually been to yet the delicious food was the least memorable aspect of those several hours because as it turned out millar had more on his mind than just wanting to meet her justine he said over drinks im basically a peopleoriented person in business as well as in my private life i believe in creating an atmosphere that allows my employees to work at full throttle but more than that i allow certain individuals to cut across departmental boundaries when their talents warrant it he took a sip of his bourbon i think youre such a person a job with us wouldnt be all that different for you than having your own business he grinned except of course that youd make a ton of money and build your rep among the highlevel accounts that much quicker justine put her drink aside for the moment her heart hammering are you giving me a direct job offer millar nodded isnt this supposed to come over the grand marnier soufflй or something he laughed im a maverick in every way she watched him for a time he was fairly young perhaps just forty his hair was thick and long enough to reach his collar streaked blond brushed straight back it could just as easily belong to a surfer from redondo beach he had a good hard face with the hint of crows feet at the corners of his intelligent wide set bluegreen eyes he had the kind of nose that made you think of mercedes pink gins and polo along the carefully manicured greensward of the connecticut shore he should have had a cableknit sweater spread on his back but his manner belied all that i can see the wheels turning in there he said as they were served the first course of fresh bluepoint oysters he grinned again a sunny somehow reassuring expression that showed good white teeth i wasnt born into money i worked hard to get where i am today but she found that she had little appetite because she knew that she was going to take him up on his offer dreams like this one rarely came along in life though the idea turned her edgy she had learned early to grab them before they slipped irretrievably by in fact she had been so keyed up about the job that she had asked rick if she could start on the following day friday instead of waiting through the weekend with nicholas just gone she had had no plans and three idle days waiting was too much for her patience so it was that she had shown up just past eight a full hour before she had to at madison avenue and fiftyfourth street the offices of millar soames robberts were three glittering twentyfirstcentury floors of the sleekest furnishings money could buy with floortoceiling windows in every executive office and mechanical and production departments that would surely make her work a snap she had been so used to doing everything herself now as rick had said to her over lunch she could concentrate on ideas allowing others to complete her sketches rick himself introduced justine to min her secretary she was no more than twenty and with the patch of green in her dark hail seemed to be the agencys concession to the postpunk era but justine soon found out that beneath the wild hair was a sharp brain that understood all the convoluted workings of the organization justines office was a floor below mary kates and because mary kate was a vice president it was somewhat smaller than her friends but it was light and airy a freshlooking coleus with a pink satin good luck ribbon tacked to it sat on a desk otherwise empty save for a phone the office was sparsely furnished with it seemed an agglomeration of castoffs rick apologized for the state of the office saying that the company was in the midst of reorganizing departments and that min would bring her a stack of furnishing and accessory catalogs so that things can get straightened out in a couple of weeks she thanked rick for the plant and putting it beside the window sat behind her new desk her first call was to nicholas in her excitement forgetting that it was the middle of the night in tokyo the hotel balked at putting the call through the officious operator asking if it was an emergency when she explained to her what the local time was justine settled for leaving a message not knowing of course that he was out wandering through jan jan but as she cradled the receiver she experienced a sharp pang of sadness she had never felt more acutely nicholas absence or her desire for him to return she had fought with desperation the fear and anxiety welling up inside her when he had told her he was going to work for her father were her feelings irrational or real when it came to her father she knew that she felt trapped by her emotions the shape of her life had been dictated by raphael tomkin as a woman in her twenties she had had love affairs abruptly severed without her knowing as a teenager she had seen the devastation his harshness and selfinvolvement had wreaked on her mother as a child she had been rendered fatherless by his business affairs even though nicholas new job was temporary she had been terrified that it would turn out to be a permanent position she knew only too well how persuasive her father could be when he set his mind to it she had been terrified too of his going away so soon after the terrible nightmare with saigo who through justine herself had almost succeeded in killing nicholas she felt that being alone was a kind of exquisite agony she knew that whatever it was saigo had done to her had scarred her for life despite all nicholas efforts to exorcise that particular devil from her true she was free from saigos arcane grip over her but she could never be free of the memories in the deepest shoals of night when nicholas lay peacefully sleeping beside her she would awake with a shivery start into a nightmare i almost murdered him she found herself repeating to herself as if there were a stranger alive inside her body to whom she must make sense of this how could i another repeating riff an agonizing counterpoint im not even capable of killing a fish let alone another human being my own love that of course might have been her salvation the conviction that she could not kill and therefore was not responsible but the nightmare continued to stalk her had not nicholas stopped her she would most assuredly have killed him just as saigo had programmed her to she was not concerned with responsibility only with a guilt greater than any she had ever known but oh she ached for him even as she feared for him every moment he was in japan every moment he was with her father for she knew intimately all the myriad ways raphael tomkin had of getting what he wanted he could be bullheaded or subtle as the occasion warranted he could get you even when you were certain he wouldnt she shuddered now within the confines of her new office oh nicholas she thought if only i had been able to make you see what hes like i dont want him to steal you away from me because the thought of nicholas permanently wedded to tomkin industries was more than she could bear she wanted her father out of her life had struggled all through her formative years for just such an objective even going so far as to change her last name to tobin and she knew that if there was a chance that he would come back into her life she would move heaven and earth to prevent it angry now as well as lonely she dialed mary kates extension if nicholas had phoned at this moment she would have spat at him for putting her in such an impossible position for making her fear for him and them both justine was told that her friend was in a meeting so again she left a message hoping they could have lunch and celebrate then she asked min to come in together they began working out logistics departmental and otherwise so that justine could get on with her first projects for millar soames robberts it took all of nicholas training to cover his true feelings the shock had been so great so totally unexpected that he had taken that one lurching step backward losing for an instant his centrism exhibiting a certain paleness of complexion a momentary flaring of the nostrils as animal instinct threatened ascendancy he was certain no one had noticed his face closed down like a steel trap as the soft mix of voices from all around him faded and he was back in new york his long daikatana drawn its gleaming blade arching away toward saigo he took a step forward and his cousin said you believe that yukio is alive somewhere and thinking every so often of the old days with you but oh no this is not so he laughed as they continued to circle each other with murderous intent he looked into nicholas eyes as he said she lies at the bottom of the straits of shimonoseki cousin precisely where i dumped her she loved you you know with every breath she breathed with every word she spoke and at last it drove me out of my mind she was the only woman for me without her there were only men his eyes blazed like coals redrimmed and mad he was bleeding heavily you made me kill her nicholas he blurted out in sudden accusation for months nicholas had lived with that pain a black cyst of torment he rarely let out into the light of day and now to see it was not as if akiko ofuda looked like yukio a family resemblance a sister even her face was yukios and as for her figure well certainly there were differences but nicholas had last seen yukio in the winter of on that long terrible journey south to kumamoto and saigo and when he had returned at last to tokyo alone and confused everything had changed satsugai saigos father had been murdered then the colonel nicholas father died shortly thereafter cheong his mother had committed seppuku with her sisterinlaw itami as second now staring hard at akiko ofuda nicholas wondered wildly whether saigo had lied that one last time was it possible he was a master of twisted truths he had been dying when he told nicholas what would that have made him do lie or tell the truth at last whatever would hurt nicholas the most truth or fiction nicholas could not tell yet how akiko had stared at him from the moment he was close enough for her to see him though there were more than a hundred people at the affair her eyes had locked on his she had created the aura of mystery hiding her face until he was quite close she had used her fan deliberately why if she were not yukio why would she have any interest in him and yet to turn up here as satos soontobewife the wild coincidence did not escape him nicholas quite rightly did not trust in coincidences as a force of nature all through the ceremony as the traditional sake cup was being passed from sato to akiko nicholas mind was preoccupied by the bizarre puzzle but the more he thought the more he seemed to become entangled in a mares nest of questions without answers it was clear to him that he would get nowhere until he could speak to akiko herself and yet his mind would not stop turning over the possibilities was she wasnt she his eyes stared at her bleakly that face her face it was as if he had suddenly stepped into a haunted house and now confused could not find his way out again it felt precisely as if all solid ground had fled was the ceremony long or short he could not tell he was suspended in an agony of not knowing hope fear anger and cynicism all mixed inside him his own thoughts and memories took precedence over outside events his body went through the proper motions like an automaton and always he found her looking at him those eyes he had known so well had loved so desperately so wildly so utterly passionately in the dark days of his youth locked with his he tried to read some kind of emotion there and because he was a master of this as well as of many other things he was dismayed to find that he drew a blank did he see mockery there or love desire or betrayal he found he had no way of knowing and this too was as frightening as this kami resurrected from his past all nicholas could think of was getting a chance to talk to akiko but quickly he saw just how difficult it was going to be to get her alone with the ceremonys end clusters of friends immediately gathered around the couple wishing them well offering their congratulations others began to drift away down the narrow dirt path toward the edge of the lake below where striped pavilions had been erected the night before there was no space for him the best he could do was to offer ms own congratulations to them both sato was smiling hugely being very american about it pumping hands just like a canny senator in his reelection bid tomkin grunted at nicholas elbow said im about ready for him to pass out the cigars he turned his head away you go on to the reception my gut still hurts im going back to the hotel ill send the car back for you alone nicholas began to walk down the path circling the cliffs ahead of him he could see sato and akiko still surrounded by wellwishers there was laughter and gaiety now that the stiff formality of the ceremony had been dispensed with he saw her descending through the darkness and light the moving shadows of the pines painting abstract symbols upon the delicate curve of her back a slight swaying of the shoulders and hips appearing and disappearing as he descended behind her the wedding the crowds the swirling chattering talk faded so that he was alone with her and the elements he was acutely aware of the sunlight the shadows the scents of pine and cedar incense and wild lemon but only as they pertained to her her passage was like the return of the plovers after a long sere winter when the ground was rimed with frost and only the glowing hearths emanated warmth once nicholas had likened yukio to the fading pale petals that fall on the last of hanamis three days although many said that at hanamis peak the second day the cherry blossoms were most beautiful still to almost every japanese the thirdday petals were most affecting for it was on that last day when one truly understood the ineffable nature of beautys transience but now what was he to think his whole reality had been turned upside down was akiko yukio how could she still be alive had saigo pulled one last diabolical trick from beyond the grave had he kept nicholas from her all this time when she was alive and he could not go on with that thought the idea made him sick to his stomach with the intensity of longing and bitter frustration then he managed to get hold of himself he knew where he was and what he would have to do in order to find the answers to all these questions he would have to allow his eastern side complete ascendancy time and patience he knew that he would have to employ them both if he was to successfully break this maddening riddle meanwhile he would just have to ignore his breaking heart he had been watching alix logan for over five months now through the sundrenched streets of key west along the narrow flat beaches in and out of the small clothing and jewelry boutiques he had even gone with her when she went to pick up her dog a large brindled doberman he cringed when he saw the neat white and black sign hanging from a crosstree on the lawn gold coast obedience school and in smaller letters beneath police and attack training our specialty and the one thing he had learned from all that time on the job was that there was no conceivable way in to her alix logan was a looker she had a slender models body long thick hair the color of honey streaked nicely now by the florida sun her eyes were an intense green he had seen them only through the compact nikon x binoculars flattened by the lens prisms into ovoid orbs as large as the sun for just over five months she had been his universe this powerful man with the wide shoulders and the cowboys pushedin face he had dogged her for so long and so intensely that it was as if he were living with her he knew what she ate what her tastes in clothes and men were what she liked what she didnt like her favorite item was a hot fudge sundae with coffee ice cream and two cherries what she disliked most were the pair of monsters who shadowed her constantly at least that was how she thought of them he had heard her call one just that monster as she accosted him on the pier one bright cloudless afternoon rushing into the shadows to deliver her impassioned message to him directly using her small fists on his burly chest for emphasis the monster stared at her impassively from out of his closeset brown eyes im fed up she screamed at him i cant take it anymore i thought itd be all right down here but its not i cant work cant sleep i cant even make love without you monsters breathing fire on my back her honey hair whipped in the salt wind please please please just leave me alone the monster turned his face away from her and crossing his massive arms across his chest began to whistle something from a walt disney movie the man with the cowboys lined face witnessed all this from the small boat he sat in gently rocking at pierside while he worked on his fishing tackle a stained canvas hat scrunched down low over his forehead putting his face in black shadow they knew him here as bristol and that was how he liked it he also responded to tex a rather unimaginative nickname tony the dockmaster had given him owing to his face tex bristol if you thought about it for more than a moment it was idiotic but then he thought this whole scene was something for the books he finished his work on his rod and prepared to shove off on the pier alix logan tears trembling like diamonds in the corners of her eyes was stalking stifflegged away from the monster toward the gangplank of a pleasure boat he cast off heard the twin screws of the engines thrumming liquidly behind him he picked up speed the thought of marlin in his head far from shore he had to laugh for someone dead and buried he was leading a remarkably actionfilled life akiko ofuda sato felt the press of her husbands hand in the limo on the way home from the reception felt the heat emanating from his body the pressure of his lustful spirit so close beside her he made no overt move but in all other aspects she felt the electricity crackling through him as they drew closer and closer to home multiple images thronging her mind in such profusion they tumbled end over end over each other of her voyeuristic nights in the house of the bodies of all the gifts she had presented him with over the long months made her gasp inwardly with a manufactured excitement she squeezed satos hand the edges of her lacquered nails scratching gently along the warm flesh of his palm once inside she went immediately to the bathroom and doffing her kimono removed all her undergarments naked she carefully wrapped her kimono around herself tying the obi checking her makeup in the mirror she reapplied eye shadow and lipstick the master bedroom was in the omoya far from the sixtatami room where he had received his gifts those women had never been allowed into this section of the house they were outsiders after all not family on a pedestal not far from the generous futon bed was a sculpture of ankoku doji scowling fiercely one leg up in the classic sitting position he was an aide to the kings of hell and putting brush to a papercovered plank it was his responsibility to annotate the sins of each penitent who entered that unholy court to be tried for his misdeeds on earth this particular ankoku doji was carved from camphorwood dated to the thirteenth century akiko hated him his sculpted eyes seemed to follow her seemed to know what she planned to do to his owner as soon as she was well ensconced here she was determined to move him to another place preferably one she did not visit often sato welcomed her to his futon they drank hot sake and he made several jokes she made sure she laughed although she barely heard them was she terrified or revolted at the prospect of being penetrated by her sworn enemy she used all her prodigious skills to push down the black tide that threatened to engulf her mind she did not want to think about what sun hsiung had said to her but she had no choice sato touched her and she jumped her eyes flew open and she realized they had been squeezed shut as if that physical act could blot out the reverberations filling her mind you are an empty vessel which i will now proceed to fill sun hsiung had said to her you came to me of your own volition you must remember that in the days and weeks and months to come your time will be long here it is not inconceivable that you will feel a desire to leave i will tell you now that you cannot that if you harbor any suspicion that you cannot tolerate hardship pain arduous labor then you must leave immediately now is the time the only time do i make myself clear and with terror filling her heart like a rush of water she had nodded said i do just as if these were marriage vows she was taking and oh they were she thought now they were the silk of her kimono was sliding with a whisper across the pale expanse of her shoulder guided by his deft hand this close to him surrounded only by the silence of the empty house for all servants had been dismissed for the night to stay free of charge at the citys most plush hotel satos wedding present to them she felt his male presence much the way a female fox is aware of her mate there was no more than the acknowledgement of lust of one brief moment stolen out of the net of time what she was about to begin had no more to do with love than a pair of microorganisms coming together what true feelings she had for him she could not express until the moment of her vengeance was at hand her nostrils dilated sharply scenting his odor her kimono had slipped off both her shoulders and now she pressed her hands across herself as a schoolgirl might embarrassed by her newly budding breasts sato leaned forward and brushed his lips against her throat akiko closed off that private part of her which was most dear to her accepting what might come she felt his hands sliding over her shoulders and she willed herself out of her stupor parting his own kimono the bright red angular pattern breaking up into shards as the folds began to appear he was naked long before she was his flesh warm beneath her probing fingers he was virtually hairless his skin smooth and unblemished she put her cheek against his belly felt the pulse of his life beating in her ear like the surf along the far shore this meant nothing to her it was as if she had put her ear to the bole of a tree he lifted her upward and now they lay body against body her legs were closed his were spread apart there seemed a second heart down there pulsing in a rhythm all its own she felt its insistent push as it grew insinuating itself between her thighs another kind of serpent she reached her hand down and cupped his scrotum he groaned and she thought it gave an answering throb she touched the base of his shaft gently he began to roll over to move her onto her back she had never been so aware of one part of her anatomy before the insides of her thighs burned as if she had pressed herself against an oven and her flesh there rippled as if in terror if he saw too soon if his love was not enough to dissuade him he would surely reject her she saw him throwing her out into the street saw herself banished from the city as it had been done centuries before when the shogun held sway and her kind would not be permitted into the bed of a samurai let alone be his bride she understood that at this moment there was absolutely no difference between her and her mother this terrified her beyond all measure and she commenced to shake like a leaf her husband mistook her fear for passion and groaned aloud he had placed her on her back she could feel the soft silk of her open kimono on her flesh like a sensuous caress sato loomed over her his muscular body throwing her breasts and belly into shadow she raised her arms her fingers and palms tracing the ridges and bulges of his muscles she used the pads of her thumbs to press inward you like my arms he whispered her eyes black jade stared up at him unblinking delivering the answer he wished for ah yes he breathed ah yes his head came down and his open lips encompassed a nipple he moved from one breast to another nuzzling and licking akiko felt nothing his fingertips rolled one nipple while he sucked on another and now she gasped at the contrast between the warm softness of his mouth and the roughcalloused rubbing of his fingers she did not know whether to scream or to cry she did neither merely bit her lower lip exhaling sharply she put her fingers in her mouth transferred saliva to the spot between her thighs then she felt herself being turned on her side satos heated body behind her his hand gently lifted her upper leg and centered in on the core of her she gasped as she felt him between her thighs in the tangled forest of her pubic hair his fingers pressed open her lips and she thought briefly again of all his gifts the movements of his lovemaking then she was opening herself to him feeling the thick hotness of him like a bar of iron between her legs she began to weep his breath hissed in her ear and she could feel the tightening of his powerful arms about her her buttocks were hard against him as he moved around and around at the entrance to her vagina until he could stand it no longer with a great groan and a violent heave he pushed himself all the way into her akikos eyes opened so wide the whites showed all around an engine of fire started up in her chest so that she could not breathe she felt a fearful tearing in her loins a great filling up a pressure on her entrails as if she had stuffed herself with food she was overcome by sensation and she cried out wildly sato misinterpreting her lunged in even deeper trying to establish an erotic rhythm akikos mind was filled with black visions all the myriad demons of hell seemed to be rising out of their moldy beds to dance in the firelight inher minds eye nights bound in the highland castle paraded in lurid detail before her like a shameless whore her head whipped back and forth her long unbound hair slapping against sato enflaming him all the more kyoki the sensei of darkness his name made her moan and bite her lip against the unfurling memories like shrouds for the dead for that was how she thought of herself now dead like ships in the night on a stormtossed tumultuous sea they rocked to and fro akiko locked inside his embrace allowing him this cruel dominance there was foam on her lips hatred in her heart she had never before offered up her body unwillingly she never wanted to again though she knew that she must to preserve this marriage until its bloody end yet she knew what to do she could give pleasure without ever receiving it this too was part of the role she had assigned herself weeping still she reached back between her thighs grasping his swinging sac at the same time she clenched her inner muscles working on the engorged head buried inside her slick channel her hips revolved in a rapid corkscrew motion she squeezed lightly with her hand she heard his deep groan felt his muscles trembling all around her and knew that his orgasm was imminent i cannot allow him to do it she thought wildly tomorrow or the night after but not now with a little cry she pulled herself away from him turning to slide her open lips over his moist vibrating shaft teasing him with the faintest of feathery touches until he grabbed at her flung hair and begged her for sweet release it was only then that she began to suck hollowing her cheeks urging him onward to completion with her fingers her other hand covered her pubic mound as if staunching a wound her thighs close together she held herself all the firmer at the instant of his sexual convulsions as a child caresses a deep hurt to ease the pain and then she willed her new husband to sleep watching him drift off staring blindly down the lightless corridor of her own past at what she might have been akiko rolled carefully over and silently rose from her nuptial bed for a moment she stood naked in utter quietude staring down at the form of seiichi sato slumbering and sated from the enigmatic look on her beautiful face it was impossible to tell what she was feeling perhaps it was tine what sun hsiung had once told her you do not fully understand anything that you feel but if that were so she told herself i could never have learned what i have i could never have gone beyond the kujikiri and the kobudera the arcane disciplines that saigo had mastered and she thought triumphantly i never could have killed that clever fox masashigi kusunoki she had used jaho and it had worked masking the nature of her intent from even such an adept as he but her delight was shortlived shaking her head her long unbound hair a blueblack cascade across her shoulder down her back she bent and retrieved her multicolored kimono it was the one she had worn at the wedding reception earlier today she drew it about her as a child will wrap a bathrobe warm from the radiator around herself in order to ward off more than the chill of night she had numbed herself in order to ward off what she thought of as an attack it had been a time when she told herself repeatedly she had to retreat now in order to have her revenge but there was a vile taste in her mouth saltysweet like blood her own blood never before had she detested so intensely her karma her training should have protected her from these feelings and it surprised and disconcerted her that she should feel so violated by one simple act that it had been a necessary one did not seem to matter at all she was weeping again in silent agony barefoot she left the bedroom making her way through the dark house until she found the fusuma that opened out onto the zen garden it was always peaceful there above the one ancient cryptomeria the stars glittered hard and twinkling like the many teeth of some grinning nocturnal predator for one long moment she allowed the barriers to fall away from her thoughts of nicholas entered her consciousness seeping through her like woodsmoke for just an instant an unfamiliar powerful emotion gyred filling her up to the bursting point and her neck arched her face turned heavenward she allowed herself to yearn for surcease up there a million miles from anything known she could be free striding through the utter blackness of space she might at last rest from the turmoil that beset her but the feeling only lasted a moment then she was earthbound again her head came down and her dark eyes contemplated the precise grandeur of the garden less was more here a uniquely japanese esthetic the pebbles which covered the ground were hand picked for their size shape and color they were carefully raked twice a day in order to maintain the precise symmetry the gardens designer had labored so hard to create three black angular rocks jutted up from different parts of the garden in contrast to the pebbles each one was unique unto itself its ridges and rills affecting the onlooker in varying ways triggers for the evocation of disparate moods the place was tranquil and invigorating at the same time akiko turned her head and sat on the cold stone bench her legs tucked neatly under her her hands were folded in her lap the fingers relaxed and slightly curved the attitude was so wholly feminine that it was quite impossible to tell what unimaginable bursts of coordinated energy this body was capable of she was acutely aware of the arc of a shadow inside her a demarcation between light and dark whose edge was as finely honed as the most masterfully forged katana blade from this place of shade she felt the rippling of her hatred her longing to wreak a horrendous vengeance her body trembled in anticipation there was a low rumbling shaking her brain apart making her moan as if she were in exquisite pain then she felt a veil of wind caress her cheek cooling her sweat dried along her hairline the precise symmetry of the garden seized her and she was altogether calm again she sighed in the aftermath of a great storm and closed her eyes her head felt heavy and as her pulsebeat slowed she reviewed the events of the evening in the stillness of the zen pebble garden akiko was thankful that she did not have to contend with a motherinlaw for satos mother like all japanese mothers would rule this house wasnt that why the central living section was called omoya by tradition mother house akiko shuddered inwardly how would she possibly be able to endure the orders of the heramochi the one with the right to hold the spoon used to serve rice the head of the household no far better that she was dead and buried along with satos warhero brother alone with only the cryptomeria blacker even than the surrounding night with the shadows of the zen stones striking her in odd rippling patterns akiko stood up and under the scrutiny of the pinpoint uncaring stars threw off her kimono in one convulsive gesture naked the hard blue light vying with the pink neon excrescence from shinjuku and the faraway ginza boulevards that never slept she stepped out onto the precisely raked rows of pebbles they felt so cold and smooth on her bare soles between two of the jutting black rocks she spread herself draped on the flat ground curled and serpentine half in light half in shadow and became one with all that surrounded her there was an acute irony in using tanya against the russians an elliptical symmetry that affected minck in just the same way as did gazing upon one of thomas hart bentons huge canvases its very existence made life worth living after moscow minck had needed elements to demonstrate to him in a direct fashion the nobler the elegant and uplifting aspects of life his incarceration had leeched that part of his memory away in returning to america he had had to learn the positive aspects of the human race all over again he looked up now as he sensed tanyas approach that was another consequence of his imprisonment some unseen layer of his mind had been rubbed away by the constant scrutiny he had been under and like sandpaper taken to skin what was revealed underneath was a hypersensitivity to human presence minck stared into those cool blue eyes dotted with gray they were large and direct and they were always the first things he saw when he looked at her that was his own personal purgatory they were the eyes of mikhail her brothers eyes mikhail the dissident had been the reason for mincks infiltration into moscow in the first place mikhail had sent a message into the west he possessed information vital to the american secret service system minck had been chosen by computer because of his facility with idiomatic russian as well as his somatic matchup with the slavic caucasian type and they had sent him in to pull mikhail out or if that were as they put it unfeasible to extract the information from him but in pursuit of that knowledge he had been traduced someone in mikhails cell had been turned and mincks rdv with the dissident had ended in a hail of submachinegun fire literally tearing mikhail in two in spotlights picking minck out of the shadows the snow falling falling all sounds muffled blood in the snow like chips of coal strewn in an explosion of malice chainwrapped tires clinkclinkclinking in his ears as he ran from the raised voices the muzzles spewing red death hidden behind the angry glare of the spotlights and running through the knifing cold snowflakes riming his lashes blinding him making him think oddly of kathy his college sweetheart his wife how she loved the snow holding out her delicate hand laughing in delight as one by one the flakes landed on her flesh melting only after giving up their secret to her only her slipping on the patch of ice undone by the blanket of snow his ankle wrenching going down and then strong arms binding him lights in his face the gassy smells of cabbage and borscht invading his nostrils voices harsh and guttural gde bumagie kak vass zavoot where are your papers what is your name repeated over and over life already reduced down to one dull fragment eight years ago carroll she was the only one who knew what the c stood for the only one who would dare use it if it were known it was the only outward manifestation he would permit of the powerful bond between them yes tanya she glanced down at the brief he had been reading is the file on nicholas linnear complete no file on a human being is ever complete no matter how up to date it is i want you to remember that he said this last needlessly since tanya remembered everything looking at her again minck was struck anew by how much she resembled mikhail both had the finely chiseled highcheekboned face of the purebred white russian rather than the broad coarsestructured visage of the slav both had that thick straight shock of hair though in latter days tanya had had hers dyed a deepburnished blond because she said it helped dampen the memories after he had broken out of lubyanka a colonels blood on his trembling hands with all of the considerable might of the komitet gosudarstvennoy bezopasnost marshaled against him with the militia out beating on dissident necks to extract information on his whereabouts tanya had led him out of moscow and eventually russia he owed her a lot and it had incensed him when in the hands of the family in those days of course there was no red station they had taken her away from him and in a lightless cell had begun on her what the kgb had worked on him he soon put a stop to that risking his own termination in the process but that was only his first stumbling step to reclaiming a life that he thought had been cut away from him as surely and as professionally as a surgeon takes a scalpel to flesh because of his incarceration he was himself suspect at first but when he delivered mikhails information to them they saw reason and no longer suspected him of having been turned he never let them know however that the information had come from tanya long after mikhail had died in the bloody moscow fusillade torn in frozen chunks from her throat during the long bitter nights in hiding so near the encroaching death drawing in all around them he had had little strength after his ordeal and she had done his fighting for him rising silently up out of their hiding places in cave or fen to cut down any soldier who strayed too close a blooddrenched spectral figure returning to him after each lethal foray to lead him onward toward freedom she was strong and she was hard and she had saved him many times repaying him for taking her out of lubyanka with him and he had quickly learned her mind was as quick and powerful as was her body her memory had been the repository for all of mikhails secrets he being far too intelligent to commit anything so explosive to paper when three years before minck rising rapidly in the family had proposed the creation of the red station to deal with all the russias their satellites and their global dealings he was granted eighteen months in which to deliver what his presentation promised it had only taken him eighteen weeks and from then on a burgeoning slice of the familys annual budget was assured he negotiated for his section much as a good attorney for a star baseball player will negotiate with a club president his contract was airtight if he continued to deliver and minck made certain of that but it was not really of budgets tanya or even the family that minck was thinking now he had sunk deep into an odd kind of reverie that increasingly had become his habit over the past several months in fact he was wondering how a highly intelligent welltrained operations officer named carroll gordon minck could find himself in such dire straits it was somewhat of a shock to him because after his nightmare ordeal in lubyanka he never thought he would feel this way again in those bleak bloodfilled days the memory of kathy was all that he had allowed himself to dwell on anything to do with the family was strictly no go since at any given moment he could be dragged from his steel cot and shot full of god only knew what new blend of chemicals psychedelics and neutral stimulators so that he would be transported and talking before he knew that he had opened his mouth the russians were at last as intimate with kathy as he had ever been but they knew no more about the family than they had the day the snow had worked against him and they had pulled him in gde bumagie kak vass zavoot when he returned to america his relationship with kathy was irreparably damaged he had shared their most intimate moments with too many people for whom he felt only fear and loathing it was as if he had sat down to discuss his sex life with the man who had just raped his wife there had been a silent explosion in his head he did not love kathy any less on his return from his own private hell but he found that he could not touch her without being torn out of time and place back to the dank fearful cell deep within moscow that his mind would not allow so they remained apart to the night she was killed and of course by that time he had convinced himself that they had stripped him of his capacity to savor sexual release then this whole godawful mess had begun but still it was beyond him to understand how he had gotten from there to here hopelessly in love with a woman whom he should not could not love was it only two weeks ago that he had clandestinely flown down to see her for the weekend oh christ but it felt like two years he stared blindly down at his hands and had to laugh at himself needed to do that lest he slit his wrists in utter frustration what an idiot he was and yet he could no more stop loving her than he could cease to hate the russians what elation filled him when he thought of the gift she had brought him a simple enough pleasure but one that he had been certain would never be his again how could he possibly give that up and how he longed to confide in tanya he could whisper the secrets of the world into her ear without a qualm but not his no this he could not allow her to know because it was a clear sign of weakness in him then she would look into his eyes with that stern slavic gaze too serious to dismiss and tell him what he ought to do and minck knew what he ought to do knew that he should have done it months ago the woman he loved had to die had to for the sake of security every day she remained alive a potentially damaging leak was walking around how many times during these past few months had he picked up the phone and begun to dial the coded mobile number and how many times had the termination order died in his throat leaving him with the acrid taste of ashes in his mouth he could not do it and yet he knew that he must in here his head came up im sorry i was lost in thought tanya said yes i could see her eyes mikhails eyes held his steadily i think its time for the pool he nodded sighing she was fond of saying that giving the body a good workout did the same for the mind tanya switched on arrts the active retrieval realtime system an advanced network that the family had had installed for red station at the behest of its director the system would now monitor all incoming and outgoing communication in this mode it had been programmed by minck to deal with the first three nominal levels of data on its own for levels four through seven it would hold before contacting minck wherever he was for instructions on how to proceed they took the leadlined elevator up three floors to the rec level passing through two distinct modes of electronic security checks stripped down minck had a hard lean body that looked at least ten years younger than it was it seemed a perfectly normal body until one came close and then one began to see details forming the hard rills and scars the patches of dead white skin hairless and glossy lubyanka had been hard on him he hit the water in a quick flatarced dive the surface barely rippling athis smooth entrance in a moment tanya followed him into the olympicsize pool both wore brief nylon suits at these and perhaps other times as well minck found himself admiring her lithe muscular body he so constantly relied on her steeltrap mind her unerring cunning at trapping the russians at their own game that these infrequent moments always struck him anew like revelations from out of the blue she had the wide shoulders and narrowish hips of the dedicated female athlete but there was nothing masculine about her just powerful and minck never made the typical mans mistake of equating the two they kicked full out for ten continuous laps up and back the long pool using each others speed and stamina to spur themselves on eventually tanya won as she always did but by less of a margin than she had several months ago close he said between breaths he wiped the water off his face very damn close tanya smiled youve been training harder than i have ill have to remember that in future reaching upward he pulled himself to a sitting position on the tile rim of the pool water scrolled off him and his dark hair was plastered down across his forehead giving him the look of a roman senator his clear gray eyes were unnaturally large in his face he had recently shaved off his thick handlebar mustache and as a result looked astonishingly boyish for his fortyseven years tanya still treading water waited patiently for him to begin he had had a dour expression on his face ever since he had had the conversation with dr kidd in new york she had not been privy to the dialog and minck had been particularly unforthcoming about it she just hoped that was the only thing weighing on his mind now he was a man to whom in far different circumstances she could find herself intensely attracted he had that quality she most admired in people the expression of intellectualism through his physicality its this goddamned nicholas linnear minck was saying now with his characteristic abruptness i think were going to have to deal with him sooner than later now she knew how the conversation with dr kidd had gone but she said nothing of that mincks gray eyes leveled on her i dont for a moment think im going to like the bastard hes too damn independent for his own good and of course hes monstrously dangerous ive read the file she said pulling herself up beside him hed never even contemplate aggression oh no minck agreed absolutely not and thats our key to him hes a naif on our territory we must therefore make quite certain he stays in our bailiwick so that we can reel him in when hes given us everything we want he ran his hands down his nearly hairless thighs because should he be allowed to return to his own turf then god help us well lose him the russians and the whole ball of wax hello nick nick where have you been ive been trying to reach you all day mumbled something into the receiver his eyes seemed glued shut nick images enwrapped him he had been dreaming of yukio a marriage ceremony before the tomb of the tokugawa a black kite wheeling in the sky gray plovers darting for cover yukio in her white kimono with the crimson edging the two of them facing a buddhist priest low chanting filling the boughs of the pines like snow nick are you there taking her hand the chanting growing loudening her head turning the shock of a yellowed drowned skull recoiling stumbling backward then seeing that it was akiko akiko or yukio which one which one sorry justine satos marriage was yesterday the reception went on until never mind that she said ive got fantastic news it was only now that he heard the note of excitement like a line of tension feathering her voice what is it i spoke to rick millar the day you left remember hed been romancing me for that dream job well i took it i was so excited i started friday nicholas ran a hand through his hair it was barely light out dawn was not far away still he seemed enmeshed in the events of yesterday much as if a new day were not dawning he seemed somehow trapped back at that heartstopping moment when akiko had slowly lowered her fan that face he felt haunted an outcast from time doomed to relive that terrible moment over and over until he found the answer nick have you heard anything ive said there was an edge to her voice now all the elation punctured out i thought you wanted to work for yourself justine he said his mind still far away i cant see why youd want to tie yourself oh christ nick her voice sharpened by anger broke in on him it was all abruptly too much for her his taking that loathsome job his being so far away from her her fearful loneliness through the long nights while the deathless ghost of saigo returned to hover over her and now his inattention mirroring her fathers selfabsorption when she needed him the most and oh she needed nicholas support now congratulations thats what youre supposed to say im happy for you justine is that so hard to say well i am glad but i thought jesus nick it exploded inside her like a burst dam go to hell will you nothing at the other end but dead space and when he tried to dial her number it was busy just as well he thought sadly slowly im not in much condition to make a success of apologizing he lay back in bed naked on top of the covers and wondered in how many ways his memories were betraying him miss yoshidas discreet knock on his hotel room door came at precisely nine am she was right on time good morning linnearsan she said are you ready to go hai but i confess i havent had time to purchase her arm came around from behind her back producing a long wrapped package i took the liberty of bringing you joss sticks i hope you will not be offended on the contrary he said im delighted domo arigato yoshidasan it was sunday greydon was up in misawa visiting his son and tomkin was in bed trying to shake the fever his flu was gifting him with now there was time for family obligations in the smokedglasswindowed limousine heading out of the city nicholas saw that she had changed her makeup she could have passed for twenty and he realized that he had no clear idea of her age she was very quiet almost withdrawn she sat on the other side of the backseat deliberately leaving a space between them that might as well have been a wall several times nicholas was about to say something then seeing the look of concentration on her face thought better of it at last miss yoshida settled her shoulders and turned to him her eyes were very large she had chosen to wear traditional japanese attire and somehow the formal kimono obi and geta served to further transform her peeling back the years linnearsan she began then apparently overcome closed her mouth he saw her take a deep breath as if screwing up her courage in preparation to begin again linnearsan please forgive what i am about to say but it is disturbing to me that you use anata when you speak to me i entreat you to use what is proper omae nicholas considered this what she meant was that no matter how far the emancipation of women had come in japan and there was certainly a good degree of lip service at least paid to this concession to the changing ways of the modern worldwomen and men still used different forms when speaking in effect men ordered when they spoke women pleaded anata and omae meant the same thing you men used omae when speaking to those on their level or below naturally women fell into that category women always used anata the more polite form when speaking to men if they were ever allowed to use the less polite form it was invariably the omaesan version and no matter what anyone said nicholas knew this divergence engendered in women a certain subservient way of thinking it would make me happy yoshidasan he said now if we were to both use the same form can you deny that you as well as i deserve the same politeness in conversation miss yoshidas head was down her liquid eyes in her lap the only outward sign of her agitation was the constant twisting of her fingers i beg you linnearsan to reconsider if you ask this of me i cannot of course refuse but consider the ramifications how could i ever explain such an egregious social breach to satosan this isnt the feudal past yoshidasan nicholas said as gently as he could surely satosan is enlightened enough to understand her head came up and he saw the tiny sparks that might have been incipient tears at the outside edges of her eyes when joined sato petrochemicals linnearsan i was the office lady that was my title no matter my functions one of the requirements for office lady was that i possess yoshitanrei a beautiful appearance but that was ten years ago these days i cannot imagine that the same holds true as you say linnearsan she said softly bobbing her head in obvious acquiescence she could not have made her point more forcefully all right nicholas said after a time well settle on a compromise the anata form will just be between us when we are alone together no one need hear this blasphemy but us a small smile curled at miss yoshidas lips and her head bobbed again hai i accept after a time her head turned away her gaze stretching out to encompass the dimly flowing countryside beyond them you are very kind her whispered voice was very soft miss yoshida was a barely seen stick figure in the misty distance nicholas turned and confronted the gravestones of his parents so many memories so many terrible deaths the quick hard jerk of his mothers shoulders men the short seppuku sword did its work and itami cheongs sisterinlaw dutifully wielding the itatana that would end his mothers pain forever she was a child of honor itami had told him nicholas knelt and began to light the joss sticks but no prayer came to his mind he thought he would remember it all against his will and for no discernable purpose instead he was overwhelmed by another set of memories as a teenager he walked the steep forested hillside of yoshino beloved of all the tenshin shoden katori ruysjonin there was he had come to understand a mystical connection between this land and the men of arcane profession who had made it their home blue mist drifted off the cypress and cryptomeria like veils the colors of dawn shading in pastels of green blue pink and white like chrysanthemum blossoms dissolving in the distance a sharpeyed thrush followed them in intervals the white blobs on its wingtips flashing now and again like the swift opening and dosing of a fan as it flitted from tree to tree twittering at them nicholas and akutagawasan strode side by side the one in the simple black gi of the student the other the pearlescent gray cotton kimono edged in earth brown of the jonin sensei at their backs the stone walls and green tiled roofs of the tenshin shoden katori ryu sprang into light as the slowly rising sun broke the plane of the horizon oblique strokes of new sunlight broke through the branches picking out pinecones and brown needles with the delicacy of a masters brushstroke akutagawasan was still in shadow when he said the mistake we all make before we enter here is the notion of civilization history ethics the very concept of law itself depend for their existence on this one crucial underpinning akutagawasans long melancholy face with its wide lips rather sharp nose and mandarinesque eyes was even more serious than usual among the students who in the tradition of students the world over had created nicknames for their sensei in order to regain at least a semblance of the control that the ryu took from them he was known as the smileless man perhaps it was not so unusual then for these two to have recognized in one another an aspect of themselves and be thus drawn together both in their own way were outcasts in a ryu of outcasts for the legend of the ninja had it that they had evolved from the hinin the basest level of japanese society and as in many levels of japanese society legend often became history whether or not those origins were true now seemed irrelevant since existing ninja had taken that legend and turned it to their advantage using it to further their mystique among people already steeped in mysticism akutagawasan was half chinese it was rumored among the boys the initiates always curious about why he was allowed to be a part of such a secret society within a society their question was answered when they found out the origins of akaininjutsu were to be found in china the fact is nicholas remembered akutagawasan saying emerging into the light there is no such thing as civilization it is a concept the chinese confected or if you prefer the western mode the greeks simply in order to give a certain moral credence to their attempts at dominion over the other peoples of the world nicholas shook his head i dont understand what about all the minute aspects of japanese life that set us apart from everyone else the complexity of the tea ceremony the arts of ukiyoe ikebana haiku the concepts of honor filial duty bushido giri all the things we are akutagawasan looked in that young open face and sighed he had had a son once who had died in manchuria at the hands of the russians every year he made a pilgrimage to china to be closer to what or to whom he had never been sure but now he thought he knew what you speak of nicholasall these things are an accretion of a culture they have no relation to the word civilization save what todays conditioning superimposes on them they moved out along the hillside the thrush keeping a stuttering pace expecting perhaps that his breakfast might be strewn in the wake of these mighty shadows if a society were truly civilized akutagawasan continued there would be no need for the samurai and it would surely not abide warriors such as we there would simply be no need do you see but the concept of civilization is like that of communism pure in the mind it nevertheless cannot exist in reality it is too absolute a concept for man like the theory of relativity it is best thought of food for contemplation for a civilized man would harbor no warlike tendencies he would not spy on another he would not be an adulterer a slanderer a destroyer akutagawasan put his hand on nicholas arm to stop him together they stared out at the partially hidden valley the tops of trees protruding through the sinuously winding mist like the stones on a go board for most people nicholas this is what life consists of the clear and the hidden the knowable and the arcane but for us here it is different when we set the concept of civilization aside we free ourselves and in plunging into the mist we learn to ride the wind to walk on water to hide where there is no hiding place to see where there is no light and hear when our ears are bound you will learn that one breath may sustain you for hours and you will learn how to deal with your enemies none of this is to be taken lightly you understand this i know yet it must be repeated for with the knowledge of how to take life comes the responsibility of a god control is the essence of it all without it there is only chaos and given a chance that kind of malignant anarchy will voraciously engulf our culture all culture nicholas was silent his body still and attuned in his attempt to understand all that akutagawasan was saying much of it seemed beyond his ken for the moment larger than life and thus unknowable but he stored it all in his memory understanding that if he showed patience all would be made clear to him akutagawasan stared out at the ancient countryside inhaling its sharp clean odors as if they were the mingled perfumes of the countrys most accomplished courtesans what you must understand now now before it is too late while you still have time to make the decision is that akaininjutsu is just one form of an entire discipline and as in all such disciplines there are the negative aspects his head turned and his black stone eyes gripped nicholas in donning our mantle you may also become a target for these negative forces one of the reasons i am here is that i am sennin in a number of these have you heard of kujikiri the ninehands cutting nicholas might have stopped breathing kujikiri was the discipline with which saigo had defeated him in kumamoto the year before defiling him and taking yukio away from him then disappearing with her as if the two of them had never existed his lips were dry and he had to try twice before he could articulate it successfully yes it was a harsh sibilant whisper i have heard of it akutagawasan nodded he was careful not to look directly at nicholas and thus be exposed to the inner struggle of emotions causing his student loss of face fukashigisan suspected as much he believes you may need this er unorthodox training in order to survive and survival is what is taught here at the tenshin shoden katori ryu akutagawasans head turned hawklike and his obsidian eyes struck nicholas with the force of a physical contact it was not a blow as such but the electricity of the force behind it caused all of nicholas muscles to tense the reflex of a more primitive and physically aware creature oddly his mind was at peace perfectly clear for the first time since he had returned from his journey across the straits of shimonoseki his river styx to seek out saigo in the underworld of kanaku na ninjutsu akutagawasan smiled slightly there are many chinese origins here but you know the japanese everything must be altered refined to fit their own cultured sensibilities this would be the only time that the sennin would ever speak this way to nicholas or to anyone a sign that he recognized their kinship their mixed heritage you now know the dangers the risks fukashigisan was quite adamant about giving you these caveats and you were not nicholas said responding to an ephemeral shading in the sennins tone do not think that i am not careful fukashigisan and i think alike in many aspects however i did not believe you required these warnings you were correct nicholas took a deep breath i want you to teach me sensei i am not frightened of the kujikiri no akutagawasan said almost sadly but in time you will learn to be he reached out and took nicholas hand now come his voice altered let darkness and death be your middle names forevermore they went off the hillside soon the mist had swallowed them completely the monsters had needed designations they were never with alix logan at the same time but rather spelled each other in twelvehour shifts the beefy one was on duty during the days and bristol thought of him as red the other one the thin wiry nocturnal monster with the long neck and beak of a nose he dubbed blue the first question he had asked himself when he had come upon them was had they been in the car it had been many months since that dark night filled with rain and an evil wind that bent the high thin palms of key west almost to the ground he had been doing fortyfive on the highway when they came up on him very fast with their lights out he felt the fierce jolt forward said what the hell to no one in particular and felt grateful for his seatbelt they were close and knowing that instinctively his eyes would move to his rearview mirror after the ram they turned on their blights in that moment of utter dazzle they moved in for the kill he knew in that flash just how clever they were knew also from his years of experience that there would not be time to regain control of the situation he was not james bond and this was no movie so he did the only thing he could he concentrated on his own survival in the brief instant before they struck again he unlocked the drivers side door and opened it a crack he unsnapped his seatbelt he was no longer concerned with what they would do or how they would do it he only knew that if he did not center all his concern on himself now they would surely kill him when the second ram came it was at just the right angle they had hesitated long enough so that both cars were racing around a bend to the right beyond the low fence on the left the land shot down in a sheer drop of perhaps seventyfive feet the ground was not particularly hard in fact the recent rains had made a rather springy mat of it but there was very little purchase it was a dangerous stretch particularly in this storm and every ten feet or so along the side of the road large signs dotted with ruby red reflector buttons flew by it was as if an enormous creature had taken a bite out of the car the back end slewed right around and the wheel flew out of his hands he let it go working on keeping his equilibrium centrifugal force and the colliding momentums of the vehicles were working against him and the darkness of the night only added to the sense of intense disorientation his hand flew to the partially open door and he had to will himself to stay put through the horrendous sounds of grinding and squealing metal the frightening outofcontrol movement and the sure knowledge that he was heading over the edge and down if he left the car before it went over thered be no point the other cars headlights would pick him up and theyd run him over while he was helpless but now the front end of the car had slammed into the low railing the shriek of more metal tearing flinging itself upward bursting apart and he lurched forward having to brace the heels of his hands against the padded dash remembering to flex his elbows slightly to help cushion the force so that he wouldnt break his arms in half then the nose of the car was thrusting upward the seat springs rocking crazily rain sleeted in the partially open window drenching him blinding him and for that instant he felt a rising panic afraid that they were going to succeed after all the car bucked forward as if kicked from behind the front end lowering the wheels spinning for purchase and finding none he had long ago taken his foot off both the gas and the brake pedals he left the car in gear though it might have been better to throw it into neutral he did not want to leave any traces of how he was going about saving himself to feed to the investigators who would surely come and do their thorough job if the sea didnt claim his coffin he wanted to be dead now he began to tumble leaving behind the short verge beyond the slick road he heard the tearing of clods of earth above the noise of the engine and the cars back wheels skidded sickeningly slewing him again so that his shoulder slammed against the door post and he sucked in his breath another inch or so forward and he would have tumbled out the unlocked door on his head all the way down a broken neck and sightless eyes staring impotently up at the white peering faces of his murderers none of that for him he held on and now there was only an eerie kind of silence rushing in the aftermath of all the frenzy and sound wind whistled through the partially opened window and then the car took its first unsteady bump on the side of the sheer cliff one side hit heavier than the other and that started the oscillation soon he knew it would get so great on the fourth or fifth landing perhaps that the vehicle would flip over and then he would have no chance at all he could see nothing that would help him he was in the tunnel of the night a steel coffin and he knew he must rely totally on sensation the feeling in his stomach his hands his legs his heart it was now or never he drew his legs up so that he was kneeling on the seat so that there was no possibility that his feet would get caught in the well quickly now he moved onto his back feet first toward the swinging door out he went watched dizzily detachedly the shock and pain turning him into an unconcerned spectator as the tumbling car hit the churning water hood first and sank into the deep without a trace bristol did not think much about that night now except to speculate on who it was whod tried to kill him at first he was certain that it had been frank raphael tomkins man but that was before he had come upon the monsters now he was not so sure he had come down to key west to find alix logan now that he had found that she was already covered he wondered who were they these monsters who never let her out of then sight were they working for tomkin were they all part of the coverup of tomkins murder of angela didion there was no way bristol could know that until he spoke to alix logan back in new york matty the mouth had given him her name bristol had known there had been a witness to the murder and if he was going to nail tomkin he would have to find her the contact had given him the name and the place for an unconscionably large amount of money but it had been worth it now bristol knew he was very close and he had told matty the mouth to get out of town for a while he owed the man that much down in key west after his supposed death after he had recovered from the fractured arm he had set himself up on watch he had plenty of idle time when he had nothing to do but wait movement or stillness dark and light they were all that existed for him and alix logan staring at her often brought the thought of gelda to mind but that was of course pointless he could not contact her in any way he must remain dead in order to stay buried near alix logan undetected and unmolested it was a difficult enough task to shadow someone it was all but impossible to do it when someone was trying to ice you bristol how may times during those long cramped hours of waiting had he worked the name around on his tongue his real name had faded out an image in an old and bleached photo album that was long ago and far away he had become tex bristol and that was how he thought of himself now just as everyone around him who knew him did there was only one person in the world who knew he had not died in the flaming car crash that night and she would never tell he had had just enough money left to get him up to san antonio he had known marie a long time ago in new york they had been on opposite sides of the law then now he was not so sure of where either of them stood but she was smart and tough and she knew everyone she had provided him with medical service and the paraphernalia of his new identity birth certificate social security card drivers license even a passport slightly worn franked several times for europe and asia he thought that a nice touch even though he didnt think hed need it hed taken the passport anyway along with thirty thousand in cash marie had asked no questions and when he had offered no explanations she went on to other matters she even seemed pleased to see him back in new york they had worked each other to a mexican standoff it had been the first time for each of them and they had learned from it you could even say they liked each other after a fashion when he left bristol knew that he owed her more than he could ever repay sir the penetrating ebon eyes lifted up into the pale mauve light and shadows skittered about the bare walls of the room like kittens chasing each other what is it the voice was more than brusque it contained within its guttural growl a definite tinge of disdain that caused the young lieutenant who had come into the room to feel somehow diminished as if he were in the presence of a being more than human it was a calculated tone but no less effective for that artifice thought the man now as he accepted the young lieutenants presence nodding him forward ruled the world a careful daily grooming of his voice kept things running smoothly at the safe house it was his experience that one could many times give the merest outline of fear and ones adversary whether it be this young lieutenant eager for promotion or one of the old guard back home supplied all the rest it left one free to pursue more pressing matters the latest printouts from sakhov iv sir the young uniformed lieutenant said handing over a sheaf of graph paper and how many passes have we here lieutenant viktor protorov head of the ninth directorate of the kgb said just over a half dozen sir i see protorovs gaze lowered to the sheaf he could feel the slight relaxing of the man in front of him and what if anything does this mass hold for me lieutenant i dont know sir oh come now protorov looked up he tapped the sheet with a rather long nail a new batch of highly classified printouts from sakhov iv what our government publiclycalls a digital imaging reconnaissance satellite centering on that section of the pacific ocean between the kuriles and where we are in the north of hokkaido an area we have been concentrating on for how many months now seven since we moved from the aerodrome in iturup comes in if you havent taken a good hard look at these lieutenant youre either stupid or incompetent protorov leaned back in his chair tell me are you either of these for a moment the young man said nothing he had begun to sweat beneath his superiors intense gaze and questioning you put me in a most untenable position sir if i say yes then my career in the directorate is finished if i say no then it is obvious that i have deliberately lied to my superior well lieutenant if the day ever comes when you are captured by the capitalist enemy then you can be quite certain that they too will put you in an untenuous position they had been conversing in english excuse me sir the young lieutenant said but thats untenable not untenuous answer the question protorov said beginning to sift through the visual data provided by sakhov ivs immensely powerful infrared video equipment an involuntary chill went through him at the thought that the americans might have such a potent weapon he was only slightly cheered by the knowledge that his countrys landbased antisatellite lasers could and had in recent days past bring down the threat he got to the third sheet times running out its a sure bet the americans wont give you this long you wont find what weve been looking for in those the lieutenant said at last as if with one long breath all the air had gone out of his lungs protorovs gaze stripped him bare then you have looked at these sir security regulations require that the od bring all passionate documents to me first for verification passionate was the rather ironic term protorov had coined for highestpriority matter circulating within the directorate sneak peekies you mean protorov grumbled he lifted a hand all right i hope you do as well with the americans if your day ever comes i am more frightened of you than of the americans sir then learn to be frightened of them lieutenant his gaze lifted again because they mean to destroy everything you and i hold dear but he was pleased with the young man he had seen the only way out of the trap protorov had set for him he had even caught protorovs deliberate usage error once the young man had left he pored over the computergenerated satellite photos again but by the end of his second pass he had been forced to admit defeat there was no anomaly of any kind again he did not know of course precisely what he was looking for only had knowledge of its name tenchi it was the japanese word for heaven and earth where are you he thought now staring impotently at the detailed pictures covering the graphs before him what are you and why are you so important to the japanese tenchi had begun as just another routine report crossing his desk back in moscow yet it had tantalized him and once he had come out here and had immersed himself in the well of rumor alleged fact and outrageous fiction he had found himself totally hooked until at this point he was obsessed with finding the answer from what he had gleaned he was convinced tenchi even the knowledge of it would give him the last of the leverage he needed for the coup back home how bitter it was to learn that fedorin one of the kgbs own was no better than all the rest of the career diplomats who had populated the kremlin before him oh yes at first he had seemed to be getting the sluggish leviathan that was soviet russia working again movement here and there could be discerned but in the end it had all been a sham a selfserving political maneuver whose scope could not long conceal its sole purpose to rid the communist hierarchy of all those who might oppose the new premier but of course protorov had held out no real hope that fedorin or anyone else in power for that matter would grasp the one true key to awakening the ussr the essential nature of the beast and that was that russia was not one country but an uneasy amalgam of many different russias all fiercely protective of their own part of the mother country what did an uzbek or a kirghiz give a fig what was happening in moscow anyway did a belorussian or an azerbaidzhani care how many missiles america had leveled at vladivostok and the lithuanians estonians georgians not to mention the nonslavs such as the tatars bashkirs mordvinians udmurts or komi did they feel any differently what was there to bind them together protorov knew the answer to that one nothing the first step to putting soviet russia on the move lay in uniting all its divergent people because once that happened the ussr would be unstoppable no nation on earth no coalition of nations could stop her fedorin had had a chance to get the new revolution underway but he like all the bureaucrats who ran the country lacked the scope of vision necessary to make that one great leap to cross the rubicon into dangerous and unknown waters thus he had allowed the slothful giant to lapse back into somnolence protorov knew only too well how long a time it could be between soviet premiers he was unwilling to wait his turn or perhaps he was intelligent enough to understand that it might never come on its own therefore he had begun his own plans for cutting short the current premiers term in office and now he believed that tenchi was the wand of power he needed to persuade the cabal of militant generals and officers in the kgb to exert their influence at once a point of ignition had to be reached protorov knew he must be the bridge between the traditionally feuding kgb and gru to that end he had spent more than six years cultivating a young gru colonel powerful and ambitious yvgeny mironenko would soon be in a position to also be a bridge between the factions for only by uniting these two mailed fists outside the kremlin could protorov be certain of the success of his coup without them he was lost and without him russia was lost he lacked only the one element of power that would bring all of them into his palm and that one element was tenchi the intercom buzzed on his desk like an angry insect and for a moment protorovs attention was deflected he reached out one long finger yes the subject is ready good bring him in he reached out and extinguished the mauve light plunging the room into utter darkness there were no windows here and only one egress its fifteeninch steel door protorov sat back in his chair and fought the urge to smoke he compromised his restless hands by lacing his fingers presently he heard movement the thick door sighed open pneumatically as three men crossed the threshold for just a moment the heavy light of the hallway streamed across the black rubberized flooring then as the door swung shut darkness swallowed the floating ribbons without sight protorov knew who had entered the young lieutenant the doctor and the subject protorov and the doctor who was a neuropharmacologica expert had been at work on the subject for almost three days now the american was a very stubborn man protorov had to give him that he had not broken and frankly protorov did not expect him to he expected him to die in a way protorov felt sorry for the man as he heard the semiarticulate babbling created by the multitude of sera the doctor had shot into the subject this was not the way for a modernday warrior to go captured by the enemy forcibly ejected into rapidpaced daynight continua so that weeks became compressed into hours until a state of body vertigo was induced according to the prevalent theory the body would do their work for them breaking down the mind blockages through its own induced trauma protorov believed none of it these days there were ways to stop a ferret from talking when he did not want to hypnosis electronic implants and if all else failed he could selfdestruct sadness overwhelmed protorov as the increasingly animated animal noises invaded his ears this was not the way it should end for any of them better by far the fierce handtohand struggle the rising anima the primal urges that came in the struggle to avoid death at all costs protorovs mind raced back to the first time he had felt the cold to feel the cold was the kgb wet meaning active in the field directorates phrase for the kill the first time for protorov was indelibly etched into a corner of his mind he had been a raw lieutenant then well trained from the kgb complex outside sevastopol he thought he was a crackerjack a worldbeater he had not reckoned on the field which cut all men down to size they had sent him to siberia a topsecret series of experiments attempting to tap the perpetual galeforce winds in the north had been infiltrated by the americans in verkhoyansk the coldest place in the world he had ferreted out the infiltrator made him bolt from his hole and one after the other they had raced across the frozen tundra onto the ice fields two utter madmen only the cold could win in verkhoyansk man was nothing a tiny mote in natures vast well of snow and ice the snow the snow always and forever the snow it was blinding chilling numbing it was death but all protorov could think of was his first assignment oh but he did not understand the meaning not at all singlemindedly he pursued his quarry seeking to feel the cold together they tumbled to the ice skidding and sliding froths of loose snow fountaining upward as they collided stupidly protorov had decided on a gun with a silencer but long since the elements laughing had frozen all the carefully oiled working parts similarly his knife would not unfold there was nothing left but his hands for almost half an hour they grappled indecisively in the ice and snow the bulky clothes made handtohand combat clumsy and difficult meanwhile the frost was sapping their energies and later protorov would come to understand that it was only his stamina that had allowed him to prevail he had not been smarter or stronger or quicker all the things he had been taught to believe he was those were lies he had just outlasted the american what little satisfaction he had found in grinding the dark foreign head into the bloodpink snow while the breath slowed and at last stilled stemmed from the knowledge that he protorov was still alive chest heaving mouth dry pulse thundering and the bile rushing upward into his throat bitter and searingly acidic all at once his extremities began to shake uncontrollably and all warmth left him he stared down at the humped thing he straddled and thought wonderingly this was once a human being an enemy of the state they had told him yes he reiterated an enemy an enemy time thats left with a start that no one could see protorov came out of his memories whats that his voice was sharp making certain the doctor understood that it was his fault protorov had not heard what he had said weve used up all the time thats left comrade do we have anything protorov wanted to know anything at all the tape machines have every word the doctor said and protorov thought i have your number comrade there is one positive element protorov turned his attention to the young lieutenant seeing something of himself in the younger man we now know that the americans are no closer to tenchi than we are in fact i would venture a guess that we have more penetration at this moment protorov considered this the lieutenant was of course correct but protorov also knew that there was a second positive element to this and that was the subject himself or more accurately who the subject belonged to all right protorov said in his dismissive tone wrap up the corpse and deliver him back to his kennel on honshu i want the americans made aware of their error immediately when he was again alone in the odd windowless room he turned on the powerful fans to rid the space of the cloying afterscents of drugs and death then he lit up switching on his lamp he once more pored over the readouts from sakhov iv he was closer to tenchi now than he ever had been he could feel it his eyes roved the folded sheets was it already here why couldnt he see it then with a deep growl of disgust he swept the useless sheaf into the hopper beside his desk and turned the shredder to autofeed the deep whine of scissoring steel teeth filled the air thoughts of feeling the cold and the grisly package that would soon be delivered to the enemys doorstep led to his concern over sakhov iv even with all its ultrasophisticated equipment he had found it to be a dismal failure but then again it was only a machine it could only do what men had programmed it to do nothing more or perhaps there had been a malfunction somewhere within the miles of multimilliondollar circuitry no matter protorov had his own human satellite and it was still functioning perfectly now akutagawasan said from out of the mist from out of nicholas memory we will begin but how nicholas said i can see nothing did you never in kansatsus ryu train with the blindfold of course but that was within the boundaries of the dojo the space was precise and uncluttered with trees stones and underbrush the configurations of which i am unfamiliar with this vapor akutagawasan continued as if nicholas had not spoken is like the darkness but far more difficult to negotiate in the darkness you may be guided by albescence a sliver of moon the patch of a household lantern even the glitter of the stars but here there is nothing but the mist i cannot even see you but you can hear me yes quite well you sound as if you are in my left ear but i shall discount the peculiar acoustics never discount acoustics akutagawasan said rather strive to understand them so that they will become another weapon in your arsenal nicholas said nothing but tried to concentrate on gaining his bearings in the valley in yoshino finally he decided that were it not for the jonins comforting presence he would be totally lost you have heard i imagine that much of the kujikiri derives its power from jaho magic tell me nicholas do you believe in magic i believe in what is sensei and discount what is not for a time there was silence that is a very wise answer from such a young man now i want you to listen to me closely there is in all people a layer a middle layer of being that lies between the conscious and the subconscious it is a land where the imagination reigns it is where daydreams originate where quick overblown fears are created it is where daytoday anxiety is manufactured it is not magic nor is it an extrasensory layer rather its origins are quite primitive our early ancestors required the active assistance of this layer to heighten their perceptions in order for them to survive against wild animals marauding bands of other primitive men who sought their women or the shelter of their home caves oh yes caves that is how far back in time i speak of now but with the coming of socalled civilization this middle layers reason for existence slowly atrophied with houses and apartments locked and bolted with mans utter dominance over all other life forms on the planet what use was this layer and yet it refused to die out instead it became the creator of small fears anxieties at work fear of dismissal fear of rejection in love petty jealousies regarding other workers all blown up out of proportion meant to keep the organism alert and functioning at peak efficiency for its survival and yet survival is no longer the issue from day to day rather it is betterment and so the supposed sharpness turns to anxiety the modern ailment now i reiterate to you nicholassan that there is nothing mystic about this layer it is not meditation we are not now speaking of the province of the holy man for you and i are certainly not that we are both men of the world and have not the time nor the inclination to give up the plethora of worldly appetites the holy man must divest himself of in order to reach these exalted states getsumei no michi the moonlit path is open to you now nicholas you must find it and learn to sink into it i cannot help you in this other than by alerting you to its existence but it may be of some help to daydream and then follow that daydream home how will i know getsumei no michi senseil by two things one is that you will feel all sensation gained in weight and resonance do you mean that i will hear better yes but only in a certain way do not confuse weight with amplification you will not as you say hear any better you will hear differently the second sensation will be the awareness of light even when there is none in your immediate surroundings forgive me sensei but i do not understand that it is not necessary to understand nicholas merely to remember at the last akutagawasans voice had begun to fade and now nicholas feared that he was all alone on the lower slope of the hillside he was a long way from the ryu and the mist had damped his usually reliable directional facilities he felt the first hard pangs of panic welling up in his chest he found he had an overpowering urge to cry out to akutagawasan but the acute loss of face involved not only for him but even more importantly for kansatsu his former sensei who had guided him here made him bite his lip instead through the fluttering of his heart he recalled akutagawasans one bit of advice to take a daydream and ride it home he sat down on the damp ground in the lotus position and closed his eyes he struggled to control his breathing the intense pounding of his blood in his veins his hands lay open palms up on his bent knees he opened his mind to the first image that swam to the surface yukio instinctively he clamped down on the image and he thought no its still too painful i dont want to think about her loss try something else but nothing else would come yukio was who he wanted to daydream about and with a great effort he willed himself to relax and think about her cascade of nightblack hair those heavylidded eyes so full of sexual promise he recalled their first meeting at the military dance her firm warm thigh pressed against his leg and then astoundingly the erotic feel of her mound rubbing against his crotch her eyes sparkling with mischief as they danced amid the spinning couples he remembered the shower he had taken the sinewy shadow appearing beyond the glass door its abrupt opening and yukio standing beside him nude droplets of water beading along her cool flank the jut of one darknippled breast his startled sound as she moved against him the warm friction the silken embrace the peach taste of her mouth the hot swipe of her tongue and the heated liquid union the long ecstatic slide the engulfment while the silvery sheen of the water spattered their shoulders and necks in a cascade of light his head came up and his eyes opened and abruptly he saw akutagawasan standing to the side of him silent observing nicholas felt a peculiar heaviness in his chest an oddly sexual feeling he felt as if he had descended into a depression from which he had the perfect vantage point on the world he was aware of more even while he saw less in the conventional sense he moved his head was he actually seeing akutagawasan or sensing him he opened his mouth and voiced the question i have no answer to that nicholas save to say that it does not matter getsumei no michi is there and we use it but i will tell you this quite important aspect of it it is body sense rather than ego it is only your nonoriental side that seeks an understanding your oriental side allowed you to let go of your ego something no westerner could ever do because he is too afraid he fears a letting go because in the primitive mind it is eternally linked to death westerners as we are aware seek to understand death because they fear it so they cannot accept as we do they have no concept of karma nor can they see what is most apparent to us that death is part of life akutagawasan began to move and as he did so it was nicholas impression that his getad feet did not touch the earth now that you have found the moonlit path it is time to use the energy there to conjure up the first superficial stages of the kujikiri this alone will take many months and at first it will be bad for you for here we will manufacture pure terror and before you can inure yourself to its manifestations you must succumb nightmares will haunt your sleep as they will your waking hours you will become sunkeneyed and even at the lowest ebb may wish to commit seppuku you do not frighten me sensei akutagawasans grim visage did not lighten that is good now remember well what you have said as we begin our descent into the maelstrom of hell the dawning of a dank drizzly monday brought everyone back to reality a smog alert was in effect and immediately nicholas stepped out of the hotel entrance he could see why the air above the slick streets was brownish gray and as it rose upward so solid seeming it completely obscured any structure above the twelfth floor no hope of seeing the crest of fujiyama from satos office this day tomkin joining him in the limo for the stopandstart trip across town to shinjuku seemed better though he was still pale and drawn from his ordeal and he said the smog was giving him a pounding headache as they left the limo outside satos building totnkin caught him by the arm and said in a low gritty voice remember nick this weeks our deadline youve got to make the merger happen now his eyes still contained a tinge of fever brightness and his breath was as foul as ever miss yoshida met them at the elevators summit and ushered them into satos enormous office this high up the windows overlooked darkness it could have been the middle of the night all the lights were on as if to dispel this cloud of gloom when they were all seated comfortably save for ishii who stood against the wall like a guard sato began before we resume our negotiations i would like to explain why i asked our respective counsels if they would step away for a moment no disrespect to greydonsan was intended but nangisan and i both thought it prudent to keep this part of our meeting just between us he cleared his throat while nangi lit a cigarette with careful deliberation tomorrow afternoons meetings will have to be rescheduled i am afraid because we must attend the funeral of our loyal friend kagamisan he paused for a moment as if unsure how to proceed it may seem a crass request to make at this time but we quite naturally feel that some answers must be reached he leaned slightly forward so that he approached the area where nicholas and tomkin were seated side by side on the sofa linnearsan i must tell you that we are absolutely mystified by the manner of kagamisans death we know nothing of this wushing that you mentioned on friday nor can we think of a reason for murder being committed here in light of all this i trust that you now having had some small time to marshal your thoughts and surmises may give us some insight into what happened to our poor colleague and friend it was an elegant speech and nicholas admired it but he could not rightly say that his mind was fully focused on the murder of kagami truth to tell since he had seen akiko at the wedding his mind had been filled with nothing but the burning image of her face and the maddening thought is she yukio he felt slightly ashamed now to have been so slavishly selfinvolved all weekend it was utterly unlike him and that above all worried him now as he hurriedly recalled the catalog of his observations in and around the bloodsplattered steam room he muscled his own doubts and fears aside he laced his fingers together tapped the thumbs over and above the bizarre appearance of the wushing tattoo on kagamisans cheek there were a number of abnormalities that would i think preclude a simple explanation such as assault by a madman that sort of thing it was premeditated ishii broke in is that what youre saying i am nicholas said for one thing the murderer left no discernable footprints outside the door even though that areas constantly saturated with moisture sato groaned heavily and glanced at nangi when the other did not return his gaze sato stood up and walked to the bar though it was only a little past ten he fixed himself a drink and it was a measure of his agitation that he forgot his manners completely and failed to offer anyone else a refreshment he took a long swallow and staring at nothing in the mirror behind the bar cleared his throat linnearsan you said there were a number of abnormalities why dont you wait for the police a westerner would have of course given an answer sato merely stared at nicholas and what his eyes said was that is why you were allowed inside sato petrochemicals business because we want no police intervention nicholas had asked the question because he had to be certain of these people why they did not relish the thought of police involvement did not concern him why they had involved him did i fear kagamisan was not killed quickly pardon me but what do you mean ishii asked he was struck many times nicholas said by a sharpbladed weapon do you know what kind sato asked im not certain nicholas said it could be any number of shuriken sato had gone through half his long whiskey otherwise there was no outward sign of his agitation linnearsan he said when you first mentioned this wushing you said it was a series of punishments may we deduce that because it uses the character wu there are five of them nicholas looked uncomfortable yes thats correct mo is the first and therefore the least of the punishments what can be more severe than death nangi said somewhat angrily i was referring to mo itself nicholas looked at him strictly speaking it should only have been that tattooing of the face nangis cane clickclacking across the short expanse of bare wooden floor that separated satos true office space from the informal conference area where the rest of them stood or sat announced his approach then this murdering of the victim as well is unusual he had pounced on it immediately highly unusual nicholas said he sat quite still his hard hands clasped between his knees he forced an absolute calm onto his face into every aspect of his physical being the last thing he wanted was either of them to become aware of his inner feelings his mind was still reeling from the thought that someone from his own ryu someone steeped in the arcane ways of akaininjutsu could perpetrate such an act it was quite unthinkable and yet it had happened he had seen the grisly evidence and he knew there could be no doubt at all fervently he prayed that no one would ask him the one question that might detonate the whole situation theres something i dont understand tomkin said and nicholas prepared himself to answer the unanswerable this woching or however its pronounced is chinese you said whats with this crossreferencing between japanese and chinese i thought the two cultures were separate and distinct i thought only ignoramous westerners say they cant tell one from the other the phone rang in the ensuing silence and ishii launched himself away from the bar to pick it up they waited while he spoke softly into the receiver he had left instructions that they not be disturbed he punched a button hung up its a call for you nangisan he said what dark emotion swam within his eyes nicholas wondered apparently it cannot wait nangi nodded ill take it in the other room he went back across the office through the open passageway to the tokonoma where nicholas had first caught sight of him the tension in the room was thick and now nicholas used his training to seek a way of dissipating that high level of energy as well as diverting interest away from areas he was still reluctant to discuss here why an ancient form of chinese punishment should be taught in an essentially japanese discipline is simple he began it is said and not i think without a great deal of merit that ninjutsu had its origins on the asian continent somewhere more specifically in northeastern china certainly it had existed long before japan became civilized but then so have many of the more ancient customs and traditions in japan he got up and went across the room his movements pantherlike he moved like some dancers tomkin had seen with a very low center of gravity as if the floor itself were springy as a mat of dried grass resettling himself on the sofa across from tomkin with sato and ishii on his left side he continued in fact china and japan are more closely bound than either country likes to admit since the enmity between them is longstanding and quite bitter nevertheless you only have to take such a basic of life as language to see what i mean chinese and japanese are virtually interchangeable he paused a moment to see if the japanese were going to protest until the fifth century there was no written japanese language at all rather they relied on kataribe people trained from birth to be professional memorizers building up a finely detailed oral history of early japan but that as we know today is a mark of a primitive civilization chinese characters were introduced into japan in the fifth century but the practice of using kataribe was so firmly entrenched in a culture always reluctant to change that it persisted for at least another three hundred years but there are differences in the two languages sato offered he seemed grayed and defeated ishii appeared to be doing nothing at all but breathing oh yes nicholas said of course there would have to be even so far in the past the japanese were true to their own nature never very good at innovation they nevertheless excel at improving on someone elses basic design the problem with chinese is its awesome cumbersomeness it contains many thousands of characters and since it was used largely for the recordings at the imperial court and official proceedings the language was not well suited for everyday use the japanese therefore began to work on a phonetic syllabary now known as hiragana to make the chinese kanji more adaptable as well as to express those matters uniquely japanese for which there were no chinese characters at all and by the middle of the ninth century this had been done it was coincidentally just about the time that the eastern european countries were developing the cyrillic alphabet sometime later another new syllabary was introduced katakana to be used for colloquialisms and foreign words being introduced into japan as an augmentation for the fortyeightsyllable hiragana but a curious holdover from chinese custom was already in effect in japan no chinese woman ever used kanji and therefore here too it was considered well ungraceful for a japanese woman to use the language so they took to hiragana and katakana and in the process created the countrys first true written literature the pillow book of seishonagon and the classic genji monogatari both dating from the beginning of the eleventh century just a wall away nangi was sitting at a desk clear of all papers and folders the cedar gleamed its high polish giving it an almost mirrorlike surface within which he could see part of his own face yes he said down the open line nangisan the voice sounded thin and strange as if the electronic medium had somehow inverted it pulling out its soul in the process this is anthony chin chin was the director of the allasia bank of hong kong that nangi had bought into almost seven years ago when through a combination of fiscal mismanagement and a series of unfortunate market fluctuations within the crown colony it had been on the verge of going under nangi had flown into hong kong and had worked out a bailout scheme within ten days that left his keiretsu with a maximum of cash flow after twenty months while providing it with a minimum of risk after the initial year and three quarters however beginning in the spring of a land boom had commenced within the tiny teeming colony of unheralded proportions anthony chin had been at the forefront of the boom and with nangis consent had invested much of allasias primary capital in real estate and both he and the keiretsu had prospered tremendously as property values rose sharply until by the end of they had quadrupled but for almost a year before that chin had counseled expansion its got to just keep going he had told nangi in late theres just no alternative theres no room at all left on the island or across the harbor theres plans afoot to make sha tin in the new territories the hong kong for the new middle class ive seen plans for sixteen different highrise complexes all within a mile or two of the race track if we get in now well double our capital within two years but nangi had opted for caution after all he told himself rationally britains ninetynineyear lease on the new territories was coming due of course every citizen of the colony discounted communist china reasoning that since hong kong and macao were its only real windows on the west and provided such a lucrative flow of money into red china it would be against their own best interests to abrogate the lease or not to renew it at the very least but nangi had had plenty of dealings with the communist chinese and he knew how their minds worked and he thought near the beginning of that there might be something else they would be needing more than mere money he had successfully predicted the downfall of mao and thence the gang of four this was easy for him since he recognized in modern china precisely the same circumstances that created the overthrow of the threehundredyear tokugawa shogunate in his own country and had established the meiji restoration in order to survive in modern times the chinese leadership had come at last to the painful conclusion that they must open themselves up to the west they had to pull themselves out of the selfimposed isolationism that mao had thrust them into a veritable dark ages since industry atrophied along with culture commerce and artistic expression all for the sake of the fiveyear plans and intense repression increasingly nangi had seen that more than profits china would need two elements to set her on her lumbering feet and both inspired within him awe and terror heavy industry and nuclear capability china was in need of wholesale transplants and there just was not enough money to pay for them there was only one other path for them to take barter and the only commodity they possessed with which to play for such astronomical stakes was hong kong if they could threaten england with expulsion a complete breakdown of all that great britain had labored so hard and so long for on the tip of the asian shore and if they could make it completely believable then they could extort almost anything they wished from that country certainly england possessed all the modern technology china could hope for toward this end nangi felt china would soon be making her first move that would no doubt involve some kind of public statement indicating that the original lease was a document which for them had no validity then would come their inevitable announcement that at some time in the future date unspecified of course they would begin a reinstitution of chinese control over the colony revelations like that nangi knew full well would burst the current real estate boom in a flash what foreign investor would want to sink his money into that kind of political quicksand the inevitable result would be that both the hong kong real estate and stock markets would take a nose dive nangi did not want to be caught in that so he vetoed all of anthony chins requests for expansion let the others do that he had said well sit on our profits and events had borne out his worst fears the chinese announcements had come late in bringing her majesty queen elizabeth running at full tilt her people had set up an extensive round of talks with the communists hoping to get the main issues resolved immediately and thus head off the expected downturn in the colonys economy nangi had had to smile at that just as he had had to smile at his own perspicacity and caution the chinese now that they had the upper hand were going to string this out as long as possible enjoying their dominant position it was essential to make britain suffer as long as possible in order to bring home to the dense westerners the dire straits in which they found themselves the talks had broken off inconclusively and the crash had come to hong kong from a high of in june of the hang seng the colonys stock market index plummeted to the s in december of in early some of the smaller property companies began to fail followed in the third quarter of the year by two or three of the larger ones but john bremidge hong kongs financial secretary said the real thing to worry about is the financial and banking sector theyre scared at present now as he took anthony chins call nangi again thanked god for his wise course of conservative action how are things in the garden spot of china it was their own private capitalistic joke but this time chin did not respond im afraid i have some bad news nangisan if its another run on the banks dont concern yourself nangi said we can weather it you know how much capital we have thats just it chin said its much less than you think we wont be able to hold against even a minor run nangi consciously slowed his heartbeat which for just an instant had leaped he fought for calm and reaching into the nonspace that was the home of the holy trinity he found it his mind teemed with a thousand questions but before he opened his mouth he arranged them in order of importance first things first where is the money in six of the sha tin developments anthony chin said miserably i know what your orders were but you were not here i was on top of the situation day to day i saw just how much money we stood to make now we cant get tenants to move in not with the unsettled climate the fears about the communists everyone is shaken here all the taipans even youre fired nangi said curtly you have ten minutes to be out of the building after that the security people will have orders to arrest you they will do the same if you touch or alter any files he hung up and quickly redialed the bank asking for allan su allasias statistical vice president mr su this is tanzan nangi please do not ask any questions as of this moment you are president of allasia anthony chin no longer works for me please give your security people orders to evict him as of now have them make certain he takes nothing of the banks with him now to business he would have to take one of them out red or blue which would it be riding the waves cerulean and a green the shade of translucent jade bristol thought it would be blue he sat in a swaybacked canvas directors chair that had seen better days paying out his line waiting for something to strike the bait twisting fifteen feet below not more than a hundred yards to port the long sleek twinscrew pleasure boat carrying alix logan a halfdozen of her friends and the red monster who was doing his level best not to stick out like a sore thumb sat in the water he had gone so far as to take off his shirt which bristol thought was a mistake because it only emphasized the paleness of the flesh on his chest back and upper arms there was plenty of muscle though and bristol took careful note he wondered how alix had introduced him to her friends the line went taut and the ratcheting of the set reel began bristol watched the end of the rod bending and quivering and he began the reelin if it had been a tossup he probably would have chosen the red monster to take out because he was even bigger than bristol was and after all this time bristol was itching for a fight but as it was there was no contest in the months of his surveillance he had come to hate the blue monster for one thing he had a way of looking at alix that went beyond a strictly business interest somehow over time blue had developed a proprietary absorption to the red monster she was just another piece of meat an assignment like many others he had had before and would have again isolate and protect he stuck to the letter of the command he had been given they had a laundry list an accounting of people in her life who had been checked out and were okay for her to associate with blue the night man loved to look at her he was allowed inside her apartment not for the entire night of course but just long enough when she returned home to check the place out thoroughly then the door would slam and hed saunter down the concrete steps a wooden toothpick twirling from one corner of his mouth to the other hed cross the street heading for the chrome and glass box of the fried chicken franchise less than a block away hed buy a pail of extra crispy that would feed a family of four and hunker down in an orange plastic seat his lips full of grease his cheeks flecked with bits of chicken skin hed stare at the lighted window square behind which alix logan was undressing for bed and lick his lips bristol did not think it had anything at all to do with the food a force jolted him all the way down at the base of the rod and things began to hot up he pushed the soles of his worn topsiders against the aft coaming and hauled back mightily on the rod the force of god was down there and the answering twist almost pulled him out of his chair what in christs name had he lit onto his back muscles tensed as he brought all his brawn to bear against the sea creature at the other end of his line a hundred yards away across the diamondlike sparkle of the rolling sea alix and her friends were in their suits their coppery skin shining with suntan oil faces held up to the streaming sunlight hair floating in the wind tops popped off iced cans of bud handed around laughter floated across the water bristol fought the fish even as his eyes were on the activity aboard the pleasure boat even as his mind still turned over his feelings for the blue monster his great muscles corded and he felt the adrenaline pumping through him exulting him damn but it was good to be alive the terror of the grave tomkin wanted him in was an inconstant specter inside him that night the tumbling car the uncontrollable motion the soaring stomachwrenching free fall the ground coming up the overpowering darkness the vertigo the getout and the searing fireball of his coffin the triumphant shout of the flames licking near his cheek and rolling rolling looking again and again with each rapid revolution into the face of death with a fierce grin bristol reeled in the line feeling with every sense he possessed the skein of life flowing all around him he felt the rhythmic rocking of the boat as it negotiated the deep sea swells he breathed deeply of the clean salt air laced with the pungency of marine fuel felt the hot bite of the sunlight on his arms and shoulders the colors of the water flashed before him now deep blue then aquamarine turquoise even far out a thin feathery line of pale green but mostly he felt the life at the other end of the line the fight the strategy of working the big fish closer ever closer to the boats side and the ultimate landing during new yorks long frigid winters he had dreamed of such moments and now he was living them the fish was close now he could see its frothy wake every so often as it neared the surface knew that that was the time to brace himself to let off the reels safety and allow the creature its head to plunge downward into the oceans depths that would do nothing more than set the hook more firmly in its cheek but it only knew that it must get away and instinctively it went down the reel screamed as the line payed out in a blur and he knew that if he were holding on to the line too tightly it would snap under the enormous force of the fishs dive and now it reached the end and lifting the rod in a long smooth arc he began to reel in the line slowly steadily with a great deal of patience it would be a long afternoon out here and he had nowhere else to go unless the skipper of the nearby pleasure boat decided to move on always he had one eye on the other craft it was important he knew not to become a passive observer most likely youd be put to sleep and youd learn nothing he had been taught to use stakeout time to actively learn about the subject moods as well as habits were important because there would surely come day when observer and subject would meet and in that confrontation the observers acquired knowledge often made the difference in establishing a dialogue the big fish was tiring and as bristol wound the line in more quickly now he saw alixs tall lithe form detach itself from the pack and move with surefooted grace up along the deck forward the red monster drinking a beer turned his head for a moment catching the movement nothing was happening so he went back to his quiet drinking alix reached the tubular aluminum railing rising from the prow of the boat and stood leaning her arms rigid her longfingered hands wrapped around the upper bars for a long time she stared out to sea at the long unbroken line of the horizon blue on blue then her gaze dropped to the water lapping gently below her her eyes were fixed she seemed mesmerized by something she saw down there in the clear water in one last burst of energy the fish at the other end of bristols line dove straight down and for just a moment his entire concentration was directed at not losing the creature when he looked up alix was gone bristols head whipped around she was not on deck perhaps she had needed to use the head or the sun had got to be too much for her bristol had a sinking feeling in his gut that fixed look in her eyes that staring he had seen it before when he had first met gelda his gaze was drawn to the sea just in front of the pleasure boats prow caramel hair floating a golden shoulder bobbing was she swimming or drowning the red monster glanced forward and didnt see her he put his beer can aside and got up his mouth opened and he said something to the skipper the other man shook his head in a negative pointed toward the forward railing the red monster sprang upward and bristol thought hed better be quick because alix was drifting away from the boat and there seemed no doubt now she was making no effort to stay within range and this far out with the current so strong it was as good as saying i give up running along the side deck red spotted her and he leaped overboard his strong confident strokes brought him to her in minutes on board the pleasure boat the skipper was breaking out the inflatable rubber dinghy several of the oiled men were helping him the women were gaping the skipper lowered the dinghy and the red monster with one capable palm tucked beneath alixs chin swam slowly toward safety they were lifting alixs body up onto the deck as bristols fish broke the surface it was a marlin and by all rights it should have whipped him out of his chair and into the sea during its fight for life bristol watched the long arch of her golden body raised like a rainbow being lifted into position her hair darkened by the sea hung down like seagrape obscuring one shoulder moments later after the red monster had given her mouthtomouth she rolled over sea water ran from her mouth in a torrent someone came over and put a baseball cap on her head to keep off the sun the skipper draped a towel across her shoulders and the red monster took her below bristol looked down into the huge glistening eye of the marlin its long body whipped its tailfin sending a spray of cool water up into his face the fish was very close and as bristol leaned over the side with his landing hook at the ready he saw the marlin for what it really was not a game fish not a trophy stuffed over the mantel in his apartment but another life he thought of the burning car the fight he had had to put up in order to escape death and he saw that the marlins desperate battle had been no different they were both gallant soldiers and this creature deserved to die no more than bristol did he stared once more into that round eye so alien yet for all that so full of life he could not take that away from the creature dropping his landing hook he dug in his pocket for the knife he used the blade to slash through the line just beyond the hook for just an instant the marlin lay there close to the boat floating its eye on him then with a flash of its mighty tail it leaped away its bluegreenblack body arcing sunlight spinning off its scales and then there was only a narrow foaming wake a tiny incision in the skin of the sea to mark where it had once been tengu was the name his sensei as tradition dictated had given him he was another of viktor protorovs agents inside the precincts of the tenshin shoden katori ryu as such he walked a fine line and even his sleep had developed a crack in it upward to the more alert alpha layers so that he might never be caught off guard as tsutsumu had always he was conscious of being in a hive filled with buzzing angry bees that anger he knew very well needed only one word of accusation to be leveled at him never had he experienced the kind of conglomerate emotional upheaval that had come from the unexpected and unexplained death of masashigi kusunoki the erstwhile leader of this ninja ryu tengu had come from a large rural family in kyushu and he remembered the day his father had died the family reunited silently moving almost as a single unit but even that display of togetherness could not compare with the singleminded will which apparently pervaded all levels of the society here jonin leadersensei chunin the tactical unit leaders and genin as well as the students such as himself were all affected to a frightening degree something was happening within the dojo that tengu did not understand some unconscious whirlwind some spiritual flashpoint of which he was not part he tried and pretended to be a part to those around him but he knew inwardly that it was useless he was lost here and he could not say why had he been able to step outside of himself and observe the totality of the circumstances within which he found himself he would have seen that he simply lacked the dedication the intense concentration of energies that would have allowed him to become a part of the mourning the renewed dedication of spirit that came with kusunokis passing tengu developed many fears during these volatile days when he was obliged to expend tremendous amounts of psychic energy in concealing his true mission at the tenshin shoden katori from those about him but none was as acute or as draining as the fear he developed of phoenix next to kusunoki himself phoenix was the most powerful of the jonin in fact to tengus way of thinking phoenix was more of a threat than kusunoki ever had been for one thing he was younger his vitality at the peak for another he was an explorer of pathways it seemed to tengu that kusunoki had long ago turned away from foolishly too phoenix had always spent more time with the lowly genin than kusunoki ever had at least during tengus tenure at the dojo the old sensei had increasingly seemed to devote himself to quiet contemplation and the instruction of certain favored pupils among them the lone female suijin so it was that just before dawn tengu would slip silently back into his cubicle exhausted and utterly drained after a night spent alternately hiding and searching his heart pounding heavily every time he sensed the approach of another terror stalked him he lived in fear that phoenix would become aware of his clandestine activities the thought of coming under the scrutiny of that glowering countenance was too milch for him to contemplate for long better by far to die by his own hand than to be delivered up to the vengeance of such a one to tengu who had been brought up with all the superstition and ritualism of country folk it was like trying to battle a kami phoenix was a shade something that tengu could not understand seeing him seeing the fiercely visaged tattooed tiger rampant across his shoulder and back tengu was gripped by a primal paralysis that he could not break therefore despite what protorov had advised he kept his boldness in check masking himself against discovery while he continued his recreancy when nangi returned to the larger office suite his face was entirely composed he had done all he could for the moment it was now up to allan su and his staff to go through anthony chins books and ferret out just what had been done to allasia to see if it was still a viable entity su had advised that they close their doors until the matter was determined but nangi knowing how rumors flew in the colony had decided to keep the bank open and to issue an immediate story about anthony chins dismissal for fiduciary improprieties to both the chinese and englishlanguage newspapers he had no compunction about ruining the career of the man who had brought his bank to the brink of financial destruction the waters in hong kong must be muddied nangi had told su we must do whatever we can to buy time he had said i do not want to transfer in capital from here to cover a run in an already skittish atmosphere i will not throw good money after bad remember that mr su your job and those of all the others under you is in your hands please dont fail running over it all again he was certain that he had covered everything now it was in the hands of god let him decide the fate of allasia of course he had not told su that the keiretsu could not afford a major transfer of funds but if the bank could not provide it capital would have to come from somewhere satisfied for the moment he turned his full attention to matters within satos office he remembered what he was going to ask linnear when the phone call had deflected him he stopped behind the back of the sofa on which nicholas sato and ishii were sitting tomkin was now sprawled in an oversized chair facing them linnearsan he said extracting another cigarette and producing his lighter before i was inopportunely called away you said that it was highly unusual for death itself to be associated with this mo nicholas his face pale said nothing and nangi staring hard as he lit up wondered whether he had hit a nerve that would somehow serve him in his quest for dominance of the gaijin i wonder nangi continued pouring blue smoke from his halfopen mouth whether you would be kind enough to tell me the wushings purpose now nicholas had a choice of losing face or possibly causing a panic among the japanese and thus endangering the negotiations tomkin had made eminently clear must be completed this week he had told tomkin part of it back in the hotel room on friday and now he had told them all a little more but only he nicholas knew it all and the ramifications were so terrifying that at least for the moment he preferred not to think about them yet tenacious nangi intelligent nangi was about to force his hand and in so doing wreck how many years of tomkins planning his mind was racing working on the problem when his head turned as if of its own volition haragei his peculiar sixth sense was warning him of what tomkin what was wrong nicholas began to move even before fully coherent conclusions had been made raphael tomkins brown eyes usually so full of cunning and impenetrable guile were now liquid and runny as if all the color of the irises were drooling out across his lower lids his pupils were dilated and he seemed to be having trouble focusing nicholas touched him felt the minute vibration in his torso arhythmic fluttery abnormal quickly nicholas said call for a doctor theres one in the building sato said motioning to ishii who was already halfway to the door hes ours and hes very good tomkin tried to open his mouth and could not speak his hands grasped at nicholas jacket crumpling the fabric in thick swatches beneath his clawed fingers within his eyes jumped the red spark of fear and terror its all right nicholas said his tone soothing theres a doctor on his way something was trying to surface within his mind a halfremembered memory tiny fleeting seemingly insignificant at the time what was it tomkins face was mottled and so close to him nicholas could feel the beat of his pulse like an engine gone wild he put his forefinger against the underside of the other mans trembling wrist after a moment he moved his finger then again his mind was numb with disbelief he could not find a pulse tomkins mouth was working and he pulled nicholas toward him wanting needing perhaps to whisper nicholas put his ear against tomkins lips and listened hard hard breath like a bellows working overtime and the sickly sweet stench of decay it brought up the buried memory but just as he reached for it he heard tomkins voice sere fibrous unearthly greydon nicholas heard between pants for christs sake get grey don now pink light reflecting off the kanzashi in miss yoshidas hair turned the watersoaked stones glistening at the bottom of a pool into gems she knelt just inside the open fusuma on the fiftieth floor of the shinjuku suiryu building home of sato petrochemicals it had been given over to a master interior architect and then a sensei of gardening in order to create a sanctuary of peaceful contemplation in the smoky madhouse of downtown tokyo a whisper of wind came from somewhere in the pearly atmosphere above miss yoshidas bowed head off to the right rose a stand of willowy green bamboo tall youthful filled with eternal suppleness that ineffable quality the japanese so treasure whose aura can renew the tired spirit miss yoshida dressed in a fashionable dark red suit knelt by the side of the pool though she was satos administrative assistant the simple fact was that tradition dictated that she be known as an office lady it was a tag she had been fighting for years without any sign of success and indeed under other circumstances she would not have been here but would have fulfilled her traditional female duties of being a wife and mother of keeping her home in perfect order but six years ago her husband had been struck by a careening truck as he stepped off a sidewalk jammed with the crush of midday pedestrian traffic his skull had been crushed instantly his death had left miss yoshida all alone to care for their one son kozo who was then beginning high school the one linked with prestigious todai miss yoshida and her husband had labored long and hard she had even appealed to sato to use his influence in this matter to get kozo in and they had been dismayed at the boys appalling display of ungratefulness he seemed totally oblivious to the great step upward to a successful future his parents had wrangled for him miss yoshida sighed now her shoulders hunched as if beneath a great weight as she recalled these events at first she had tried accepting the invitation to come and live with her motherinlaw but that had lasted only a few months for miss yoshida found that she had merely exchanged one form of hell for another by living in her motherinlaws house she put herself under the direct control of the older woman she was a heramochi of ferocious intensity insisting on taking over the guidance of the money in her sons life insurance and multiple bank accountsand the servitude under which miss yoshida was forced to abide became too much for her she took kozo and fled the baleful eye of the heramochi returning to the same section of the city she had loved as a child renting a small apartment there and because there was only kozo left in her life now she became a kyoiku mama an education mother constantly working with her son to improve his grades so that he could get into the elite juku the private study groups that gathered on sundays and on national holidays over and above the days regular classes were in session miss yoshida wanted kozo to enroll in a juku because she knew the level of teaching in the classroom at his school because students were not allowed to repeat or skip grades the level of teaching was geared to the slightly slower students in each class and these miss yoshida had judged were on a level far below her own sons and through her own diligence and kozos innate intelligence he was soon asked to join a particularly prestigious juku which rented a classroom at todai miss yoshida was particularly pleased because she remembered her own schooling in junior college where all of her classmates were women miss yoshida was taught how to behave in society how to treat her prospective motherinlaw how to raise children and how to prepare herself for all the myriad vicissitudes of married life it was no more than a finishingschool education she had been bitter about that and had vowed that when she had a female baby that child would have an entirely different form of education but her karma had lain in another direction and when her physician had told her that the one child was all she could ever have she resigned herself to seeing that her son received the finest in japanese education so that all the great doors to the business world would be open to him for everyone knew that without an education at only a handful of universities a young man would be cast adrift on a lonely and unproductive sea thus she ignored kozos complaints that his teachers at school resented his enrollment in the juku they felt he told her that the juku undermined their own teaching and they were jealous at the loss of control and thus made life more difficult for him in class nonsense miss yoshida told him thats merely an excuse to shirk your studies do you have any idea how much the juku costs me each month of course she would not tell him but privately she was glad that her husband had been such a hoarder he was a good provider even in death two years ago has it already been so long she asked herself kozo was ready to graduate high school all semester long he had dedicated himself along with his class to studying for the todai entrance examinations white faced and tense he would leave the apartment every morning not returning from the library until late in the evening then in the three weeks after new years with all regular classes dissolved for the year kozo began the rigorous aroundtheclock cramming that was known as shiken jigoku examination hell miss yoshida shuddered now when she thought of those words she arranged for kozo to have one entire section of the apartment for his intensive studies and then one morning miss yoshidas shoulders shook as she sobbed out loud at the verge of the exquisite garden the rustling of the leaves the musical notes of the tiny waterfall which flowed over the smooth ochre stones lost on her no a voice within her cried why torture yourself again why make yourself remember but all the while she knew why penance silent tears streamed down her rounded cheeks staining her silk blouse beading on her linen suit jacket ah buddha how can i ever forget the moment when i entered his rooms that morning and found him hanging twisted in his bedsheet the small stool kicked over on its side swinging back and forth like a monstrous metronome and oh when he was a child and sleeping peacefully that small secret smile on his lips he would twist his sheet around his legs his legs not his neck oh my poor kozo three months after she had buried him in a plot next to his fathers she had read a newspaper article by professor soichi watanabe of tokyos sophia university in part he lamented the bitterness of educational servitude young boys were forced to undergo a sentence from which no child can escape and she had wept all over again appalled at her own lack of understanding or compassion from the moment of his birth she had molded kozo into the conception of what she wanted him to be she saw now that she had had no clear idea of him as an individual rather he had always been an extension of her a most important extension to be sure but only a part of her for all that now her head buried in her hands she rocked softly back and forth on her haunches and wept bitter tears drenched in longing and spiteful selfpity and that was how death found her falling across her body in shadow a rippling nightblack finger that seemed to appear out of nowhere running across her bent back ribboning along the folds of her linen jacket like a slice of the void splitting her in two miss yoshida was aware of nothing but her own pain and sorrow the more recent trauma of finding kagamisan in his own blood in the steam room and the indelible memory of kozo even the foul stench emanating from tomkinsan a product she supposed of his meatfilled western diet was forgotten in the swelling blossom of her utter despair then she felt a gentle hand on her shoulder and a soft womans voice crooning to her and slowly she unwound her shoulders lifting her spine unbending and her head coming up to see the source of comfort she had just time enough to see the colorful kimono the long gleaming sweep of blueblack hair marked with the coarse bloody xi in the manner of the geisha before she heard the odd high whistling and the great ruffled blade of the gunsen slashed through the bone and cartilage at the base of her nose severing it miss yoshida screamed thickly as her raw nerves overcame the shock trauma and pain flashed through her blood gushed from the rent in her face drenching her blouse and jacket she fell backward with her feet bent under her buttocks her eyes opened wide blinking rapidly in incomprehension for now she recognized the figure for what it was and her heart contracted in terror i am afraid this is way beyond my ken the doctor said he was gray and wan seeming ten years older than when he had come through the office door his only hope now is a hospital he sighed deeply pushing his wireframed glasses up on his glistening forehead then massaging his eyes with his thumbs a thousand pardons i am afflicted with an almost constant sinus headache these days he produced a small plastic bottle detonated squeezes in each nostril my doctor says i must soon leave the city for good he pocketed the bottle the pollution you know he was a stooped japanese of more than middle yeas with shoulders so thin the blades could be seen beneath his rumpled jacket he had kind intelligent eyes he sighed now as he put the bottle away but if you want my opinion even that wont do much good he peered around at the anxious faces in the room nicholas sato nangi then at the form of tomkin sprawled on satos sofa its not his heart the doctor said i dont know what it is i took his pulse while you were being summoned nicholas said he didnt have any quite so the doctors eyes blinked owllike behind his thick lenses and that is what is so remarkable he should be dead you know he looked over in the direction of the stricken man was he on any special medication do you know linnearsan nicholas remembered idly picking up the small plastic bottle in tomkins hotel suite hes been taking prednisone the doctor seemed to stagger backward a pace and nicholas reached out for him his face had gone pale but he made no exclamation only said so low nicholas had to lean toward him prednisone are you absolutely certain it was prednisone yes the doctor took off his glasses i fear the ambulance will be useless now he said softly carefully he replaced his spectacles and looked at them now his face had altered just as if he were a quickchange artist his eyes were black a professional veneer like a curtain hanging between him and everything else about him nicholas had seen that look many times before in doctors and in soldiers returning from a war it was a kind of defense mechanism a deliberate hardening of the heart to protect it from sorrows bitter arrows there was indeed nothing the doctor could do and he hated defeat so much i am afraid tomkinsan is suffering from the end phase of takayasus arterisis a uniformly malignant and fatal disease it is also known as pulseless disease the reason for that is i think obvious to all of you miss yoshida was confident that she was dying this did not seem to be a terrible occurrence for it would bring an end to her suffering and would hide her shame at being too cowardly to take up her husbands wakizashi and drawing the steel from its scabbard plunge it into her lower belly but the manner in which she was dying that was another matter entirely she was dying like a dog a poor broken animal in the street kicked and pummeled the life escaping from her in short arrhythmic gasps surely this was no way for a samurai woman to die she told herself her mind already half numb from the painful contact of the needlesharp ripple blade of the steel fan but the sight of the figure looming over her that painted demons face dead white with bright orange paint in the manner the kabuki represented demons in its plays transfixed her it was as if she had been spun down the awful tunnel of legend as if quotidian tokyo with its hordes of rushing people thick pollution and bright neon lights had disappeared entirely and in its place were the wood and paper houses the green trembling bamboo groves of the japan of long ago mist shrouded and mysterious filled with magic and the feats of heroes this was the essence of the visage which was bent over her now administering a terrible punishment but i am samurai a voice in the back of miss yoshidas dazzled mind cried if i am to die at least grant me the nobility of falling in battle and so miss yoshida reached up with clawlike talons shredding first her nails and then her fingertips on the deadly gunsen that whistled down at her again and again she began to inch away from the blows uncurling herself awkwardly using forearms and elbows now the blood running hot and free down her arms and into the drenched sockets of her armpits but now her lips were drawn back from her clenched teeth in a cross between a grin and a snarl and adrenaline pumped through her and her heart arose from its gray slumber and sang again at the spirits of her samurai ancestors who moved her now to her glorious end confirmed diagnosis has been relatively recent early at the mayo clinic i believe there is nothing you can do takisan sato said the doctor shrugged his meager shoulders i can sedate him take away the pain theres nothing else but surely the hospital has facilities that can but taki was already shaking his head it is almost over satosan he will feel far more pain if we move him and the hospital well personally i would not want to die there had i the choice sato nodded also admitting defeat nicholas left them a modern cabal ineffectual against the primitive ultimate forces of nature he knelt beside tomkin and looked into the pale pinched face once he had seen the power in that face the lines the burden of command had etched into it giving it character and substance now it was those lines that had begun to take over deepening widening extending their networks time seemed to have closed in on him aging him ten years in as many minutes but unlike taki he would never bounce back the regenerative process in him had been destroyed by disease it seemed vastly ironic to nicholas now to be kneeling by the side of this dying man the same man whom he had vowed to destroy but he did not question it tomkins karma was his own nicholas accepted these events as he accepted all else in life with equanimity and calmness it was just this unique quality which had allowed him to put away his intense desire to talk with akiko his bewilderment at her physicality it was what allowed him to recover so quickly from the awesome implications of kagamisans terrible murder he was eastern in nature even though there was but a hint of his mothers blood in his face the colonel had he been alive today would have recognized in the visage of his son an almost exact duplicate of his own youthful self save that nicholas hair was as dark as his mothers and his eyes somehow did not contain the directness of western culture within nicholas now swirled many emotions he recognized the hate for tomkin which had allowed him to go to work for him even become his mend in order to be close to him to sow the seeds of his revenge for his friends murder at tomkin s behest and yet there were qualities about the man that had begun to affect nicholas for one thing he was fiercely loyal he would try to bring the sun down from the sky for one of his people who was legitimately in trouble for another his abiding love for both his daughters but especially justine was touching it was in the nature of the man that he could not very well express that love but his understanding of his troubled younger daughter and just as importantly his acknowledgement at least to himself and to nicholas of his complicity in her emotional state was laudable though tomkin could often be loud and crude these abrasive qualities hid a man of much emotion indeed in private moments many of which he had chosen to share with nicholas when his guard was down and he was relaxed he could be an engaging even a charming companion nicholas looked down at the gray deflated face devoid of animation tomkin had the countenance of an overused wax doll he recalled tomkins sadness over justines relationships how he had ached for her when she had been used by chris the final anger that had both saved her and caused her to turn away from him nicholas recognized that justine should be here perhaps only he knew how much solace her presence would bring to tomkin now ultimately it was his family that was tomkins weak spot it seemed cruel indeed that he should die here so far from home and his daughters all that he loved facing death nicholas felt always slightly diminished he understood dimly that that was a western facet of his personality a legacy from the colonel his eastern half understood fully that death was integrated with life the two the same really if you were one with all things then death was one of them that at least should be some solace to him now nicholas saw the eyes flutter open the brown of the irises dirty and almost gray breath was an enormous effort the drylipped mouth was half open i called greydon he said hes just outside but there seemed no recognition at all in the eyes as they drifted drifted across the room outside day had died and the nighttime splendor of tokyo was a blaze of neon fire holding back the darkness with its multicolored shell tomkin turned his head and nicholas followed his gaze there was nothing there a blank wall what did tomkin see there that held the last of his attention only cats sat and stared at nothing then a shadow passed across the wall and as if it were somehow connected to him tomkin shuddered once and nicholas said doctor though it was merely a formality he knew death when he saw it mr linnear nicholas rose slowly and turned to see the worried face of greydon tomkins attorney how is he let the doctor tell you nicholas suddenly felt tired taki knelt beside tomkins form with his stethoscope listening intently after a moment he pulled the instrument from his ears hes expired im afraid he stood up and began to write in his notepad greydon wiped at his face with a linen handkerchief this is so sudden he said i never well i never suspected it was so close you knew about tomkins illness nicholas said greydon nodded distractedly yes dr kidd his personal physician and i were the only ones then his eyes seemed to focus and he looked at nicholas tomkin had to come to me for the will you see i had to know he took a deep breath would anyone mind if i had a whiskey and soda excuse me sato said the circumstances he went quickly to the bar and made greydon his drink gave it to him he made something for nangi as well who was looking very pale greydon took a long pull at his drink and touched nicholas on the elbow please he said quietly come with me away from the others nicholas stopped what is it he said shortly his mind was elsewhere greydon snapped open his black lizardskin attache case there are certain matters which must be not now nicholas said putting his hand on greydons arm therell be plenty of time for formalities later on the lawyer looked up at him from his halfbent position im sorry mr linnear but i have explicit instructions mr tomkin was quite clear on this point his hand dipped into the case extracted an oversized buff envelope nicholas name was on the front the flap was sealed with a blob of red wax he handed it over mr tomkin requested that immediately upon his death you be handdelivered this envelope and that you read it and sign it in my presence numbly nicholas looked down at the envelope whats in it its a codicil a codicil to mr tomkins will greydons face was anxious again he touched nicholas on the wrist you must read it now mr linnear it was mr tomkins express wish his eyes seemed large and moist please nicholas turned the envelope over broke the seal he lifted the flap took out several sheets of paper the top one was in tomkins unmistakable oversized scrawl he began to read nicholas you are no doubt slightly bewildered by recent events that is only natural i must confess to wishing that i knew just what emotions are dominant in you now i only know that were i there now i would never be able to tell them from your face in many ways you have been even more of an enigma to me than my daughters i suppose that is only right since you have come to seem like a son to me actually i think that is only fitting wasnt it oedipus who wished to kill his father oh yes i know because i have come to know you i have done many foolish things in my life things on which i have little desire to dwell i had an unquenchable desire for power and toward that end i destroyed people whole companies even to achieve my desires but in the end life has a way of making fools of us all and why should i be any different meeting you changed my life i cant deny that oh at first not at all i was too ironwilled for that but i remember that long night while both of us waited for saigo to come you were there to protect me yet in my fear and desperation i spoke to him offering to sacrifice your life for mine it was only later that i realized how foolish i had been and i suspected that you had overheard me im right arent i well it doesnt really matter much to me now only to say that after that night i began to understand you some quality within you that i am still at a loss to define began to creep through me like a mist im glad you came to work for me just as im glad you will marry my daughter that too is fitting there are perhaps many reasons why you would want to kill me but perhaps the most insistent is for what happened to your friend lewis croaker he thought i murdered angela didion and you thought i had him killed youre wrong and youre right im truly sorry but i cannot be more specific ive perhaps already said more than i should to business on the next sheet of paper you will find a legal document it assigns you sixty percent of the voting shares for tomkin industries with it you can sit on the board of directors you may even change its composition though justine and gelda each retain twenty percent that will be entirely your prerogative just as it was mine sign it and you will become the president of tomkin industries dont think too much about it follow your instincts but know that this is what i want nicky with all my heart and soul if such a thing truly exists soon you and justine will marry i am pleased that you love each other no one understands better than i how precious such a commodity is these days youre family now you see in all ways if you sign you will make me very happy ill know that the company is in the right hands but know this there is one thing that you must do immediately after the funeral greydon who is no doubt standing by will tell you what it is goodbye nickytell my girls i love them raphael tomkin it was witnessed by greydon dated june nicholas sat down on the arm of satos chair his head was buzzing and he fought desperately for control nothing in his training had prepared him for this mr linnear slowly nicholas looked up becoming aware that greydon had been trying to get his attention for some time mr linnear will you sign the codicil there was just too much happening at once nicholas felt overwhelmed emotion welled up from the western part of him while his eastern half fought desperately to suppress those same emotions which if they surfaced would surely cause loss of face nicholas felt in the middle for the first time in his life at odds with either side of himself because he wanted to do both feel and not feel at the same time sato had been quite correct in this country grief was an extremely private emotion held back from even those closest to you and yet he felt acutely the presence of the colonel urging him to grieve telling him that it was all right that it was a mans prerogative to cry to feel to need solace in times of stress it was what everyone wanted and still nothing showed on his face perhaps nangi the astute master that he was might have seen the pain flitting like dark darting fish in nicholas eyes but nangi would never even contemplate such a gross intrusion of privacy ever since tomkin was stricken the japanese had steadfastly looked only at each other giving no chance for loss of face mr linnear all at once nicholas found himself in the first attack position his muscles corded his hips and knees already moving on their own the red killing drive welling up in him and his arm beginning to lift yes greydon blinked rapidly behind his glasses standing immobile and defenseless and nicholas thought to himself what am i doing appalled at the misdirection of emotion the readiness of his body to act on his akaininjutsu training it was as if all his time in america had been shed from him and now returned to his natural element he was reverting cerebration giving way to instinct as he had been taught for jaho the magic of the ninja ryu required the absolute imprisonment of the laws and strictures of socalled civilization but this was not nara prefecture and he was not within the caol stone walls of the tenshin shoden katori he was no longer a pupil but a sensei he should know better but he was not entirely eastern no matter how much he tried to convince himself otherwise and at precisely this moment as if a great and towering glacial floe that had blocked his path for ages reflecting the light in its icy rills and ridges had cracked asunder he understood the latent anger he felt toward the colonel for bearing him for imbuing him with his western genes reactions instincts his coarsened method of viewing the world nicholas realized that his unfaltering reverence for his father was merely a mask for the resentment that lay smoldering in white heat inside him and abruptly he knew what he must do he relaxed his body consciously draining it of the adrenaline which unbidden had been released in the onset of kokyu suru the attack stance handing greydon the papers he said give me some time will you and went across the room from island to carpeted island past the four japanese who would not dare look into his face who spoke in low quick tones of mundane matters nicholas went around the side of the sofa and tomkin appeared before him again already laid out as if on a bier there was a bitter taste in nicholas mouth and a burning behind his eyes the day the colonel had died the linnears new gardener another old man a zen master of his leafy domain to take the beloved atakes place in the house on the outskirts of tokyo had begun to rake the snow and nicholas could see again the lines of dark and white the sight of melancholy winter transmuted by personal tragedy into the embodiment of death nicholas knelt down at right angles to tomkins body bowing his head formally as one does to acknowledge the head of a family after the revelations of a moment ago there seemed no difference between this corpse and the one he and his mother and itami had buried with such ceremonial pomp and circumstance so many years ago save that now the ache inside him unknowable and seemingly absolute had been dissolved in the knowledge of his view of the roundeyed barbarian though the colonel had come to love the east with an unfailing passion still he had been gaijin and throughout all his life growing up in japan nicholas had suffered because of it the blood the blood the japanese could not get over that could not in their heart of hearts secreted far away from their public display of affection for him forgive him for that ultimate transgression in raphael tomkin nicholas had perceived albeit unconsciously all the traits though untrue ascribed to his father he saw now that part of his hate for tomkin was his hate for what the colonel had been what he could not help being he was an easterner trapped in a westerners body karma but nicholas understood now that he had never been able to accept that that he had for so many years unconsciously fought against that karma just as he had steadfastly refused to face his deep and abiding hatred now he could tomkins death had shown him the way and for that he would be eternally grateful to the man but he knew as well that he had felt far more than hatred toward tomkin he had never truly believed him the monster his daughters claimed he was always ruthless sometimes cruel he could nevertheless display an astonishingly profound love for his children as well as life nicholas felt the sorrow bubbling upward released at last from the iron restraints of his eastern heritage for while he grieved for raphael tomkin he grieved anew for his father as well tears fell like stones from his eyes neatly aligned pebbles from his own inner zen garden that had forever been diminished by human loss after a time nicholas rose his face was calm composed and his mind felt clear free of the ropy restraints of a half hour before he went back to where greydon was standing patiently holding the documents and took them from him he read the letter all over again fascinated anew by tomkins insight he had obviously understood far more than his ugly american exterior had indicated when nicholas got to the paragraph about angela didion he paused was croaker right or wasnt he he wondered how could it be both shock after shock wheels within wheels the letters overall tone was curiously oriental in its acute introspection its hints at deeper developments for a long time nicholas stared at the letter he had long ago ceased to read his eyes might even have seemed blank to an uninitiated observer but the fact was he had begun to look beyond the words to find the void and in that peculiar form of meditation open only to the greatest of the worlds warriors of the east the answer to perhaps the largest change in his life abruptly he looked up and when his eyes made contact with greydons they were focused and sharp he carefully folded the letter and put it away in his inside jacket pocket what happens if dont sign he said quietly its all in the will greydon said i cannot tell you the details that would violate my trust i am authorized to say only that the board of directors will decide on the new president but who will it be nicholas asked will he be a good man will he be in favor of this merger will he manage the company as tomkin wanted greydon smiled thinly what would you have me say mr linnear obviously mr tomkin wanted you to make your decision without such knowledge he looked at nicholas for a moment however just by your asking those questions i believe you have already come to a decision he produced a fountain pen and uncapped it its gold nib shone in the light like a swordblade tomkin said there was something i must do if i sign you know what it is greydon nodded thats correct as the new president of tomkin industries you are required to seek an interview with a man in washington his name is c gordon minck i am in possession of his private number who is he i have no idea the pen was waiting hanging in the air nicholas took it noting its weight and balance he put the codicil down on satos desk and wrote his name on the designated line greydon nodded his head good he took the codicil waved it about until the ink dried then folded it away you will receive a copy after the will is read he stuck out his hand good luck mr linnear he ducked his head now its time i notified the company and began to see to funeral arrangements no nicholas said ill do that and greydon please wait until i speak to his daughters before informing the office of course mr linnear as you wish he left the room nicholas looked across the expanse of satos office the others were discreetly not looking at him he went across to them and said satosan nangisan ishiisan bowing formally i have been named to succeed tomkin his company is now mine he lifted his eyes to see their reaction but they were being very careful and circumspect too much had already happened today sato spoke first congratulations linnearsan i am so sorry that your good fortune comes through these tragic circumstances thank you your concern is greatly appreciated ishii also expressed his concern in a manner that managed to be sincere without being inquisitive nangi said nothing that was all right now it was time to forge ahead unfortunately i will be forced to return to the states immediately to see to the last rites our discussions must be postponed they bowed all around karma sato said but i have no wish to forestall our merger nicholas said and i will be returning as soon as is proper but toward that end i find i must leave with you some information bizarre though it may seem to you now he had their undivided attention good he thought here goes i had decided not to bring it up now because i felt some more evidence was needed i thought i could be of some help in this now however circumstances dictate otherwise because i am leaving because i hold sacred our mutual pact and do not want anything to disrupt it i must now answer nangisans question fully he asked if i had any knowledge of death linked to the wushing i said truthfully that i had never seen such a thing and yet i have heard of it in what circumstance sato asked what happened to kagamisan truly we must know and nicholas told them the ancient legend he had recounted to tomkin quiet electricity built itself in the air i think its time for all of us to go nangi said from out of the silence uniformed attendants called by the doctor had arrived and now they began to wrap raphael tomkin in silvergray plastic swaddling ishii left then sato and the doctor filed past but nangi his face as pale as a geishas white ricepowdered visage held back his dark eyes locked on nicholas face they stood side by side in three days nangi said the cherry blossom springs to life blooming like a mystic cloud heaven come to earth for a brief moment in its opening we find joy in its fading we console ourselves with the richness of memories is that not the way of all life with a dry crinkle the silvergray plastic enwrapped raphael tomkins face in its code of eternal silence kyoto tokyo spring autumn when tanzan nangi returned from the consequences of war released from the military hospital in which he had recovered while his country slowly lost the initiative in its desperate struggle against the west he tried to go home he was set free of his antiseptic bed on march almost a year to the day since he had been rescued from his makeshift raft the hospital had claimed him the surgeons scalpel probing his flesh time and time again in attempts to repair the nerve and muscle damage done to him sight in his damaged eye was totally gone and there was nothing they could do but sew the lids in place to stop the interminable tic that had plagued him with his legs it was another matter entirely three lengthy operations returned partial use of his limbs to him he would not as the doctors had at first feared be subjected to the indignity of amputation but they told him he would have to learn to walk all over again and it would be a slow painful process nangi did not care he was grateful to the god jesus to whom he had prayed in his darkness and who had seen fit to preserve his life travel in those times was difficult for a civilian even a hero of the war if you did not wear a uniform if you were not on your way to a mobilization center you were largely ignored japan in dire straits had more on its mind the bureaucratic war machines hegemony over the country was stronger than ever but the spirit of togetherness beneath the billowing clouds of war was everywhere and nangi found a ride into tokyo in a farmers brokendown truck rattling over bumps and holes in the roads stopped seemingly at every turn to allow the military traffic its right of way as it turned out he neednt have bothered the sky was black over tokyo a dense acrid pall in no way related to the rain clouds higher up choking ash hung in the air coating face and hands lining the mouth and nostrils with grit nangi stood shakily up in the back of the trembling truck as they rolled into the city it seemed as if there was nothing left tokyo had been devastated the high winds made it difficult to see clearly and he was obliged to blink constantly to keep his eye free of ash not whole buildings not whole blocks but entire sections of the city had been incinerated where nangis familys house had stood there were now squads of sweepers and shovelers clearing their way through the lumps of blackened structures no one was left alive he was told the intense heat of the igniting napalm combined with the high winds the same winds that had fanned the terrible tokyo fire of to roast fully half the city there was nowhere left to go but to kyoto nangi had not forgotten the promise he had made to gotaro to see to his younger brother seiichi the ancient capital had been spared much of the devastation that had turned tokyo into a smoldering blackened skeleton but food was still scarce and starvation was rampant nangi had acquired a small loaf of black bread a pot of jam a bit of butter and six daikon white radishes these he brought to the sato house as a gift against the disruption and inconvenience of his visit he found only an old woman at home a straightbacked stifflipped creature with iron gray hair pulled back flat to her skull and the eyes of an inquisitive child behind a face full of wrinkles hai the interrogative was somewhat defensive and nangi recalled what gotaro had said about his grandmother there had been a great deal of suffering and death in this family and he could not bring himself to be the bearer of more bad tidings with the current chaos of the war it was all too likely that news of the death of her grandson would not have reached her he bowed politely and handing her the packet of food told her that he had served alongside gotaro and that he sent his best respects to her she sniffed her nose lifted slightly and said gotarochan never paid me any respect while he was living here but clearly she was pleased with this message and bowing she backed away from the doorway to allow him entrance it was still difficult for nangi to negotiate and she turned away in such a natural and graceful way he could never be certain that she had done it on purpose to avoid him embarrassment obachama for nangi would know her only as others did as grandma went to make him tea a signal honor in those drear days without hope they sat on opposite sides of the room with the break in the tatami between them as was customary between host and guest sensei and pupil sipping weak tea leaves that had obviously been used more than once obachama spoke and nangi listened at times answering her sharp perceptive questions as best he could fabricating a skein of lies when it came to gotaros whereabouts the war has destroyed this family she said sighing just as it is destroying this country my soninlaw is buried my daughter in a hospital from which she will never leave japan will never be the same no matter what the americans do to us her eyes were hard and glittery and nangi found the idea of being her enemy frightening but it is not the americans i fear she sighed again and shaking her head from side to side took a delicate sip of her tea just when he believed she had lost her train of thought she began again leading him slowly into the rhythm of her life the russians have joined the war the words had the pronouncement of a death sentence they waited until the last moment until the outcome was clear even to their slow bearlike brains now they have jumped in with their swords rattling and they will want a piece of us too her white hands with skin as translucent as porcelain gripped the tiny handleless cups with unnatural tension do you see these cups my grandsons friend nangi dutifully looked they were beautiful impossibly thin so that light falling through the window penetrated from outside in turning the material they were made of milky and glowing nangi nodded his head they are quite magnificent obachama sniffed again they were a recent gift from a distant relative of mine it was all that was left of his family he stopped here on his way out of tokyo to the countryside he had become sokaijin i urged him to stay here but the bombing of tokyo had been too much for him and he could no longer tolerate being within a citys limits any city poor thing he did not even understand the nature of his flight but at least he was smiling obachama he said the fire raids on tokyo have forced me to move four times in the past three months first out of my house which is no more then from temporary shelter to temporary shelter with each move my priceless collection of tang dynasty antiques was diminished fire took some of the scrolls here a stumble on the street destroyed a vase there he handed me these cups here obachama i see that your life is still calm please take these they are the last of my collection now i have been freed to start my life anew without dragging my collection behind me like a burdensome hump the war has made me appreciate other things in life obachama turned the cup in the light using only her thumb and index finger imagine it is the tang dynasty i hold in my hand nangi heard the awe in her voice and was not surprised he looked anew at his own cup marveling at its artistry and age he too felt the common appreciation most japanese had for this most revered of all the chinese dynasties obachama carefully put down the antique and closed her eyes for a moment but of what use is talk of art and antiquity now the russians will soon arrive along with the americans and then we will truly be undone beneath the despair nangi heard the deep and abiding undercurrent of rage and fear directed at the soviets he felt a violent urge to reach out across the intervening space that tradition and courtesy dictated must forever remain and touch her assure her that everything would be all right but he could not the words stuck in his throat like needles in the knowledge that everything would not be all right for them he was about to open his mouth to say something anything to break the taut painful thread of silence when there came a sharp rapping on the door obachamas eyes cleared and bowing she excused herself nangi sat silently without turning around his back was to the front door all he could hear was the soft murmur of voices a sokaijin means literally escape to the country the term was used for the thousands of refugees streaming out of the smoking cities into the rural and therefore safer villages short silence the murmuring beginning again then the door closed softly and he heard nothing until obachama returned to his view she sat back down opposite him her head was slightly bowed throwing her eyes into shadow i have had news of gotarochan her voice was like a wisp of smoke gently drifting a shell only transparent and empty within he will not be coming home perhaps she always spoke of death thus with a poets poignancy but nangi suspected not gotaro had been special to her as in the brief but incredibly intense time nangi had known him gotaro had been special to him the space between them danced with dust motes twisting in the heat of the sunlight their false life only accentuated the emptiness there the thin sounds of the uncaring traffic outside came to him remote as the memories brought to life by a faded photograph an era was passing before them a slow and heavy cortege filled with black roses the scent of the past was everywhere with only the dark uncertainty of the unknowable future to keep it company a kind of despair seeped slowly from obachama though she bravely strove to be resolute and inwardly calm the helplessness of his situation affected nangi profoundly as they sat facing each other her tissuepaper face had been crumpled by karma and his heart ached with the burden of her newest loss one in a string of bitter beads then what came into his mind was a poem not quite a haiku but exquisitely moving by chiyo the eighteenthcentury poet considered the greatest of all of japans female poets it was what she wrote after the death of her small son notable for what it did not say as well as what it expressed he spoke it now the dragonfly hunter today what place has he got to i wonder of a sudden they were both weeping and obachama appalled at her lack of good manners turned quickly away so that he could see only her thin shoulders moving and above her bowed gray head after a time he said quietly obachama where is seiichisan he should be here with you her eyes scored the nap of the tatami searching perhaps for imperfections she would not raise them then her body moved as if she were steeling herself to speak he is on his pilgrimage to the mausoleum of the tokugawa in nikko park nangi bowed then with your permission obachama i will go and fetch him his place is here it is a time for family now the old woman raised her head and nangi became aware of the tiny nerve tremor that kept it in constant motion i would be most grateful to have my other grandson beside me again the corners of her eyes were diamond bright with the hint of tears she was holding back with a supreme effort of will nangi thought it was time he left her to the privacy of her grief he bowed to her formally thanking her for her hospitality in these evil times and with some difficulty rose to leave tanzansan it was the first time she had spoken his name when you return with seiichi her head was held very straight a tendril of hair swept down across one ear feathering with her minute temble you will stay here with us her voice was firm every young man needs a home to return to the deep green of the cryptomeria occluded the gray pall that still hovered over burntout tokyo where legions of civilians still picked through the massive tons of rubble and blackened skeletons of the red night urban farmers with ashcovered rakes unearthing a harvest oјdespair all that remained of the terrible winds of the week before were soft gusting breezes that bent the tops of the cryptomeria and set up a fibrous rustling whose confluence with the natural buzz of the insects brought about a harmoniousness for which this park was noted nangi crossed to the far side of the stream via a stone footbridge and took a winding hillside path through dense foliage that would lead him to the goldencrusted yomei gate and the tomb of the tokugawa he had not told obachama because the timing had not been right but he too had spent many happy hours during his schooldays lost in deep reverie at the verge of this final resting place of much that had made japan great that the shogunate of leyasu tokugawa began the history of modern japan nangi had absolutely no doubt but it was only in the difficult and feverish years ahead that he was to come to fully appreciate the insight he had forged for himself this shogun was the first of a line stretching over two hundred years who tamed the myriad feuding daimyo the only one with enough strength and cunning to bend these powerful regional lords to his will in so doing of course leyasu created the great twohundredyear peace and forever changed the path upon which japan would walk for in effect he destroyed the samurai warriors have no place in peacetime for there is nothing for them to do and in this interregnum the samurai metamorphosed slowly into bureaucrats working in administrative functions thus becoming no more than a service nobility nangi had heard it often said in school where astute minds young enough not to have yet been entirely shorn of the objective view which age and full participation in the system would cut from them that japanese government was built on the separation of power and authority to understand this nangi had had to return to his studies of history reading in areas his professors had apparently ignored in their zeal to complete the semesters curricula there in his books he found the historical and political imperatives that were his answers the twin feudal powers of the choshu and satsuma families at last brought to an end the tokugawa shogunate but the resultant governmental corruption caused such a public outcry that they in turn were overthrown by the meiji oligarchs and the restoration began what this cabal of leaders arranged was the kind of government similar to that in bismarcks germany that many of these leaders had strong ties into that german government seems partly the answer as to why they chose that particular system the other reason was that they wished to clandestinely retain their control of a government which on the surface at least would appear responsive to the needs of the public at large toward this end they set about creating what they termed a nonpolitical civil bureaucracy it seems ironic that the meiji oligarchs so fearful of the traditional samurai that they officially abolished the class were obliged to seek out for administrators of their newly coined bureaucracy the remnants of the very class they hated but it was their determination to have this vast and powerful buffer unit of bureaucrats in place before when the national diet the new parliament would open and candidates from political parties began campaigning for public support and power the bismarckian system of monarchic constitutionalism also served the meiji oligarchs well since it made the prime minister and the army responsible not to parliament but to the monarch the interim result was a relatively weak and ineffectual diet and a powerful bureaucracy laced with supporters of the meiji oligarchs thus was the will of the people carried out and yet for all its subterfuge and illicit lines of power the growth of the nonpolitical bureaucracy as the center of the government found great favor among the japanese for the corrosive memory of the privilege accorded the two families satsuma and choshu still burned like a fire within them what they appreciated about the formation of the bureaucracy was that it was open to all men who had trained diligently and well and who displayed the proper aptitude and fortitude in scoring highly in examinations which could not be more impersonal and thus impartial and yet the ultimate result was never perhaps anticipated by the meiji oligarchs for with the solidification of the bureaucracys power as the center of the new government and with at last the passing of the last of the oligarchs the true power within the government devolved entirely into bureaucratic hands both civilian and just as importantly military and all this truly was the legacy of the tokugawa an important lesson especially for a young man wandering the land of a soontobedefeated country who must think toward the highly uncertain and volatile future change was coming and the sight of the tokugawa mausoleum breaking through the stairway of trees between which he had been walking brought home to nangi just how much he wanted to be part of that change because the alternative was too horrendous to contemplate to be swallowed whole in the inevitable war crimes tribunal of the occupation forces nangi paused looked quickly around him he appeared to be alone he turned and stepped off the path moving quietly into the protection of thetrees in a tiny clearing he knelt down and removing his army uniform from the small bag he was carrying that contained all his possessions he rolled it into a rough ball and lit a match to it it took some time until it was all gone at last he stood creakily and ground the ashes into gray dust that done he returned to the path to search out seiichi sato and bring him home seiichi was not at all like his fallen brother for one thing he lacked the wild sense of of humor that made gotaro so easy to be with for another he was not a christian seiichi was a swiftly maturing boy with a serious outlook on life on the other hand nangi found him to be supremely quick witted and a man it was impossible to think of him as a boy open to new and unusual ways of thinking primarily because of this quality fully as unusual as wild gusting humor the two formed a solid core of confidence and trust in and for one another as for seiichi he took the news of his older brothers death well nangi had first caught sight of him as a black silhouette within the gloom of the mausoleum doorway he had introduced himself and they had spoken for a long time then in the intuitive way some younger people have seiichis eyes shifted and he said you have come to tell me gotarosan has been killed he died a samurais death nangi said seiichi looked at him peculiarly that might not have made him as happy as it makes me he was japanese after all nangi said his faith in another god did not enter into it at all he turned as if changing the subject he saved my life you know ultimately what bound them was their mutual desire not to die at wars end neither were soldiers of the emperor they certainly did not think of themselves as kamikaze falling like cherry petals on the third day of their brief bloom yet for all that they were patriots and it was this very love of country which spurred them on nangi was farsighted enough to want to see japan rise from the rubble this stupid and ineptly fought war had reduced it to seiichi was young enough to still believe in the idealism of the world together nangi thought they just might be unbeatable to this end he began seiichis education in kanryddo the modern japaneses bushido the way of the bureaucrat while seiichi was finishing his last year at kyoto university nangi thought that he would need a particularly salient example to hook seiichi into this new way of thinking he asked seiichi if he knew the best route to political power in japan seiichi shrugged his shoulders the national diet of course he said with the absolute surety of youth isnt that where all politicians gain their experience nangi shook his head listen to me seiichisan not one of tojos cabinet ministers ever served in the parliament all were former bureaucrats any time you feel your interest flagging i urge you to remember that but i have no desire to become a civil servant seiichi complained and i cant understand your desire to become one have you ever heard the phrase tenno no kanri no it is the definition of the japanese bureaucrat an official of the emperor imperial appointment gives to them the status of kan a word of chinese origin that meant in those faraway days the home of a mandarin who presided over a city kan is power seiichi believe me and no matter what the american occupation forces do to us in the end kan will rule japan and make it great once again of course history proved the veracity of nangis words though general macarthurs scap the occupation authorities changed the bureaucracy drastically from onward for seven years they did not and indeed could not eliminate it in fact they unwittingly strengthened one area the economic ministries scap did away with the military completely this they were compelled to do but not understanding the fundamental nature of japanese government they failed to see the ramifications of their action for the military had been the chief rival of the economic ministries but now the war crimes tribunal set in sights further afield and began calling in certain influential members of the zaibatsu the great familyrun industrial combines whose might had propelled japan into the war in the first place with the transformation of the zaibatsu and the inevitable weakening of their influence as the tribunals dedicated officers sifted through the rosters seeking out more war criminals in hiding a power vacuum was created into which the economic ministries again stepped shortly after the ministry of commerce and industry was purged of fortytwo members among the lowest percentage found within the government tanzan nangi achieved a position in kosan kyoku the minerals bureau this was in june of and shinzo okuda the current viceminister was glad to have him nangi had gone to the right schools and just as importantly came to the ministry without taint as far as the war was concerned he had never achieved a high enough rank or the kind of notoriety for him to have come under the scrutiny of the scap tribunal he had also worked at the industrial facilities corporation a bureaucratic management foundation or eidan shortly before the war broke out and he was called into service it did not take him long to catch on because macarthur had been advised to choose an indirect occupation that is working through the existing japanese government instead of doing away with it entirely the shrewd ministers of the bureaucracy found a way to protect themselves menju fukuhai okuda explained this to nangi soon after he had been on the job long enough to have impressed his superiors with his skills and to have gained their trust what we continue to do each day the viceminister said standing in the center of his small office is to follow the american orders so long as they are looking then reversing them in the belly when they can no longer see what we do and as okuda told nangi the bureaucracy had already passed its first crisis point one day minister hoshijima called me into his office you could see just how agitated he was he was pacing back and forth back and forth okudasan he said to me macarthur is threatening to go to the people and have them ratify this new foreign document what the americans call a constitution he turned to look at me do you know what that would mean we cannot allow the public direct participation in government if we are to keep our absolute power a plebiscite would be the beginning of the end for us we must all gather our power now and push for an immediate acceptance of the macarthur constitution okuda was smiling now and it was done nangisan in just this way in the months ahead it became plain to nangi that the fate of japanese bureaucracy had been set forever for one thing the countrys desperate need for economic recovery made it imperative that the legion of bureaucrats be expanded for another the political leaders who filtered through scaps erratic and to the japanese anyway illogical system were totally incompetent the occupation forces had returned to power many politicians who had not worked in over twenty years time and again nangi would confront cabinet ministers who were forced to bring with them their viceministers whom they turned to for answers to almost every question put to them too it became manifestly clear to him just how little power resided in the diet it was at nangis own ministry where policy was hammered out and only then presented to the legislature for ratification in his new position nangi was put in charge of carrying out many of mcis policies that his viceminister was far too busy to oversee himself one of these was mining manufacturing morozumi mining was only one of many fledgling companies in need of total restructuring that came under his purview almost all the senior executives had been purged and subsequently tried as class a war criminals since morozumi had been revamped during the mid forties becoming one of the leading producers of trinitrotoluene for the war effort its then standing director had been awarded several medals in from tojo himself for the companys high levels of production but morozumi was too well run to destroy entirely and after the scap tribunal stripped the tree of all its boughs it asked mci to restaff the konzern this nangi was delighted to do since he was able to install seiichi as production chief a job which in better times might have been suspect for a young man just turned eighteen but seiichi was exceptionally bright and well schooled further instinct had taught him how to act with men his elder and thus his appointment passed without a ripple of protest from the viceministers office with the money they had received from the tang dynasty cups obachama had given them even in the worst of times there are those enterprising few on the lookout for treasures the two men had managed to rent a fairsized apartment in tokyo sato knew that his friend hated to give up such treasures nangi had fallen in love with the antique cups at the moment obachama had first shown them to him but they had had no choice as soon as they had a little money nangi had sent seiichi to fetch obachama her daughter had died shortly after nangi had brought sato home and though she loved her little house in quiet kyoto age was making a solitary life more and more difficult for her one evening early in nangi returned to the apartment somewhat early as always obachama opened the door she hurried to make tea ignoring his protestations with the tiny cups she brought out three freshly made rice cakes a special treat in those times nangi watched her distractedly as she went through the delicate tea ceremony and when the pale green froth was at just the right thickness she withdrew the whisk and offered him the cup when she had made her own and had taken her first sip she judged the silence to have proceeded long enough without her intervention if you have pain in your legs i will get your pills age had made her more outspoken in any case she saw no shame in soothing away hurts inflicted by the war she was grateful that he at least had been spared as her gotarochan her daughter and her soninlaw had not my legs are no better or worse obachama outside the sounds of traffic ebbed and flowed as the convoys of military transports supervised by the occupation forces ran true to schedule then what is troubling you my son nangi looked up at her its the ministry i work very hard and i know my ideas are forward thinking and innovative and yet there seems no hope of advancement obisan who is younger than i am by more than a year and is nowhere near as quick and knowledgeable has already been promoted to bureau chief his sotomawari his going around the track as these series of postings are called has already begun on the elite course nangi closed his eyes in an attempt to hold back the tears pearling there it is unfair obachama i work longer hours than most i come up with the solutions to problems the viceminister uses me when hes stuck for an answer but he never invites me out to drink after work he never confides in me i am an outcast in my own bureau this obisan the old woman said sitting like a buddha he graduated from todai as did your viceminister is that correct nangi nodded his head and you my son what university did you graduate from keio obachama ah obachama nodded as if he had provided her with the key to the rosetta stone that explains it then you are not of their faction do you so soon forget the history of which my grandson is never loathe to tell me you are a sensei always the samuraibureaucrats position depended on imperial appointment not on performance she took another sip of her tea why should it be any different today do you think any iteki barbarian interference can change us that much she snorted in derision but you my son must learn to work within the system im doing the best i can nangi said with an edge to his voice but i cannot swim against a tide keio is not a wellknown university i know of only one other man in the ministry from there hes a junior and not a classmate so hes no use at all oh stop sniveling nangi obachama snapped you sound like a baby ill not have such a demeaning display in this house is that clear nangi wiped at his eyes yes obachama i apologize for a moment my frustration seemed too much to bear obachama snorted again and nangi winced now the object of her derision what do you know of the capacity to bear pain disappointment and suffering you are only twentynine when you get to be my age you might have some inkling although buddha protect you i hope not she squared her shoulders now we do what must be done and that does not include crying over the inequity of a system which all young men must abide by obviously gakubatsu he first and at least as far as the ministers are concerned the strongest of the factions that will help you in your life is of no use to you here but there are others we may rule out zaibatsu as well since that bond is based on money and you have very little at this moment that leaves keibatsu and kyodobatsu of the first as far as you have told me you are not related by blood or marriage to any minister or viceminister and the chances of you marrying into such a family at any time in the near future seems nil am i correct yes obachama nangi said softly the bursting of his monthslong frustration had brought no relief rather it had given rise to a feeling of dull depression lift your head up tanzanchan the old woman said i want to look in your eyes when i speak to you nangi did as he was told you look as if all is lost my son it is not her tone had changed softening just a bit you speak to me of how ingenious your thinking is at the ministry it is time to bring some of that home to guide yourself it is my understanding that in order to receive promotions each junior bureaucrat must have a senior to champion him tell me my son who is your sempai i have none as yet obachama ah the old woman put down her cup and folded her mottled hands in her lap now we come to the root of the problem you must have a sempai she knitted her brows together her eyes crossed in concentration the stylized mie used in the kabuki theater and in art the first three factions have been put aside but what about kyodobatsu have we by chance a viceminister who comes as you do from yamaguchi prefecture nangi thought for a moment the only bureaucrat of such senior position is yoichiro makita he was born in yamaguchi just down the road from me well then obachama makitasan was minister of the munitions ministry during the war he is now a class a criminal serving time in sugamo prison now obachama smiled you have been so busy working away at your ministry you have no time to read the newspapers your makitasan has been in the news lately you know that as well as being munitions minister makitasan had also been granted s cabinet minister status by tojo nangi stared at her cleareyed it seemed as if he had suddenly awakened from a dream what was in obachamas mind when the americans captured saipan in makitasan publicly expressed his belief that the war was over for japan and that we should throw up our arms in surrender tojo was outraged well who can blame him really in those days the word surrender had been struck from the language and rightly so in the spirit of the intense patriotism we all rallied around but makitasan was right nangi said oh yes she nodded her gray head just so but tqjo called him to task cabinet minister or no he would have no more of this defeatist talk as the head of the kempeitai he could have had makitasan executed but he did not as it happened the minister had a number of influential friends in the imperial household the diet even the bureaucracy and they were strong enough to stay tojos hand obachama picked up her tiny cup poured herself more tea these facts have just come to light last week makitasans status was changed to unindicted class a war criminal and the machinery is currently under way to depurge him those dark eyes watched nangi carefully over the rim of the delicate tea cup she swallowed and said you know my son makitasan served as viceminister of commerce and industry under three cabinets and as minister under a fourth that would certainly make him sempai would it not hai obachama smiled charmingly now eat your rice cakes my son i baked them especially for you sugamo prison was a depressing place it had nothing to do with the physical aspect of the place which was altogether ordinary in fact in those areas not given over to cells it might have been the repository for any one of the myriad ministerial bureaus housed across the city the indifference of those who ran sugamo appalled nangi more than anything else yes there were iteki as obachama would call them always present but it seemed to nangi as if the everyday administration of the prison had been given over to the japanese and it was the behavior of these people that affected nangi so intensely to a man they exuded the shame and indignity the scap forces had put them through incarcerating their own people the daily horror of feeding exercising observing and most of all punishing these war criminals was tattooed on their faces as clearly as if they were the inky artwork covering yakuza flesh it took nangi three weeks to burrow through the labyrinth of red tape guarding the entrance to sugamo like a gordian knot his viceminister was of some help though the man himself was the military then secret police unaware that his signature on a form in triplicate helped nangi open the steelclad doors of the prison the scent of defeat rather than despair perfumed the atmosphere inside sugamo bars were everywhere in evidence and during his hours there the resulting striped sunlight gradually came to seem normal to nangi because makitasan had been declassified and was in the process of being depurged they allowed him to sit across from nangi without the usual steel net screen between them nangi could remember having seen yoichiro makita only once in a photograph in the newspaper announcing his appointment as munitions minister that man had been hearty and as rotund as a chinese with a fine wide face and broad heroic shoulders the makita who now appeared before him had another appearance entirely his body had lost most of its weight because one could now see that he was a relatively largeboned man his undermuscled flesh appeared as thin as the skin over it he had an unhealthy pallor that made him appear almost jaundiced but oddest of all his face had lost none of its roundness if anything that moonlike quality had inexplicably increased bloating his features all save his eyes which seemed sunken in soft folds of meaty flesh nangi expressed none of his dismay in either tone or movement merely bowed formally as he introduced himself makita nodded absently said good of you to come as if he knew precisely why nangi had shown up it is time for my exercise he waved a hand in an aimless gesture i hope it will not inconvenience you overmuch if you accompany me outside sugamos version of outside was a narrow strip of courtyard between two buildings that rose up bricked and barred on either side of the lane at one end was a brick wall too high for any human being to climb but crowned with corkscrews of barbed wire all the same at the other end was a glassedin guard tower the tarmac on which they walked was hard and unyielding please excuse my silences makita said i am no longer used to talking except to myself he walked with his hands clasped behind the small of his back his enormous head down already he evinced the shuffle of an old man nangi was no longer certain of his course could this burnedout husk of a man actually become his sempai it seemed unlikely now that he had come in physical contact with him it seemed as if his best days were behind him nangi was about to excuse himself saying it was all a mistake and accept his loss of face as karma when makita turned to him so what is it about me that has caused you to seek me out here in the depths of the netherworld young man kanryodo nangi said it automatically without thinking i am seeking my way in the new japan indeed makita said nothing more for the moment but his head had come up they commenced walking again you work for which ministry mci makitasan in the minerals bureau uhm makita seemed lost in thought but nangi noticed that he was no longer the shuffling old man he had been at the outset of the walk ill tell you what is most interesting to me nangisan the americans are now more interested in the burgeoning worldwide communist threat than they are in us as a defeated power when scap first set up shop here they were adamant about one point they claimed that since we had brought on our own economic woes the allies were not going to be responsible for setting us back on our feet so to speak interesting nangisan because as soon as they found out that due to the complete collapse of our international trade that tack would only ensure a communist revolution here they switched one hundred eighty degrees and insisted that the state take complete control of all economic measures good for us who practice kanryodo but even better they removed the largest thorn in our side the zaibatsu as you know nangisan these giant cartels were our biggest rivals before and during the war they snatched economic power from us bureaucrats as often as they could but by doing this they ensured their own destruction scap rightfully decided that the zaibatsu were responsible for our wartime economy and they have been banned the ministries have their power now and it must be like having stepped into the promised land now japan is perceived as a bulwark for america against the further spread of communism in this part of the world as such it has come to my attention that scaps first priority is to make our postwar economy viable makita stopped and turned to nangi and do you know how they propose to do that young man im afraid i dont sir international trade of course they began walking again up and down beneath the gaze of the guards and the fulminating sky and that being the case it seems obvious to me that the ministry of commerce and industry has outlived its usefulness there was silence for a time it seemed to nangi that outside the prison walls the wind had picked up but it was difficult to tell certainly the sun had been occluded by dense dark gray clouds he swallowed aware that the barometer was falling a storm was coming everyone at mci is split into two camps nangi said half believe in the seisanfukka setsu reconstruction through production and the commitment to heavy industry buildup the other half are advocates of the tsuka kaikaku setsu the control of inflation and a commitment to light industries that would take immediate advantage of our cheap and large labor pool makita laughed and which side do you adhere to my advocate of kanryodo actually to neither side eh makita stopped and peered at nangi in the gathering gloom explain yourself young man nangi steeled himself this was just one of the ideas he had been formulating that he could not articulate to anyone at the ministry now he would see if obachama had been right in guiding him to makita it seems to me that we must devote ourselves to the expansion of heavy industry if only for the greater value of the finished products but to ignore currency reform would in my opinion be a grave error for if inflation is allowed to spread out of control it wont matter what kind of industry we are beginning to build it will all collapse like a house in an earthquake makita stood up straight and nangi got the impression that the other man was looking at him as if for the first time in the ensuing silence a rumble of thunder could just be discerned muffled as it was by the high walls once trapped in there however it reverberated in blurred overlapping waves like the echo of a temple gong calling the gods for supplication it was very dark now a premature evening or the first slide into an eclipse nevertheless makitas eyes glittered fiercely like diamonds at the bottom of a well an interesting theory nangisan yes but to carry it out we would need a ministry that went beyond mci the board of trade or any other now in existence do you not agree nangi nodded we would need a ministry with broader powers a large ministry whose primary function was the manipulation of international trade his head came around like that of a great predator do you see that nangisan hai so desu why because of the americans nangi said immediately if they are suddenly in such desperate need for us to become a viable country again to protect their far east flank then it will be their international trade which must pull us up nothing else will work as quickly or as completely yes nangisan it is the americans we must make our closest though unwitting allies in this venture for scap will help us create a ministry able to wield denka no hoto the samurai sword that status accorded us will bend both government and industry to our will then rain came with a great surge of moisture and almost no wind because of the narrowness of the space within moments they were drenched but neither seemed to mind makita came closer to nangi and said we are from the same prefecture nangisan that is as good as a blood bond no better if i cannot trust you then i can trust no one not even my wife for her second cousin married one of my chief rivals not more than two weeks ago he huffed so much for loyalty among family the rain pattered against the tarmac soaking their socks and making their shoes squeak when they moved now there are two immediate problems one is that as long as i am in here i am not as well informed as i might be go back to your job at mci nangisan and in your spare time gather dossiers of as many of the ministers and viceministers as you can i know where you work and you are only down the hall from the central file the second problem is mine as well i am being depurged by a most difficult man a high member of the scap team a british colonel by the name of linnear he is a very thorough fellow and his annoying attention to detail is holding up my release makita smiled but i will make him pay for prolonging my incarceration he put a hand on nangis arm for a moment an unusual gesture when finally i am released rest assured that this iteki shall hand over to me the information we will need to complete our files and begin our own mabiki our weedingout process the board of trade that makita had mentioned was a fascinating institution because of the terms of the potsdam declaration which japan had accepted as part of its surrender no private japanese could engage in international trade everything had to go through scap therefore the occupation forces created a japanese organization in charge of accounting for and distributing imports brought in by scap and handing over to scap exports manufactured by local manufacturers nangi had never had much to do with the eot and makitas mention of it was in fact the first time he had thought of that bureau in quite some time however when he returned to work at mci the board of trade was to become a major force in his life as it happened prime minister yoshida a longtime enemy of mcis since he had a distinct distaste for their linkage to the old wartime ministries had appointed his administrative advisor torazo oda to head the box three months ago in december of as oda began to clean house at bot under the guise of removing some improprieties he was purported to have discovered there it began to circulate that yoshida planned to elevate the status of several ministries under his direct control to help decrease mcis power this the powerful ministers at mci would not tolerate and on the same day that nangi was out of the office interviewing makita in sugamo prison there was an emergency highlevel meeting at mci the ministers decided that they needed to forestall oda and yoshida who they knew were working in concert against them to this end they were in agreement that they needed to put one of their own inside bot to keep an eye on oda and report back to them his every move that way they felt they would always be one step ahead of him and therefore could deflect him there were few candidates to choose from principally because the list of qualities this man must have was so unusual he must be highly intelligent with a quick mind but just as important they knew he had to be someone relatively young and without the usual gakubatsu connection that would inevitably bring him under odas scrutiny as a possible rival in short the candidate had to pass through bot virtually unnoticed they came up with only one name tanzan nangi when nangi was summoned to viceminister hiroshi shimadas office he was in the middle of amassing his mabiki file in fact he had just unearthed several interesting tidbits about the newly appointed viceministers wartime activities at precisely the moment the summons came he listened blankfaced as shimadas proposal was given there was really no question of not accepting for the bureaucrat as well as for the common worker a isha seishin devotion to the company obtained it was an essential part of kanryodo yet even if nangi had had an actual choice to make he would have leapt at this opportunity for he immediately saw in this what sun tzu called kai ho to open the leaf of a door thus he determined to swiftly enter this gap afforded him his eagerness masked by humbleness and his evinced dedication to serve to the best of his abilities viceminister shimada and his bureau but in truth it was yoichiro makita whom nangi was sworn to serve the way of kanryodo was paramount with nangi just as it was with makita each recognized in the other that which was inside himself the spirit of the direct descendants of the tokugawa shogunate elite warrior caste the true samuraibureaucrat nangis subsequent appointment as chief of the trade section of the bureau of trade did not long deter him from continuing with his compilation of dossiers in fact it provided him with a new source of confidential information so that by the time makita was depurged he had a fourinchthick stack of folders within which were revealed the peccadillos petty and not so petty thievery connivery and outright bribery by perhaps two dozen bureaucrats of the first and second dan on the day after makita became a free man before he and nangi had a chance to review this parade of malfeasances nangi was summoned to the office of torazo oda what the minister of bot had on his mind came as a total shock to nangi tea was served on a polished tray of filigreed european silver in cups of bone china poured from a tall acidetched silver pot with curling feet the set seemed grotesque and immensely overstated to nangi as all things european appeared to him yet he smiled like a monkey and heartily complimented the senior bureaucrat on his exquisite taste though the words threatened to stick in his throat and make him gag the tea too was not to his liking it was an execrable and illadvised combination of several teas dominated by orange pekoe that somehow managed to cancel each others aromas he might have been drinking used dishwater when he complimented oda on the tea the older man told him it was an american import called lipton the importance of america cannot be overemphasized nangisan oda said he was a heavy set man with the overbearing paunch of a sumo he was impeccably dressed in a threepiece pinstripe suit handtailored for him on saville row his black wingtip shoes shone like mirrors it is time for us to put away our kimono and geta time for the rats head oxs neck time for us to begin thinking about more than our gardens and the perfection of the tea ceremony he watched nangi for a moment as if gauging his response to this speech we have a job to do here and since the gaijin joseph dodge has stopped our runaway inflation with his extensive reduction of demand we have only the future to think about again and our future nangisan the salvation of the new japan lies in one area international trade tsushd daiichishugi trade number oneism he paused for a moment to sip some of the unpalatable tea tell me nangisan do you speak english no sir then i think it high time that you learn the prime minister has created a number of courses for bureau personnel he recommends joining and so do i ill look into it immediately sir good oda seemed genuinely pleased my secretary will provide you with all the information you need on your way out he sipped at his tea again he had ceased to watch nangi with such scrutiny and in fact had turned partially away from him to watch the busy streets through the window behind his desk tsushd daiichishugi he said it softly almost as if he had forgotten nangis presence an admirable goal and a necessary one but really it seems to me that in this new atmosphere of what we must term highspeed growth we will require an entirely new ministry he spun around to face nangi suddenly his eyes dark and penetrating what do you think of that idea nangisan i would have to hear more about it sir nangi said to cover his shock oda waved a meaty hand oh you know a ministry whose primary function was to oversee and control all foreign trade technology it would have the power to dispense preferential financing to those industries the government had chosen for development and to grant those industries tax breaks to make their growth easier and speedier oda was back to his careful inspection of nangi does this kind of ministry sound feasible to you nangisan nangi was caught between a rock and a hard place how should he answer was odasan friend or foe certainly he was an enemy of nangis superiors at mci but that was not really the issue at hand because from the moment he and makita had formulated their longrange plans in the prison courtyard nangi had for all intents and purposes ceased to work for mci at least in his heart the issue now was whether or not oda was inimical to their plans he could be an enormous aid to nangi and makita if he agreed with their theories however if nangi leaked any part of the plan to this man and oda turned out to be antagonistic to it he would certainly destroy the nascent plot immediately what to do it seems clear to me nangi said cautiously that until the occupation forces leave japan we are bound to them hand and foot however i have heard rumblings from korea if the communists there carry out their threats to reclaim all of their country i believe america will drag us into that conflict with them oh odas eyes were heavylidded and the overhead lighting made it impossible now to see them clearly nangi made a mental note to remember the effect how so i think they will have no choice sir obviously they will need all the paraphernalia of war uniforms vehicles communication equipment ammunition and so forth korea is a long way from america we are close it is my opinion that they will use our economy and put it to work for them that will be good for us yes and no nangi said knowing he was taking a chance what do you mean odas face was absolutely impenetrable and nangi cursed the lighting precisely this sir of course the business we will get will be good for our economy because there will be a high degree of turnover and therefore profits will blossom like cherry petals in april however there is a danger inherent in the very speed required our companies are all undercapitalized and it seems to me that even a six months delay in payment will be enough to send them into bankruptcy the business could kill us more tea oda was refilling his own cup nangi shook his head he had already done his duty on that score oda slowly stirred his tea with a tiny filigreed spoon how would you avoid the er negative aspects of this situation nangisan your new ministry would do nicely sir there it was done nangi thought willing himsejf not to sweat it had been said yet not been said now it was odasans move and depending on what it was nangi would have his answer you know young man that your own viceminister shimada would oppose the creation of a new ministry he is no longer my viceminister sir nangi said neatly sidestepping the trap ah yes oda put down his cup of course that is true it had slipped my mind for the moment and now nangi had his answer and his heart soared carefully he kept his surging emotions off his face the ministers of mci struck me as perhaps a trifle overzealous in their protection of their own power perhaps they have a right to be nangisan those most afraid of losing their power are always the most er sensitive about supposed threats to its security he and yoshida are thinking of closing down mci nangi thought it was the only possible explanation for the line of this conversation if you were in my shoes nangisan oda said his voice neutral who would you choose to be the chief of this new ministry dealing with international trade now nangi had to make his decision he had to decide for himself whether oda was friend or foe for he knew that once he answered the question there would be no turning back nangi knew that there was no one in mci he could turn to knew too that as many friends as makita had their influence would not be enough to project him into the center of this new ministry without the blessing of oda and yoshida all of a sudden he felt released his decision made for him my choice would be yoichiro makita he said without hesitation for a time there was silence in the office oda tapped the bottom of the spoon against his pursed lips at last he said viceminister shimada would never stand for such a thing he wont be happy about the formation of the new ministry either nangi pointed out oh but this is different nangisan shimada and makita are bitter enemies creating the new ministry is one thing installing makita at its center is quite another may i inquire sir as to whether makitasan would meet with your approval well it hardly matters nangisan you can see that there are things we all would wish for but cannot have one must learn to flow with the tide lest one be pulled out to sea and become lost to land in the gathering gloom of the late afternoon outside nangi thought of his mabiki file and the list of incriminating evidence he had amassed against shimada correct me if i am wrong sir but in kanryodo there is a continual weedingout process at the lower levels yes of course oda said the outgoing viceminister selects his replacement and all others at the ministry from the new mans university class resign in order to give him a clear field of unquestioned authority and yet nangi said carefully at the upper echelons there is from time to time also mabiki oh yes oda said but there we are generally talking of a scandal of some major proportions i can recall a time when those things could be manufactured a small smile creased his face there were artists for everything in those days his expression sobered and he shrugged but in the present there is always the occupation forces and like hawks in the sun they are ever over our left shoulders hovering scrutinizing he shuffled some papers in any event all the old artisans are gone if i understand you correctly nangi said his pulse racing wildly as he approached the heart of the matter you are speaking now of manufacturing a scandal out of smoke and pine needles poetically put nangisan and essentially correct i take it then nangi said keeping the tremor he felt inside out of his voice that the occupation forces would give us no trouble over a quite real scandal a telephone rang somewhere in an adjacent office muted voices could be heard for a moment just beyond the closed door minister odas almond eyes glittered like dark gems behind the round lenses of his spectacles the stillness in the room was so palpable that nangi felt as if he was swathed in blankets now every motion ever word every look became a clue to the outcome of this meeting scandal it seems to me nangisan can mean many things to many people i think it imperative that one comes to some clearcut understanding of er definition nangi locked his eyes with the ministers and said disgrace for our enemies after a time oda reached downward producing a bottle half full of amber liquid may i offer you a brandy nangi nodded his assent and there was silence in the room while they both drank outside a typewriter had begun working at a fastclipped pace carefully oda put down his cup it seems to me nangisan he said that shimadasan was most generous in transferring you into my purview perhaps but he was also stupid nangi said with uncharacteristic candor oda shrugged his shoulders it is said that the chinese cannot believe that a foreigner can speak their language so that on those occasions when one does he is not heard viceminister shimada reminds me of the chinese he refilled their cups he may not have acute insight but he has many friends and allies nangi knew what his minister was obliquely implying none of them have enough power to save him from his own blunders hiroshi shimada has been a very greedy bureaucrat not the american way oh no nangi said getting into the spirit of the play not in the least good perhaps we may even experience some help from that quarter torazo oda rubbed his hands together as for the er business aspects i trust we have come to a mutually satisfactory agreement pardon me sir but i believe we have one more matter to decide oda in the midst of rising preparatory to dismissing nangi paused his face was calm and what might that be you have my permission to continue with all due respect sir my own position has yet to be worked out oda laughed as he sat back down his great belly shaking as if with convulsions behind him the first gusts of rain began to bead the windowpane obscuring the hurrying pedestrians far below young man i do believe i have the measure of you now he chuckled i shall not underestimate you again lets see he tapped a pudgy forefinger against his pursed lips it is clear that you are far too clever to remain here at the bot you will be my eyes and ears at the new ministry makitasan will appoint you chief of the secretariat there you will weed through all of the applicants to the new ministry approving those who are loyal to makitasans and my policies slowly we will transform the face of the entire bureaucracy slowly we will melt away those who oppose us those who do not understand the nature of trade number oneism it will be the twohundredyear tokugawa shogunate reborn nangi recognized the fierce cold light of the fanatic turning the ministers eyes into beacons and he found himself wondering what it was oda had occupied himself with during the war makitasan and i will have to treat this one carefully he thought as he rose and bowed formally thank you sir he turned to leave but odasans voice stayed him nangisan you were quite correct about viceminister shimada he was twice a fool once to underutilize that fine brain of yours second to send you of all people to spy on me mci did not disappear as nangi had suggested but the ministry of international trade and industrys creation did sound its death knell nangi and makita pored over the mabiki file and as had been planned makita took nangis information officially to oda because shimada was a viceminister and this did have at first whiff the scent of a major scandal oda felt obliged to pass on all the damning evidence to the prime minister six days after yoshida received the documentation of shimadas transgressions which included manipulation of ministry funds use of ministry classified information to obtain jobs for several of his family and the unearthing of a mistress a geisha as well as a wife he was forced to dismiss the viceminister and make the circumstances of his firing public scap demanded such a procedure in order to ensure continued public support for the government and in order to bring home to the japanese populace at large that they were indeed living in a democracy where nothing was concealed yoshida was of course against such a public humiliation and fought it knowing what the end result would have to be he was overruled by members of the occupation forces and at last after stalling long enough to return to him most of his lost face he released the documents to the press less than twentyfour hours later hiroshi shimada kneeling on a fibrous tatami clad in a kimono of ash gray field and smoke wheels directed his wakizashi toward the muscled ridge of his lower belly slashing left to right then upward his body quivering with effort control and face his wife kaziko was found by his side pools of their already browning blood amassed and mingled their last and only testament i wonder how much colonel linnear hated shimada yoichiro makita knelt on the tatami while across from him nangi reclined in a minimum of pain his spine against a folded futon nangi was surprised you mean the gaijin who depurged you how is he involved makita looked far better than he had in sugamo his body had begun to fill out while his face had most of its former bloat he now appeared much as he had in the newspaper photograph nangi had seen years ago a figure of almost iconic proportions an aggressive and powerful ra nrabureaucrat during my long weeks with the english colonel he revealed much to me makita said thoughtfully though far less than many other gaijin would he has the gift of patience that man you sound as if you admire him makita smiled oh nothing so strong as that surely but still for a gaijin his voice trailed off for a moment and his gaze retreated to an inner stare you think he knew shimada personally nangi asked after a time as you did makitas eyes snapped back into focus and he was with nangi again oh there was something between them all right i have no doubt about that colonel linnear was the man on macarthurs staff who most vociferously fought to have the facts in the scandal made public knowledge just like a gaijin on the contrary nangisan just like a japanese nangi shifted position to ease the stiffness coming into his muscles i dont understand unlike most of the iteki in scap who had no concept of the lethal consequences of their planned public humiliation for they saw it only as a revealing of the truth colonel linnear knew what shimada must do oh yes nangisan he wanted shimada dead almost as badly as i did what is another japanese life to an itekf makita heard the bitterness in his friends voice and wondered at the innumerable kinds of rationalization the human mind could unearth in order to protect itself from psychic trauma it was apparently easy for nangi to believe someone like colonel linnear would engineer the death of a japanese merely because he was a barbarian did it occur to nangi that he himself was the minister of justice in this case meting out shimadas death sentence in order to help speed japans high growth through the direct control of miti now who is rationalizing makita asked himself he had no doubt about nangis brilliance however the man had been dead right with his prediction of the korean war america had put japan on a warmateriel manufacturing blitz and many of the nascent companies dragooned into gearing up were helplessly undercapitalized scap saw this immediately and allowed the bank of japan to step up its loan rate to the twelve city banks who then passed the money on to the companies in need for weeks makita had been thinking of a way to capitalize on this development for he saw that a lack of adequate financing would leave many companies open to foreign takeover this he felt quite strongly must never be allowed to occur and he was in the process of extending mitis power in this area so that all foreign investors would have to come to miti to seek permission to approach a company how is our friend satosan making out he asked quite well nangi said reaching for one of the mochi concentrated rice cakes that obachama had baked for them they were three days into and these were traditional new years fare he has managed to rise to the vice presidency of his mining konzern overseeing all coal operations makita grunted take care you drink plenty of water with those he observed my brother was a doctor and he used to dread the first two weeks of every new year because he was constantly running from patient to patient trying to unblock intestines clogged with indigestible mochi i wouldnt let obachama hear you say that nangi said taking another bite but just to be on the safe side i think ill have some more tea he leaned forward she misses him you know makita said after they had drained their cups satosan hes making a great deal of money and a solid name for himself but hes up north and he rarely gets a chance to see obachama now if only his konzern had an office here in tokyo but theyre much too small on their own it wouldnt be profitable only the city bank that subsidizes them is located here a warning bell went off in nangis mind on the surface there seemed no relation to what makita had just said and the problem he had been working on and yet he trusted his senses enough to know that if he took the time to probe beneath the surface he would find the link the problem revolved around money and who had money other than banks for a moment nangis mind was blank and then the meshing of ideas hit him with such dazzling force that he was rocked back on his buttocks yes of course his eyes cleared makitasan he said softly may i have your assistance you have it gladly you have only to ask here is what we must do makitasan miti must resurrect the zaibatsu but they were our enemy at every turn they sought to draw power away from the ministries and in any event the occupation forces have banned zaibatsu forever yes nangi said excitedly the old zaibatsu but what i am speaking of now is something new kinyu keiretsu financial linkages as a base we will take a bank because only a bank has enough capital to finance such a setup its capital will finance several industrial firms oh say steel electronics and mining and a general trading company in times of expansion as we have now the bank will be able to underwrite its own companies and conversely during times of economic recession which must surely hit us makitasan the trading company will be able to import raw materials on credit and promote the keiretsus products overseas thus avoiding any stockpiling in a contracting domestic market makitas eyes were shining and he rubbed the palms of his hands together call satosan immediately well start with the bank underwriting his company well elevate him and in the process bring him home oh this is brilliant nangisan brilliant by next year scap will be gone and miti can do whatever it feels is necessary to propel japan to the forefront of international trade what about control nangi asked we must ensure that what happened with the zaibatsu never happens with these new keiretsu we must bind them to the ministries as part of their charter makita smiled and so we shall nangisan because miti directs policy because we can issue writeoffs in certain areas and not in others because we can authorize sizable payouts as insurance against bad debt trade contracts we can totally control the trading companies and without the trading companies the keiretsu is useless any bank will see that reasoning ah even the prime minister will see the pureness of the keiretsu since it is a perfect way to direct what capital is available into the right economic channels they were like two children wonderingly examining a marvelous new toy its the perfect longrange plan because the individual companies within each keiretsu are totally financed by the bank they can concentrate on market penetration developing the best possible product and not on shareholders demands for shortterm profitability makita sprang up this calls for a celebration my young friend tomorrow is soon enough to speak to satosan tonight we are off to a place i know in karyukai a night in the willow world will do us both a great deal of good come we are off to fuyajo the castle that knows no night where the sake flows until dawn and we will ik on pillows that breathe with infinite softness and create patterns of eternal delight an exaltation of larks clung to the flamedecorated branches of the stately maple that grew on one side of the garden that had originally attracted nangi and sato to this house near ueno park brisk october winds had scoured the sky vaporizing the stringy clouds near the horizon and turning the air to crystal as nangi watched clad in a padded kimono a black field with a pewter design the larks burst from the maple in a fine spray as if he were on the bow of a ship churning through the pacific then like the occupation forces they were gone swallowed up in the enormous cerulean sky the color as translucent as the finest chinese porcelain though this was the end of and japan was once again a free country purged of iteki there was no joy in nangis heart he knelt by the open fusuma his hands folded in his lap gazing with blind eyes out at the nearperfect beauty of the garden it would never be perfect of course as the nature of zen dictated one must spend ones life searching for that perfection behind him nangi could hear the soft voices of makita sato and his new wife mariko a gentle dolllike woman with a core of courage and an open soul nangi could admire she had been good for sato fulfilling a void in him that had been apparent to nangi almost since the two had first met it was nangi who mourned obachamas passing the longest makita of course knew her only peripherally to sato she had been mother and father both and he had been unwell for almost a week following her funeral but obachama had died more than a month ago and nangi still felt the absence of her spirit like a void in his own soul she had been more than mother to him she had been his confidant his sensei even when he needed it they had shared the joys of his successes the bitter sorrows of disappointments she had counseled him wisely in perilous times and had had enough strength to kick him when he thought he had no more stamina to press onward she had been old ancient even and nangi knew all things must eventually turn to dust from whence they first came but his spirit was bitter and sere without obachamas bright eyes and chirrupy voice though he could not understand it fully then obachamas death sealed his fate or a good part of it at least after gotaros death nangi had made an unconscious pact with himself never to allow that degree of openness and therefore vulnerability to spring up between him and anyone else but somehow obachama had charmed him out of that pact with this inevitable result though nangi was to sleep with many women in his time he would feel nothing for them in his heart the double deaths from his past were like eternal kami hovering in his mind reminding him of how evil and unfair life could be these of course were very western concepts but nangi could never admit such anathema to himself thus his karma was complete this struggle between his japanese nationalism and what a tiny part of him might suspect was his ultimate reason for turning to christianity would plague him to the end of his days an eternal punishment perhaps for submitting to gotaros sacrifice for lacking the courage to overcome his terror and do for his friend what gotaro had finally done for him the birds were gone now but the splendor of the autumnal foliage crowned the maple with a mantle of searing colors voices drifted over nangi like kami mariko was busy preparing the traditional gifts of foodstuff for tonights tsukimi the moonviewing ritual of contemplation and peace nangis gaze moved over the top of the swaying maple to the brilliant sky swept new by the gathering winds swirling aloft soon the moon would rise showering this small space with silver and blue light and through the open fusuma the chill of night would slowly creep in book three kai ho new york tokyo key west yoshino spring present his heart leapt when he saw her she broke through the cordon of milling people her long legs pumping and raced into his arms oh nick she cried into his chest i thought you were never coming home he lifted her head up so he could drink in the colors of her large eyes the swirled sienna and bottle green that could have been hazel but was not the bright crimson motes danced in her left iris he saw that she had been crying justine his sigh set her off again and he feh the slow crawl of her hot tears as their lips crushed together and her mouth opened under his her sweet warm breath mingling with his and he thought its good to be home im sorry about how that call ended she said people were shouldering roughly past them and he became aware that they were blocking the egress from the incoming flight he moved them quickly off to the side so am i he said i was distracted there was so much to do over there and not enough time to do it in she had done something to her hair he saw it was as tangly and wild as a lions mane too there were garnet highlights here and there as the overhead lights spun off it i like it he said his arm still around her she looked at him what your hair she smiled as they began to walk toward the glass doors all that matters is that youre home safe and sound she put her head against his shoulder forcing him to shift his bags to a more comfortable position he found it odd and somehow unsettling that she had said nothing at all about her father but considering what was ahead he did not think this the best time to question her instead he said tell me about your new job are you happy there oh yes she said and immediately launched into a description of the three major projects rick millar had her working on in so doing she was transformed again into the exuberant little girl she often could be it was interesting how all shyness evaporated from her at these times she seemed supremely selfconfident and mature nicholas found himself wondering how a job could have changed her in so short a time but when she was finished the selfconsciousness returned she could do more things with eyes than anyone else he knew and now as she lifted her head and stared at him he saw the shyness and the need for his approval there was that peculiar coolness swirling in the depths that he recalled vividly from their first meetings that was far better than a verbal warning to keep him at arms length he swept her up laughing but of course i think its wonderful its about time you came out of your shell now listen nick i didnt say id keep at it or he set her down but you said that you enjoy it she abruptly had an air about her so fragile and insubstantial that he hugged her to him as if she were a lost child there was a gleaming silver limousine waiting for them as they emerged from the swinging glass doors nicholas stopped but justine tugged at the crook of his arm oh come on she said i decided to splurge part of my new salary indulge me reluctantly nicholas gave his bags over to the uniformed chauffeur and ducking his head slid into the plush back seat next to justine she gave instructions to the driver and they slid out into the slowmoving traffic on their way to the long island expressway i see gelda decided not to meet her father justine looked away from him you didnt hear my asking to look at the coffin that was all taken care of ahead of time there was no reason for us to be there silence in the car like a beaded curtain between them your father dont start this again micky she said sharply her head turned and he saw the anger in her eyes i never for a moment understood why you went to work for him my father of all people he was such a despicable man he loved his daughters he didnt love himself he didnt know how to love anyone else nicholas put his hands between his knees and clasped his fingers this might be a bad time to tell her he thought but he could think of no good time she had a right to know he wasnt that eastern that he could keep this from her your father gave me complete control of the company thrumming of the powerful engine deep and rich the slide of queens semiurban sprawl drifting by them and a feeling of helplessness thats a bad joke nick she said dont even make it mentally he sighed steeling himself for the storm its no joke justine he wrote a codicil to his will six months ago his sixty percent of the voting shares makes me the new president of tomkin industries bill greydon was a witness and he witnessed my signing the codkil in tokyo you signed the bloody thing she was twisted around on the seat her back stiff pressed tightly into the opposing corner you agreed to that she shook her head in disbelief for the moment words failing her oh christ but its madness her voice had turned throaty as if her throttled emotions were aswim in her words she put her hand up to her face as if to block out the image of him sitting so close to her as if that would erase what he had revealed to her oh god no no it cant be she tore her hand away from her eyes and glared at him her chest heaving with her rage i thought it was finally over i thought my fathers death would once and for all put an end to it that it would sever me wholly from how he had chosen to live his life because as sure as were both sitting here nick tomkin industries was built on the blood and bile of everyone my father felt he had to defeat in his climb up to the top she gave a small bitter laugh and looked as if she were going to spit the top of what can you tell me that nicky what was it that was so important that he treated my mother and gelda and me as things useful to him when he needed us but beneath his notice when he was otherwise occupied by getting to the top nicholas said nothing knowing that his best bet was to allow her to run her course and now that laugh came again so chill that it seemed to border on hysteria now when im finally about to get my life into some kind of order you tell me that im again bound to tomkin industries body and soul i only said that i had signed the codicil and of course that has nothing to do with me she cried were going to be married in a month or has going home made you forget so soon justine for gods sake no no this involves me as well as you but bastard that you are that never occurred to you did it admit it damnit her eyes were fiery and her cheeks were pink and burning with her anger you know how i felt about my father you knew how i felt about his company i thought that you working for him would be temporary i thought oh christ she put her head in her hands her rage dissolving into tears of helplessness oh how i hate you look what youve done to us nicholas put his head back against the plush velvet closed his eyes it was supposed to be temporary justine his voice was soft gentle assuring as he used the opposite side of kiai to manipulate his tone but life is fluid events cause us to change our plans theres a flow to oh dont you dare start with your idea of karma she snapped i dont want to hear any of that obscure mumbo jumbo try it out on your japanese friends not me justine he said simply were both exhausted a great deal of thought went into my decision and i but not about me not about how felt theres more to it than what you want justine he said abruptly angry now you listen to me i spent all my life listening to what my father told me listening to what a long succession of boyfriends told me and i obeyed them all just like a good little girl should but thats all over and done with because you see there isnt more than what want ive never in my life had what wanted i was always afraid to try for it because of what my father told me what my boyfriends told me how to behave what to do what not to say now its me and only me i control my own life i control my own destiny not my father not anyone else not even you nicholas she leaned toward him moving out from her corner of the seat her skin was red her normally full sensual lips pulled taut and thin at last im free and no one is putting me back in my cage again i wont be chained to anything especially something so heinous as tomkin industries then we have something of an impasse nicholas said but justine was already shaking his head oh no nick thats your definition of this situation but the truth is this as long as youre involved with my fathers company i dont want to see you i dont want to talk to you i dont want to know you exist in the great spacious hall of martial arts on the thirtyeighth floor of the shinjuku suiryu building masuto ishii was working up quite a sweat while others spent their lunch hours over soba and suntory scotch ishii used that time to give his physical self a workout three times a week he rose before dawn to run ten miles along twilit streets before returning to his tiny bachelors apartment in the ryogoku district showering and dressing in impeccable dark suits for work the other four days he spent the earlymorning hours in this same gymnasium since he allotted his section chiefs fortyfive minutes for lunch he felt a duty to conform to the same spartan schedule that was too little time for a whole panoply of exercises so midday he confined himself to the repetition of one or two difficult maneuvers culled from the various disciplines with which he was conversant thus when akiko found him he was in the midst of the irimi variations ofjowaza stave aikido there was no one else about the vast sato staff emptying out of the building like locusts upon the gleaming field of shinjuku at precisely twelvethirty for a time she watched him intently long muscles rippling filmed with a light sheen of sweat that lay on his chest like mineral oil his oval head down the bulllike chest barely moving as his concentration deepened she remembered the long lingering look he had given her on her wedding day she had seen the veiled lust in his eyes then and had wondered had it been her he had wanted to get at or was it the symbol of what his superior was about to possess for akiko sensed ishiis adoration of power as strongly as if it were animal spoor not for him the quiet contentment of home and family of his secure position as numbertwo man at sato petrochemicals in his heart he was no mans right hand but rather wished only to select his own line of command from top to bottom this was in her mind as she came across the polished floorboards feeling their supple springiness beneath her white socks she had left sandals and cloak at the door after first locking it from the inside no one else was here no one would come there was only the two of them now ishii became aware of her only when she was very close the particular irimi he was working on had been one whose perfect execution had eluded him even after months of the most diligent practice still he was not frustrated nor was he angry at himself he had just come to a decision to pass on to another variation when his break in concentration revealed akiko his head came up sweat sparkling like dew across his black closecropped hair he bowed immediately voicing the traditional greeting ikagadesuka okusan somewhat distantly akiko returned it hoi okagesamade arigatogozaimasu it was schoolgirls rote that was all tell me she said are you as assiduous in your work on the merger as you are at aikidot i do what is asked of me okusan akiko gave the top of his head a bleak smile she could see his scalp burnished as brass and that is all that you do at the last upward inflection ishiis head lifted and his deceptively soft brown eyes gathered her in for an instant akiko felt like an image upon a plate developing then he blinked and the sense was gone i am not a robot if that is your meaning he said deliberately i create for the company as well as serve it in what way with my mind you are an impudent man she said coldly my apologies okusan he bowed again please forgive me her lips curled upward and she held out a hand closing her fingers around the stave she pulled and he took a halting step closer to her she made him aware of her as a woman in the way she stood in the attitude of her head her expression recalled the moment of his searching look on her wedding day she melted into him this is what you want isnt it she whispered into his ear she felt how startled he was at her aggressive stance and laughed to herself he was pulled by the conventions of his mind drawn by her heat it was his moment of indecision using that she broke the stave across his right shoulder with a variation of the iai draw too swift to see clearly his mind was stunned his body immobilized at the same time now a part of her felt sorry for him kneeling bent and broken before her without even uttering one animal mewl of protest where was his maleness his traditional superiority he was nothing now not an image or an icon not a protector or a provider he was she saw not even an enemy he was merely a means to an end his face was raised toward her his skin was covered in pristine beads the sweat of pain his ragged breath broke from his partly open mouth like the sigh of an engine winding down for a long time akiko stared down at him while all manner of thought flung itself like rain in her mind then she withdrew her blade seeing its long gleaming length mirrored in his eyes she felt his terror and thought there are no more warriors left in the world then with neat precise swipes of her katana she cut off his feet when the long black mercedes slid to a halt the driver came around opened the rear door and seiichi sato emerged into a morning sparkling with dew there were two other men with him besides the chauffeur as was the custom with all vips in japan he never went anywhere without them this time though he bade them stay where they were inside the car alone he walked slowly up the pineneedlestrewn path into the precincts of the shinto shrine where he had gotten married this was part of his weekly pilgrimage if he was in tokyo no matter the weather he would make the trek to the lakeside far below him he could see the bright white dazzle of sunlight off the water through the thick stands of pines and cryptomeria on his way up to the inner sanctuary sato passed beneath the crimsonlacquered myojin torii gate and just beyond paused to drop something in the offering box reaching just above it he pulled the rope that rang the sacred bell which would awaken the resting kami who dwelled in this place and alert them of the presence of the arriving supplicant inside the main sanctuary building sato knelt before the tables laden with offerings grouped around the tables were carved figures of sitting archers spearmen samurai wielding katana before the closed doors of the inner chamber wherein the kami resided stood the gohei a wooden wand with bits of folded paper hanging in zigzag fashion from it beside it was the haraigushi the purification wand a small branch from the sacred sakaki tree above banners depicting the clouds and the moon hung indicating the presence of the kami draped from one of the standards which held the banners was a brocaded cloth in which were hung the sword and jewels as well as the shield and halberd of the shrine these were symbols both of the power of the kami in matters of wisdom and justice and of protection against evil centered directly below the banners on the table was the sacred mirror which was perhaps the most important and certainly the most mysterious element in the shinto religion it was thought to reflect the cleanest light to be able to reflect everything as it truly is and not how we would wish it to be did not the jinno shotoki say that the mirror hides nothing it shines without a selfish mind everything good and bad right and wrong is reflected without fail was not the sun goddesss divine spirit captured in just such a mirror hung outside her cave now sato knelt before the mirror and peering into its keen eye was bathed in its clear light and as he did so he wished for peace of mind and spirit he wished for the deep and abiding sanctuary of thought symbolized by the gleaming lake far below he summoned up the kami in moments a peculiar kind of peacefulness stole over him that he had become accustomed to from his earliest days and he felt as if a connective bridge had been spun out of the ether between his essence and that of his honored father the elder sato had come to this shrine almost every day of his life and when seiichi was old enough to walk his father had taken him along with gotaro even as a young child seiichi had been enraptured by this place while his older brother had fidgeted and yawned by his side seiichi had begun to feel the presence of the place steal over him like a mantle of refracted light from the mirror and when his honored father had died he had made his own pilgrimage after the funeral rites here down the narrow rocky path which he and all the guests at his second wedding descended many years later to the shore of the lake mist was still rising off it then so that it appeared as it must have eons ago at the dawn of japanese history prehistoric and pure it was only as he stared at the gently rippling skin of the lake that seiichi had reconnected with his fathers kami and so he came here regularly to be as close as he could come to the history of his family he needed all their accumulated wisdom now to see him through this maelstrom it seemed as if all his world were collapsing around him thirtyseven years to create and then in the span of little over a year they were on the verge of ruin how had it happened he could not say even with the supposed help of aftersight perhaps they should never have become involved in tenchi in the first place but the government had made manifestly clear the potential rewards if the project were successful with the keiretsu in the position it was in just outside the charmed circle of japans top seven companies we could not resist sato thought now but even though the government was pouring the countrys money into tenchi still there were an enormous number of peripheral costs that the keiretsu was expected to absorb it was their duty and there was simply no question of charging them back to the government over sixty million dollars had been outlayed by the keiretsu in the space of fourteen months a terrible drain on any corporation no matter how large tenchi sato supposed was one of the major reasons nangi had allowed their expansion into international banking in hong kong actually sato had been against such a move from the start the thought of the vagaries of the crown colonys financial fortunes filled him with trepidation it was tantamount to putting your foot in a bear trap and waiting for it to spring shut but nangi had insisted and sato had felt compelled to acquiesce to his will after all they did need an immediate infusion of money both for tenchi and to offset the loss of capital from their steel works so many idle hands and nothing to do with them but pay them their wages and their benefits while the plant ran at percent capacity now sato was close to a deal to sell off the kobun the price would give them only the most modest of profits but at least they would be out from under that saddle but that might not be enough now the tomkin deal was in limbo until linnear returned and sato had had the most awful feeling in the pit of his stomach ever since nangi had gotten that call from the allasia bank in hong kong he had been most unforthcoming about the nature of the call but his hurried trip to the crown colony boded ill sato read the papers he knew what the communist chineses repudiation of the treaty with great britain had meant to the colony and he had gritted his teeth as day by day his worst fears were borne out real estate and banking were the two mainstays of hong kongs economy and he knew once the first went it was merely a matter of time before cracks began to show in the other just how deeply has tony chin sunk us he asked himselfoh amida i pray he has a cautious nature i pray we are not caught in the bear trap but sato knew that he and nangi were already in one kind of trap and it was closing inexorably about them with frightening rapidity what linnearsan had called the wushing sato shuddered inwardly three deaths kagamisan mo the tattoo yoshidasan yi cutting off the nose and now masuto ishii found in the gymnasium with his feet cut off sato strained to recall with a sickening lurch that set his gorge to rising it came to him yueh the ideogram was a merging of those of knife and foot what was happening to the kobun the company was dying around him and unless linnearsan found a way to stop these murders he and nangi would be finished for there were two more murders left in the wushing ritual and it did not take a genius to determine who the final targets would be who wished to punish them and why abruptly within this place of moving shadows and ancient kami sato had the growing intuition that their past his and nangis had somehow been resurrected and a shambling reanimated corpse trailing rotting flesh in its wake was making its relentless way toward them soon they would have no structure from which to carry out the final stages of tenchi what would happen then he bent his head and prayed fervently for salvation or at the very least surcease from this terrible nightmare that had grown up around them destroying the kobuns most efficient executives the very heart of the empire that he and nangi had struggled for so long to achieve he must not allow that to happen nothing must be allowed to delay tenchi nothing but there was a cold hand clenched around his heart squeezing until his eyes filled with tears and the pain was hot in his mouth and he thought punish us for what what have we done viktor protorov should have been in the middle east three weeks ago his presence had been required in southern lebanon to put a stop to a dispute that had been going on so long now that it had taken on all the characteristics of a feud yet he had not moved from hokkaido from the safe house he had spent four years creating for himself when he was here no one in the soviet union knew where he was or could trace him protorov was quite certain of that he had several of his best apparatchiks tunneled securely into the heirarchies of all eight other directorates they had tried numerous times at the behest of their respective leaders all drew blanks as for the men of the ninth directorate who manned this safe house protorov was just as certain of them they were to a man loyal to him first the directorate second and mother russia third of course he did not leave such vital matters to chance once every two weeks the staff as well as the operatives alive within the japanese islands were obliquely vetted in an ongoing program to ensure that the safe house was absolutely sterile only one man was not thus spied upon by his own people and that was because he was in such an enormously sensitive position for him alone protorov wished to see in person to ensure his own safety and that the reports he was receiving were pure white white reports were those containing highly sensitive information as well as being entirely free of disinformation in point of fact white reports were rare protorov had been in the business of deception long enough to take for granted that a majority of all reports were to some degree gray that is they contained some disinformation and it was for him to determine the wheat from the chaff discarding the lies to uncover the truth this was only one of his many specialized talents japan was an exception that proved the rule many of the ninth directorates operatives were of such a fanatic nature that they invariably turned in white reports the man protorov was going to see now was one of those but the problems in southern lebanon had not gone away and just this morning protorov had dispatched one of his most trusted lieutenants to take care of the feud for him tenchi was too much a part of him now as yet a nebulous concept still its siren song lured him onward with the promise of awesome reward but if the truth be known protorov had not wanted to return to the baking dusty climate of southern lebanon always the stink of camel dung and heated machine oil was in the air and how he had come to despise the arabs oh yes he had no doubt as to their usefulness to the soviet union but their gullibility their stupidity really the key to their usefulness was what he could no longer tolerate they were obscene barbarians and he was far better off pursuing the specter of tenchi than having to mediate a dispute between arab and russian arrogance protorov thought now was a quality the white russians suffered from hence their downfall but the damnable arabs had it as well he was well away from them he had been months getting the sand out of his clothes kotens great bulk descended off shinjuku satos weekly pilgrimage had given him some free time shrines were no place for violence sato felt and therefore would not allow koten to accompany him the sumo took the green line four stops where he changed for the blue line at kudanshita riding that to the huge nihonbashi station he was stared at openly in the subways but he was used to that outwardly he ignored the attention even while his spirit expanded with pride he had worked hard to move up the dan and even though he no longer performed in public still he spent a great deal of time staying in shape and even from time to time engaging in exhibition bouts he had not been defeated in these five years he emerged on eitdori and turned right the avenue was crowded with shoppers along the next block he waited for the light then crossed the avenue and entered the tokyu department store inside the place was as enormous and as varied as a city one of his friends had gotten married here another had purchased burial plots for himself and his family but koten was interested in neither of these services a whitegloved female attendant waved him onto the down escalator he stared openly at her heavily madeup face until she turned her head away beneath the scrutiny in the basement he idly watched cakes being prepared sushi being rolled tofu being fermented bean paste being mixed and sugared he made his lunch from the numerous free sample trays on the glass counters he passed when he had judged that he had eaten enough he moved away toward the up escalator still there was an emptiness within his capacious stomach he ascended past myriad floors of designer clothing housewares furniture toys and games theaters medical and dental clinics galleries filled with paintings and sculptures classes on how to wear a kimono how to serve tea how to arrange flowers and in between a plethora of restaurants there was a teahouse in the roof garden with red black and white ricepaper lanterns on wires dancing in the light wind amid the carefully manicured shrubbery was a small zoo attended by flocks of children some of whose mothers were busy downstairs shopping koten waded in among this lot to get a better look at the baboons and gibbons some distance away there were the smallish monkeys from the northern alps around nagano koten edged closer to these though they were less exotic and therefore had less of an audience koten was from nagano and the sight of these symbols of home abruptly made him conscious of the fact that he had not been back for more than ten years see something of interest he did not need to turn his head to take in the small accountants body the undistinguished face these little ones chatter of home to me he said ah the drab man said the mountains those of us who were born in the mountains never fully adjust to being parted from them koten nodded slowly and made his report when he was finished he dutifully answered the drab mans questions to the best of his ability i have to get back he said satosan will be returning from his prayers soon prayers said viktor protorov disdainfully are for the already vanquished three times tex bristol had had to abandon his plans to take out the blue monster and it had more to do with alix logan than it did with her nocturnal guardian after her suicide attempt the blue monster wasnt taking any chances and he had moved in with her at night now the lights never went out in alixs apartment during the long nights as her keeper kept vigil with the most obvious tool light and light in the dead of night was not something bristol had counted on there was an element of surprise that was needed it had come to his attention that alix logans monsters were not themselves excops they were far smarter than that and they had a manner about them that was well almost military bristol had spent long hours baking in the sun doing nothing more than watching alix logan from afar except to wonder where the monsters got their training had tomkin become smarter in his old age had he begun hiring a higher grade of gorilla to do his dirty work that was the only explanation after the third aborted attempt to steal into alix logans apartment at night bristol reluctantly abandoned his first plan you had to be plenty flexible in situations like these he told himself continually every plan had to have a backup and each backup had to have its own backup that was the only way to be successful because no situation involving people was ever static you make that assumption and you might as well go into some other line of work so bristol put into effect a plan he had hoped never to use he loved to fish he loved being on the water but being in it far out at sea was something else again still he had rented the scuba equipment had himself checked out by a pimply boy of no more than eighteen the shops pro he was a mite rusty it had been some five years since hed learned his diving but the basics one never forgot and after two hours of intensive work in the pinktiled swimming pool of the beachfront hotel down the street from the shop the pimply boy tapped him on the shoulder arid gave him the thumbsup signal now bristol had taken his gear onto his boat which lay rocking in the oily swells dockside he doublechecked all his gear as he had been trained to do and was bent over fiddling with the regulator when he spied alix out of the corner of his eye coining down the dock with the red monster just behind her bristols heart beat faster as he saw her turn in toward her small boat no pleasure cruise this afternoon with the same round of vacuous friends it was just her and red the red monster freed the aft and bow lines and stepped quickly into the rocking boat his topsiders squeaking alix already had the engine throttled blue haze of fumes rising from the bubbling aft pipe she turned the wheel over hard and they began to glide out of the harbor bristol his pulse still racing waited patiently before firing his own engine he tugged at the bill of his beatenup cap and headed out after them squinted his eyes against the fierce glare of sunlight dancing off the water with his free hand he strung up a pair of dark glasses wrapping the curled ends of the wire temples around his ears this plan was far simpler than his first one but it was also far more terrifying to him it had taken him six months to work up the courage to take his first scuba lessons and finally only direct orders from above had set him in motion he was a brave man in most respects but not this his hands shook so much that he dropped the speargun twice after he had unwrapped it from its concealing cocoon this was not an item he had rented in fact he had made a point of telling the salesman at the scuba shop that he had an abhorrence of such things when the man had asked if there was any other item he wanted to rent bristol had bought the speargun in a shop in boca chica early one morning while alix logan still tossed in her bed he paid cash dressed in a ridiculous seersucker suit with an oldfashioned straw hat atop his head and a pair of dimestore glasses with mirror lenses masking his face nicely blending right in with the bushy mustache he had glued on for the occasion on his way back south he had his pick of three chemical plants most engaged in retrieving nitrates from guano and choosing one he broke in easily and took what he needed he spent the rest of the day on his boat in distant view of the long pleasure craft alix had chosen to climb aboard that day working out the rest of his plan and now that it was time to implement it he was as nervous as a rookie on his first day in the business it didnt look good and with the bulk of the tanks settled between his shoulder blades he paused feet planted and spread on the rolling deck trying to slow his breathing and calm his racing pulse but all the time his gaze ran away with him slipping like an uncontrollable kid over the side drinking in the long deep swells and the infinite depth through which he would soon have to navigate he put his hands out in front of him saw the tremor there and said the hell with it out loud as if he were blowing carbon dioxide from his system he bent and retrieved the speargun carefully examining the wickedly barbed flechette at its tip he stuck two sticks of shark repellent into his weighted belt doublechecked his wrist compass working out the realignment of vectors now that alixs small boat had drifted a bit hed have to remember that and not rely solely on the compass he went to the railing of his boat and slipped on his powerful fiberglass fins then bringing his regulator over his head and up to his mouth he made certain the line was absolutely clear mentally he ticked off the list of items the pimply kid had gone over with him partly for safety and partly to keep his mind occupied and off the abyss already lapping at his ankles he reached for his mask washed it with sea water and then spat heavily into it smearing the liquid around so that the mask would not cloud up fitting it over his face grabbing the faceplate his mind a frozen blank he slid over the side the coolness of the sea engulfed him even through the protection of the blue rubber scuba suit he could feel the suck of the cold rising from the oceans depths like a physical creature steady schmuck he told himself the last thing you need now is for your imagination to run away with you youre safe and warm in your booties and mommies coming soon to tuck you in bristol hung in the bluegreen depths going nowhere until he had settled his breathing and had gotten used again to the peculiar form of breathing one was obliged to use underwater strands of sunlight filtered obliquely down from above giving him the odd sensation of being in a cathedral and he thought of the old days in hells kitchen before his father had been slaughtered in the filth and darkness of a neighborhood alleyway then he made the mistake of looking down where the bands of light faded out and could not penetrate blacker than anything he had ever seen and he realized what was below him down down down convulsively he made himself look at his compass and orienting himself he set off in the direction of alix logans boat he swam slowly almost lazily but that appearance was deceiving for his enormous fins propelled him through the water in great long kicks he was in excellent shape and he had no trouble even with the tidal surge that could potentially become a divers worst enemy creating a nausea so strong it could turn even the strongest diver into a mewling baby a third of the way there he forced himself toward the surface in order to take a visual fix he did it in less than three seconds up and down again into the depths checking his compass again he saw that he was six or seven degrees off and adjusted his course he plowed on using the halfleg kick the pimply kid had told him was more economical and less taxing over a long haul than the one he had been originally taught he had just come down from his second visual and had again corrected his course slightly when his peripheral vision picked up the shadow almost directly below him immediately he ceased his kicking and hung motionless in the water if it was a shark he did not want its acute vibrational sense picking him up but now ahead of him he could dimly make out the bulk of the underside of alixs boat and below that the taut fishing line in reality he could not actually see the line but he was certain it was there the red monster had caught a big one and that was what bristol saw the fish was hooked solidly its body whipsawing back and forth and that was the reason for the shadow cruising below him silently bristol cursed the red monster but now as he glanced back downward he saw how close the shark was to him he was no expert but he knew a basking shark from a blue a nurse from a tiger this one was about twelve feet long and from its marking was surely a tiger shark one of the flesh eaters it was there now because it could sense the blood drooling from the fish fighting the line more than a hundred yards away bristol watched the spotted light play along the rough prehistoric hide of the creature as it wound its way upward he could not tell whether the thing had sensed him or not but he did his best to parallel its course keeping on top of it at a certain point that would have to end and then he would have to see what the shark did the tiger rose lazily almost indifferently moving so slowly bristol could make out the score lines crisscrossing its flank then abruptly it veered to port launching itself through the green void like a missile it turned and now bristol had no doubt it had seen him his heart pounding painfully in his chest he willed his body to be still he hung suspended watching the tiny green plankton drift by him in oblique sheets a strand of seaweed foods in the other direction asshole he spoke silently to the primitive creature you dont want any part of me ill just bash your pea brain back into your spine the tiger was now turned so that it was head on to him and they faced each other like a pair of gladiators in a vast surging arena filled with awful silence the lens of the sea turned it monstrously large against all logic it moved toward him not swiftly as it had when it had sensed him but cautiously after all this was not a creature in distress its senses informed it yet there was distress and blood in the immediate vicinity and the shark wanted to feed unmolested though bristol was carrying two sticks of shark repellent he had little faith in the chemicals still he inched his right hand down toward his belt fleetingly he thought of the speargun but quickly rejected that course of action he had seen too many shots of sharks with spears through their brains still alive and attacking and he wanted no part of that he only had one spear the tiger was very close now and bristol could see the wicked sickleshaped mouth below the wide apart pig eyes pink plankton clung to its bottleshaped snout and three ramoras two above and one below mimicked its every twist and turn it was still coming on and bristol gripped one of the sticks with a gloved hand and gently drew it out he was sweating christ he thought this bastards gonna come all the way in bristol rode with the tidal surge four fathoms down and gripped the stick with a viselike grip come on old buddy he whispered inside his head have i got a surprise for you the tigers ugly snout nosed in and bristol abruptly came to life lifting the stick and slamming it as hard as he could against the sharks snout the creature bucked hard almost standing vertically on its tail then it twisted so quickly it left two of the ramoras temporarily behind and fled into the green depths with a great double wave of its long powerful tail for a time bristol just hung as he had feeling the cold sweat drying on his skin beneath his rubber cocoon then replacing the shark repellent in his belt he got a fix on the boat and moved off toward it twentyfour feet above where bristol swam and perhaps seventyfive yards distant jack kenneally was having the devils own time landing his catch the red monster was no professional fisherman but he originally came from florida and he had done a lot of deepsea stuff as a teenager now his job was to go after bigger game and he bitterly resented this halfassed babysitting assignment kenneally spat over the side with disgust he had saved her tan ass once from oblivion and he wondered just how many times he would have to repeat the feat before this shithouse assignment would end privately he wondered whose instep he had trod on to be handed this one he was top echelon and he chafed to be out and setting prey in the sights of the long gun and not at the end of a fishing line he glanced over at alix logan stretched out in the skimpiest of bikinis her burnished skin shining with oil and cursed softly who the hell was she anyway he asked himself that i gotta risk my neck to keep her alive and separated from the rest of the world kenneally never did get an answer to that question for at that moment light danced off a surfacing faceplate and in the midst of reeling in his catch the red monster said what the fuck and reached for his magnum got off a shot just before he heard the plangent twang the bright rush of wind the ballooning black object and then the burning pain in the center of his chest aggh he cried as he staggered back under the shock of force the rod spinning out of his hands and disappearing beneath the waves he clutched at the fire burning inside him trying to rip the flechette from his flesh but that only caused the curved barbs to bite deeper into him his chest was expanding and from his vantage point on the deck he looked up into the burning sun the slim silhouette of alix logan stood over him her hand to her mouth covering the great o her lips were making her beautiful eyes were open wide and kenneally was suddenly struck by how much those eyes reminded him of his daughters now why hadnt he seen that before fingers like swollen sausages and a terrible paralysis beginning to suffuse him stiffening his limbs fevering his mind kenneally saw the great shade looming up over the side of the boat flicking sea water from its slick blue skin then his eyes were bulging outward unnaturally and blood ran from his nose mouth and ears in bright crimson trickles and his body convulsed twice as the autonomic system shut down for good climbing over the side of the boat bristol ripped off his heavy fins pushed his mask up onto the top of his head and said alix logan im detective lewis jeffrey croaker of the new york city police department and to tell you the truth ive had the goddamndest time getting to see you then he vomited all over the running deck justine was numb the funeral progressed around her like some vast charade which she was fated to witness yet not participate in the hordes of people from her fathers firm flown in from all parts of the world bewildered her their assumedly sincere murmurs of condolence slid off her like rainwater at times she had no idea what they were talking about her mind was otherwise occupied but when the clouds lifted far enough for her to think of her fathers passing it was only with a sense of profound relief at some point she became aware that a male presence was close beside her looking up her heart beating fast thinking that it might despite what she herself had said have been nicholas she was surprised to see rick millar he smiled and took her hand justine might have asked him where mary kate was but if he replied she did not hear him she seemed dead to the world not even the beautiful setting beside the great beach house on gin lane just east of southampton where she and gelda had grown up seemed to affect her she was as anesthetized in her own way as her older sister was in hers lying almost insensate in her sutton place apartment having consumed god only knew how many quarts of vodka this last year following the death of lew croaker he had been the only man able to get through her tough exterior leaving her so very vulnerable now that he was gone justine had just about given up on her sister only a miracle could save her and justine had none up her sleeve she couldnt even manage her own life let alone geldas oh but how she felt betrayed as if the solidseeming earth beneath her feet had abruptly split apart hurling her downward into a pit of nothingness now that nicholas had done this to her now that he had become another in the long line of men who ultimately betrayed her she felt only despair even rage was denied her it was as if some vital spark had gone out within her her head came down her mane of hair falling over her face those assembled studiously looked away from her grief not understanding its source at all nicholas felt a longing to return to japan that was so intense even had he not received satos disturbing telegram he would in any case have been on the next flight out following raphael tomkins funeral he put one hand in his trousers pocket and felt again the flimsy sheet of yellow paper he did not need to bring it out in order to recall its contents linnearsan vp of operations masuto ishii third victim of wushing feet severed cheek tattooed with ideogram yueh kobun in grave jeopardy we seek your aid sato yes nicholas thought now there was no doubt yueh was the third of the wushing punishments only two remained and nicholas feared that he knew who the next two victims would be now it was more imperative than ever for him to return to tokyo tomkins last wish was to have the sphynx merger consummated and as quickly as possible that nicholas knew he would accomplish but first he had to deal with the creature enacting this deadly ritual for he saw that there would be no merger without the cessation of this danger he had his duty to tomkin to perform and he saw now what must have been inevitable since the advent of the wushing that he must stand against it the black day had come that akutagawasan had both feared and foreseen when he had begun nicholas training in the dark side of ninjutsu and he knew instinctively that he would need to use everything he had learned over the years just to survive he spent almost all the time before the ceremony meeting the assembled executives from tomkin industries farflung offices bill greydon had taken care of those telexes so they had been prepared and were ready to meet their new president only once did nicholas think of justine and that was when he caught a glimpse of her with a handsome blondhaired man who seemed to have stepped off a fashion layout page that would be rick millar her new boss nicholas made this observation with an odd kind of detachment he knew that he was now so caught up in the people and events on the other side of the world that he had in a very real sense cut himself off from justine his feelings toward her were like fish in a tank he watched them with cool curiosity removed from their heat there had been no question of him dropping tomkin industries he could do that for no one person his mother cheong would certainly have understood that and so would the colonel there was always giri to perform in life and the debt of honor outweighed all other considerations even ones own life it did not seem at all odd to him that only six months ago he had wished to wreak vengeance on the man for whom he now felt giri the forces of life were constantly in flux and woe unto the man who stood fixed and unyielding in his attitudes tomkin had been responsible for croakers deathand he hadnt what did that mean nicholas had no idea as yet but one thing was clear to him now whatever tomkin had done in that regard did not have the mark of a personal vendetta at least in that croaker had been mistaken but where was the truth in this whirlpool executives from silicon valley san diego montana pennsylvania upstate new york connecticut manila amsterdam singapore berne there was even one diminutive silverhaired gentleman from burma where the company was involved in hardwood foresting spoke with him in seemingly endless array all were friendly all were unknown to him until craig allonge the chief financial operations officer in new york came up to him thank god for a friendly face nicholas said stay here and dont move ive got a job for you when this is all over in the limo returning to manhattan nicholas dialed the washington number greydon had given him he spoke for several moments then replaced the receiver he turned to allonge first stop is the office he said give me a quick course in how to pull information out of the computer then leave me alone get your passport i assume your japanese visas up to date good pack a small bag i need you to go over the last five years of this companys life with me so dont plan to sleep on the plane but nicholas was quicker by far than allonge was and while the lanky texan frantically sorted through his files as they began their takeoff four hours later he sank into getsumei no michi his eyes closed to exclude all distractions in the middle level of consciousness that was fully as much feeling as it was cerebration intuitive expansion was paramount he bypassed the enormous inflow of cataclysmic events during the past several days deep within the moonlit path he began to explore the center of his dilemma his eastern side so much more dominant these days had conveniently broken it off from the mainstream of his thoughts carefully surrounding it with opaque walls so that no feelings could seep out from it or seep in thus could he continue with the multitudinous decisions of daily life without his judgment being affected or colored by unwanted emotion and finally on the horizon of his imagination he came to the citadel of the unnameable emotion that had been haunting him from the moment akiko ofuda sato slipped her fan away from her face and revealed herself to him true consciousness had not been able to bring him here nor could his dreams it was only getsumei no michi the riverbed of all emotions that had fetched him up on this far shore he felt fully the trepidation he had put away and yes the fear like a great funnel of forces trying to wrest control from him for just an instant he was quite certain that like staring at medusas face he would be paralyzed if he allowed himself to recognize what was within the citadel then recalling one of his most basic lessons in the mists of yoshino he penetrated that fear he went completely through it and on the other side discovered that his love for yukio had never really died at all just before sunset sato was sitting crosslegged in his study the fusuma were pulled back revealing a small moss garden that was carefully nurtured through the seasons there existed more than a hundred varieties of moss here were represented a score pale light golden and flickering as the sun descended through the broadboughed trees touched the mossed rocks here and there giving the gardenia softspectral quality he heard movement behind him but he did not stir sir it was kotens oddly highpitched voice there was no one else in the house akiko had gone south to visit her ailing aunt who had not been able to make the trek north for the wedding and nangi was home preparing for his hong kong trip both he and nangi had been filled with foreboding at the discovered death of ishiisan just hours after nicholas linnear had taken off for america as if the gods had been made angry at his departure sato had tried to bring himself to articulate to his longtime friend some of the fears that had overwhelmed him at the shrine but nangi was satos sempai just as makitasan had been nangis and there were some matters one did not bring up with elders sir ah yes kotensan he said shortly what is it a phone call sir i dont want to be disturbed excuse me sir but the gentleman said it was urgent sato thought a moment perhaps it was that young chinese he had hired in hong kong to oversee nangisans movements since nangisan was determined not to speak of the situation sato had found it prudent to take his own measures to discover what had gone wrong in the crown colony he rose nodding to koten and walked out of the room the study was for contemplation and as such it had no telephone entering his office he went around to the side of the desk and picked up the receiver yes this is seiichi sato it is phoenix satosan ah satos heartbeat picked up considerably just a moment he put down the phone and padded silently to the doorway to his office taking a quick look around the hallway he closed the door then returned to the receiver what have you to report im afraid the news is not good satos stomach contracted first the allasia bank and now this big risk big reward both he and nangi had known this going in and tenchi would provide them with the biggest reward imaginable but the downside was rushing to meet them with hellish speed kusunoki was murdered i already know that sato was impatient the risk he was taking made him so and the thought of failure but did you know that it was done by one of his own pupils the line between sato and phoenix seemed to groan in agony as if many conversations were vying for control i think youd better tell me all of it sato said gritting his teeth in anticipation naturally the muhonnin found with him had been suspected of killing the jonin it has now been determined that he did not the soviet spy lacked the prowess to accomplish such an unthinkable deed then who did kill him from out of the silence phoenix said if we knew that he would already be undergoing punishment then it is likely that there is another soviet infiltrator i admit the possibility exists sato was abruptly furious you are the best there is that is why i hired you to guard the secrets of tenchi if i wanted unthinking thugs i could have pulled them in from the yakuza clan across town amida what are you doing down there have faith phoenix said all is well i am assigning myself to this matter personally phoenix like kusunoki was a ninja sensei sato was mollified you will keep in touch each day at this time i will call you at this number excellent ill make certain i am here sato replaced the receiver and on the other side of the house the miniature voiceactivated tape machine connected to the listening device koten had secreted in satos office turned itself off its store of information increased nicholas and allonge deplaned at dulles international in washington mr linnear a handsome blonde with the slender spreadlegged stance of an athlete you are nicholas linnear she had a european accent that should have been spiky but was not she had somehow managed to soften the vowels clear up the guttural slurring that would have been normal he thought she must have gone to school for that yes the accent was definitely eastern european and immediately he began to catalog her facial structure she reached inside her burberry opened up a black lizard card case would you come with me please was it your mother or father who came from belorussiya he saw that her eyes were sky blue azure really they were quite intelligent and she was superb at hiding things he found that despite the inconvenience she was causing him he liked her he took her opened card case from her hand and peered down at it gospadja tanya vladimova vstraychayetzye craig allonge on rabotayet dla tomkina industrii the shock registered on her face even as she nodded at the mystified allonge in response to the introduction she brushed her thick hair back from the side of her face and he saw that her nails were square cut and clear lacquered obviously she worked with her hands and this interested him it was my father who was born in belorussiya she said in the same language do you take after him in more ways than just looks he was a very dedicated man she said extremely dogged when the occasion called for it he was a rural policeman my mother was from birobidzhan there was an immediate flash in her eyes a kind of challenge and a hint of something more nicholas knew how it must have been for her family inside russia what with a white russian for a father and a russian jew for a mother there must not have been many options open to them her father had taken one obvious one had others in the family taken the other how many of you were dissidents he said softly she gave him an odd searching look for a moment and he was made peculiarly uncomfortable then it was gone her face had cleared and like the blank face of a computer terminal she began again enough so that my father had a great deal of time to grieve excuse me craig allonge interjected in english nick whats going on nicholas smiled nothing really miss vladimova is merely seeing that i fulfill a clause in tomkins will before we jet off to japan he put his hand on the other mans shoulder and squeezed take a break at the airport stretch your legs get something real to eat ill be back as quickly as i can mr linnear c gordon minck said fortyfive minutes later in a clear crisp voice its good of you to come on such short notice i know that you must have a great deal on your mind at the moment nicholas had been taken into a building along f street not far from the virginia avenue underpass a private elevator had taken them up to a fourstoryhigh arboretum nicholas had successfully hidden his surprise a cubistic whitewashed brick structure crouched in the center of this unnatural indoor forest tanya had taken him inside with a complete absence of selfconsciousness for this stagy and to nicholas way of thinking needlessly indulgent construct tomkins will was quite specific on the matter nevertheless im delighted to see you nicholas smiled and the two men shook hands they went through the building past numerous rooms all with tile or wood floors there were no carpets at all and nicholas was aware of the sounds they made when they moved ive never heard of the department of international export tariffs he said what do you do here minck laughed id be surprised if you had heard of us he shrugged were a bureaucratic backwater that congress in its infinite wisdom has somehow seen fit to keep going he gave nicholas a genuine smile we issue overseas licenses and in some isolated instances revoke them nicholas realized that minck had responded to his queries without actually answering them he was led out onto a glassedin patio tanya was already there pouring freshly squeezed orange juice into crystal stemware minck waved nicholas into one of the comfortablelooking rattan chairs covered in haitian batik potted palms deep green sword plants and dwarf palms were scattered about this is an odd environment for a government bureau nicholas said minck lifted an arm oh this is nothing but a set we get a lot of foreign dignitaries in here he smiled we like to make them feel at home is that so nicholas stood up he watched tanya and minck as he moved about the patio its almost midnight yet this building is as busy as if it were ten in the morning i think if this department were what you claimed it was youd be sitting behind a metal desk in a cubicle filled with fluorescent lighting i think at this time of the night youd be tucked safely into your bed id like to know who you two are where i really am and what it is im doing here minck nodded all understandable concerns nicholas may i call you nicholas by the way good a phone rang the sound muffled through the walls and tanya excused herself please sit down minck unbuttoned his seersucker jacket this department it goes by many names the department of international export tariffs is just one of them costs about as much as an aw ac to build and maintain thats considerably less than the cost of a bl bomber still it took me six months of memo wars and threats to get this set built he smiled again bureaucratic minds cannot conceive of such a necessity as this but i can and do this is the first sight a russian defector sees after the wrapping comes off spies nicholas said slightly incredulously raphael tomkin was involved with spies i dont believe it why not minck shrugged he was a patriot and he was a close friend of my fathers he poured more juice for them both let me explain my father was one of the founders of the oss tomkin was an explosives expert learned his trade in the marines where the two of them met he could take the wing off a finch without ruffling a feather on its breast my father used him on several rather delicate highrisk forays toward the end of the european campaign things were a bit desperate by then a lot of lastditch nazi plots to contend with along with clandestine work keeping the russians in line anyway this one mission was a real ballsup from what i have been able to gather it was tomkins fault although my father would never say a bad word against him the man simply lost his nerve and broke under the pressure three of the unit were inadvertently blown up when the packet detonated prematurely minck drained his glass your exboss was a highly honorable man i guess he blamed himself and though my father erased him from the field roster he remained tied to the er organization my father did not want his friend shamed for what he considered a human error and tomkin i suppose did not want to make the break so you inherited him so to speak minck cleared his throat im not callous in this regard knowing the circumstances i gave tomkin the choice after my father died there was a question that needed voicing before they went any further tell me nicholas said carefully was tomkin industries built with oss money good god no minck seemed genuinely shocked we have no stake in the corporation whatsoever you can set your mind at ease on that score nicholas nodded and rose again he went to the windowdoor looked out because he was becoming increasingly uneasy about why tomkin had insisted he come here he was reluctant to pursue a direct course what happens when they see this place he said the russians i mean theyre disoriented minck replied youd be surprised at how much current western fiction they manage to read most of them expect to be taken to a colonial mansion somewhere out in the wilds of virginia he laughed they seem disappointed when theyre not interviewed by alec guinness or what they perceive as his american equivalent minck stood up so much for the easy part he thought the reason youre here now he said has to do with your merger with sato petrochemicals oh nicholas turned to face him in what way its a matter minck said of national security akiko had not slept since nicholas had departed there was a rhythm to her life to all her actions a rhythm that kyoki had taught her to search for and to use one that increased her power a thousandfold what was she to do now that nicholas had returned to america there were three possibilities but only one option because the first to break off her plan entirely was unthinkable and because the second to follow him to america would be to put herself at the same disadvantage that saigo had labored under she rolled over on the single futon there were no intricately patterned coverlets here no luxurious appointments she might have been in a barracks in the seventeenth century save that there was no one else in the small room contrary to what she had told sato she had not gone to visit her aunt that would have been an impossibility she had no living relative slowly she rose and stretching began her morning exercise ritual forty minutes later after toweling off the running sweat taking a quick cold shower to close the pores of her skin she returned to her cubicle and commenced the slow studied ritual of the tea ceremony this she did in solitary reflection each morning no matter where she was it remained in her memory the only link with her mother the only physical thing the woman had taught her akikos mother had been a chanoyu sensei there was an almost religious fervor to the tiny practiced movements the element of perfection before the void brought the concept of zen concentration to the art of preparing tea as it did to many daily japanese preparations transforming them lifting them from the mundane onto the plane of art involving the spirit as well as the mind and the hand with the pale green tea a froth in the small handleless cup akiko arose and slid open the fusuma beyond the wide veranda was the reflection garden its pure white pebbles dazzling in all light its three black igneous rocks set in harmonious confluence along the perimeter and just to the right of center rose the branched trunk of the giant cedar as akiko slowly sipped her stingingly bitter tea she allowed her eyes to pass over the fluted configurations of light and dark shadow and sunlight dappling the textured needles she was so long at it that when at last she returned to her starting point the shapes had changed subtly with the angle of the sun thus lost in the void her mind heard again the plangent double notes of the bamboo flute elongated and sorrowful this was the only music she heard save for the birdsongs which accompanied the changing of the seasons for all the long years of her stay with kyoki the bittersweet song began at noontime just as she was serving kyoki his tea abasing herself before him kowtowing in the ancient chinese tradition on which he insisted she could feel anew the chill of the stone flooring against her slightly parted lips there were no tatami in the ancient castle often in the afternoon between studies she would peer through the heavy latticework of greenery beyond the slit windows carved into the thick stone walls on the off chance that she would catch a glimpse of the player he was a komuso a follower of the fuke sect of buddhism he would have a straw basket upturned over his head garbed in a simple striped robe wooden geta on his feet a musician of such consummate skill that often she would find herself weeping for no discernable reason other than the tender cruelty of the notes dropping one by one through the atmosphere like dissolving snowflakes clever girl that she was she never allowed kyoki to see her tears had he suspected her of weeping he would surely have punished her that was kyokis way the battle commander high on the castles ramparts flapped the sashimono the ancient battle standard that he had fashioned as tradition dictated it was dominated by the commanders seal in this case a depiction of a stylized mempo a battle mask of hinged steel they came in many styles and shapes kyokis was the most feared the akuryo an evil demons visage on a black field during the day kyoki always positioned akiko so that the sashimono was in her line of vision she was never free from it for at night she could hear the heavy snap of the cloth in the wind even in her sleep and terror rode on her back for so long that she secretly suspected that kyoki had stolen into her chamber while she slumbered sectioned out her heart and with the dust of some arcane spell had replaced it with an organ of crystal into which he could peer whenever it pleased him akikos eyes snapped open and she looked downward at the cup she held tightly in both hands tears had stirred the dregs of the leaves whorling them into new patterns she blinked heavily and exhaled a long stream of carbon dioxide she had been unconsciously holding in her lungs beyond the opened fusuma beyond the pebble garden where the spreading pine swayed in a gathering wind she could see the gray wall past which lay the lushly wooded slopes and mistfilled valleys of yoshino alix was moving away from him her green eyes were opened wide so that he could see the whites all around her hands were up in front of her in a defensive gesture and when the backs of her legs hit the gunwale she was so startled he thought she was going to tumble over backward into the ocean he made a lunge toward her and she screamed twisting away from him slipping on the deck in the process skinning her knee get away from me she cried there was a tinge of hysteria in her voice who in the name of christ are you i already told you there was a weariness to his voice he did not bother to hide lewis croaker nypd he sat on the opposite gunwale his stomach quietening you threw up all over my boat and then as if it were an afterthought you killed a man he looked at her as if she were crazy he would have killed me first if id given him the chance he pointed at a spot on the deck somewhere between them the red monsters pistol lay there like a gleaming fish he wanted to blow my brains out the smells terrible she said turning away deaths like that croaker said archly but he reached for the bailing bucket and washed his vomit down the scuppers with sea water then he picked up the magnum and studied it there were no markings and the serial number had been filed off it was virgin and therefore untraceable she began to shiver now her arms crossed over her breasts her fingers clutching her shoulders with such force they turned white her lips were working as if she might be praying he dropped his mask and flippers on deck got out of his gear resting the heavy air tank against the railing what are you going to do now that youre free he said softly alix was still shivering what she seemed to choke on her words and swallowing hard had to begin again what are you going to do with him she inclined her head but did not look at the corpse hes going down with the boat and when she gave him a sharp look he nodded the boats a writeoff now theres no other way theres still the other one her voice was very small croaker knew she was talking about the blue monster the sinkingll throw him off long enough for you to get out of the state it was obvious that she had been listening closely because she turned around now and looked him full in the face you said me not we he nodded how come youve already been in prison long enough im not going to extend your stay but you want something from me thats simple enough to figure out its why im here with them its why you came after me her eyes watched his face croaker looked away you know who these two are she shook her head silently where theyre from she shook her head whos protecting you no but you do know what it is youre not supposed to divulge there was that acid tone again he grunted when he got no response and went through the boat very methodically when he came back on deck she had not moved he pointed to the red monster this guys got no name no id no nothing hes as clean as a pig in shit he looked at her for any kind of reaction then reaching down for one of the red monsters hands said except for this alix gave a little scream as he peeled what looked like an oval of skin from the mans fingertip he repeated this process nine more times then held the small pile in his palm know what these are alix she shook her head wildly theyre idiots idiots are print changers very sophisticated stuff i mean your average hood on the streets lightyears away from this kind of equipment he did not show it but his stomach had contracted painfully when his keen eye had spotted the one idiot beginning to flake off at first he could not believe it but now he was coming to understand that that was because he had not wanted to believe it entering into a red sector with preconceived notions was just about the worst of the cardinal sins a detective could commit and croaker had to admit that that was what he had done from the outset his mind had been so set on tomkin being the villain that no other possibility had entered his mind but now with the evidence of the idiots the lack of other id added to the methodology these two jailers had been using croaker saw another possibility forming and he did not like the look of it at all theyre disgusting alix said take them away they look like slugs he folded the idiots away came across the deck toward her alix who the hell are these guys i i dont know im not she turned her head im confused i dont know whats right and whats wrong anymore he saw the fear and shock in her eyes and he decided not to pursue it at once it wasnt doing her much good to be so close to the stiff he weighed anchor started up the engine and swung the boat to starboard heading in a flat arc back toward his own craft once there he set the engine in neutral slung the anchor onto his boat to keep the two craft linked and climbed over the rail after it he turned and offered alix his hand slowly she unwound and as if in a trance came aboard his own boat why dont you go below and lie down he said gently guiding her to the companionway just relax for a bit after she had disappeared he went to work transferring the halfgallon plastic container of gas to alixs boat going belowdecks with it when he returned he took the red monsters corpse and using his fishing knife cut out the barbed flechette of the spear this he threw overboard then manhandling the body he draped it over the wheel lastly he took the fallen magnum and returned belowdecks there he fired three shots downward through the hull sea water began to ooze up through the rents then he uncapped the plastic container and drenched the cabin he went back to the companionway and lit a match barely escaping the sudden whoosh of the flames greedily eating up the oxygen quickly he scrambled up onto the deck and drew the anchor back on board wound the chain around the red monsters ankles he set the engine at full throttle the rudder at a straight course and the container in one hand jumped overboard it was an easy swim back to his own boat and climbing on board he stowed his scuba outfit along with the empty plastic container then he went belowdecks alix was lying on one narrow berth her right arm flung across her eyes she heard his approach and her lips moved slightly i heard noises they sounded a little like shots your engine was backfiring there was no point in telling her any of it and some danger in it as well its gone she said it like a little girl of her favorite teddy bear it was part of the price of your freedom her arm came away from her face and she looked up at him well i never paid for it it wasnt mine anyway i suppose croaker nodded and came to sit down beside her on the opposing bunk its about your friend angela didion yes alix seemed to sigh its always about angela i caught the squeal croaker said i found her dead and i want her killer alixs eyes blinked is that all there is to it someone doesnt want me to find the murderer bad he hesitated now on the brink of the question that had haunted him for over a year the question that had sent him to matty the mouth for information the question that had led him down to key west when he had been warned off the case by his captain his throat was dry and he felt as if his vocal chords were in spasm so long a time on this one such a dogged determination and now the answers staring at him out of jade green eyes right in front of his face was it raphael tomkin who killed her it sounded like anothers voice but he knew it was his tomkin was there thats not an answer for a long time she stared at him trying to make up her mind the boat rocked gently beneath them in the swells and the vague scent of dried fish weeks old still lingered over the swabbed decks at last she stirred moving to a sitting position well make a deal she whispered you get me out of florida you get me to a place where i know ill be safe she paused as if quivering on the last threshold and ill tell you everything i know about angela didions death if minck expected a reaction from his guest he was sorely disappointed instead nicholas said this department is concerned with soviet russia how does it come to be entangled with the japanese it will come as no surprise to you that japan has been our major bulwark against communism in the far east ever since the end of the war we have been putting enormous amounts of pressure on them for years to increase their defense budget which i might add they have been doing slowly but surely he shrugged thats something and this year they have agreed to allow us to install a hundred and fifty of our newest supersonic f tigershark jet fighters at the naval base at misawa this conversation had begun to have echoes of the one nicholas had had with tomkin last week our latest intelligence puts each of the kuriles in the hands of a minimum of two divisions of mechanized soviet infantry apiece twentyeight thousand troops and on one of them lies a soviet command post capable of coordinating the activity of an entire army corps minck sat forward theres been a great deal of coordinated activity going on there ever since the new migs arrived but personally i dont think its related to the supersonics those were merely brought in as defense against our fs no if our growing file of intelligence is correct its far more serious than that what our probing suggests is a confirmation of what a number of the more militant joint chiefs have been concerned about for a while minck took a sip of his drink we now feel that this troop buildup is part of a specific program to create a military curtain in that part of the globe behind which russian submarines carrying longrange ballistic missiles with nuclear warheads capable of reaching the american mainland can operate without fear of intervention nicholas felt chilled despite himself what youre talking about is madness global madness we would all die in an instant without any recognition threefourths of the human race gone he shook his head i cant believe it even the dinosaurs did better than that the dinosaurs werent smart enough to split the atom minck said ironically so youd better begin believing it nicholas could discern a spark of fire in his eyes now because thats precisely what our information indicates is happening for a time nicholas said nothing the whir of the automatic sprinklers could be heard doing the rains work surely this is eyes only material he said after a time yet youve revealed it all to me a civilian why minck rose his legs unfolding like a cranes he stood next to a pair of the window doors his hand on the white wood pillar separating them his concentration seemed lost in the foliage the soviet unions committee for state security known familiarly as the rgb is comprised of nine directorates he began his voice had changed timbre and nicholas had the impression that his thoughts were still far away each directorate serves its own purpose in the overall schemata for instance the first directorate is in charge of internal affairs if youre ever inside russia and picked up it is to members of this directorate that you will be turned over once you reach the yellow brick building on dzerzhinsky square here minck paused as if he were a captive of his own thoughts with an obvious effort he continued on the other hand the fourth directorate handles all operations in western europe the sixth north america the seventh asia he turned around abruptly im sure you get the picture the kuriles with their close proximity to japan are and always have been under the control of the seventh directorate minck returned across the room to stand in front of nicholas there was too much tension now in his frame to allow him to sit down not more than ten days ago one of my young cryptographic geniuses broke one of the soviets new random access alphathree ciphers theyre changed weekly so its usefulness is limited still he works on the alphathrees exclusively because only the highest priority signaling is done through them minck stuffed his hands in his trousers pockets as if he had no idea what else to do with them before i tell you what that signal contained i must explain that for the past nine months we have been extending our best efforts in trying to determine who was running the kuriles operation it should have been rullchek anatoly rullchek the head of the seventh directorate and indeed we put a finger on his movements in and out of the kurile island command post three or four times during that span but frankly something smelled there was just too much gru movement over there at the same time rullchek i know well and he hates the gru with the fierce fanaticism of the old regime too i kept getting reports of a certain colonel mironenko who was gradually assuming command while rullchek was home in moscow seeing to his bureaucratic flank what was going on there that no one knew about i began to ask myself was gospadin rullchek really running the ops and if so why would he cede even partial control to the gru because nicholas i will tell you quite truthfully that the idea of a united kgb and gru fills me with a deep sense of foreboding but then again the alternative that colonel mironenko was running the show seemed even more farfetched surely the kuriles ops was far too crucial to entrust to a young colonel so then what was the truth minck now folded himself perching on the arm of a white rattan chair one leg swung back and forth like a metronome as he spoke now we return to the intercepted signal it speaks of someone known as miira it tells us that miira is in place and is feeding regularly which makes control grow richer minck withdrew his hands and pressed the palms together nicholas noticed that they were sweating lightly this signal was sent from somewhere in the north of hokkaido and was received by the soviet kuriles command post this was at a time when colonel mironenko not gospadin rullchek was presiding nicholas thought it high time he added to the proceedings and was this signal signed mincks leg ceased its hypnotic arc for a moment and he nodded his head as if he were a professor approving of a pupils question oh yes indeed but well come to that in a moment first would you be so kind as to tell me if this word miira means anything to you nicholas thought a moment it would help if i saw the kanji character in order to be certain of which meaning was being employed but guessing just by the context i would say it was japanese for mummy uhm mummy minck appeared to mull this over as if it were all new to him a mummy you say there was no point in answering minck lifted his head id say it was more like dig dug dig dug minck seemed pleased to be able to explain something again an arcade game we keep a large supply two floors down to increase eyehand coordination in stationary personnel the object of dig dug is to have your man burrow burrow burrow through the earth in order to score points youre saying that the person referred to as miira is a mole in effect yes the text makes sense taken in that light doesnt it miira is in place and is feeding insert information there regularly of course control grows richer but where is this mole nicholas asked did the signal give you a clue instead of answering minck stood up he brushed down his trousers with his hands tell me did you ever wonder why mr tomkin was so insistent on the site of your proposed sphynx plant being at misawa nicholas nodded of course especially when it became a source of contention in the negotiations i advised him to drop the idea it was holding up consummation of the merger then he gave me the facts and figures as to why we had to have the misawa site bullshit minck said blandly what what he gave you and satos people is bullshit minck lifted a hand oh the cost ratio study was done all right and all the figuresre real thats just not the real reason for tomkins insistence on misawa i dont understand tomkins insistence on misawa stemmed from the same source that caused sato to resist giving it to you the company is involved in an operation of its own we dont know what it is only its name tenchi by its name alone heaven and earth we know it must be incredibly important and whatever tenchi is its being done in misawa we believe that to be so yes although the keiretsu maintains offices for a mining konzern in misawa we have confirmed information that there is not enough actual mining being done to warrant all the activity there minck the master of his profession allowed that innocuous remark to hang before adding its my opinion that the russians also have this information nicholas was instantly alert miira right now theres no way for us to know minck stared directly into nicholas eyes and there was no mistaking his intent oh no nicholas said thats not my line of work on the contrary mincks eyes would not let him go but you have men trained for this use them i have minck said simply for nine months the last one was sent back in appalling disrepair theres no point in sending another of mine in ive run out of cover besides my times just about run out nicholas thought about that for a moment are you convinced that miira is placed within the keiretsu where else would the soviets place dig dug to extract maximum information about tenchi its likely then that theyre further along in solving the mystery than you are the ensuing pause was more forceful than anything minck could have said do you know anything else about the mummy nicholas asked knowing that he was one step closer to doing what minck desperately wanted him to do unfortunately no jesus why dont you try blindfolding me putting the donkeys tail in my hand and spinning me around minck stared at his polished nails ive heard it said that ninja true ninja that is can kill people blindfolded in the dark ive heard that they can infiltrate the most heavily guarded areas appear and disappear at will into the night disguise themselves in the most remarkable ways all of thats true nicholas said but i wont do it for you oh its not for me that youll do it nicholas not at all there is as you call it giri tomkin passed on responsibility to you i think you owe him that i know that he would ask it of you if he were here besides the merger will be meaningless if the soviets succeed in penetrating tenchi now nicholas knew nothing mattered what he thought of minck or what minck wanted him to do there was giri and without duty life would become a meaningless jumble of unrelated noise and action when he had walked in here an hour or so ago he had had no intention of being coerced into a situation he had no interest in but minck had very cleverly robbed him of that option there was giri nicholas owed minck nothing and minck knew it but tomkin was another matter entirely now in the light of all this new information what was nicholas to make of the three murders at sato petrochemicals could they possibly be the handiwork of miira he thought it unlikely since miiras job entailed anonymity and quiet and therefore decided not to bring it up to minck besides he had given his word to sato not to talk of them with anyone technically of course that referred to only the first murder what do you know about tenchi he asked after a time four hundred billion yen thats what the japanese government has already poured into the project and theres no end in sight christ what the hell is it your guess will probably be as good as mine oh god minck stood up there is no one else and thats no lie he walked back to the windows the sprinklers had begun again their sprays beading the glass at the beginning of each pass and now i suppose we come to the person who signed the intercepted signal mincks back stiffened just as if he had scented the enemy oh yes that youve got a good memory it was signed protorov minck turned around the light streaming in behind him shadowing his face viktor protorov my friend is the head of the rgbs ninth directorate whats their field of expertise it varies with whom you speak to some say the ninth is the kgbs overlord their own private watchdog but that seems to me to be overly redundant even for the russians besides that would be just the thing the gru would agitate for so id discount it well then my own theory is that the ninth controls and regulates the worldwide terrorist network the soviets train and in some cases at least control a very dangerous man this gospadin protorov he was watching minck carefully because he suspected that they had come to the heart of the matter with barely a flicker of his eyelids minck said extremely dangerous hes exceptionally militant exceptionally bright but even worse for us hes no bureaucrat theyll purge him in the end then nicholas observed theyll take care of him for you i suppose theyll try meaning minck came away from the windows for years protorov was head of the first directorate then about six years ago he was elevated i rather think that this particular gospadin has already amassed too much power for that ill have to remember to use extreme caution then ah minck said he watched nicholas id be er grateful if you did protorov has a nasty habit of bringing ferrets in and playing around with them is that what i am now a ferret sato petrochemicals is the tunnel im putting you down minck said taking nicholas hand mind you only light the lamps as you go they went back through the odd house tanya will give you an access code that will tie you in to the network twentyfour hours a day you can always get either one of us he smiled at last perhaps out of relief and nicholas id appreciate it if youd memorize the thing dusk was gathering when tengu decided it was time to take his leave of the dojo ever since his brother in arms tsutsumu had been found slain at the feet of the sensei kusunoki he had become increasingly ill at ease in this walled castle that had been his home now for more than a year how had tsutsumu been discovered he had begun asking himself that terrifying question as soon as he had heard the news if tsutsumu then why not him in the time he had been here he had come to understand that there were more forces in the world than he had ever dreamed could exist he had witnessed feats he had previously thought impossible and to this day could not fathom all these and more could be his if he stayed on and worked diligently but that was not to be the signal from control had assured that tengu now wondered who he was more afraid of control or these strange folk all around him though he had lived with them he was intelligent enough to know that he was not part of them he floated outside their orbit as a cold moon does a sun soaking up what energy it could through the vastness of the gulf between them part of him was loathe to leave but that area could stand little scrutiny tengu knew and he forcibly pushed his thoughts in another direction even so he would not be preparing to depart now had he not found the safe it was an accident and afterward tengu realized that that would have been the only way anyone would have stumbled upon such a cleverly concealed cache all the novices took turns picking the day lilies that dew laden lined the slopes of the yoshino foothills beyond the walled compound today had been his turn and just before dawn as kusunoki had done when he was alive tengu climbed the slopes in search of the most esthetically pleasing blooms returning to the dojo he went to the senseis study it was deserted as was the custom at the dojo this room would never again be used save for studied contemplation of the spirit of the master which was the spirit of all that was taught here tengu knelt before the earthenware vase which stood atop the raised platform of the tokonoma the contemplative alcove within masashigi kusunokis study pouring fresh spring water into the narrow neck of the vase he began to carefully arrange the lilies in truth his mind was far away instead of concentrating on the spirit of the flowers in his hands his mind was recalling all that he had done during the past week to discover the senseis secret what it had to do with he did not know and it was not for him to know of course his search was hampered by how circumspect he needed to be around these highly dangerous people but at that moment he was engrossed with wondering where he had been remiss and because his mind was wandering in the zen sense he became clumsy but ironically it was just this clumsiness that led to his discovery as he was arranging the lilies several drops of water fell onto the highly polished wooden surface as he moved to wipe them off with the edge of his sleeve he perceived the barest hairline shadow at first he thought it to be a natural fracture of the grain caused by the expansion and contraction with changing temperature but his concentration returned and he then observed that the line ran straight as an arrows shaft for perhaps five inches at that point he saw another hairline connecting with the first at right angles his pulse began to jump and he looked around fearful that he might be observed all was quiet now as he craned his neck he could see that the porcelain vase was at the very center of what could only be a secret door he jammed the flowers into the vase and carefully lifted it away putting it to one side he produced a blade so thin it appeared no wider than a filament of wire the point of this he slowly lowered to the hairline shadow probing with the utmost caution for should he slip or in any way mark this polished smooth surface he would be undone already his brother in arms had been discovered by what method he could not guess and destroyed there must not be the slightest hint that another traitor existed within the dojo his ears attuned for the slightest alteration in the quiet background sounds from within the buildings he worked his blade surely and methodically rejoicing at the slightest movement of the wood panel content to be patient and at last he was rewarded there was no hinge the piece just lifted out tengu nodded to himself considering the nature of the hiding place it was a far securer system for the sensei was sure to see any signs of tampering with such a tight fit beneath the panel was a drop of perhaps three inches then a horizontal metal door with a spring lock again using his multipurpose knife the man popped the lock inside he found papers it was these he had come here to search for quickly now he stuffed the wad of rice paper into his loose cotton jacket he could feel their frail fluttering like a trapped bird against his bare skin then he set about returning the doublelidded safe to its original position concentrating fiercely he spent an extra few minutes arranging the day lilies in the simplest yet most sublime arrangement his ikebana sensei would have approved now in the failing light he finished packing up his meager belongings in a cotton roll sack that fitted across his shoulders and touching the packet of papers held fast by his belt against one side of his lower belly he emerged from his room into the empty corridor swiftly yet with no hurrying of his spirit he went through the maze of the dojo passing without incident through the ancient stone gates he skirted the red lacquer torii which stood guard over the grounds and took the high winding path that would lead him through the foothills of the thickly wooded slopes of the yoshino mountains rising stands of cypress cedar and fir rendering the air heady with their scents swept away almost to the apex of the vault of the heavens standing black and impenetrable against the last fiery glow of sunset already to the east a few firstmagnitude stars could be seen dimpling the oncoming bowl of night swallows and gray plovers darted through the rustling edges of the fields below him on their way home before the keeneyed predators of the dark roused themselves and took wing behind him lights were already lit within the walled fortress of the dojo wavering and hazy he was well quit of them it took all of his concentration to keep his thoughts utterly disciplined every moment he was there it was an exhausting business even for one such as he for he knew by observing carefully that this particular dojo specialized not only in a myriad of arcane bujutsu subdisciplines involving the body but a number involving the mind as well as he pushed onward up the twisting woody slope tengu contemplated this he was somewhat acquainted with the dark side of ninjutsu but here in yoshino he had begun to enter into areas in which even he did not feel entirely comfortable rounding a long sweeping bend he lost sight at last of the bastion which had been his home for so long he felt as if some obscure weight which had been crushing his heart had been lifted from him and like the horned owl who bloody clawed and bloody beaked lifts it prey up into the night he felt a kind of eerie elation that seemed to fizz the blood in his veins and with it came a curiosity he could not control searching for a slight break in the underbrush on the upward slope to his left he struck off from the path in an oblique angle now hidden within the sheltering cedars he sat crosslegged on a mossencrusted rock he chose it because it had the appearance of tokubei the great mythic firebreathing toad mounting it made him feel more keenly the hero that he was he reached into the crossed opening of his jacket he looked up and outward past the barely discernable mountain path to the wide valley beyond dotted here and there by glowing lights from small houses and farms he caught the pungent scent of a fire and he thought of the hearth a steaming bowl of miso soup piled high with noodles then he shook himself and producing a plasticsheathed pencil flash unfolded the sheets of rice paper he had stolen from kusunokis safe with a curt nod he set himself to reading the vertical lines of ideograms why not he had certainly earned the privilege for fully half an hour he pored over the text substituting kanji for the ryus complex ciphers and as he did so his heart began to pound within his chest his pulse rate shot up and he found he had to fight to control his breathing buddha he thought what have i stumbled onto his fingers trembled when he thought of the overriding implications for japan and so engrossed was he in his reading that he did not notice until it was veryclose a small bobbing light flitting like a willothewisp through the trunks of the cedars immediately he doused the pencil flash but it was already too late the light had stopped its rhythmic movement and now shone still and fierce at a spot on the path directly below where he sat cursing the excitement that had narrowed his normally keen senses he refolded the papers stuffing them back into his jacket he hid the flash and climbing down off the rock moved slowly off the slope far better he felt to emerge himself from the forest than to have the source of the light come up to find him especially if it was one of the sensei from the dojo tengu girded himself for such an eventuality bringing his ki up to a sufficient level so that he could call upon its power at a split seconds notice but as he emerged onto the serpentine pathway he saw that it was no sensei who had inadvertently seen his light but merely a young girl she was dressed in a gray and green kimono rope geta on her otherwise bare feet she carried a small kerosene lantern in one hand a janomegasa a brightly colored ricepaper parasol in the other moisture beaded his face and he became aware of the soft pattering of the rain he had not felt it at all within the sheltering arbor of the forest he saw the rain in beads sliding down the oiled ricepaper janomegasa dripping dolefully into the earth pardon me madam he said bowing mainly to hide the flood of relief in his eyes i hope my light did not frighten you i was out collecting wild mushrooms when i eh she had taken a quick step toward him raising the level of the lantern so that its compact glow spread upward across her face with a quick painful lurch of his heart he recognized her it was suijin the female student from the dojo what was she doing here he wondered even as his small blade snickered out into his right palm but the lantern was already falling suijins now free hand gripping the bottom of the janomegasas lacquered bamboo haft pulling it down and away from the spread top in a blurry glitter his eyes only had time enough to register the transformation from harmless bamboo to thousandlayered steel edge before the footlong blade pierced his chest and slashing downward rent his heart in two suijin watched only his face as component by component it fell apart and his hot pumping blood spilled his eyes showed bewilderment rage shame then they crossed and all human emotion was wiped from the slate of his face like the small and defenseless warrior she had as a child once made out of mud twigs and lichen he flopped this way and that without coordination without the divine spark now as then she placed the flat of her hand across the tautness of her lower belly wondering what magic lay within her womb the anvil of creation now there was only a twisted mass at her feet a waxy parody of what had once been alive she stuck the point of the blade into the wet earth to free her hands as well as to clean the gleaming surface black with blood raindrops pattered all about her as she dropped down her nostrils dilated as she caught the freshening scent of the wood the spoor of animal life the rain fell heavier turning the traitors cheeks to putty she had suspected that there might be another one even at the moment of tsutsumus death strictly speaking it should have been none of her business at that point her mastery over her sensei masashigi kusunoki had been her graduation from the dojo and if experience had taught her anything it was never to look back accomplishments were strictly the province of the present those who sat back to gloat over their achievements often died with those thoughts and yet despite this knowledge she had returned studying the contents of the traitors pockets and experiencing again the feeling of outrage that had fired through her breast when she had observed him this morning rifling the senseis most closely guarded secrets she knew that somehow kusunoki had been different he had gotten to her in some way she was at a loss to explain she felt keenly his loss and all at once in the midst of this vast mountainous forest he had loved so dearly with only the gusting wind and the swirling rain for companions she was weeping silent tears her chest constricted and her heart full of an unnameable anguish a burden abruptly too terrible to bear when the spasm subsided for that was how she thought of it the next day she completed her meticulous search of the corpse she found the sheaf of papers half stuck to the traitors hip and she had to be extremely careful in peeling the top sheet away from the damp skin quickly now protecting the papers from the wet she refolded them put them away in a dry place within her kimono kusunokis violation had become her own she did not look at the papers she had no interest in them they were the property of her sensei and whether he was dead or alive their place was still where he had put them she stood and pulled her blade from the earth it was clean and shining again she reattached it to the top of the janomegasa and with it disappeared into the wood above to change into her students gi for the last time the glowing lights of the dojo beckoned her or was it kusunokis kamil she did not know the papers were safe with her and soon they would be back in their rightful place justine had a surprise waiting for her at millar soames robberts when she returned there the morning after the funeral mary kate sims was no longer in her large corner office in fact mary kate sims was no longer a vice president at the advertising firm she was about to go and see rick millar to get an explanation neither min nor anyone else she knew at all seemed to be around when he strode into her bare office id heard you just came in he said a concerned look on his face i thought i told you to take a couple of days off theres no need for you to works the best tonic for me right now she cut in i hate hanging around the house staring at shadows im always afraid ill turn into a cat rick nodded his head deferentially okay its just as well youre here anyway ive got something to show you he began to propel her out the door just a minute she began theres something later he said taking her down the hall toward the elevators thiss more important a floor above he led the way around a turning here it is what dyou think oh holy jesus justine thought it cant be what the hell is my name doing on mary kates door your office now justine that spare office downstairs was just temporary surely you knew that she turned on him flaring temporary until you got rid of mary kate absolutely not she left of her own accord she tendered her resignation at closing yesterday i dont believe you justine said hotly if she were thinking of leaving shedve told me were friends remember lets go into the office shall we rick prompted he closed the door after them youll damn well tell me the truth or ill walk out of here right now justine shouted on top of what had happened to her father what had happened with nicholas this was just too much to take it was all piling up like the weight of the world her head was spinning and she found herself holding onto the edge of the knurled wooden desk with white knuckles the truth is mary kate wasnt er well working out she had gotten into a number of scraps with the senior executives i had spoken to her of course more than once but he shrugged well you know mary kate i know she wouldnt take too much of your bullshit rick justine shook her head i dont believe this what youre telling me is that you had every intention of firing her when we had lunch together you were interviewing me for her job rick shrugged again it happens all the time justine and anyway whatre you so steamed about the better girl won you can run rings around mary kate you should be what a bastard you are to do that to me she stepped up to him and slapped him across the face to us she gathered up her things youd better find someone else to do this kind of shit because its not going to be me nice touch rick said smiling if youre angling for more money ill go along with it ill have to twist some arms but there wont be any are you out of your mind justine backed away from him heading toward the door i dont want one dollar from your firm get the hell out of my life downstairs on the milling sidewalk she realized that she had nowhere to go she couldnt face the apartment empty and lonely most of all couldnt face the clothes the belongings the photos of nicholas there she could not think of going to geldas that kind of depression would put her over the edge and as for returning to her own freelance business the idea of starting up again seemed beyond her at the moment confused she crossed the avenue and went into a coffee shop she could not taste the coffee set before her which was perhaps just as well tears slid down her cheeks as she stared at the blurs of color hurrying by outside ive got to do something she told herself she went to the closest branch of her bank and withdrew five thousand dollars she kept half as cash the rest she converted into travelers checks she did some clothes shopping after that stopping into a luggage store to buy a lightweight suitcase she charged everything cosmetics were no problem but by the time she did that number she realized that she would have to go back to the apartment after all for some essentials she just could not buy duplicates of she made it as quick a stop as she could but still she was struck by the difference it no longer felt like home everything seemed out of place or missing the comfortable had become disquieting and sad she wiped the tears away and got out of there locking up as if she were going away forever it was only when she was already airborne on her way to honolulu and thence maui that she realized that indeed one item had been missing from the apartment the long black lacquer scabbard that sheathed nicholas prized daikatana the supreme long sword was gone from its spot on the bedroom wall so of course was the deadly weapon instinctively something inside her began to wail minck saw the concern on tanyas face as she returned from putting linnear back on his flight east she had heard and seen everything secreted behind the panel of the mirror that was in the adjoining room a rectangle of oneway glass carroll i dont understand what youre doing she said youve as good as killed him sending him against protorov like that that wasnt the plan unless i missed something minck was not in a good mood despite his success with nicholas come with me he said brusquely he led her through to the opposite end of the rambling house here in an area that was restricted even to some of his own staff minck took her through several windowless laboratories and into a steelwalled cubicle it was very cold in there he flipped on the fluorescent overhead light tanya squinted in the harsh purpleblue illumination still she saw the draped corpse immediately it would have been hard to miss since its bulk dominated the small room carefully she strode over to the head and pulled back the white muslin cloth oh god she whispered its tanker that was not his real name she turned to minck when did he come in while you were out she came away from the blued body i wondered why you created that signature anyone with a knowledge of how it all works would have known that in signals only code names are used not real ones then lets be thankful that thats one area in which our mr linnear is ignorant he said acidly because of this beauteous package dropped on our doorstep in honshu i now have to deal with our brother services who were obliged to transfer tanker here they stood in the dim hallway with the door closed at their backs we now know that croesus is protorovs code name however tanker was the only one close she said obviously he got too close minck closed his eyes now like it or not we must make do with mr linnear do you think thats wise that remains to be seen but wise or not our time has run out im afraid that were we not to send mr linnear into the lions den the lion would eat us all for supper he may still do that for a time minck was silent i take it then that you disapprove of my improvisation tanya knew that she was on thin ice here and she thought her words out carefully i think hes an amateur amateurs have proven in the past to be highly unreliable as well as disconcertingly unpredictable theyre not under discipline uhm true enough but thats also one of his great advantages protorov cannot connect him with us as he did tanker or as he would you minck had the manner of a country yokel sitting on his back porch of a sunday sleepily passing the time with a neighbor it was as if nothing of moment was in the air and after all hes quite frightening you know he seemed to be musing up close like that i believe hed frighten the devil himself his eyes opened and he looked at her even kill him if he was given just cause if he or those around him those he cared about were put in jeopardy mr linnear strikes me as an extremely loyal fellow as well as a deadly one you think hell be provoked enough to bring protorov down it occurred to tanya that this had been his goal all along yes minck said i have sent our mr linnear out rather cleverly i might add to bring me viktor protorovs head to end our feud once and for all i dont like this kgb connection with colonel mironenko in fact it scares me like a rattling skeleton at my door i begin to imagine the connection between protorov and mironenko as being highly significant the paranoid in me sketches out a scenario wherein the kgb and the gru would somehow unite impossible tanya exploded but her ashen face betrayed her own fright there are too many points of contention far too much bad blood between the two yes yes tanya my dear were all well acquainted with that line of thought minck seemed inordinately pleased with himself still i can imagine the attempt being made i can especially imagine viktor protorov spearheading that attempt hes got a vicious mind hes not a bureaucrat thats a particularly noxious combination in an enemy he stirred in any case whether this is all imagination or frightening reality the time has come for protorov to die mr linnear will be my terrible swift sword i have quite a bit of faith in him even if you do not i didnt say that not in so many words no he contemplated her as if she were an entree set before him he rose but just in case youre right in your assessment ill be sending you after him in a few days time timings crucial so youll have to be ready immediately the beeperll signal you if youre out of the building tickets will be waiting at pan am the rests standard procedure what about linnear minck looked at her cynically the first priority absolutely the first is protorov if you and mr linnear can come to terms and team up so much the better and if not if not minck said moving away if linnear becomes a hindrance youll just have to dispose of him seiichi sato possessed big hara kneeling across the low lacquer table from nicholas he had already taken the top off one of the small dishes and with artful dexterity was using his chopsticks to serve his honored guest hara strictly speaking was the japanese word for stomach but it was also the symbol of a man being well integrated with all the aspects of life one of the primary lessons of all martial arts required the student to find that deep well of reserves of inner strength that resided in everyone just below the navel it was known as tan tien by the chinese and tanden by the japanese both physical and spiritual power dwelled there a man with big hara was centered within himself grounded to the elements of nature japanese often observed that westerners bounced along as they walked evidence that they were centered only in their minds and therefore not attuned at all to the world around them japanese on the other hand walked with a heavier stride their gait flowing smoothly from hips and pelvis a certain sign that they possessed hara nicholas was intrigued by satos big hara it was a great compliment to pay any japanese he had flown the trail of the endless night as the japanese call it chasing the darkness for twentyone hours leaving washington at night arriving at narita the same night one day later mr sabayama one of satos many minions had been waiting blearyeyed for hours at the airport he murmured away nicholas apologies and taking their bags led them through the terminal to the waiting car nicholas asked mr sabayama if he would take care of craig allonge at the okura mr sabayama assured nicholas that there was someone already at the hotel to see to all their needs he would accompany nicholas out to satosans house on the edge of tokyo outside the hotel nicholas spoke quietly to allonge i may be out of touch for several days craig even as much as a week i want you to stay in touch with new york and keep things running smoothly weve already had enough of a shakeup now nicholas could hear the boughs of the boxwood scraping against the side of the wood and tile house the air outside was clean and clear on the rainsoaked streets the pedestrians bowed before the wind only partially protected by their amagasa briefly he saw the high arc of the nihonbashi as they crossed the river that flowed into the wider sumida parasols over the span reminded him of hiroshiges prints the great artists images speaking to him from another age the summons to satos house came as no surprise to nicholas considering the highpitched tone of the telex he had received from the man three murders unexplained and bizarre were more than enough reason for this latenight rendezvous the japanese were a practical people and in times of emergency even politeness might be bypassed for efficiencys sake but for nicholas the summons held other echoes ones that sato could not know about or understand being at the industrialists home meant that nicholas would see akiko again and if his luck held even get to speak to her he remembered the gilt and crimson fan trembling like a flower in that extended split second just before she began to lower it and changed his life forever for it seemed clear to him now that everything he had done after seeing akikos face every decision he had made had been so that he could see her again he was drawn to her as a moth is to a flame without reason or logic with even some atavistic knowledge that the journey might end in destruction nicholas was no longer the person he had once been when he and yukio had been so madly in love yet there was a piece of that madness still burning within him and he knew that he could not get on with his life could not fulfill his karma without first investigating this last blind spot within himself his entire life had been spent in the pursuit of pushing back the darkness he had found that he could control the chaos of life through the mastery of the martial arts through that powerful conduit he had not only learned how to channel the natural forces which he had hitherto found frightening for they were the forces which had robbed him of his father and mother but also the spiritual forces whirling within himself yukios power over him was obvious she had spoken to his spirit before he had even known fully of its existence her attraction had bypassed his conscious mind the rational decisionmaking sector on which he had come to rely so heavily he was drawn to her and he did not know why he had become frightened of her and of himself oddly this had served only to deepen his love to etch it on his heart like a black tattoo that could never be erased as he raced through the rainfilled tokyo night spangled with pink and orange neon he was conscious only of nearing yukio again impossible but true which was the dream and which reality his body had quivered with the certain knowledge that soon he would find out but to his bitter disappointment sato had told him in response to his query that akiko was still away in kyushu visiting her infirm aunt he saw only koten the sumo bodyguard lurking in the background like a welltrained doberman drinks first then food at night tea was subordinate to liquor for the modern japanese for this too they had the west to thank nicholas thought suntory scotch vile but he drank it anyway grateful that allonge half scotch was not here to witness firsthand what had been done to his nations most treasured asset as was the habit of the japanese they spoke of everything but what was on their minds that would come later sato mentioned that nangisan was on his way to hong kong to close an important business deal would you consider it impolite nicholas inquired if i told you that my opinion is that nangisan does not see this merger in a favorable light certainly not sato said we are drinking together linnearsan this makes us friends this binds us more than our business ever will businesses are not like marriages you know they rise and fall of their own accord the whims of the market economic factors that have nothing to do with us sato paused for a moment but you must try to understand nangisan the war left its imprint on him like a tigers clawing each day he wakes he cannot forget that we live with the atomic sunshine you understand me the fallouts effects seem neverending he is childless and therefore without any true family but me because of it i am sorry satosan nicholas said truly sato eyed him his wooden chopsticks suspended above the steaming food three kinds of cooked fish sashimi glass noodles steamed rice cucumber and sea urchin in sweet rice vinegar yes im sure you are he said at last i see quite a bit of your father in you but then there is the other side that part i do not know he resumed serving his guest for a time they ate in silence with rapid economical movements sato drank more than he ate and he ate quite a bit it was obvious he wanted to talk openly and without restraint that was quite impossible to do for a japanese under normal circumstances once drunk all actions all words were immediately excusable and allowable therefore nicholas drank with him there would be no point to the session if only sato drank and besides that would be insulting as if nicholas was saying i dont want to be friends he perceived from the moment sato himself had met him at the door to the house that the older man needed his friendship and support whatever was behind the wushing slayings was far more important to him than holding pat in resisting the merger as originally outlined by tomkin whatever fear had erupted in sato and nangi of the ritual punishments overrode their normal caution and preference for hard dealing and within this softening of his stance nicholas trained to dissect every situation in evaluating the elements which created it perceived a weakness it did not make him feel particularly noble or honorable to use this weakness to gain the advantage yet he desperately needed an opening into tenchi he knew quite well that under almost any other circumstance he would have come up against a stone wall where tenchi was concerned however in this instance the keiretsus secret work made them vulnerable to outside scrutiny sato had made it clear that no police were to be involved nicholas was the only person who could conceivably break the chain of the wushing thus he had a powerful bargaining point from which to open the negotiations fah sato exclaimed focusing nicholas attention he threw his cup to the floor he was wearing a kimono composed of the flaming colors of autumn he had generously offered one of his own the one with the angular ndh pattern that he had been wearing the night akiko had brought him his last gift before they were married and nicholas was now wearing it dregs of the brown liquor flew up the sleeve lying in beads like decoration this scotch is no true liquor at all he turned redrimmed eyes on his guest linnearsan you pick our drink for the evening thank you satosan nicholas bowed id very much like some sake hot if thats possible possible sato exploded why its the only way to drink it he lurched heavily to his feet padded in his low white socks to the bar against the longer of the two inner walls of the room it was fairly large by japanese standards sixteentatami the wet bar also contained a black ironandboxwood nagahibachi smaller than the one in the other side of the house this one was never touched by the women of the household but was reserved expressly for the use of the host as he went about heating the rice wine sato hummed quietly to himself an ancient folk tune his obachama had crooned to him when he and gotaro were children it seemed to fill the house with a warmth that was not exactly physical as if he had summoned up the attention of good kami but when he returned to the low lacquer table with the sake his face was set into somber lines i fear we have fallen on evil times linnearsan he said as he poured this wushing he shuddered i am samurai but this this is simply barbaric i am not at all surprised that its origins are chinese how very indiscriminate we japanese are eh to take the worst from them along with the best the yakuza are nothing more than glorified triads and the ninja have their origins there as well his eyes crossed for a moment as if he had just forgotten something important and then his head went down forgive me linnearsan an old mans tongue runs on and on late at night nicholas lifted his left arm as if to make a gesture and in so doing caught the hem of his sleeve on the lip of the delicate porcelain sake pitcher it made a tiny sound as it shattered clear liquid ran across the table nicholas jumped up a thousand pardons satosan please forgive my western clumsiness sato calmly wiped away the liquor and quickly gathered up the shards of porcelain there is nothing to forgive my friend akiko is not here to serve us from the best porcelain this was an old and timeworn piece that needed throwing out in fact it is only my laziness which had precluded me from disposing of the pitcher myself thus did nicholas cleverly negate his hosts acute embarrassment gaining enormous face in satos eyes while saving face for his host when sato returned from heating more sake there was new respect in his eyes he bowed as he pushed the filled cup across the table domo arigato nicholas returned the bow sato downed more sake before he spoke again it is my opinion linnearsan that the wushing is being directed at us that is nangisan and myself even though the three deaths have seriously undermined the effectiveness of the konzern there is something personal in the manner of the deaths with each one kagamisan yoshidasan ishiisan we come closer and closer to the core of the company the path is indeed terrifying to contemplate he stared down at his empty cup and nicholas realized that even with so much alcohol inside him this was a difficult moment all nicholas could do was to remain silent i have thought much about these ritual punishments satos head came up and i now believe that we are being stalked by our past can you understand that yes i thought so you of all people have you and nangisan discussed the possible origins of these punishments no nangisan is sempai yes i see besides sato admitted nangisan is no good when it comes to the past there are many things that he would rather forget some because they are too hateful others because they are just too full of intimate emotion you may think nangisan cold and heartless but this is not true no no on the contrary emotion is quite dear to him he wept bitterly when my obachama died he was heartsick at having to sell a pair of her tang dynasty cups sadly we were forced to do so in order to come to tokyo and begin our careers just after the war ended these cups you know were superb examples of the genius of those faraway chinese artisans as limpid as a mountain stream but beyond their undeniable aesthetic value i believe a component of nangisans attachment to them stemmed from the poignant circumstances under which my obachama received them he told nicholas the story of his grandmothers distant relative fleeing the firebombing of tokyo i think for nangisan this incident more than any other exemplified the useless cruelty of the war the past is dear to him and i think you can understand why he would not wish to speak of it sato shook his head im afraid he cannot be counted on there memory is an affliction with him he will not speak of the past even with me then it must be up to you satosan i know the older man said miserably but up to now i have been able to remember nothing out of the ordinary you know what it was like here after the war those were extraordinary times more often than not survival called for taking extraordinary measures regimes came and went alliances were hastily formed and just as hastily dissolved sato poured them both more wine i understand many enemies could have been made then as well as friends sato nodded those were pressurized times i often think that decades were compressed into years years into months we accomplished so much in such a small amount of time coming back from the abyss of defeat regaining our selfconfidence it was as if we had to begin all over again the holocaust purged us in a way of many of the worst elements we had allowed to run our society like the contents of noahs ark we stepped ashore on mount ararat prepared to begin a new society and we did just that we overcame runaway inflation we directed the growth of our industry through miti and allowed picked sections to enjoy the most high speed growth known in the world he looked at nicholas and smiled we were even successful at turning the slogan made in japan from a derogation into a status symbol none of this was an accident none of it was luck our karma is great and we continue to thrive though we sometimes experience growing pains he poured more sake slopping some onto the lacquer but do you know the one thing we still cannot tolerate linnearsan it is the knowledge that even in times of an oil glut there is what amounts to a caravan of tankers arriving and departing japan day and night dotting the pacific in an endless stream the world must feed us in order for us to survive like a mewling infant who cannot make his own food we are stuck on these beautiful islands on rock devoid of all fossil fuels can you understand how galling that is for us linnearsan he nodded sagely but of course you can you are part of us after all i can see that even if others cannot and you know there is truth to the saying that misfortune never lasts a lifetime he sighed heavily but i tell you that sometimes i am not certain his hair hung lankly on his head and his kimono had come partly unwrapped so that nicholas could see a broad section of his hairless chest and the edge of one dark nipple the truth is he said his voice slurring slightly that there are times when i miss my wife oh not akiko no no i was married before mariko was her name beautiful mariko she was very young when we met he smiled again and nicholas could discern a light boyish quality pushing through the years of accumulated sorrow and i well i was a good deal younger too nangisan and i already knew each other he was in miti and i was in business i had several kobun in those days and all were successful in some matters i relied on marikos judgment it was she who had recommended that i buy the ikiru cosmetics company this was in ikiru manufactured face creams and astringents and when i purchased it the japanese cosmetics boom was just beginning its sharp upswing the investment was fantastic in the first year of acquisition alone the keiretsu made back its purchase price and even showed a small profit from ikiru the future looked bright indeed for the second year as part of her familial duty mariko began to use dtirus products herself rationalizing that she certainly could not expect all her friends to use ikirus products if she herself did not because her perfect porcelain skin was her pride she used the face cream and astringent twice a day as she had with her former brands several months later she began complaining of headaches of migraine intensity these would often last several days she would become alarmingly dizzy on and off during that time i took her to a doctor he could find nothing wrong with her and suggested a week at a spa for relaxation dutifully following his advice i packed her off to the peaceful countryside but at the spa mariko became ill with a fever that went well above when another physician was summoned by the worried proprietors he found her heartbeat irregular and far too rapid at their urging he phoned me i went immediately and fetched her in tokyo she was referred to a specialist who after administering a battery of tests informed her that she was having trouble with her gall bladder he prescribed somemedicine but the fevers persisted and now she began to feel that the flesh of her face was sticky beneath the glossy skin so she used the astringent even more religiously after each application of the face cream until one morning she woke up to discover that the skin all over her body was as slick and smooth as that of her face running her hand down her leg it seemed more the appendage of a wax doll than that of a human being more upset than ever she returned to the specialist who subjected her to yet another battery of tests this time he assured her it was her pancreas more medicine was prescribed and dutifully consumed a week later mariko awoke in a sweat she sat up with a start her heart beating like a triphammer she had been dreaming blood in her dreams and now looking down at her pillow she saw a reddish brown stain there automatically she put her palm up to her cheek it came away smeared with blood and some other discharge she could not name hysterical now she called out for me and this time i insisted she be admitted to the hospital she had lost a lot of weight and now she had trouble breathing yet the doctors could detect nothing wrong with her lungs or indeed her respiratory system matter continued to ooze from her pores and mariko had to be restrained lest the incessant itching cause her to lacerate her skin she continued to insist that something was under her skin the matter she exuded was sent to the hospitals lexicological lab for analysis but the technicians were overworked and in any event testing takes time in the interim mariko went on continuous iv unable to eat slowly she slipped away from me submerged in a coma that was as inexplicable to the physicians as were all of her other symptoms she died less than a week later drifting from the twilight of coma from halfdeath to the full measure of sleep without ever having regained consciousness i cannot remember having said goodbye to her or even that i loved her during those long days and even longer nights there was no more food and even the wine was gone empty plates stared at them from the litter of the table it was only some consolation sato said when the toxicological lab finally worked out the problem it seemed that the face cream she had been using contained a paraffinlike polymer similar to one used in the manufacture of enamel paint the astringent dissolved that particular polymer thus allowing it to be absorbed by her bloodstream it had blocked the pores of her skin suffocating her by minute degrees and had affected a number of her internal organs including her gall bladder and pancreas at once thunderstruck and heartsick i immediately took steps to alter the formulas of ikirus products and that done began to list all the ingredients in ikiru products on their containers but it was not until that the japanese ministry of health and welfare acting on the prolonged outcry not only from me but from the thousands who had suffered from the less than fatal kokuhisho black skin syndrome from the inclusion of red a coal tar dye in some creams established the act requiring the listing of all cosmetic ingredients six months after marikos death when i could think clearly again i founded keshohinkogai higaisha no kai the organization of cosmetic victims using profits from ikiru there was pain in nicholas heart at the enormity of what sato had to bear mariko had not been the sole victim of kokuhisho other victims suffering and death could be only slightly less painful to sato and atonement as nicholas knew well was not the same as never having sinned at all sato turned his cup over and placed his palm across it tell me linnearsan have you ever felt anything other than pleasure at being in love his damp head bobbed ah yes buddha knows there is pain and suffering sometimes when there are arguments when animosity lingers perhaps for a day or so but that is a temporary thing surely it fades like the snow each winter and when the sun shines the blossoms open up again i am speaking of something entirely different now his head was weaving sunk down as it was onto his broad shoulders experience means nothing in this realm have you ever felt imprisoned by your love linnearsan as if you love despite yourself rather than because you wish to no no you must do you see his hand came away and nicholas could see that the tiny porcelain cup that had lain beneath was now gone as if some cruel heart had cast a spell over you in the gloaming at the end of the day lew croaker sat slumped in the car that had taken them up the east coast of florida traffic rushed by him the procession of crimson taillights like searching eyes alix had just gone to the bathroom in one of the highway cafeterias he felt the vibrations of the road as if they had become a part of him just behind him was the savannah river up ahead stretched georgia then south carolina north carolina and so on as i snaked its way northeast they had not eaten since jacksonville there was no point in stopping in small towns along the way leaving footprints for anyone to follow big cities had a habit of swallowing new arrivals and transients no one paid attention alix had wanted him to slow down as soon as they had crossed the florida border but croaker had kept his foot on the accelerator she thought he was being stubborn but he didnt want to tell her what he had found in the red monsters ford sedan it was a phonix cipher transmitter receiver that he had read about the sight of it had sent chills down his spine he did not think that anyone raphael tomkin would hire would know what to do with a phonix let alone have one in his car the phonix was a relatively new instrument that automatically turned the spoken word into a preset cipher it was the code alone that was broadcast between units so that rapid transmission was virtually indecipherable to an eavesdropper now alone in the gathering georgia night with the endless miles of dazed flight still thrumming through him croaker wondered again where his obsession with angela didions murder was taking him he had forsaken his job his friends and a woman he was just beginning to know and fall in love with his entire existence had been turned inside out upside down and for what vengeance against raphael tomkin for despite the gathering evidence croaker was still convinced that the industrialist had murdered angela didion how and why still had to be determined but he had his key now alix logan was the sole witness and against all probabilities she was still alive and again he asked himself why with a shiver he went over it again by all rights she should be deader than a doornail now he saw her emerging from the lit doorway and gunned the engine she was alive and being kept that way by a brace of very deadly creatures why and why in one place surely they could have moved her anywhere who were they protecting her from croaker but croaker was dead drowned and crushed beyond recognition when his car went off the road in key west who had instigated that tomkin with a start croaker remembered matty the mouth he had been the fly on the wall who had delivered alix logans name and address to him for a usurious price to be sure but what the hell he had come through hadnt he stay here croaker said to alix as he sprinted toward the cafeteria inside he dug out some change and made a longdistance call a woman answered at first she professed to never having heard of matty the mouth croaker did some firstclass persuasion matty was out the voice didnt know where didnt know when hed be back since he got back from aruba mattyd gone low profile croaker said he understood it was the same with him he had no number to leave with her and under the circumstances wouldntve left one if he had said hed call back lets go he said as he slid behind the wheel and nosed the car out into traffic im tired alix said golden girl beside him she curled into a ball it was like having a dream come to life sitting at his elbow lithe blond beautiful croaker had only seen women like this from afar this close he had expected her to turn to garbage at any minute when she hadnt he was startled it wasnt that he lusted after her precisely as the blue monster had although he had to admit there was an element of sexuality about how he felt rather there was this protectiveness thing having her safe and with him made him feel warm and somehow more alive he did not want to take her to bed but as a father will with his daughter when she comes of age he longed to see her nakedness to caress her with his eyes it was as if the presence of her nude in front of him that acquiescence of vulnerability would increase his feelings fulfill them even but this night his thoughts were not of the golden girl lying like a cat curled on the seat against his hip rather his thoughts retraced the moment when he had first seen the phonix and had broken out into a cold sweat the ultimate purpose of a japanese drunk such as this one was reciprocity while it was true that the freedom the japanese found in drunkenness allowed them to unburden their spirit that could not be accomplished alone a mutual unburdening a clasping of warm hands was what really mattered nicholas knew that sato was waiting this was a crucial moment between them much would depend on what nicholas next said if he lied now for whatever reason not trusting sato being just one of them there could never be anything between them despite what sato said before about their being friends those were just words and the japanese did not take much stock in words what mattered to them most what they truly revered above all else was action because actions never lied for better or for worse nicholas suspected he and sato had to trust each other now they were in deep water with nothing but an abyss below them if there was no trust between them then their enemies had already won i think satosan that in some ways we are the same perhaps that is the reason why nangisan dislikes me perhaps he has already sensed this bond when i was a young man young and foolish the two men grinned hugely at each other i met a woman she was old beyond her years certainly beyond my years but then my er studies precluded my early initiation into certain basic worldly matters sato both fists against his rather flushed cheeks was rapt he was obviously enjoying himself immensely she possessed a power i could not explain i still cant though i think i understand it better but it was as you have so eloquently said it was as if some cruel heart had cast a spell over me i was powerless before her she was a purely sexual animal satosan i still cannot fully believe that such a creature could exist and yet i must confess that it was precisely this quality which drew me to her you can see that she could not possibly be a happy person how could she if she were not making love there was a nothingness for her oh not the void you and i know that there is power in the void and an essential kind of peace that causes a completeness of the spirit but yukios was diminished when we were not at sexual play i did not think on this part of her at all until one day in april we were walking through jindaiji i favored that place above all others in tokyo because my father had always taken me there rather than ueno i suppose he liked it better because it was a botanical park the bonbori were hung on the trees though the time of the someiyoshino had already passed it was late into hanami the third of the traditional days when the cherry blossoms fall we had meant to go the day before when the petals were at their height but yukio had felt ill and we had stayed in watching old movies on tv we walked through the winding pathways of jindaiji on that third day and it felt to me as if we were high on the slopes of mount yoshino with one hundred thousand cherry trees whispering in the wind about us i had never before wept at hanami though certainly my mother had many times and once i had seen tears in my fathers eyes that time as well it had been on the third day and i had wondered why he might be so moved since it was obvious to me that the blossoms had been more beautiful the day before now i wept understanding what it was my father had seen that as a child i had not though indeed the sakura were past their peak as they fell this day one knew that there was no tomorrow that this was the last leavetaking and their beauty seemed enhanced deepened even by this knowledge the ineffable sadness inherent in the moment was palpable and for the first time i found myself understanding in a purely visceral way the mystique known as the nobility of failure which we as japanese revere so highly for i saw that the sorrow of the moment caused the effort to be truly heroic nicholas paused for a moment he had become as rapt as sato at the return of those longago memories he was transported by the opportunity to unburden himself then something odd happened i turned and looked at yukio her beautiful head was raised toward the pinkwhite cloud of the descending blossoms i could clearly see the line of her long neck the hollow between the collarbones two pale sakura clung to her silk blouse as if they belonged to her and i saw that somehow they were the same these last most precious of the cherry petals and yukio that she possessed that same quality that made them so special it was not a nothingness that possessed her when she was not making love but rather a terrible aching unassuageable sadness that went beyond anything i had encountered and all these years later i find myself wondering whether that was why i loved her cherished her above all others because somehow i knew that given time i was the only one who could remove that sadness from her you speak of her in the past only my friend she died in the winter of drowned in the straits of shimonoseki ah sato murmured so young how sad but she is with the heikй the kami of that doomed clan will care for her he turned his gaze downward wiped at the remnants of spilled sake on the lacquer with the hem of his kimono sleeve satos large frame seemed as hulking and hunched as a brown hokkaido bears there was an unbreachable gulf between them but at the same time they were closer now than many men ever got in their lives for they were bound by a common sadness that drew them together like blood brothers twined as much by what had been left unspoken as by what had been said linnearsan when he spoke again his voice was soft a hint of the paternal tinged it did it ever occur to you that perhaps you would no longer have loved her had she lost that ineffable sadness that indeed she herself might not have survived in this world without it perhaps it will help when next you think of her but nicholas was not thinking of that he knew that the next logical step in this unburdening process was to tell sato of akikos uncanny twinness to yukio indeed he tried several times to get out the words but nothing came it was as if his throat had become paralyzed a shadow passed across the open doorway to the room and nicholas saw kotens bulk for a moment just checking up on his boss nicholas thought see that i havent strangled him yet carved an ancient chinese character into his cheek he shuddered inwardly returning fully to the present for a blessed time they had both dwelled in a world free of revenge and bizarre murder across from him sato lurched to his feet come my friend he beckoned with a hand and stumbling across the tatami fumbled open a fusuma at the far end of the room the night breeze stole in following him nicholas found himself a step down on a smooth pebble path that seemed luminous in the moonlight around him shivered dark peonies releasing the scent of roses clumps of iris and hollyhock farther away he made out the shape of chrysanthemums beside the bole of the boxwood tree sato stood in the center of his garden his chest expanding as he breathed in the fresh air the storm had scoured away the last of the pollution at least for the several hours left before dawn low in the distance beyond the boxwood the sky was pink and yellow tattooed with the pigment of shinjukus neon life is good linnearsan satos eyes glowed reflected in a combination of cool moonlight and the warmer light streaming out to them through the open fusuma it is a rich and varied tapestry and i do not want to prematurely leave it his eyes blinked heavily in the manner of the drunk you are a magician linnearsan you have come into our lives most fortuitously one learns one cannot turn away from karma eh he hugged himself tell me linnearsan are you a student of history my father the colonel was nicholas replied and he taught me to be as well then surely you remember the emperor godaigo who in the early fourteenth century sought to break away from the hojo regime soon it became clear to him that the only way to do this was to utterly destroy the eastern savages as he called them yet he had no clear plan and he himself was no military commander he did not know what to do until one night he dreamt of standing near the boughs of a great spreading pine tree more ancient than any he had ever seen before there were three ministers of state sitting beneath the boughs each facing a different direction on the south side of the tree was a pile of mats it was the seat of the highest rank two children appeared before godaigo and told him that nowhere in the land would his safety be assured for long yet they bade him sit beneath the tree for a time in the seat of state when the emperor awoke he perceived that the bodhisattvas nikko and gakko were attempting to give him a message through the dream it occurred to him that if he put the character for south next to the one for tree it created camphor tree therefore he called to his master of discipline and asked if there were any master warriors close by with the surname of kusunoki camphor tree the priest replied that the only warrior kusunoki that he knew of dwelled in the province of kawachi in the west his name was masashigi kusunoki who could trace his ancestral line back to minister lord tachibana no moroe nicholas said the emperor summoned him and kusunoki came at once he became godaigos tactical commander and his staunchest supporter he led the losing side in the battle of minato river in approximately where kobe is today at the conclusion of the terrible sevenhour battle he left the field and committed seppuku inside a neighboring farmhouse the nobility of failure eh my friend sato sat down on a round stone seat with no back but it is incidents such as these men such as kusunoki that make up the warp that is the tapestry of our history sato leaned forward as a bit of wind stirred the folds of his kimono linnearsan i dreamt last night of the camphorwood tree the bodhisattvas were not present but two figures shrouded in shadow were there nonetheless can you tell me the meaning of this dream my friend these are indeed evil times satosan nicholas said carefully sato was giving him the opening he needed but was there a catch he reviewed the situation once more before continuing we and i include myself because with this merger i have become a part of the keiretsu family and therefore partly responsible for its survival and prosperity are beset from within and without sato nodded yes the wielder of the wushing and those who would try to wrest the secret of the tpram chip away from you nicholas waited a beat not quite in fact there are just as serious breaches which are right now threatening our merger and the continued stability of the keiretsu noting that nicholas had not said your keiretsu sato said then you must possess knowledge picked up on your brief trip back to america yes nicholas nodded to put it simply satosan there is a muhonnin a traitor within the keiretsu sato went very still his eyes were steely they had lost the unfocused glaze from the sake so and which of your competitors does this muhonnin work for none nicholas said rather the traitor is in the employ of one of your er competitors the kgb for once nicholas could see a distinct reaction play itself across that broad japanese countenance sato lost all color in his face his hands began to shake so uncontrollably that he was obliged to lace his fingers together the russians his voice was a whisper but what emotion it contained yes i see the russians would love to get their hands on a tpram prototype or then again nicholas said watching the older man closely it could be something else entirely theyre after sato shrugged his shoulders such as nicholas had his undivided attention kusunoki was a loyalist as am i his emperor asked a great deal of him yet he did it unhesitatingly nicholas was beginning his bargaining he was not about to release his last bit of information without obtaining the guarantees he needed the wushing is a matter of life and death and as you have said satosan life is good i too have no wish to see you leave it prematurely he turned and opened the scarred wooden case he had brought with him opening the three latches he produced the daikatana his great longs word forged almost two hundred years ago it was thirty inches long when sato saw what was inside his eyes opened wide moving from the black lacquer scabbard to nicholas face silently then he slipped off his perch to kneel on the stones before nicholas he bowed so low mat his forehead touched the ground nicholas returned the honored gesture said my father named this blade isshogai for life it is as you know the soul of the samurai carefully nicholas picked up the sheathed blade and placed it between them my kami resides here satosan he did not have to tell the older man why he had brought the daikatana back to japan with him it was not for show but to use it and while the wushing is life and death this merger between our kobun is no less important for the future i beg you to the merger the merger sato exploded i am sick to death of thinking about the merger you have my word that when nangisan returns from hong kong the merger will be immediately consummated according to the agreement already outlined for a moment nicholas was so stunned that he forgot what he was about to say next he had been prepared for debate not capitulation then it is settled between us nicholas found that his mouth was dry by deed as well as by word sato unhesitatingly held out his right hand nicholas did the same with his left and using his free hand tied a length of cord around their wrists thus bound together they put the palms of their free hands over the sword nicholas unbound them in a moment sato said some moments ago you were about to tell me what other than the sphynx tpram this kgb traitor would be after or was it merely a ploy with no documentation to back it up the kgb involvement is real enough nicholas said i have firsthand information that cannot be disputed what do they want then sato said a bit sharply tenchi at that moment they both heard movement from inside the house and turning their heads saw akiko haloed by the inner room light step down onto the smooth pebbles of the garden in which they knelt returning from her mission in yoshino to fulfill her last promise to masashigi kusunoki akiko felt the thrill of fear race through her like a shock of freezing water she had been caught totally unaware no one had seen fit to tell her that nicholas linnear was returning so quickly and now she cursed koten for not having the common courtesy to tell her that sato was entertaining a guest akiko sato jumped up like a puppy seeking its masters lap i did not expect you back until tomorrow afternoon auntie was feeling poorly she said by rote there was no point in my staying longer you remember linnearsan you met at the wedding akiko lowered her eyes as she advanced across the shining moonlit pebbles they were so white against the darkness of her shadow as she passed over them of course i am so sorry about the passing of tomkinsan please accept my condolences for the longest time it seemed as if she did nothing but stare into his shadowed face she barely paid attention to satos fussing as to drinks and something to eat for her after her long and tiring journey it occurred to her that her husband wanted to be rid of her she wondered what it was the two men had been discussing when she had broken in on them to satos ire she sat down on the stone perch he had used earlier in the evening she wore a brocaded traveling kimono with flights of white herons crossing its dark blue background japanese invariably wore their best clothes while traveling she held the bone handle of a ricepaper janomegasa with its point down against the pebbles sato was doing all the talking but it was as if an aura surrounded her and nicholas as if they were the only two people left on earth and inside the overlapping field of their powerful wa something was happening something akiko could never have anticipated she felt giddy lighter than air all hara seemed to have left her she could not ground herself and without that centering she was utterly powerless she felt the first painful flutterings of panic take wing inside her and decided that she must do something immediately to forestall this loss of the void what was happening to her the more she stared into that face she had come to know so well to hate with an almost inhuman passion the greater her sense of helplessness became she was spinning out of control why what was he doing to her dizzily she downed the hot sake sato had brought her heard herself ask for another in a thin strangled voice she could barely recognize this too she tumbled down her throat almost choking on it yet she went on watching him tracing each contour of his head and face as if she were touching him physically she felt as if she were being embraced and she felt her thighs tremble her throat constrict she felt a tingling at the back of her neck as if she were being caressed there and the fine hairs were raised like the whiskers of an animal she closed her eyes in an effort to steady herself but found instead that she was compelled to see him again her eyes snapped open he was still there sato was still prattling on about buddha only knew what years raced before her opened eyes like veils parting before a freshening wind years of laborious training obsessive dedication a heart filled with burned love and from those bitter ashes a thirst for revenge that smoldered and fanned by hate had burst into full flame vengeance will be mine how often during the painful years of growing up had that one phrase given her the courage to close her eyes and sleep so that she could live another day without that phrase to hold to her like a blanket on a frosty night she might never have survived unto this day to become aware of this moment an arrow piercing her heart dear amida she cried silently now she began to tremble in earnest with the knowledge of what nicholas linnear was engendering in her wildly her mind sought this avenue and that in order to avoid what she already suspected was an inescapable truth oh buddha she thought i want him i want him so much i cant see straight tokyo autumn autumn ikan lived within the pale green and caramel walls of fuyajo the castle that knows no night had been her home ever since she was eight years old that year so long ago now had been a time of ill omens and poor crops throughout the countryside bowbacked farmers had no money and little hope of making it through to the end of the year it is said in japan that hard times are the best friend of tradition for it is during these periods that the people fall back most heavily on the ways of their ancestors and so it was with ikans family that year her fathers crops were no better than those of his neighbors which was to say no good at all it was as if the earth refused to release its nutriments that year the first ikan suspected something serious was amiss was when she returned from the fields with a handful of reeds and saw her mother weeping the next morning ikan was driven from the farm in a dusty backfiring truck that smelled of cabbage and tomatoes a small bag filled with the pitifully tiny pile of her possessions the savior of her family destined for the precincts of the yoshiwara like many young girls throughout the ages before her ikan was to be sold into prostitution by her family in order to retrieve them from the indignity of bankruptcy yet unlike the western view the japanese view of prostitution was filled with nobility mixed with an odd poignancy as he did with many other institutions the shogun ieyasu tokugawa created the legitimate need for baishun the selling of as it is known in japan spring because he was obsessed with his own power the only force able to tame the multiple feuds of the regional daimyo that had kept feudal japan in a constant state of civil war for years before his ascendancy he required that each daimyo make a pilgrimage to edo now tokyo every other year along with his samurai where they would stay for a year this sankinkotaiseido served two purposes first it cut into the daimyos solidification of his own power in his native ryochi and second the long often arduous trip helped deplete his coffers of accumulated wealth the daimyo and the wealthier samurai were able to avail themselves of the services of their mistresses but the poorer samurai were forced to turn to prostitutes for as leyasu himself said prostitution was needed in order to negate the possibility of adultery in a year after the shoguns death a feudal lord in edo petitioned the tokugawa government to allow him to create a sanctioned area within the city for baishun he found a desolate field filled with reeds hence the name yoshiwara in the succeeding years a different character was substituted for reedy and the yoshiwara became known as the happy field the original redlight sector was destroyed in a fire and in was rebuilt in the asakusa district of edo where it remained until april of in ikan subsequently was taught by her sensei the government declared that all rice grown was subject to confiscation by the imperial samurai in its place farmers were told they had to subsist on millet stricken farmers were forced to put their wives to work sewing or weaving and to send their young children to toil in the city yet even this was not enough and so often one female child was selected to be sold to the brothels in order for her family to survive there was no loss of face in this on the contrary these young girls were looked upon with a mixture of great respect for submitting to their gin of filial piety and pity for it was generally known that while a prostitute might on a very rare occasion become the mistress of a wealthy samurai once she crossed the moat that surrounded the yoshiwara she surrendered all hope of becoming a wife and creating her own home so there was always an air of mystery tinged by the purity of sadness that drew men into the arms of geisha in the same way it drew them to ueno each spring to view the cherry blossoms dean began life at fuyajo the most ancient of such establishments in the yoshiwara as a kamuro a kind of apprentice who fetched for the oiran the higherlevel prostitutes when she was not busy cleaning and polishing in this capacity she was constantly busy yet she always found time to observe and to learn from her observations often imitating the motions and delicate swirls of the oiran early in the mornings before exhausted she fell on her futon when she was twelve ikan took a strenuous examination and passed on to the level of shinzo where she began her courses in the study of baishun these included singing the difficult art of haiku ikebana chanoyu dancing a study of literature and of course lovemaking her training took five years at the end of which she was required to take another exam this was the crucial one for if she failed to pass it she would return to the level of kamuro and spend the rest of her days at fuyajo doing nothing more than taking out the garbage she had no serious trouble and at the age of seventeen rose to the exalted station of oiran for four years she plied her difficult and complex trade diligently and well her open inquisitive mind allowing her to absorb the best from the more experienced women around her her innate sensitivity to creating all forms of pleasure in a man intellectual esthetic as well as physical creating an everexpanding world that she alone could explore and on the day of her birth twentyone years after she was born ikan became tayu the loftiest of the three stations of oiran never in the history of the castle that knows no night had there been a tayu of such tender years and a celebration was thrown in her honor and it was in that most festive of atmospheres when the sake was flowing freely and the samisen spangled webs of music in the steamy air that ikan first encountered hiroshi shimada he was a man of quiet intensity not a handsome man by any but the broadest of standards yet possessed of a strength of spirit that she found most attractive for his part shimada had singled her out almost at once his eyes fell upon her stately alabaster beauty and his heart turned to water he felt a great cry rising up from within him and for a moment he had to put a hand out to grasp the knurled wooden stairpost for support when his knees stopped shaking he began to breathe again his head felt light as if he had been drinking sake long into the night there was an odd metallic taste in his mouth as if he had bitten down into a piece of tinfoil it never occurred to him that he might be falling in love one did not fall in love with a geisha one came to her for comfort relaxation and a night of total enjoyment and yet at the moment he first saw ikan her awesome physicality struck from his consciousness any thought he might have held of any other woman his wife included there was an aura about ikan that was undeniable even the other oiran whispered of it in clandestinely envious tones among themselves for she had achieved what all members of the floating world aspire to that ineffable merging of the ethereal and the animal that unfailingly set men under its almost magic spell an aphrodisiac for all the senses all the pleasures for her clients loved her just as strongly when she was reading to them from genji monogatari when she arranged day lilies just for them or wrote a haiku in their honor as when she bedded them thus shimada found himself drawn to ikans side his gaze lovingly caressing each elegant fold of her glittering kimono the three translucent tortoiseshell kanzashi angled through the gleaming black pile of her hair the kushi the simple traditional comb of tsuge wood at the back of her head and when he spoke his first word to her through cracked lips merely the gesture of her turning her head in his direction sent flutters of desire through his chest there was of course no chance for them to be alone at the party and in any event a proper assignation had not been arranged beforehand as was the strict policy at fuyajo but the next week when shimada could take time out from his busy schedule he returned to the yoshiwara on the threshold of the pale green and caramel structure he paused trembling rain pattered on the conical shelter of his amagasa and he looked up watching it drip off the eaves just beneath the curved tiles of the roof as the samurai in olden days had done he had disguised himself somewhat before setting out on his trek to the redlight district it was not that he was ashamed of coming here or that he wished to hide his presence at fuyajo from his wife on the contrary it was to her that the castle that knows no night sent the bills for his sojourns of pleasure rather it was the unsettling political and economic climate within the bureaucracy that caused him to act with caution as viceminister of mci he had many enemies and he had no wish to present his illwishers with fodder for his political demise a chill gust of wind bowled down the street making him shiver and pull his long capelike raincoat closer about him that scap hound colonel linnear was already sniffing around for incriminating bones and though shimada was quite certain he had buried his deeply and well he nevertheless refused to relax his vigilance for he knew that in the wake of the wars end he could not rely on his prime minister for refuge if the truth were to come out in fact knowing yoshida he would be among the first to deliver shimada up as a sacrificial lamb to the gaijin war crimes tribunal war the thought made shimada shiver always it came back to the war how he wished now that japan had taken another course in retrospect he saw his own rabid ideas of expansionism his close ties to those warmongers in the zaibatsu as tantamount to slashing open his own belly and yet there was no dignity in the association his hands were soiled by the clandestine work he had done for his friends in the zaibatsu both before the war and during it shimada had been a key figure within the ministry of munitions and had been saved from the war crimes tribunal by a mixture of his own cunning in hiding his past and the decision of his superior to break apart the ministry at the last moment turning it into the ministry of commerce and industry before scap had set itself up and begun its own purge shimada looked down at his hands his palms were slick with sweat he took a deep breath calming himself he resolved to stop by the shinto shrine on his way home and petition the gods and kami for the gift of confidence and the blessing of forgetfulness if not for the gaijin linnear all would be peaceful he knew abruptly the door to fuyajo opened and cool illumination flooded over him like a spotlight shimada hurried inside at first he wanted nothing more from her than for her to serve him tea the complex ritual of chanoyu was as soothing as a massage or a soak in a steaming tub watching ikan perform the ceremony just for him caused all the problems fears and doubts that snapped at his heels in the world beyond the happy field to dissolve like tears in a pool in their stead he found himself filling up with a delicious contentment a clarity of mind he had thought he could never achieve and because every movement ikan made no matter how minute or trivial turning a teacup or touching a wisp of her hair was the epitome of grace and fluidity he found his enjoyment multiplying geometrically as he unraveled each layer of meaning from what she did or spoke for her words were never trivial or mundane she made no small talk rather each question she asked or each answer she gave to his questions were both fascinating and eloquent in the world beyond fuyajo memories transformed shimada like a growing cancer into a man old beyond his years but here ikan had the ability to banish that haunted quality of his life and like a serpent shedding its skin he was reborn in her presence as he was enchanted by her awesome ethereal prowess for her part ikan never saw the man that shimada was in the outside world for with her he had no need of scheming he had no need of fiercely keeping his enemies at bay she saw rather the man he might have been in another time another place he was gentle with her and warmhearted and his obvious delight at all she did warmed her she recognized in him a deep need to be nurtured and loved and since it was her belief that all men were at their core nothing more than infants she felt no need to probe too deeply into the source of this need but it must be said that another factor entered into this selfdeceit ikan knew there was something special about shimada when on his second visit he brought her a set of old traditional kanzashi made of tsuge wood in a similar design as her kushi now she had a complete set for her hair her manner was calm her smile sweet small and proper her eyes properly downcast her murmur of thanks soft and brief as he presented her with the magnificent gift but inside her heart was pounding and she could feel her blood singing through her veins this was a completely new feeling for her and she was inwardly bewildered but later than night when she lay entwined with him on the lushly fabricked futon as their sweat commingled as she felt the doublebeat pulse of his heart close to hers as he gently entered her after the careful and delightful hours of sensuous preparations ikan knew what that feeling was she was in love the decision to have the baby was entirely hers it was her privilege as tayu at least that was the custom established years ago by those who ran fuyajo the decision had been an entirely pragmatic one like champion racehorses who are put out to stud it was felt that many of the tayus unique qualities were innate needing only the proper training to emerge and be enhanced but this usually happened somewhat further on in a tayus career because there was fear of markings or disfigurement from the rigors of childbirth as well as the months of enforced idleness and thus lost revenue to think of however ikan was of such stellar quality that the greed of those who ran fuyajo eventually overcame their initial doubts ikan was certain that she wanted to bear shimadas child already he insisted that she see no one else and paid for the privilege of her exclusivity through the nose he did not care although what his wife thought of the increasing level of the bills was quite another matter but shimadas wife was someone ikan never thought of why should she that woman was part of another world a world in which ikan could never participate what use such thoughts too she was acutely aware of how she affected shimada and she suspected that after the birth of their son for she had no doubts that she would bear him a son his elation would be so extraordinary that he would grant her any wish and she had only one to become his mistress he would have to buy her freedom of course but he could well afford the price it never occurred to ikan that she would bear a daughter who would bind her to fuyajo forever and who would herself be bound to the castle that knows no night and yet it was a female child to which she gave birth a squalling hairless infant with nothing between its legs but a slit for three days ikan wept on her futon her dreams of a glorious future destroyed in an instant she saw no one spoke to no one ignored all the notes sent up to her by a worried shimada these last she burned instantly as if by handling them she could be contaminated during this time she did not sleep rather she lay curled on her left side her face to the wall her shame was overwhelming and her face burned with it at first her hatred for her daughter was overwhelming so powerful that she shuddered to its bitter taste in her mouth and this too caused her to decline all food wanting perversely to subsist wholly on her hate but by the middle of the second day she found that she could no longer sustain such a harsh and cruel emotion it went against all her training and after all the child was so helpless and alone she was weeping again hot bitter tears that swept down her cheeks depleting her strength for she began to understand as one begins to see a red swollen sun appear after a long debilitating storm that her hatred was for herself a terrible despair began to engulf her and with that awful feeling rose the shame a black baleful raven in her tortured mind oh how her love had warped her how her own selfish desires had driven her to this shameful reality for in her egotism she had been confident of bearing a male child had she not spent two hours every day at the shinto shrine two blocks away propitiating the gods seeking their aid and had thrust to the dark back recesses of her mind the consequences of bearing a daughter for all female offspring of tayu became the property of fuyajo to train when they came of age to replace their mothers as new oiran and if the gods favored them eventually tayu she spent all of the third day contemplating this taking a little food now when it was offered to her but still wanting to see no one and at the end of that time after she had lit incense and prayed to the amida buddha for guidance she asked to see her baby there is no name as yet for this little one lady the old woman who cooked for them and took care of them when they were ill said as she transferred the tiny bundle into ikans trembling arms it is bad luck she added needlessly dean dropped her gaze to the tiny face of her daughter still wrinkly and red skinned reiko one of the kamuro who failed her examination has been nursing her the old woman said softly as she gazed up into the troubled face of her lady this is a hungry little one the old woman giggled hoping to break through the oppressive atmosphere she had sensed when she entered this chamber dean nodded absently it did not really matter who nursed the baby she would not be allowed to i have lit many sticks of incense the old woman went on i have done what i could to protect this innocent from bad karma but lady forgive me she must have a name ikan heard but it was impossible to say what was going on in her mind she felt enwrapped by her guilt and now face to face with the tiny creature she had borne knowing what kind of a life her unthinking actions had condemned it to she felt sick at heart her pale lips opened and she whispered yes old one a name i will give you a name there was a sighing in the room as if the autumn wind outside had somehow crept through a crack in the window sash and now swirled around them deans eyes were filled with tears so that the tiny face blurred and became indistinct her whisper could barely be heard call her akiko she was an exceptionally healthy child strong and fully as robust as a boy she was up and walking early as if somehow even at that early age she suspected she would need to rely on her own resources to survive and for all that ikan grew to love the child she showed very little overt emotion rather she left the supervision of the infant to the old cook and the other girls all of whom were enchanted with the new baby she hung back as if she were afraid of the child especially during those times when those who ran fuyajo congregated in the infants room leaving their gifts near the sleeping form often shimada would come to the castle that knew no night and as before he would spend the long languorous nights with dean but the one request she continually denied him was to look at his daughter to hold her to speak his first words to her so that she would know that he was her father she took exceptional pleasure in keeping akiko from him outwardly she would be attentive responsive to his every wish often without his having to utter a word of direction that was a courtesans greatest skill after all but all the while she would be gloating inwardly at the unique kind of pain she brought him and like sadist and masochist this became a kind of bond between them that somehow brought them closer together or at least afforded them a more intimate understanding of the essence of one another akiko recalled meeting her father only once and that was on an unseasonably warm spring day when she was midway between her third and fourth birthdays she had been playing with yumi the old cook and had returned to her mothers room as she always did at this time of the day but instead of her mother waiting for her to comb her hair she found a man in a chocolate brown suit he had slightly stooped shoulders thick features a grayish mustache no thicker than a pencil thick tufty eyebrows like clouds he smiled when he saw her and she saw his slightly yellowed teeth akikochan he said bowing she returned the gesture she was close enough to smell the halo of cigarette smoke that seemed to envelop him she wrinkled up her nose and rubbed it with her finger ive brought you a present akikochan he bent toward her and held out his hand nestled within his palm was an exquisitely carved netsuke of a horse with its head down its forelegs raised as if set for flight or to ward off some unseen advance it was made of tulipwood akiko stared at it but made no move to take it its for you dont you want it yes she whispered so he reached out and taking her hand deposited the netsuke into her small fist curling up the fingers around its cool girth now this is just from me to you our secret she nodded domo arigato he smiled down at her and took her other hand now we have the entire afternoon to ourselves it was the time of hanami and he took her by train to a small park on the outskirts of the city with gently sloping contours dressed with lines of old cherry trees she remembered the smell of the train an agglomeration of luncheon foods and could still feel after all those years the tightly packed claustrophobic sensation of being pressed in with so many people shimada held her hand tightly but still she was uncomfortable and began to weep silent tears until he picked her up in his arms and held her rocking gently with the motion of the train against his chest in the park they stopped in front of a cart selling sweet jellied tofu and he purchased small paper cones filled with the confection for both of them the sky was clear and sparkling so hard seeming that it reminded akiko of a piece of green glass she had found by the seashore its edges rounded and smoothed by the constant immersion at the verge of the tidal pull shimada pointed upward showing her the orange and green box kite with a fierce tigers head akiko laughed as it dipped and swooped in the wind she ate her tofu hungrily and shimada wiped her cheeks with his snowwhite handkerchief it felt very soft against her skin but most of all she remembered the cherry blossoms it was so quiet here that akiko thought she could hear the drift of the light pink petals through the clear air and they seemed suspended in time ail motion attenuated all the world attuned to their drift lifting up her head she laughed out loud with delight skipping away from shimada and back again grabbing onto his trousers leg pulling him forward wanting in her own inarticulate way for him to dance too she never saw shimada again and it was a long time before she understood why during her time with him she had no inkling that he was her father certainly he had never even broached the subject but yet when she thought back on it through the prism of time she saw that she had known immediately that he was unlike all the other men she had met in her short life and would meet in the passing years shimada was special just as that memory piercing the veil of time with such pristine clarity was special what she had not been able to understand was why he had taken his life not more than twentyfour hours after he had watched her smiling as she capered through the last hours of the cherry blossoms she thought she could never forgive him for that and then upon learning the terrible truth thought she could never forgive herself as for ikan she was never the same after shimadas death like a blossom at hanami she had reached her peak of beauty and having slid past it could never go back an intense form of melancholia stole over her like a shroud etching lines into a face that had been filled with perfection she drank copious quantities of sake often passing out insensate in the middle of an assignation as if the mere state of consciousness was too much for her those who ran fuyajo were understandably perturbed and then as ikans state declined rapidly filled with anger she had many more years left in her and they felt after she had passed beyond the barriers where sexual union was paramount she could still fulfill her potential as the houses finest sensei training the younger women but such was not to be in the spring of when akiko was thirteen ikan could not be roused from her futon fright flew through fuyajo like an evil kami turning the girls nervous and shorttempered all conversation dropped to a whisper as the doctor arrived and took the long slow climb up to her room akiko was kept with a group of the girls and they forcibly restrained her from ascending there was no life left within ikans glorious husk the old physician shook his head from side to side and clucked his tongue against the roof of his mouth he sat on the edge of her futon and stared down upon the pale face and thought that he had never seen such magnificent human beauty in his life by her side he found an empty bottle of sake and a small vial this too was empty save for a light dusting of white powder along its curved inside the doctor dipped his little finger and touched the white tip to his tongue his head nodded again his tongue continued its clucking he heard movement behind him and he quickly pocketed the vial perhaps there was something for him to do here he thought for when those who ran fuyajo asked him the cause of death he lifted his shoulders let them fall resignedly and told them she had died of heart failure which in a sense was true he felt no compunction about lying to them or even falsifying the death certificate in fact he felt ennobled by the deed he had read the papers concerning viceminister shimadas shocking suicide and in its aftermath the unraveling of the evidence against him this woman had endured enough he thought let her death be a peaceful natural one a death that will cause no further ripples of evil talk those who ran fuyajo wasted no time in explaining to akiko what had happened and at last it dawned on her what the composition of her life would be from this moment on until the day she died perhaps in precisely the same manner that her mother had expired and that knowledge was totally unacceptable to her that night she gathered up her belongings much as ikan had done the night before her departure from her familys farm deep in the countryside and several items of her mothers that she loved and did not want to leave to the scavengers at fuyajo stuffing these too into a small battered bamboo suitcase she stole out of the building in the dead of night the height of the varied activities served to shield her from discovery soon she was crossing the narrow street and turning a corner hurried down a dark alley moving quickly and surely until she had left the yoshiwara far behind her she never once looked back and she never returned they came after her of course they had every right to she was an enormously valuable commodity and they had a great many years invested in her there were no yakuza involved in running fuyajo and the boryokudan held no piece of it still those who had founded the castle that knows no night were hard businessmen and their descendants to whom the running of the brothel now devolved were much like their ancestors and though the occupation forces had begun to disband the yoshiwara and fuyajo was thus forced to move they did not take kindly to akikos defection in fact they wished to put an end to it as swiftly as possible to that end they dispatched two thugs to return her to her proper home and if that were not practical to exact from her the highest possible penalty for her treacherous deed the first akiko suspected that she was being followed was when she saw two shadows moving at once one slightly ahead of her and one perhaps two blocks behind her she would never have seen the shadows at all for they were absolutely silent had it not been for the cat four tiny kittens had been suckling at the cats distended teats when akiko stumbled into her territory and startled she had arisen and arching her back hissed at the intruding shape baring her teeth and glaring carnelian eyes into the wan light akiko gasped her heart pounding painfully in her chest and she skidded to one side her head and shoulders moving away from the angered cat even as her feet and legs were still sliding along the pavement toward it thats when she saw the twin movements and her eyes went wide she pressed herself against a cool wall looked to front and back now there was nothing silence the absence of traffic was eerie and not even a koban a police call box around she was still in the asakusa district filled with the old traditional ways tokyos last remnants from ages gone by the buildings here were small and low of wood and oiled paper as they once had been throughout japan no steel and glass towers as in other sectors of the city akiko her heart still in her throat sidled away from the bristling cat certain now that the long arm of fuyajo was stalking her but there was no way they were going to bring her back to that hated place she decided she would die first and not before she hurt someone badly a red rage beat through her like a tide an accumulated sizzling she was still only dimly aware of quickly she knelt down and as she did so a dark flicker came to the corner of her eye a swift blur like a racing cloud obscuring for a moment the face of the moon unhesitatingly she opened her bamboo suitcase and took out the pistol it was fairly small a pearlhandled caliber well oiled and in good operating condition it was fully loaded she had doublechecked that before she had removed it from its hiding place beneath her mothers futon why dean would have such an implement in her possession akiko could not fathom but the day she had discovered it more than a year ago she had had enough sense not to tell anyone not even her mother what she had found and tonight she had not wanted to leave it behind now she knew why they were closing in akiko swiftly closed her suitcase and stood calmly the pistol hidden behind her curiously she felt no fear she had been born into the night and darkness held none of the primitive terror it did for many people she was at home in its furtive light and rather enjoyed the anonymity its shadows afforded her night at fuyajo would find her rising from her futon to roam the many rooms at will honing her instincts and her handeye coordination stealthily climbing back stairs and crawling through vent passageways in order to observe the myriad couples one came lithe and slender he blended into the darkness so that he was almost upon her before she became aware of his presence she turned her head startled despite herself giving a strangled little cry angry with herself for not sensing him sooner what do you want her voice was a husky whisper little more than the night wind which rustled the leaves of the cypress above her head sound too could betray him so he remained silent and now unbidden akiko felt fear flutter her heart her eyes were open wide the pupils dilated to their maximum as she peered into the blackness in order to pick out some tiny gleam that would make of him something more than a wraith i know youre there she said softly willing her voice not to tremble if you come near me ill kill you but despite her bravado she began to tremble she felt chilled to the bone and everything around her seemed strange and forbidding on the verge of tears akiko made a decision she knew that the longer she waited the more certain it was that she would lose her nerve already tremors coursed through her tightly coiled muscles wracking her like ague it was now or never and she would just have to trust her eyes she had not seen him move from the patch of shadow so close to her so that must mean that he had not visions of ghosts and shapechanging creatures were for children i am afraid she told herself in the calmest inner voice she could summon up but hell kill me if i let him or at the very least drag me back to fuyajo which would certainly be worse than death she was just bringing the pistol out from behind her when she felt the presence to her left and thought the second one she felt pressure on her larynx and of course reflexively tried to breathe when she could not panic rose within her and she cried out bringing the pistol up in a blur her forefinger already squeezing squeezing anything to get oxygen into her straining lungs the roar of the discharge caused her to scream in rage and fear concussion struck her eardrums like a physical blow and she staggered already retching from the intense stench of the cordite and the heat searing and instantaneous that had brushed by her like the hand of death light blinded her and she fetched up against a wooden wall sliding down it as her legs gave out something was in her eyes and she put her free hand up wiping at her forehead her hair was matted and wet filled with grit that rolled slickly through her fingers blood black on the night its coppery stench filling her nostrils making her gag all over again making her wipe again and again at her face crying now in great gulping sobs a shadow looming over her and instinctively she brought the pistol upward almost all control gone now so that the barrel weaved back and forth she tried to get at the trigger again but her finger wouldnt respond to her commands and then the gun was gone from her weakened grasp and she was broken sobbing still whispering through it dont take me back i dont want to go back lifted bodily off the street a breeze against her hot streaked cheek for an instant and then a creak a slam the noises of a bolt being shot home and the warmth of a house stealing over her a place unfamiliar but only one fact surfacing it was not fuyajo her head went down a face swam into view like the man in the moon pockmarked and huge descending through a network of sere branches as spiky as a stags antlers akiko cried out tried to throw her arms across her face to protect it she had the sensation of falling and shooting forward at the same time spinning like a leaf in the wind toppling from the safety of what the man in the moon lifted away and it was like a weight being pulled off her chest is this better the voice was soft and lilting a country accent i cant breathe her voice was like a rodents squeak and she realized that her mouth and throat were so parched that she could not summon up saliva in time you will be able to do everything the man in the moon smiled or so it seemed to akiko she still had trouble seeing as if she were peering through a windowpane streaked with running rainwater you look blurry she whispered through cracked lips when you stop crying the gentle voice told her you will no longer have that problem she slept for a time after that sliding down into a vertiginous whirlpool a troubled slumber in which her fear brought to the surface would not allow her to slip deeply into unconsciousness rather she fought in a series of battlescarred dreams on the cusp of sleep her eyelids fluttering constantly her limbs thrashing and twitching like a dogs when at last she awoke it was near night again and it was as if no time had passed though in reality more than eighteen hours had elapsed from her ordeal in the street where did you get this weapon it was the first question he asked her she knew the answer of course but the effort required in opening her mouth and translating thought into speech seemed beyond her he put an enormous lopsided wooden bowl of larmen dosanko in front of her and sitting crosslegged on the tatami beside the futon on which she lay laced his fingers beneath his chin and contemplated her silently akiko rose to her haunches the scent of the steaming noodle soup was overpowering blotting out all other sensation or thought only when she was finished eating did she notice the sleek metal and pearl of the pistol lying by his side it was this he was referring to when he had asked her the question she looked back at the rumpled futon its fabric was light but in spots deep rustcolored stains had turned the beautiful cotton leathery and stiff the sight set akikos heart to hammering again and something must have showed in her eyes because the man sitting across from her smiled and said you have nothing to fear from me kodomogunjin akiko put her fingertips up to the right side of her forehead near her hairline a cessation of hunger had made her aware of a painful pulsing there she felt the bulge of a bandage why do you call me little soldier perhaps he said softly leaning forward to push the pistol across the tatami toward her for the same reason you carry this weapon he cocked his head it was no wonder she had first thought of him as the man in the moon for his face was as round as a full moons with pockmarked cheeks and a flat chinese nose he had a long wispy mustache drooping down around the corners of his mouth but little other hair overall his face seemed as soft as raw dough he bowed now i am sun hsiung how may i call you you have already named me havent you kodomogunjin he nodded as you wish she leaned forward and took the pistol off the tatami it seemed quite heavy to her now she did not look at him when she spoke next what happened last night sun hsiung put his forearms on the points of his knees you shot the man who was holding you you discharged one bullet which entered his skull through the socket of his left eye it splintered the ridge of bone just above and lodged in his brain hes dead quite she swallowed hard and the other one he was coming for you when i arrived on the scene he was going to kill you i believe i had to stop him akiko opened her mouth to ask another question but immediately thought better of it they may send more sun hsiung shrugged perhaps she put her finger around the trigger and hefted the pistol ill shoot them too sun hsiung considered her for a moment he had not asked her who it was who might send more thugs after her or even why these had been dispatched that would be most unwise i think her look was defiant why it saved my life he rose leaving her there in silence to learn her first lesson it was not the pistol that had saved akikos life but the advent of sun hsiungs intervention when she had worked that through sufficiently so that she could see the ramifications she unwound from her sitting position and went to him he was outside in back tending to his tiny exquisite bonsai garden akiko stood at the edge of it a giant blundering into a minute world i want to learn she said softly the ricepaper lantern swung from its black iron hook its light falling across sun hsiungs shoulders as he toiled he did not turn around or make any motion that he had heard her or indeed was aware of her presence at all i want you to teach me what you know she looked down at the weapon she was still holding in her hand there was an odd kind of security in its heft and warmth in her hand and it was something of her mothers slowly carefully she made her way through the tiny sculptured trees to where he was working on hands and knees please she whispered kneeling down as best she could in the narrow stone path and bending far forward in a kowtow she extended the firearm in her open palm take this as payment it is all i have sun hsiung set his gleaming tools aside and slowly turned around he bowed to her and lifting the pistol from her open hand murmured domo arigato kodomogunjin she had almost killed herself that night as well as the thug that was why her forehead was bandaged why when she finally removed it there was a reddish weal that gradually metamorphosed into a small white furrow of puckered skin the bullet that eventually killed her assailant had nicked her as well too close she was glad she had given the pistol to sun hsiung the beginnings of her training surprised her days commenced at five in the morning pupil and sensei began their exercises in the dark building wind the cardiovascular system in the pale light of dawn they were into tai chi chuan slow languorous movements that increased a sense of balance and limb coordination not unlike ballet from midmorning to midafternoon sun hsiung left her alone in the house to read selections of certain books he would provide for her akiko was an excellent reader with superb retention and a large vocabulary she was diligent in her studies at times even rapt when sun hsiung returned from his daily errands abroad they would retire to the bonsai garden and the variables of the weather each with a ricepaper pad a small sable brush and a pot of ink at first akiko was nonplussed her heart was burning with fury and often she shook from an excess of released adrenaline her head buzzed with swirling emotions and she would call up those memories from that night all fear leeched from her instead a cold calculating hatred growing wildly like a weed in an untended garden so she balked at the idea of painting she could put up with the rather gentle tai chi the long hours of studious repose but this this was just too much the first time she was handed the pad and brush she said as much sun hsiung looked down at her and said kodomogunjin i fear that i have named you too well you must learn peace before you can be taught the ways of war but painting her tone made the word synonymous with garbage collection silently sun hsiung considered whether he had made a mistake he wondered if this wild young thing could be taught the most difficult lesson of patience he shrugged inwardly her own karma would determine that it was his karma to teach her after that before we can start on the protective aspects of your training your heart must be purged of hatred he said to do that you will require a conduit i place the leech on the inside of your arm and blood is drained from you but they will not wait long to come after me again you are no longer alone in the world kodomogunjin he said placing the pot of ink beside her her eyes swung away from him and contemplated the vast snowy expanse of the paper lying on her lap but i dont know how to paint she said in a plaintive voice sun hsiung smiled down at her then let us begin with the fundamentals over the succeeding months painting became her favorite part of the day and she came to cherish the sound of her senseis key in the lock at precisely the same time each day lifting her head up she would look out the window to see the sun striking the bamboo wall of the tiny garden and recognize the light for the finest of the day eagerly then she would close her books and gather up their painting materials meeting him at the fusuma out to the garden her mind quivering in anticipation of the new lesson too at first the advent of afternoon rain would depress her for that certain light would not be present and they would forsake their painting and turn to other lessons but later on when she became more adept she would look forward to the rain for then they would sit just inside the open fusuma where it was warm and dry and begin to use the diffuse light the oblique intermittent lines of the rain as the basis for their paintings how could akiko have ever thought that she would be so elated by foul weather when others were slowly wending their way home through the slicked streets bent over beneath their amagasa against the rain and wind shivering and damp she would be busy dipping her brush in ink putting it to paper and so gradually that she was not at first aware of it the hatred did indeed fade from her heart flowing out through the creative conduit sun hsiung intuited was right for her her paintings softened flowing more easily over the paper gaining a kind of organic power that gathered in her lines and spaces impressing even the sensei who had spent so long at this pursuit thus there came a time when sun hsiung judged it right for her to begin the more difficult aspects of her training on a day when the snow had fallen heavily a sere blanket covering the greens and browns of japan he kept her up all night beginning the long process he did this with full knowledge of what this might do to her and to him for in truth he had never before had a female pupil and had he been of another temperament he would have felt a certain trepidation in fact he recognized that on some level it was odd that he had accepted her sex so readily his native china was so different in its concept of women sun hsiung knew that his father found intelligent women who showed any kind of talent troublesome sooner or later he would tell his son they will open their mouths and talk back to you and then what use is their talent in japan as well as in china a woman was expected to follow the dictates of her father until she was married then she was required to obey her husband and in the event of his death her eldest son the worst sin a wife could commit was to fail to bear children in that event according to certain ancient codes she was expected to leave in some cases she could choose to accept her husbands siring a child via a mistress or failing that adopting a child of one of her husbands relatives a wifes adultery caused her to be immediately divorced but a man could have as many mistresses as he chose in fact a law enacted in in japan established kinship between parent and child to be in the first degree and kinship between a man and his mistress to be in the second degree although this was rescinded ten years later the custom of taking mistresses continued unabated when the emperor mutsuhito ended his reign in it was rumored that the son who succeeded him as the emperor taisho had been borne not by mutsuhitos wife but by his mistress taishos reign was brief in he was succeeded by his own son hirohito in recalling all this history sun hsiung again reminded himself what a renegade he had been and still was he had fled mainland china many years before because of the oppressive nature of the society the fact was that he did not find subservience in anyone attractive particularly in a mate he had consciously or no dedicated his life to the pursuit of strength and he differed markedly from the feudal japanese samurai who fed on strength by day and by night wished only for the obeisance of gentle women he looked at his little soldiers working body now in the coppery lamplight a thin sheen of sweat turning her pale skin glowing and burnished he asked himself whether he would look upon a male body with the same set of conflicting emotions which seemed to plague him would he be so acutely aware of the play of her back muscles the rippling of her thighs as she stretched and twisted in the tai chi she performed it with such startling skill and agility it was difficult for sun hsiung to believe she had been at it for six months rather than six years his eyes stole down to the workings of her buttocks as she lifted one leg and spun and he was profoundly ashamed of the instincts which rose within him and yet he could not help them he was a man who had always dealt with his desire in precisely the same way he did all his other requirements when he felt the need for it he entered the new karyukai district and slaked his thirst yet those times had all been of his own choosing and his iron control had dictated the nights he would perform those erotic exercises to the delight of not only himself but his partner as well now for the first time since he was a young untrained lad his desire rose unbidden a deceitful serpent twining about him enlacing him within its languorous coils angry he steeled his mind against the onslaught but his mind had nothing to do with it he was a man after all who was in touch with the totality of his being and he knew full well that only modern man chose to live completely within his mind and it was sun hsiungs body that was speaking now and he knew deep down where his essence resided that he must respond to its calling in some manner that morning while his pupil still slept off the nights lessons he stole from the house and availed himself of the pleasures of the willow world but now though he felt the pleasure rippling through him at what was being done to him though he shot his seed twice within the span of time he was with the tayu these were only surface sensations and while the storm raged in the depths there was only motionlessness and silence he could not say that he had not enjoyed his stay within the precincts of the happy field he had felt the clouds and rain but yet his spirit was roaming restless though his member was for the moment satiated still the core of him remained unfulfilled sun hsiung wondered at this all the way back to his house and turning the key in the lock and entering once again the sanctum of his domain he at once understood the nature of his agitation for as he went through the silent rooms he came upon his pupils sleeping quarters the fusuma was partly open as it always was and sun hsiung paused to check on her she was still asleep her face turned to the side toward him she was on her back one leg stuck straight out the other bent sharply at the knee so that she had the electric appearance of leaping even in repose and like the clean edge of a gleaming knife sun hsiung felt the flick of his emotions flutter his heart as his eyes drank in the sight of her what mysterious essence could a woman of her young years possess to affect him thusly it was a question that he could not possibly answer for it belied the use of years and experience the commodities with which he was most familiar and as sun hsiung knelt just outside the threshold to her room enrapt by the serenity of her wa he felt a pulsing in the nether reaches of his lower belly a kind of tidal pull that the awabi divers spoke of where in a lake none should be so too now with sun hsiung and he craned his neck staring hard at her sleeping face to make certain for it seemed to him that something was reaching out across the brief gulf that separated them and was massaging him internally it was not that he thought of this feat as impossible he knew too much of jaho to rule such a thing out but from such a one as his little soldier why she had had no training and yet he could not dispute what was occurring inside his body he looked around the day was almost done long shadows stretched through the house like animate pets and the light was fast failing night was coming on so near him akiko stirred both legs extending arms raised over her head as she too stretched like some great cat her eyelids fluttered open and her irises were upon him as if in her slumber through the membrane of her lids she had been watching him all the time come here she murmured in a totally undisciplined voice and when sun hsiung made no move said no word her lids pulsed and he felt the kneading in his lower belly increase radiating downward to the base of his member all at once his testicles began to tingle and it was as if a silken hand had grasped him about the base of his penis he began to stiffen and grow no a voice inside his head shouted but he had no recourse as if he were a dreamer immersed in water he swam lazily across the threshold of her room felt her arms come up and like oiled serpents slide across his muscled shoulders the long fingers caressed the nape of his neck and the base of his skull sun hsiung could no longer feel his hands or his feet he was aware only of an inordinate pleasure pooling in his loins magically majestically she parted his kimono her left hand tracing circles across his chest belly nipples her eyes still heavy lidded with sleep and perhaps something more stared up at him their pupils dilated so completely there seemed no iris at all her lips had softened becoming sensuous parted slightly so that he could scent her sweet breath there was a part of him that did not want to see her naked but another side the one she had provoked would not be denied and slowly softly he pulled apart her thin cotton kimono so that inch by inch her glowing flesh was revealed to him at first the sections he had already glimpsed areas in their tempting proximity to the more intimate parts that had already begun to inflame him then when all of those had been revealed to him he held his breath as first one breast then the other slid out from beneath the concealing shadows of the kimono they swelled into the light capped with nipples and areola as dark as the encroaching night if fujisan was the most perfect mountain in the world then surely these must be the most perfect breasts a tiny cry escaped sun hsiungs lips as he bent his head in worship and akiko closing her eyes in rapture as she felt his lips encompassing first one nipple then the other stroked the back of his neck in the expert manner she had observed for so long in fuyajo sensing now with her own newly learned knowledge the proper nerve bundles and running her fingertips down their buried lengths how to keep them burning with electric energy or to calm them into a euphoric stupor and yet it was not enough she was impatient and her right hand snaked between their bodies seeking to grasp in physical substance what she had reached out for during the last rising moments of sleep when something inside her had become aware of a presence beside her then sensing that it was sun hsiung and lastly picking up the intensely sexual emanations emerging from him thus she had reached out for him while still in the beta level of twilight cerebration and on the cusp of consciousness she had moved her wa across the infinity of space between them now she had in her hand what her mind had touched and she cupped his heavy scrotum in her palm while her fingers gently probed the soft skin just beneath midway to his anus sun hsiung who had been involved with the pristine symmetry of her breasts abruptly felt the exquisite invasion of her fingers and thought he was going to perish with joy she was moving to the core of him accelerating his pulse rate he felt inordinately heavy and ponderous a human put into a sun bears shaggy body his mind no longer worked correctly all the crystal passageways that had led him so successfully through the labyrinth of logic had crumbled he felt caught up in a power beyond his imagining involuntarily he groaned as her astounding ministrations accelerated his passion further with a low growl he finished stripping them both of the robes swinging her around on the futon he put his calloused palms flat on her thighs moving them slowly inward along the incredibly soft flesh there with infinite slowness he parted the stems of her legs and gazed lovingly down at the moist petals of the flower thus revealed his nostrils quivered at her musky scent he felt his erection leap in her hands the crown expanding straining for release it was as if she possessed a natural aphrodisiac that turned the air heady and thick as honey her soft high mount was within reach of his lips never had he hungered for another with such profound desire every fiber of his being was concentrated on these next few moments her hair just beginning to come in grew only along the center strip of her pubic mound leaving the sides as smooth and bare as a small childs gully this only increased his ardor since he had before him both woman and girl without another moment of hesitation he pulled apart her shining lips with his thumbs when akiko felt the heated stab of his tongue in her core she arched up with her hips crying out in inarticulate delight she felt as if the sun had detached itself from the heavens and had been pressed up between her thighs too she found that if she worked on him at the same time her pleasure was increased tenfold she moved upward slightly on him craning her long neck until she could press her lips to the skin just behind his scrotum she felt the heavy trembling of his member as she did so and she began a low vibratory growl in her throat pressing more directly against him in order to pass on the sensation above her his nose and tongue gliding along her slippery surfaces sun hsiungs eyes almost crossed with the intensity of the ecstasy he was experiencing it was as if he had not just recently been drained twice by the tayu in the koryukai it was as if he had not had sex in many years his tongue laved her from crown to stem and back again as if he could not get enough of her taste soon he felt the quivering of her powerful muscles high up along the insides of her thighs and he concentrated feverishly on the core of her now expanded and pulsing in delicious surrender he heard her gurgle and gasp beneath him felt the electric swipe of her pointed nipples against his belly as she worked busily on him he wanted to give her her first real orgasm but he did not know how long he could hold out she had not directly touched the crown of his erection yet he knew that soon he must jet his seed even with no direct touch part of him marveled at this feat as he continued with his erotic stimulation and now she was in spasm the ridged muscles rippling just below the surface of her skin her thighs pulled wide apart and her buttocks as hard as rocks he could feel the ultimate vibrations beginning inside her and then unexpectedly he felt her insinuate herself out from beneath him felt himself turned on his back watched wideeyed as she mounted him inserting just the tip of him inside her he gasped and involuntarily his hips lept upward off the futon as the liquid electric first contact threatened to overwhelm him her hips moved back and forth stimulating the crown of his penis first the top then the underside back and forth in a rhythm that took his breath away then she was sliding down farther and he had to put his hands on her waist her own over his pushing helping himself through the natural barrier of tissue and then like the burst of a cannons fusillade he was through his shaft sliding all the way up her he felt her puffedout lips against his scrotum and then as she reached around her fingers caressing him there urging him onward she crouched over him sliding her breasts and nipples hard against his flesh her small white teeth bared slightly as she worked her nips against him building an irreversible tension within him sun hsiung gritted his teeth the cords at the sides of his neck standing out like steel cables he grunted continuously all the way inside her now but his eyes were open staring up at her face wanting to wait for her and the trembling came to her again this time in great wracking pulses shivering her hot sheath around him it was the last straw and he felthimself melting all his energy all his reserves of strength flowing down the ribboning muscles of his thighs to his loins pooling like quicksilver in his scrotum as her cupping palm urged him onward as her sheath fluttered around his expanding penis he felt a great series of throbs an unutterably delicious warmth overpowering him combined with an enormous desire to penetrate her farther than he had any other woman then she was crying out as her hips blurred as she worked herself on him rubbing and stroking her sweet breath with a hint of his own musk in his face her damp unbound hair a tender veil across his eyes a heavy undulation across her abdomen and belly her muscles fluting in spasm and he felt silken fingers grasping him stroking him anew with such tenderness that miraculously he felt a return of his waning orgasm gathering once again in him as if he were a female regenerating another form of pleasure entirely one of which he had been ignorant all his life something inside her that same thing that had reached out to him in slumber and caressed him lifted him up with her so that they experienced her orgasm together united in a kind of spirit dance sun hsiung had previously only experienced at the very height of the highest level of combat when lives hung in the balance and death hung by his side shaken like a leaf in a tempest sun hsiung allowed the full force of her marvelous power to blast through him he rose with her on wings of ecstasy and his renewed erection quivering shot again within her dripping sex all that he could muster years later the memory of that evening remained fresh inside him and so it was that she came before him now fully a woman and said to him bowing as she did so sensei i wish to learn one more thing sun hsiungs belly contracted and his heart went cold for he had known of this moment almost from the first and dreading its coming he had erased its specter from his mind until now for now was the time and what is that he inquired his voice faint in the flickering lamplight which served to illuminate one small patch of the surrounding darkness akikos forehead was against the tatami her shining black hair was pulled tightly back from her exquisite face tied in a long ponytail a chinese fashion unknown to her but pleasing to sun hsiung that lay curled across one shoulder and her upper back she wore a kimono of crimsons golds and flame oranges a match for the autumnal foliage beyond their front door i wish to learn how to disguise my wa her voice was calm and free of excess emotion she had proved to be an enormously gifted pupil ever since i discovered the talent in me i have longed to know this why is that kodomogunjin because i feel somehow incomplete without it sun hsiung nodded once i understand he thought about saying more there is no need to warn me sensei she said catching the essence of his emanation it is more dangerous than even you can suspect their eyes locked akiko submitted entirely to his will now her whole being attuned to his words sensing their import beyond the fact that nothing could dissuade her from her karma i am not afraid of death or dying she said softly corporeal death is far from the worst eventuality abruptly the room seemed webbed with bioluminescent strands the building of their spirits pulsing with vitality making of this place a power spot these forces you seek are beyond even our understanding they are so elemental that they may only be controlled partially and in those other moments they may change you they may corrupt all that you have learned here within the echoing silence that engulfed them both akiko bowed her head i understand i will guard myself carefully against just such corruption then this is where you must go sun hsiung said sliding a folded slip of paper across the tatami to her the next morning as she finished her packing he took her painting pad and brush from her you cannot take these where you are going little soldier and for the first time akiko had a sense of the depth of the darkness into which she was descending this saddens me sensei those were the last words sun hsiung heard her utter they drank one last cup of tea together moments later she hefted her bags and bowing formally left him it was the first time that she had performed chanoyu for him the pupil serving the sensei as new sensei for a long time after that sun hsiung sat before his tiny cold teacup the dark green leaves clinging tenaciously to its bottom like a vine refusing to die then slowly and carefully as if he were made of delicate crystal he crawled across the tatami to where her painting pad with its black finger of the sable brush lay he reached out and picked up the pad drawing it toward him as his eyes studied the calming confluence of forces within the bonsai garden he heard the plaintive call of a plover through the partially open fusuma he was quite unaware of the coolness in the room and with the pad pressed tightly against his chest he began a slow rocking on his haunches at last one salty tear slid down his weathered cheek to drop silently on the edge of the pad immediately absorbed by the sheets of paper gone forever book four fachi hong kong washington tokyo maui raleigh hokkaido spring present i am afraid mr nangi that the news is a good deal worse than either you or i first imagined tanzan nangi sat sipping his pale gold jasmine tea staring out the set of windows that faced the botanical gardens on hong kong islands midlevels just beyond was victoria gap high up on the peak he was high up above the central district in the allasia banks executive offices a glass and steel tower in the middle of des voeux road central go on nangi said placidly as he tapped the ash from his cigarette into a crystal ashtray on the desk in front of him allan su glanced briefly down at the oversized buff folder he was clutching although it was apparent that he hardly needed to do that he wiped at his upper lip then ran his fingers through his hair he was a small compact chinese of shanghainese extraction who was normally calm and clear headed now his obvious anxiety filled the room like a strange perfume he began to pace back and forth over the antique bhokara to give you an example we have threequarters interest in the wan fa housing project in the new territories in tai po kau the first mortgage has already been refinanced once and is on the verge of being so again that would necessitate a second mortgage which we cannot afford we need an occupancy rate of seventysix percent to break even at this point the units should be renting for sixteen thousand hong kong dollars a month were lucky if we get five thousand now since the announcement by the communists no one wants to live in such an unstable area that could be overrun at any moment allan su stopped his pacing long enough to slam the folder down on the polished teak desktop on a pile of other such folders the list is almost endless there was true disgust in his voice anthony chin could not have done us more damage were he secretly working for one of our competitors was he nangi inquired in this city who knows sus shoulders lifted and fell but i doubt it several of the other banks were caught the same as us though none to such a degree he shook his head no i think mr chin was merely greedy and greed mr nangi is the worst enemy of good judgment nangi bent forward and poured more tea then he settled himself more comfortably in allan sus highbacked leather chair and contemplated the terraced network of white and pale ochre high rises that sprouted from the slopes of victoria peak a forest of concrete tell me mr su when was your last severe earthquake momentarily nonplussed by the question allan su blinked his eyes behind his wirerimmed spectacles why its been almost two years now i believe uhm nangis attention was still firmly on the thicket of skyscrapers a bad one inopportunely placed would do many of those in dont you agree theyd all fall apart like a jumble of childrens building blocks many lives would be lost many family lines would abruptly come to a halt many fortunes would be destroyed he turned his head to face allan su fully and who else do you work for mr su i pardon me mr nangi but i do not understand what you are talking about oh come come nangi said thinking that all chinese were alike theres no room here for coyness everyone in hong kong holds down more than one job its far more profitable he paused to pour tea into a second cup now take anthony chin for instance he was not only the president of the allasia bank of hong kong but he was also a lieutenant in the red chinese army he pushed the cup across the desk impossible allan su had ceased his pacing ive known him for years our wives shopped together once a week then you must have known of all this fiscal impropriety nangi said blandly indicating the pile of folders filled with their damning evidence the investigation team he had hired had done their work well i knew nothing of the sort su proclaimed hotly nangi nodded his head just as you knew nothing of his true affiliation allan su stared at nangi for a moment trying to force down his instinctive hatred of the japanese and see this man for what he really was he knew that that clarity was all that could save him now then it follows that you also suspect me of being a communist oh you may rest easy on that score nangi said he smiled come mr su will you drink with me his heart hammering in his throat allan su did as he was bade i should no longer be surprised at the outcome of events here he gulped at his tea which had already grown cold then used the cup to gesture out the expanse of sparkling glass toward the slender fingers of the midlevels take those high rises for instance it would take far less than a major earthquake to send them tumbling more than likely theyve been built with a gross insufficiency of supporting iron rods in the concrete the favorite trick is to set a half dozen in the poured cement which by the way will have twice as much sand in it as it should while the building inspector watches then as he moves on those same six rods will be removed from the setting cement and used in the next section the inspector is looking at after hes gone theyll be removed once more and used at the next building site its a game really because the inspector has already been paid off by the builders not to search through the site too thoroughly nangi frowned thats nothing to play a game over lives and millions of dollars su shrugged if i can buy a twelveyearold virgin down in wan chai why then should i not be able to buy a building inspector as well the difference there nangi said dryly is that the twelveyearold virgin youve paid your hardearned dollars for could probably screw rings around your wife then my lust and thats a form of greed has blinded rny good judgment nangi stood up abruptly how much is the royal albert bank paying you a month mr su allan su almost dropped his porcelain cup but not quite he heard the yammering of his pulse in his ears like the screaming of all his ancestors and he thought great buddha what will happen to my family now no work and ruined in the midst of the colonys worst recession in three decades nangi was seeming to slip in and out of focus and with the exaggerated slowness and care of a habitual drunk he placed the empty cup on the desk top next to the pile of buff folders come come nangi said its a simple enough question but the answers a difficult one i beg to i do not nangi interrupted him leaning forward with his rigid arms on the teak wish to hear explanations mr su require someone here whom i can trust completely either you can do it or you cant nangi held his eyes you know what will happen to you mr su if you cant do it allan su shuddered saying nothing he stood very straight though his knees felt weak of course he could walk out of here now tendering his resignation but where would that get him had he any assurance that the royal albert would hire him the job market had narrowed considerably in many fields banking high among them since the damnable communists made their accursed announcement he thought about his wife his six children aunt and two uncles one widowed and how many cousins on his wifes side whose welfare he was responsible for of course he could always try to brazen it out but he suspected that would be an unwise course for him to take the result being the same as if he walked out nangi was hard and he was japanese but if he were fair he could make a satisfactory employer su decided to tell the truth the royal albert has been paying me ten thousand hong kong dollars a month to keep them informed of all allasia transactions he held his breath he could hear his accelerated heartbeat like surf in his inner ear i see nangi tapped the eraser end of a new pencil on sus desk top then he looked up as of now mr su your salary is doubled great gods of the west wind su thought a thin line of sweat broke out at his hairline in six months well review the matter and based on the banks overall position it will be reevaluated upward or downward the same will hold true a year from now his eyes were searching sus face if at that time the bank has performed up to a schedule of profit i shall work up for you before i depart you will receive a ten percent stock equity in allasia pursuant to your signing a lifetime contract nangi saw with satisfaction that all color had drained from sus broad face i will immediately sever all ties with the royal albert sus voice was thin and reedy his eyes seemed glassy youll do nothing of the kind nangi said youll take your ten thousand a month and within sixty days ask for a raise god knows youve earned it sus face clouded sir i dont think i understand relief was flooding through him like a spring torrent muddying his thoughts from today on mr su you will provide the royal albert with precisely the information i feed you at the same time you will relay to me just what is going on at our competition i will want to know every major and minor deal on their boards i will want to know their capital outlay their spread and their investment goals for one year five years and ten years he cocked his head are you getting all this mr su su had recovered sufficiently to smile oh gods of all four quarters he prayed silently tonight i will offer a feast to each and every one of you im with you nangisan he said in his best idiomatic english this is sounding more and more like a task i will enjoy immensely then concern flooded his face again but i cannot be expected to achieve these great gains with the depletion of capital that currently plagues us the bank is on the verge of insolvency if we were to have to redeem on any kind of an extended run and even if the run does not materialize may all the gods hear and make it so it would take more than twelve months for us to recover sufficiently from these setbacks so that i can make even a semblance of headway two items will help us here nangi said unruffled first we will have additional capital available to us within seventytwo hours may i ask the source of this capital su interjected just be prepared to invest part of it wisely for a maximum return with a minimum of time factor su was already shaking his head big risk in that too much for us in our current position not with the information youre going to be getting from the royal albert nangi was smiling now as he rose ride their back mr su as the temple dog rides the great dragon let them take all the risks do all the work while you make our money grow for us risk free he nodded his head congratulations this is a big day for you shall we go and celebrate tanya was manning the arrts terminal when the cipher came in that was luck pure and simple but if someone else had been on which had been far more likely he or she would have merely starred the unreadable entry and she would have been flagged down immediately on her return the spearfish situation as she had somewhat ironically designated it was her baby she was its monitor principally because it was a personal matter of mincks and not business well that was not strictly true spearfish had been business up until perhaps a year ago it should have been terminated then as tanya had argued in fact as far as anyone else in red section or anywhere else in the family was concerned it was terminated only minck and tanya knew otherwise the moment tanya became aware that spearfish had crossed the line it never should have into the personal sector she had come alert one of her jobs unspoken and all the more crucial for that was to protect minck in her judgment he had picked a particularly dangerous time to pull something like this though she knew when personal feelings were allowed to interfere with business there was no good time for it thus she became spearfishs guardian while acknowledging the foolhardiness of the enterprise some things could be kept in cold storage better than others but nothing could be well kept for long out in the open when she knew that minck would not go for the termination she had switched tactics arguing for a closed shop that was out of the question as well he said spearfish could not be penned up then she had gone for the box eight men in two shifts but minck had said spearfish would find that distasteful as well it limited freedom he said tanya had kept her mouth shut knowing that that was precisely the purpose of the box it was normally used on more serious tags but it could work just as well on friendlies such as spearfish finally she did what he had asked her to do in the first place put two men on it but she would not let it go at that she kept in constant touch spearfish was highly volatile and she wanted no mistakes made the only time she laid off was when minck himself went down he thought that even she did not know but she did now she watched the glowing green letters springing up on the terminal screen marching across in dedicated rows when the message had ended she watched the pulsing letters hanging there for a moment before she pushed the decode button the word really came up and she hit a sixdigit key ultimate access sequence now the decoded message wrote itself across the screen now she had one minute no more no less to digest the message if she did not depress the print key by that time to get a hard copy arrts would dissolve the cipher as if it had never existed she went pale as she read the terse message so stunned that she had made no conscious decision whether or not to print before her time ran out and the message disappeared from the screen that did not matter much since it still glowed behind her eyes silently she cursed minck and his personal problems because the cipher had turned spearfish from a potential problem into an active one she depressed the send key composing her reply as she did so when only the date appeared she was reminded that codes were changed weekly and this was the day to get a new one that meant tony theerson she got up and went down two floors the boy wonder had his digs in an otherwise unused corner of the floor his only companions were the jumble of cardboard and wooden crates shipping labels and huge rolls of brown wrapping papers and his cipher machines though minck had theerson working on the soviet alphathree ciphers almost around the clock it was also his devilish little brain that composed the red sections own codes he said they were unbreakable tanya believed him when she came in on him he was sitting up on the army cot he had asked be installed in his work space tanya suspected that the boy wonder had no private life whatsoever he certainly slept in the building enough also because of the time differential between washington and the areas he monitored primarily russia and asia he tended to have odd sleepwake patterns hey he said in his laconic way want some coffee he offered up his bare arm he was dressed in a tshirt with dйpкche mode written on it and a pair of faded blue jeans just slip the needle in this vein doctor tanya laughed as she crossed to the coffee machine and filled two mugs she gave him one had a hard night he sipped at the strong french roast and groaned his eyes closing in ecstasy food of the gods he downed more coffee im having a bitch of a time breaking this new one he meant the alphathree he put the empty cup aside frankly i dont think im going to get it he rose and stretched yawning widely its that time again im afraid tanya said she had hardly touched her coffee preferring tea but she had not wanted to appear unfriendly the boy wonder groaned again you mean another weeks slid by oh god he ran his fingers through his hair i need a shower business first personal hygiene later tanya said putting down her cup im on an open line gotcha theerson poked through a box of floppy disks he pulled one out gave it to her this ones a doozy they all are she said heading for the door good luck he grunted sourly with this monster im gonna need it the last she saw of him he was putting on his walkman headphones as he sat down to work with the boy wonder business came before anything tanya decided to draft a memo to minck suggesting he give theerson some enforced vacation time back at the arrts console two floors up she inserted the floppy theerson had given her and punched the enter button the word file came up and she typed in spearfish she waited for the cycle to complete then entered her reply the machine would automatically use the new cipher arrts having replaced the old code with the new one in the receiver transmit hourly updates will be mobile soon will give backup within thirtysix hours terminate spearfish when situation stabilizes and you are certain of target visibility then she went away to make her report nicholas sat on the backless stone seat in satos garden he had been there for perhaps an hour ever since his hosts had retired he had made a show of going to his room so that they would not be obliged to share his insomnia but he hadnt even bothered to undress merely waited fifteen minutes before returning to the now deserted garden with infinitesimal slowness light came into the garden in a way it was a shame since before only cold moonglow had distinguished shadow and illumination causing the flower scents to dominate now as vision took hold the perfumes seemed to fade nicholas became aware of the presence behind him the moment it crossed the threshold of satos study and stepped down onto the glowing pebbles the predawn atmosphere was aqueous with white mist there was no sound save the waking of the birds he knew that it was akiko without having to turn around or hear her voice their wa had locked hours before and that had been enough to mark her in his mind the system was as primitive as it was sophisticated as akutagawasan had said urban life had bred it out of modern human beings because of this too he knew that she was dangerous he did not know in precisely what way or even if it was to him in particular he knew she was sensei very few individuals would have been able to make that determination from mere visual observation and the imprint of her spirit even other sensei without all of nicholas skills and ability but he was different nicholassan her low voice shivered him and he willed himself to remain calm still his pulse beat hard in his temples and he felt a sudden rush of blood to his head where is your husband snoring on his princely pallet what was in her voice nicholas strained to hear all of the echoes and nuances even those she might not know were present had he found derision there isnt your place beside him it was the petulant comment of a jealous lover and he cursed himself my place she replied as if she heard no overtones is where i choose to be she paused as if uncertain whether to go on do you think that unjapanese of me he shook his head untraditional perhaps but not unjapanese in the ensuing silence she said wont you turn around and face me am i so difficult to look at her words stirred the hair at the base of his neck and he wondered how carefully she had chosen them slowly his heart beating faster than he would have wished he turned toward her he melted inside just the first hint of dawn blushed her face in radiant light she had changed into a pale yellow kimono with ice green and silver thread embroidered in the shape of stands of pine trees a lone golden heron flew at full wing over her left breast her hair was down a gleaming blueblack cascade stretching straight down her back she wore no jewelry whatsoever her nails shone with clear lacquer but were cut short as would befit one of her training he thought he could discern the slightest tremor in her face a fleeting tic along the upper lid of one eye then both were gone and she was in control again was that so hard she breathed into the soft wind mist swirled at her back danced around his shoulders you are beautiful to look at akiko he had not meant to make any such admission immediately he felt as if he had lost a battle she came toward him gliding along the pebble path she seemed to him to be emerging from out of the ending of the night why do i feel as if i have been with you before what she said startled them both it was as if naked they were embracing and sato had walked in on them blood flooded akikos face and her eyes flicked away from his face the tremble was back within her all sense of reality had slipped from nicholas mind lost within the white mist he saw only her yukio rose before him a kami who had been granted a second life then he too reached out for the stability of the void seeking an answer to the unanswerable as if in a dream he rose from the hard stone seat and came toward her until they were but a hands breadth apart he fought with himself to say the words that had been roiling through his consciousness ever since she had slipped the fan from in front of her face they were words he longed to say words that would free him perhaps from his inner torment but which would also certainly make him vulnerable to her what to do the moment was here in japanese society one had very few moments alone with another mans wife this moment would never have come but for akiko what did she want of him was she yukio did she want to hear him call her name if so why was she torturing him so he was assailed by questions which led to riddles which in turn brought him to enigmas it seemed to him now that all his life had been an enigma a fitfully understood succession of events from which he had constantly turned away who are you he said hoarsely i must know her eyes searched his who do you think i am there was no coyness rather he sensed a deeply buried desperation he could put no name to i dont know somehow the distance between them was closing there seemed to be no conscious volition on either of their parts tell me she whispered tell me he could feel her breath on him smell the scent of her feel the heat of her flesh from beneath the silk kimono her eyes were half shut her lips partly open as if some emotion inside her was on a runaway tear yukio her name was torn from his heart like a tattered battle pennant it was irrational that he should utter her name irrational that he should think this was who stood before him yet he said it again yukio yukio seeing her eyes flutter closed as if in thrall felt the melting of her upper body in against his her head coming back the long arch of her neck merging with the image the memory he had carried with him for so many years there was a burning inside him as he reached for her to embrace her or to stop her from falling he did not know all his organs had turned to water and were boiling up there was a fever in his brain there was no control his lips came down over hers and he tasted her essence as he felt the dart of her tongue inside him for the first time in her life akiko was open to the universe nothing in all her long arduous training had caused this ignition inside of her she was so dizzy that she was doubly grateful for his strong arms about her all breath had left her as he had uttered her name and it was her name how was that possible but oh he tasted wonderful and oh how she ached for him her thighs were like water unable to support her she felt a kind of ecstasy at his touch she thought only possible in orgasm what was happening to her swept away still a dark part of her mind yammered to be heard what strange force had invaded her mind what had turned her plans of vengeance inside out what made her feel this way about a hated enemy and why had she lied to him she was not yukio she was akiko and then with the power of his wa surrounding her with her heart beating in her inner ear like thunder with the press of his hard chest against her breasts the answer exploded in her mind with the force of fireworks as akiko she was nothing she had come from nothing and nothing was her future as yukio she was someone here there was more for her than kyomu that which kyoki preached nihility from the moment she had left sun hsiungs loving tutelage she had felt herself to be doshi gatai beyond salvation without any other anchor in her life what else could she expect now abruptly with nicholas linnears appearance yukio had become a reality she was no more idea no more means to an end no more twodimensional schemata she lived the force of nicholas linnears love for her had brought her back from the dead justine saw him on her second day at the hotel the first time was near the pool bar in the shade of the overhang and she thought that she must be mistaken but the second time was at the crescent beach while she was wading out into the jade ocean snorkel and mask in one hand black fins on her feet this time there was no doubt it was rick millar at first she couldnt believe it after all she was six thousand miles from new york on a rambling worldclass resort in the midst of a acre pineapple plantation she was in west maui in one of the most remote areas on the island far from the strip of highrise hotels at kaanipali where most tourists to this paradisical spot stayed she watched transfixed the tide lapping around her waist as he headed into the surf toward her his body was lean and trim with narrow hips and wide shoulders he did not have the wrist and chest development nor the overall muscle definition that nicholas had but then rick was a tennis player not a human killing machine tears erupted through her quivering lids stinging her eyes and she turned away out to sea and the hazy outline of molokai justine youve got some helluva nerve coming here id only heard about the famous tobin temper before everything they said was an understatement to the real thing his voice was deliberately light bantering did you give mary kate back her job she felt the pumping of her heart like a weight of granite hanging inside her it wasnt her job to give back justine he was closer to her than she wanted him to be i told you i had found the better person to fill it she whirled on him her eyes blazing you used me you bastard he remained calm you know the trouble with you is that youre a scared child in a womans body come off it justine i didnt use you any more than id use anyone else its the wrong term mary kate wasnt working out in the adult business world you dont fire an executive at any level until youve hired his or her replacement id be remiss in my duty to the company if id gone about it in any other way but were friends thats incidental but if it means anything to you im sorry that had to enter into it he smiled testing the waters there was nothing sinister in it i assure you id seen some of your freelance work i spoke to several of my executives whod used you over the past year they all thought you were great he smiled again all of them warned me about your temper by the way i see that didnt deter you she wished now that she hadnt been crying when he came up i liked your work too much youve got a singular mind when it comes to advertising concepts thats an invaluable quality he looked away for a moment and his expression gave him the appearance of a little boy anyway i thought i could tame you i saw it as a challenge his eyes swung back id give anything if we could start over from the beginning is that why you followed me he shook his head standing his ground as a large wave made it through the coral reef out at the headland to the crescent bay began to surge toward them not really i found that the office seemed very empty without you when the wave hit it rose the water up to chin level knocking them sideways forcing them together nangi put his ruined legs up on the chaise as he settled back and stared out at the south china sea as it ran up onto the pale yellow beach at sheko he was on the south side of hong kong island nearer to aberdeen than he was to central district the downtown and financial hub of the crown colony sheko was one of the four or five areas within hong kong reserved for the truly wealthy in this teeming city of enormous wealth and abject poverty but things had changed in the year and a half since he had been here for one the beautiful old hotel at repulse bay had been torn down in order to erect another group of highrise houses it was not solely that nangi had spent many a glorious sunspangled afternoon at tea doing business on the expansive colonial porch of that hotel that he mourned its passing it was just as much the thought of the old ways passing the sunny serene days transplanted by the lust for profits that the building boom had created during five or six years of the crown colonys highspeed growth in the middle and late seventies that was what had ultimately brought him here the collapse of that real estate boom and in that light the destruction of the repulse bay hotel was even more bitter now nangi was alone in the tile and stucco villa watching a young nubile chinese girl brave the pollution of the south china sea as she ran down the beach and into the mild surf no one else was about although a pitcher of iced tea and two tall glasses sat on a pebble glasstopped table at nangis left elbow he saw the girls bobbing head in the water she had not bothered to tie up her hair or to wear a cap the dark tail of hair flung down her naked back spreading out in the water like a sea anemone tendrils waving on the tide wushing the words kept intruding on his conscious thoughts and that was a problem three deaths three questions to be answered nangi wondered what connection there could be between the wushing murders and tenchi these days when anything unexplainable occurred he immediately thought of tenchi that was logical enough he knew the russians would stop at nothing to wrest tenchi from japan if they knew what tenchi was as for the americans he could imagine them attempting to sabotage the operation ever since the end of the war america had been dependent upon japan to be its anticommunist watchdog in the east but america wanted japan subservient so that like a willow it would bend to the will of the victorious country and it was true that japan was dependent on america but tenchi would change all that nangi feared that if the americans got wind of the operation they would move as quickly as the soviets to shortcircuit it this could not be allowed for the first time in many decades japan found itself totally alone and oddly enough it was a frightening experience he was becoming increasingly aware that he could no longer cling to his dreams of what japan had once been all that was gone now wiped out by the atomic sunshine and the period of highspeed growth in which he had played such a crucial role he closed his eyes knowing that there were no easy answers in life nothing was so neat in reality as it was in fiction one problem at a time he thought i must surmount the chinese obstacle before i again think about ancient and arcane punishments though he had been alone in the villa when he had arrived he now heard the soft footfalls opening and closing of doors that foretold the commencement of his assignation he reached for the pitcher of iced tea and poured himself a glass it was bracing and delicious just the tonic for this already steamy day nangi did not turn his head as his keen ears picked up anothers approach but remained where he was sipping his drink staring out at the girl now emerging like a water nymph from the rolling south china sea good afternoon mr nangi by mutual agreement they spoke only english here it was foreign to both of them but at least they hated it with an equal passion mr liu nangi nodded his head to no one in particular he heard the creak of the chaise beside him the musical clink of ice against glass and only then turned his head once this mans ancestors must have been purebred manchu for he had the long highdomed skull structure peculiar to them he was tall for an oriental he knew it and used this advantage as an intimidating tool even when he was seated liu was smiling now as he sipped at his drink he put his head back against the chaise and how is the business climate in japan these days mr nangi liu had the habit of beginning topics as if they had been spoken about previously very strong nangi said shortly thinking ill give him nothing to chew on until im ready the forecast is formidable ah the chinese said moving his head then your ah keiretsu is not so much involved in the heavy industries that began your countrys great economic leap forward he put down his sweating glass laced his fingers across his small potbelly it is my understanding that these industries such as steel manufacturing long the very core of your economic progress are in serious financial straits in these days of worldwide recession nangi said nothing for a moment wondering just how well this man was informed he might know the worst of it or again he might be fishing in order to corroborate unconfirmed reports it was essential that nangi answer him without giving anything away there is no problem with our steel kobun he said carefully we have seen nothing but profits from it indeed with that one word liu made it clear that he did not believe nangis statement and what of coal mining textile manufacturing petrochemicals hm this topic is of no interest to me liu turned his high head like a dog on point and yet mr nangi it is of interest to me why you would wish to sell a division of your organization that in your words has only made profits for you we are no longer interested in manufacturing steel perhaps he had said it a shade too quickly but at least now he knew the extent of the chineses knowledge it was formidable and he was even more on his guard now the real problem for japan has i think just begun liu said much as an instructor will inform a pupil your golden age of unlimited global economic expansion has come to an end in years gone by you could export your finished product into foreign markets where they were snapped up immediately over their domestic competition it gave you not only profits of course but an everexpanding level of employment in your own country but now times have changed lius fingers unlaced spread like a starfish and closed down again settling back on his stomach let us take as our example one of your greatest successes automobiles your invasion of the united states domestic auto market has caused a spate of unemployment in that country and not long ago forced one of its giant corporations to the brink of financial dissolution you know as well as i do how slow the americans are to take the initiative he smiled thinly but sooner or later the deepest sleeper must awake and when his strength is as vast as is americas the awakening can be quite rude repeatedly now you have been slapped with import quotas from the us government now you are beginning to understand what it is like to fence in the international arena in order to survive you must export capital and technology building new nissan plants in tennessee instead of in kanda that means less japanese employment less profits your era of free trade has ended despite the truth in what liu was saying nangi detected a strong streak of jealousy in the other mans words wouldnt the chinese love to be in our economic position he thought dryly and then there is yawata liu continued he was referring to japans magnificent yawata steel works the oldest and largest of the countrys coastal mills which began manufacturing in curious i think it is an historic relic of other times yet since your government has shoveled more than three billion dollars into updating and refining yawatas technology and what has it availed them today yawata is in far worse shape than it was after the oil shock of at least then the government could take economizing measures streamlining operations severely rationing fuel consumption all those steps allowed yawatas operations to continue unabated but today those measures are still in effect and because the worldwide market has shrunk so significantly yawatas work force has dropped from sixtyone thousand in to less than twentyfour thousand today three of nippon steels blast furnaces are currently idle and a number of their subsidiary plants have closed down the american steel industry would i think be delighted to return to the seventy percent capacity yawata is currently running at but japan is simply not geared for such reductions and what can you do in america bethlehem can lay off their workers in your country your political and social structure does not allow you to fire your employees liu paused here as if he expected nangi to make some kind of comment when he did not liu seemed slightly put out and his tone when he spoke again was rather more sharp the end result of this little talk he said crisply is that your keiretsu like most others is currently going through an organizational upheaval and that as we both know takes capital with cash flow weakened you have been dipping rather heavily into your reserves we are quite solid solid perhaps liu shrugged but i am doubtful that you have enough reserves now to save the allasia bank if he is going to offer me aid from the other side i shall have to strike him across his head with my stick nangi thought what do the communists want with the allasia bank oh we dont want any part of it liu said conversationally rather we wish a piece of your keiretsu nangi despite having extended all his feelers for clues was thunderstruck oh were willing to pay a high premium for the privilege liu said into the silence privately hating the necessity for observing the niceties of conversation among equals just as if he were not face to face with a barbarian an extremely high premium it is clear that the keiretsu needs to be underwritten we will provide the new infusion of capital im not interested nangi said almost strangling on his hatred for this man and all he stood for please be kind enough to allow me to complete my offer before hastily setting it aside liu forced his lips into the configuration of a smile well he thought what can you expect from the japanese they do not have our long centuries of breeding they merely appropriated from our culture that which they required in order to raise themselves up from the level of the slavering beast but oh buddha they have not come far our offer is this he said you relinquish to us onethird interest in your keiretsu and we will deliver to you divided into six semiyearly payments the sum of five hundred million dollars at first nangi was not at all certain that he had heard correctly but staring into that long manchu face he had no doubts five hundred million dollars his mind immediately embraced all the things made possible by such an incredible infusion of capital my god he thought wildly we could leap to the top if we are careful and courageous and yes just a bit lucky this was much more money than he could ever hope to get out of tomkin industries should their merger go through it was more capital than he could hope to get from any other source he was absolutely certain liu knew this too only the chinese could come up with enough ready capital to see the allasia through the immediate crisis of the bank run that above all else must be his primary concern if the allasia went he knew the entire keiretsu would soon follow tenchi had put him in a delicate and severely undercapitalized position anthony chins treachery might be the final straw that broke the whole business empire apart for that nangi would curse him and all his progeny to the end of his days but nangi had to ask himself what the chinese really wanted out of this deal they did not easily part with such tremendous amounts of money profits yes but they could get profits in a number of different areas and with a much smaller outlay nangis mind raced to find the answer to a question he knew liu would never willingly provide him with but there were other answers which the chinese would have to give him and perhaps if he asked the right questions liu would give him the solution without knowing it tell me mr liu he said now what do your people propose to do with your onethird interest do he said shifting in his chaise i do not follow you the young chinese girl had been joined by another and nangi was hard put to discern which one was wearing the skimpier suit a wicker basket now sat between them a treasure chest on the sand from which one took a bottle of wine pouring them both half tumblers of the pale gold liquid as they lay back on their blankets he could see the soft succulent swells of their breasts its quite simple nangi said without taking his eyes off the girls they were a good deal more pleasant to look at than the man reclining beside him before i even consider allowing an outside er firm access to the keiretsu no matter the price i need to know what it intends to do with its investment why make money of course liu said what other possible reason could we have nangi smiled thinly as he spread his hands you may be able to understand my caution i have had little contact with members ofyour firm perfectly understandable liu said a bit more amiably he had begun to sense a thaw i would suspect your own motives if i did not detect your caution this is after all not the sort of business deal one puts together every day in some ways we are a very young country mr nangi the world outside the divine kingdom is new to us very simply put there are those currently in power in peking who wish to probe the beginnings of an oriental alliance they feel a business partnership strictly business is a sensible way in which to er get the ball rolling as if on cue the two chinese girls were packing up their belongings the sun seemed very hot even here in the protection of the veranda while they talked all the ice had melted in the pitcher of tea and the dazzle of the water was blinding like strips of endless gold though this is an extraordinary opportunity liu continued as he mopped his forehead with a handkerchief time is of the essence and once you leave china he shrugged i fear it will no longer obtain surely you cannot expect me to make such a monumental judgment concerning my keiretsu in the blink of an eye nangi said turning his head toward liu and away from the girls who were busy brushing sand from their sleek oiled thighs on the contrary mr nangi liu said tapping a longnailed finger against a portion of his silk suit directly over his heart i expect nothing rather it is you who must deal and deal quickly with the allasias unfortunate difficulties bank runs are like wildfire here mr nangi once the chinese get something into their heads it is often an astoundingly short time before matters get out of control the royal hong kong police are well aware of this peculiarity and thus seek to thwart congregating masses a flame in and of itself is not a particularly dangerous element but lit at a gas station well lius hands spread so you may take all the time you wish mr nangi please do not feel any pressure from this quarter to come to a decision he reached into an inside pocket of his jacket however in a friendly effort to er provide you with some assistance i have taken the liberty of having the papers drawn up i see nangi thought about the implications of this for quite some time liu could not quite keep the smug smile off his face despite some curious western depictions we run quite a welloiled machine yes nangi said hating this man with a much more detached passion now i can see that oh no mr nangi you will pardon me for saying so but you do not see it at all liu paused as the two chinese girls coming in off the beach wiped their sandy feet on the lowest step of the veranda his deep avian eyes studied the face of one the tall one who had been on the beach when nangi had first arrived as if his gaze could penetrate the shadows as well as the cascade of thick hair that fell across one shoulder in a moment they were gone stepping silently past the two men into the interior of the villa we shall have dinner soon liu said local langoustes and garoupa as well as braised sun bear paw quite the delicacy here his attitude had altered somewhat at the approach of the women and nangi struggled with that fleeting change trying to divine its essence but back to the topic at hand liu continued somewhat more briskly we are very well coordinated in hong kong far better and more extensively than the british would dare consider his shoulders lifted and fell and why not hong kong is our property after all the true government of china has never recognized a treaty signed under duress when a different age caused men to act dishonorably we tolerate the british rule because it is useful to us i would not deny how lucrative it is for us that would be foolish liu stood up abruptly but ill let you in on a little secret he reached into his inside jacket pocket and revealed a multipage document folded twice on itself carefully he placed the document on the small table between them before continuing his eyes seemed to glow with an inner light the recent land boom is ours his head bobbed yes it is true mr nangi the recent sixyear real estate spiral was instigated by us you see we had planned all along to make our announcement repudiating the crown colonys right to govern here but first we had to bring home to them the true import of the situation within which they would one day find themselves liu was smiling now with an evil triumph nowadays you see it is we who are the master we say jump and the queen jumps the whole world saw it her majestys loss of face was enormous in hastening here and abasing herself at our feet in order to ensure her countrys continued interests in this quarter of the world but that humiliation would not have been so great britains situation quite so dire without the illustration of how with a few wellchosen words we are able to shake the western economy of this colony of how we are able to affect the finances of so many lius fingers were clasped behind his back even you mr nangi must admit that our latest fiveyear plan is a brilliant one the only way to gain our goal the eventual total control of the vast monetary flow in and out of hong kong nangi reached for the folded document and began to read it assiduously in order to calm himself god in heaven he thought if the crowns authorities ever got wind of this theyd have a collective stroke at the very least surely the colonys chief of police and internal security would be given the ax how could this kind of manipulation have gone on right under their noses it must have been vast ah madonna theyre all fools here my own people were totally foxed and i was convinced they were well informed why should the officials here be any different but debating unanswered questions was a waste of time and he quickly turned his mind to other matters first and foremost the contract on initial reading it appeared to be hardnosed but essentially fair there were no hidden strings no floating clauses that liu had not brought up nangi raised his head for a moment coming up for air i see here on page three that the first inflow of capital doesnt commence until ninety days after the signing of this contract liu nodded delighted they had gotten this far that is correct there are a number of er realistic entanglements at gathering and transshipping that large an amount of money gold if that is your wish it will be handled via the sun wa trading company but surely your ah firm is of a sufficient size to begin payment on signing now lius long face looked pained his hands coming around from behind his back were like prehensile hooks regrettably accelerating the timetable of payments is impossible my firm has a number of prior commitments that it must see to concluding first there just isnt enough capital for another ninety days or so nangi sat up grasping the white jade dragon head of his walking stick now we come to the nub of it all he thought i must outmaneuver him here or not at all mr liu as you yourself have said my situation visavis the allasia bank is critical if i am forced to wait three months for your money i will lose tha part of my keiretsu that would not be in either of our interests and nangi thought desperately how i wish we were already one with the american company so that i could call down thencapital but he saw the impossibility of the situation even had satos kobun merged with sphynx he did not believe that the company could have provided enough money within the deadline period maddeningly liu was right he had to stave off the run before it became a stampede otherwise no amount of infused capital would save the bank liu said nothing tapped his fingertips together to an odd internal rhythm time is of the essence for me as well as for you nangi said carefully feeding emotion into his voice if i decide to sign and as you have said that must be before i leave hong kong then there must be a rider that specifies delivery of enough capital to cover the anticipated run and the shortterm obligations say the next six months the bank is required to pay nangi concealing all emotion from his face and voice took a mental deep breath it was sink or swim now he knew thirtyfive million dollars us payable no later than twelve hours after signing liu was silent for a moment beneath the sounds of the quiet surf they could hear the small comforting clinks as the women worked in the kitchen liu required of all his women that they be able to cook and cook well he tapped the side of a nail against his pursed lips you drive a hard bargain that is a not inconsiderable sum you ought to know nangi said gambling youre the one who got me into this liu managed a smile nangi took that as a sign that the chinese could not contain his pride and he thought im leading him in the right direction perhaps after all something of the sort could be arranged liu nodded as if in final decision yes i believe that we might be able to deduct that much from the first of the payments to the keiretsu oh no you dont nangi thought the thirtyfive million is over and above the purchase price totally independent and nonrecoverable i dont want the banks financial operations tied to the keiretsu in any way ultimately that would hamper our profit potential here as well you know nangis heart thudded wildly as liu considered the proposition his hooded eyes revealed nothing nangi knew that this was his chance an immediate bailout an infusion of desperately needed capital in exchange for a third interest in the keiretsu troublesome but not crucial between them he and sato could veto anything the communists wanted that they did not besides working with and not against the communists in their own country would bring its own rewards liu for his part was taking somewhat longer than nangi judged he needed to make the decision he was as still as a statue his parchmentlike skin glowing in the light at length he stirred as a constrictor will when it has roused itself from a long somnolence and is preparing itself to feed again it can be done liu said in that event however we would require that you sign over to us a somewhat larger portion of your keiretsu fiftyone percent nangi showed none of the terror that gripped his heart in that terrible frozen moment fiftyone percent jesus joseph and mary he thought sato and i will lose control of our own company i should not be making this offer at all you know lius voice had turned plummy my government does not easily cast that much money on the er international waters he leaned forward but i see that you are much like your company and that pleases me together we can make a fortune here and in your country he stood up it has been a long day for us both i trust you are as famished as i am he smiled down at nangi this offer is one of a kind i would caution you about that six pm tomorrow is the deadline and that is absolute he lifted a hand the perfect host and now to the food during dinner nangi spent more time watching lius woman than he did his host liu took this as a good sign it signified to him that nangi was a firstclass lecher and he giggled to himself made secure lets go inside she shook her head her long dark hair straying across his cheek and shoulder i want to be out here were elementals now its where we belong nicholas felt her soft and yielding against him his mind was numb with disbelief she was someone elses wife and that someone else was his friend they had shared drunkenness secrets they had sworn to be bound together that part of his mind the rational part quailed as her naked flesh slid over him and what of justine wasnt there a matter of honor where she was concerned he knew that his love for her was undiminished untouched by this moment and what it held an internal shudder wracked his soul he should stop this rise up and walk away into the sanctuary of satos house but he did nothing of the kind justine was a faraway flame bending in the windstorm of his current emotions he breathed a prayer to her even as he drew this creature more tightly to him he could not help himself his body yearned for akiko as if she were food drink oxygen to fill his lungs he could no more disentangle himself from her than he could still his pulse akikos yellow and green kimono lay behind her buttocks in hills and valleys of its own the folds holding deep shadows as if they were secrets both of them were enfolded within his kimono satos kimono her flesh was hot and moist her nails clawed at him her small white teeth bit at his hard flesh as if that too were a sexual act neither of them wanted it ever to end and so their feverishness was tempered with an almost painful holding back their restraint caused akiko to whimper and moan he felt her smaller body trembling uncontrollably against him when his hand first made contact with the already soaking mount of her sex her hips convulsed inward again and again her eyes closed and she gripped him until her fingers went white around them the mist seemed to congeal and darken the sky could no longer be seen and the air had grown heavy and dank as if with the incipience of a storm abruptly thunder rumbled brokenly and early morning seemed to turn into dusk akiko was arched against him trembling her thighs open her hands stroking lovingly his back and buttocks her tongue licked the hollow at the side of his neck then an animal cry broke from her and she moaned i must i must twisting herself around until her hot mouth engulfed him inching down him until her lips enclosed the very root he wanted to do the same to her but even with pinpoints of ecstasy sweeping through her she had the presence of mind to deflect him keeping the insides of her thighs away from his eyes she could not afford to let him see what lay there grinning with power for that would end it all yukio would be gone forever and nothing either of them could do would bring her back again he would know and he would try to destroy her so she sucked more heavily on him reaching up to enclose the totality of his sex using every technique she had learned to bring him pleasure he gave up his grip on her surrendering but oh how she longed to feel his lips and tongue on her as she was on him in her minds eye she imagined it and shivered then she felt his fingers returning to the core of her and she sighed inwardly feeling her sex like the heavy pulse of a second heart it began to rain as she reluctantly let him go immediately he moved atop her his wet sex grazing her thigh and belly as he did so gently she took hold of him guiding him his mouth came down over one dark nipple then another back and forth she could not slow her breathing thunder cracked overhead approaching and the rain picked up there was virtually no wind and the rain came almost straight down striking the smooth pebbles all around them in a muted roar they could see nothing clearly but themselves akiko rubbed him against her wet opening with the delicacy of a courtesan she begged him not to tease her yet her hands continued to tease them both increasing the tension and the pleasure until it became unbearable for them with a burst of exhaled breath nicholas tore himself from her gentle grasp and slowly moved into her akiko gasped and shaking uncontrollably arced herself up against him she rubbed her wet flesh against his reveling in the scrub of his hair against her body he hilled her and she felt connected to the universe she felt all weight leave her heart all hate melt like snow in the burgeoning heat of the first spring day all blackness disappear from her sight she floated in the rain and the thunder like a slender reed on the riverside birds flew calling above her the wind rippled all about her the rain struck her and she bent willingly before its force water rushed by beneath her and small burrowing insects tickled her roots she was part of the river the forest the sea shore the depths of the world she plummeted and rose at the same time night became day then reversed itself the cosmic clock beat in her ear turning seconds into centuries minutes into eons her breathing was the growth of bedrock the metamorphosis of carbon into diamond of fossil detritus into fuel she sighed and the seasons changed she shuddered and new islands sprang into being across the bosom of the pacific she convulsed crying out wildly as he shot and shot into her as their loins ground together as orgasm followed orgasm and the world winked out in the blink of an eye the blue monster had changed cars three times on his way up north the first time had been in miami when route became the second time had been in savannah when the bastard and alix logan stopped to get a bite to eat the third time had been just outside beaufort south carolina the phonix cipher machine was on a locking slide mount and was easy to move from vehicle to vehicle right now the blue monster would have felt naked without it the bastard drove like a sonuvabitch and the blue monster had to be doubly careful because this was strictly solo and there was absolutely no margin for error if he lost them now it was all over for him he knew that neither he nor anyone else would be able to find them quickly again he bided his time he smoked unfiltered camels and was patient allowing the harsh tobacco bite to keep him awake he took no pills the blue monster was far better than croaker had anticipated and he arrived outside the hotel fourandahalf minutes after croaker and alix logan had disappeared inside the stone and glass lobby it was an eastern chain hotel just outside raleigh with an enormous trilevel shopping arcade across the sixlane highway off which its drive curled in a macadamed crescent jesse james the blue monster pulled his creamcolored aries k car off highway he had spotted what he suspected was their car a latemodel maroon ford fourdoor and had made the turn from the middle lane causing both voiced ire and the screeching of brakes and horns from those vehicles to the left of him as he slid across their bows speeding toward the egress he lofted a rigid middle finger in their direction after the incident five miles back he had no patience for any of these southem north carolina hicks the goddamned pimply kid in the dusty pickup with the straw cowboy hat and denim jacket james thought as he rolled up into the parking lot probably wasnt even seventeen and sure as shit didnt know how to drive james spat out his open window the kid was how he had come to lose the maroon ford imagine to come all this way on that bastards tail only to lose him at a goddamned stoplight because a candyassed kid wouldnt pull over to let me pass james still seethed inside at the thought then his keen eye had picked out the maroon ford sitting in the hotels parking lot and he had made his move he pulled into a space three cars down from the ford and ambled out stretching his legs no point in hurrying now he told himself pragmatically either this was their vehicle or he had lost them for sure his pulse rose as he saw the license plates florida he came and stood next to the car put the flat of his hand on the hood still warm it was them all right he knelt down as if tying a shoelace and wiped the accumulation of mud that wily bastard had smeared across the plates making a note of the letternumber combination then he rose and went up the stepped concrete path toward the hotels side entrance the young lieutenants name was russilov and the more protorov saw of him the better he liked him the man had initiative the problem with most of the soldiers coming up through the strictly controlled soviet system protorov thought was that they lacked just that initiative they were all right if you gave them a blueprint theyd follow it down to the letter or die trying you couldnt fault that kind of dedication unless you were in viktor protorovs line of work then that kind of robotic thinking could blow a network destroy a potential defector coming over from the other side or expose the mouse in someone elses house protorov had too many mice in other peoples houses to be satisfied with the grade of soldier that would normally be assigned to him bureaucrats were of course out altogether it galled him that he had to take this raw and basically unthinking talent and make it over beneath his skillful hands the clay of mother russia was reformed into individuals useful to the ninth directorate to that end he was headmaster of a school in the urals it was much smaller than the one the kgb itself ran the one filled with american streets american money milk shakes and hot dogs talk of the yankees and the dodgers the giants and the dallas cowboys that was fairytale stuff and besides it had proven to be potentially dangerous too many russian sleepers assimilated into american life via that school had failed to respond to their wakeup call life in the west presented a siren call apparently too seductive to resist for all but the most hardened personality protorov preferred to keep the soviet ethos very much alive at his academy while he expanded the minds of his pupils broadened their outlook in short taught them to think independently the old bureaucrats in the kremlin had they known what he was up to would no doubt have closed him down summarily but the truth was they were afraid of the ninth directorate and afraid especially of viktor protorov besides he brought them too many third world victories it was too convenient for them to swell upon his most recent successes in argentina snaring england into an idiotic and draining war and in el salvador egging the hawkish american administration on into what could easily become another vietnam they were not adept at examining their fears anyway pyotr alexandrovitch russilov was a graduate from protorovs ural academy but he was special in many ways for one he had graduated at the top of his class for another he had adapted superbly to the field protorov had found through bitter experience that academic life had little in common with the awesome pressures at work in the field many graduates did not make the adjustment and were retired to the ninths bureaucratic section where they never again came into direct contact with protorov but gospadin russilov was different in another way he was an orphan early on the state or more properly protorov had taken him over he was a reclamation project of the first rank because protorov was married to his job and also perhaps because sex had never meant that much to him there had only been one woman in his life she was someone he would have preferred to forget but could not alena was the wife of a jewish dissident after protorov then head of the first directorate had sent alenas husband off to a gulag he took her to bed it had been far more pleasurable for him than he had ever imagined whether it was because of the peculiar circumstances surrounding the incident or whether it was something within alena herself protorov could not say he thought of himself as a basically dispassionate man able to see clearly and objectively all situations yet he had never been able to fathom this one it remained like a great ice floe hidden beneath arctic waters mocking him with its opacity but like it or not alena was all he had in reality and then after he had her sent down in lubyanka in his memory until russilov without quite knowing how it had happened protorov had come to look upon his protege as family son was not too strong a word to use when protorov retired from the ninth which would not be very long now he knew that russilov would run it well now that he had received the signal from colonel mironenko that the kgbgru summit was scheduled for a week away his time at the ninth was coming to an end but he had to have penetrated tenchi by then tengu his second agent inside the tenshin shoden katori ryu had been mysteriously murdered as he was escaping with the prize that protorov had been seeking since he had received the information that that particular ninja ryu was safeguarding tenchis written records it was a frustrating setback protorov thought now but not a fatal one by any means sir protorov looked up his train of thought disturbed yes lieutenant russilov he liked the way the young man addressed him as sir and not comrade rank was important in the ninth directorate and unlike the hypocrisy running rampant in the kremlin protorov made no bones about it russilov entered the soundproofed chamber through the vaultlike door he held a sheaf of computer printouts in his hands i believe sakhov iv has given us a clue after all immediately protorov cleared his desk of paper stacking files russilov set the sheaf down in the open space it was open to the fourth page both men stared hard at the readout broadcast from the tracking satellites onboard computer it showed a gridform geographical tableau approximately by kilometers the landsea area was quite familiar to the russians it was the section of sea between the northerly end of hokkaido and the most southerly of the kuriles kunashir part of that area was japanese territory part was a soviet possession the young lieutenants finger stabbed out you see here sir the pad of the finger roamed across the nemuro straits there is nothing absolutely nothing out of the ordinary now he reached up and flipped to the next page just here his finger hovered over one small point in the straits what is it protorov asked knowing quite well what it was he did not want to deprive russilov of the fruits of his victory that would have been unfair an emanation of heat russilov said protorov looked up at him for a moment he had to give the young man credit there was no triumph in his voice though surely he must be feeling it very strong volcanic action protorov offered it was the most plausible explanation oh this is much too localized for that besides the known northerly fault is here his finger moved off to the southeast i see protorov sat back what is it then tenchi oh yes protorov thought thats precisely what it was because they knew from reliable sources that tenchi was some form of monumental industrial or resource project what protorov and his unit had been searching for all this time was some discrepancy now protorov felt it was here then as he glanced down at the readout something else caught his eye he did some rapid mental calculations then mulled it over for a time before saying anything lieutenant he said meditatively this intense heat activity where would you place it exactly thats difficult to say sir russilov bent over the readout as you know this comes from a long way up and of course our technicians have had to piece it together to get the whole nevertheless protorov pursued i want your best guess russilov took his time producing a jewelers loupe with which he routinely scanned the readout at length he stood up dropping the magnifier into his cupped palm if i were put to it sir he began i would have to say that part of the activity is coming from japanese territory protorovs pulse picked up a beat and the other part the other part it seems to me is coming from russian sovereign territory alix logan was in the shower croaker sat in an easy chair in the large neatly furnished room he was sipping a bourbon and water that room service had brought up he was tired and he let his head fall back against the chair closing his eyes he still felt the slight motion vertigo from having been in the car eighteen straight hours he would have preferred to fly out of key west but that would have been suicidal like putting a come follow me sign on their backs no all things considered a car had been best at the least it afforded them the option of changing destinations any time they pleased dimly he heard the shower running he thought again of what it had felt like to have alix logan sitting beside him for all that uninterrupted time the sunstreaked hair falling now and again on his shoulder those piercing green eyes the models lithe tautfleshed body the skin tanned and smooth as cream and that led him to thoughts of angela didion the other model and alix logans best friend but none of the fame angela didion had amassed none of the myriad rumors about her mattered a damn at the moment croaker had entered her apartment and found her sprawled across her bed naked save for a thin gold chain around her waist and very dead she was no beauty queen then no superbly madeup sex goddess the vision of every mans fantasy stripped so harshly of life she was merely a young girl pathetic in her ultimate vulnerability and she had moved croaker more then than she ever had in life he remembered that moment well how he had wanted more than anything else to wave some magic wand and resurrect her not for himself just for her in death she was only a human being and therefore far more than she ever had been as a cover girl for vogue and cosmopolitan where she had been drenched in twodimensional unreality in one sense that seemed a very little thing to set him on this long torturous quest a tiny thing over which to lose ones own life but when one thought of it another way it was the only truly honorable thing to do and lew croaker had learned about the importance of honor from his best friend nicholas linnear now alix opened the door to the steamy bathroom and emerged with a thick towel wrapped around her another smaller one wrapped as a turban around her hair croakers eyes snapped open and for a moment he saw not her but angela didion and he found renewed determination not to let alix logan die which she surely would if the blue monster ever caught wind of their whereabouts youre next she said giving him that direct disconcerting look that seemed to penetrate his skull you look like death warmed over croaker grunted and finished off his drink funny i feel worse than that she sat down on one of the double beds her hands in her lap why are you doing this thats what id like to know theyll kill you if they catch you you know that dont you its because of angela you didnt even know her alix said you were in love with that face just like everyone else you dont get it at all he said shifting in his seat and i never will she said archly unless you explain it to me she died on my turf he swirled the ice around the empty glass staring at the cubes but looking at nothing at all someone did her in i want to find out who because she was a person just like anyone else she deserved that much at least alix gave a short laugh im in a better position to know what she deserved she paused for a moment as if gathering herself she was a bitch lew she was mean vindictive insanely jealous and absolutely venal croaker looked up at her none of that matters to me she was no better or worse than anyone else alix poured herself a drink from the bottle of old granddad you shouldve spent some time with her she said taking a swallow neat a coupleve days thats all it wouldve taken croaker took the glass out of her hand finished what she had in there were you in love with her thats none of your goddamned business she flared at him her hands clenched into whitened fists and her lips compressed into a thin unattractive line then her face began to break apart a small piece at a time just because you saved my life what makes you think you can expect answers like that out of me by then she was weeping her sunbaked shoulders heaving her hands covering her face croaker watched her for a time suppressing the urge to reach out for her and comfort her he knew her well enough now to know she would pull back from such a gesture after a while her hands came down and she wiped at her eyes she seemed a great deal calmer the truth is she said softly angela was in love with me she ran long fingers through her wet hair after unwinding the towel she began to rub it through her hair i could never remember my mother and angela was strong i guess there was a lot of the male in her not that she was masculine it wasnt that at all im talking about something inside her personality or whatever she caught me i honestly dont know how else to put it i knew she was a bitch from working with her and i knew she was into drugs opium and coke nice combo huh but i thought oh i dont know what i thought i suppose i blinded myself to all those things because i needed a mother someone to show me the ropes and protect me alix stopped fussing with her hair sat again with her hands in her lap so that she appeared very young almost a little girl innocent made of spun pink candy we fought all the time in many ways she made my life hell you could have walked out croaker pointed out but alix was already shaking her head like i said you didnt know angela what she wanted she kept until she was tired of it she would have ruined me professionally if id tried to leave she could have done it easily she was quite the expert at it i saw her do it once to a young model coming up who said the wrong thing to her one day angela made one phone call and no one in the business even spoke that girls name again angela had the power of a pharaoh her head came down so far that croaker could see the soft bit of light down at the nape of her neck but the truth is i didnt have the strength to leave her she frightened me and oddly i suppose within the power of her manipulation i felt more secure than i had outside on my own in the world there was a silence that stretched itself filling the room with an odd kind of chill then what happened croaker prompted then everything changed alix said her voice so soft croaker had to lean forward to hear her properly angela met raphael tomkin jesse james had picked up the bastards name tex bristol from the harbormaster at the key west marina when the man and several others who had been on the dock at the time had noticed his boat leaving its slip just after alix logans had james did not know who the bastard really was but he promised himself he would soon find out he had asked for bristol by name at the front desk figuring the bastard wouldnt see any reason to change the alias at this stage but he had been wrong he had been told that no bristol with the first name of tex or with any other first name had registered that day the blue monster had launched into explanation c going the full route showing a badge he was a private detective a case of adultery here are the descriptions of the pair nothing to get het up about just serving divorce papers et cetera he got their room number one room very cosy james thought what does this bastard have that i dont he took the elevator up the doors opened and jesse james emerged onto the third floor of the hotel croaker had just come out of the shower he felt thirty years better toweling himself dry he put on the lightweight slacks dark blue tshirt with key west is best stenciled in green across the chest and his tattered topsiders that he had brought with him into the bathroom alix wore a pair of cutoff jeans and a pink capsleeve silk shirt her bare toes curled on the bedspread she was sitting up her back against a pair of pillows reading a paperback book she had picked up at the place along the highway where they had stopped for lunch this things as bad as the food we had this afternoon she said throwing the book away from her vampires in the bayous whos kidding who that was when the door to the hall burst open with a crack like a rifle shot sato found his guest in the garden in the rain my dear friend he called from the dry sanctuary of his study youll catch your death of cold out there nicholas did not answer at once his shoulders were slumped as he sat on the stone seat facing the swaying branches of the boxwood there was a fat gray plover strutting impatiently back and forth along a dry patch near the wide bole every so often it cocked its head upward its glaring eye seeming to curse the foul elements as for nicholas he barely noticed the wetness the kimono was soaked through and there was not a part of him that was dry it did not matter he knew now that akiko and yukio were two separate entities deceit could only be taken so far a face could lie for instance whispered words even a knowing glance but a body was different response to an intimate touch the softening the opening all these were unique they could not be counterfeited an unutterable sadness filled him at the thought that he had lost her all over again of course it had been an impossibility that she should be alive logic dictated that she had died by saigos hand just as he had described it to nicholas savoring each words effect on his hated cousin yet nicholas for the first time in his life perhaps had not heeded logic he had thrown a lifetime of training and understanding out for the possibility of one desperate hope it was laughable and sad at the same time and he despised himself for the enjoyment he took from the adulterous joining though akiko was not yukio still he had made love to her with more than his body who she was and why she looked like his lost love became secondary to the knowledge that his heart was open to her if she were not yukio could he love her anyway by what magic was that possible or had some vital piece of yukios somehow lodged in akikos soul in any case he felt tainted an outcast from himself his misdeed had lost him his centricity and without that he was powerless in a world gone mad linnearsan he could hear satos voice raised above the racket of downpour then the older man was beside him draping a clear plastic wrap across his shoulders contemplation must conform to the elements which it honors he said softly i will leave you alone no satosan please stay abruptly nicholas did not want to be alone he already felt too isolated bereft almost all his youthful dreams were gone in the space of a thunderclap wild hope had died but what he thought is a human being without hope this garden is most calming at all times of the day sato moved beside him he opened his mouth to continue closed it as a crack of thunder rolled across the sky ive often thought that it is the shouting of the gods he said thunder i was awakened early this morning by the storm i drowsed listening to its cries almost human dont you think very human indeed nicholas said i must confess he thought i must return harmony to my spirit satosan the chinese taught our forefathers geomancy sato said forestalling nicholas so that we might forever remain in harmony with the forces of nature we are not tigers though we may strive to be there is a perfection in that lesser state to which we human beings can only aspire his eyes were liquid and soft as he looked down at nicholas and quite startlingly he put his hand on nicholas shoulder wont you come inside now he said and allow me to brew you tea watching russilovs ramrodstraight back disappear out the steel door protorov thought about how after struggling for so many years to devote himself to the service of ideology his life had taken on a personal cast not creating a family for himself he certainly saw as proof of his overriding dedication to the eventual worldwide triumph of soviet ideals but now he had russilov how had that happened his intense feeling for the young man caused him to feel vulnerable and being vulnerable made him feel afraid viktor protorov had not been afraid for eight years not since the death of his older and only brother at that time protorov was head of the first directorate responsible for russian internal security creating an unassailable kingdom for himself within the ninth directorate a bastion from which to strike outward at the right time to lead the motherland onward to global victory was just dawning on him in the winter of that year a particularly bitter one filled with day after day of heavy snow he had many missions running all were important in those days he lacked the internal clout to request more men for his understaffed directorate he had learned to make do but because of the acute manpower shortage and the inclemency of the weather he was forced to physically oversee more missions than he should have consequently he had been outside moscow far to the north when they had brought in minck protorov had known of his presence inside russia and had wanted him badly a fluke had landed him early and he was inside lubyanka when protorovs brother of junior rank a lieutenant though he was three years older learned of his presence protorov had always done better than lev academically and socially protorov knew how to speak to people knew how to take exams knew in his own mind what he wanted to be lev was always the dreamer unsure of which fork to take in a road in which direction to turn his life he had always been afraid of making a mistake he had made a mistake that dark snowfilled afternoon even while notification of mincks capture was being relayed to protorov by the despicably unreliable wire system lev went into lubyanka to interrogate the spy himself he wanted no doubt to prove to his younger brother that there was something he could do as well and on his own he failed somehow minck was able to overpower him and using him as hostage break free then he killed lev slaughtered him in the snow like a butcher they left him there in the storm terrified to touch him before protorov arrived there was little blood for him to see when hours later he returned to moscow the cold had congealed it cauterizing the wound still there was a gaping hole in levs left temple where the bullet had torn through the skull protorov did not want to look at the damage inflicted on the back of the head knowing that the devastation would be far worse at the egress point quite deliberately he turned levs body over and stared at the carnage snowflakes caught on his lids making vision difficult still he persevered even as he ordered the manhunt for minck and his fellow escapee tanya vladimova perhaps it was then that protorov thought for the first time that there was too much pain to be borne in having a family perhaps it was at that moment that he decided not to have one of his own for the sense of utter isolation of a terrible vulnerability was overwhelming he found himself hating the american named minck far more than he had ever thought he could hate another human being six months later he had awakened an important sleeper in order to kill mincks wife sleeping alone and vulnerable in their bed in rural maryland one shot from a pistol protorov and minck knew well at close range through the left temple still it had not been enough so the war went on and on protorov sighed now alone in his inner sanctum he pushed his glasses up onto the dome of his forehead scrubbed at his face with a palm he found that he had been sweating though tengu his second agent within the tenshin shoden katori ryu had been killed his backup the last agent protorov had in that field was making progress at that moment the compact cipher machine began to buzz preparatory to decoding an alphathree his satellite was about to whisper in his ear once again croaker grabbed alixs slim wrist and jerked hard hearing her short high scream of surprise and pain as he used his strength to roll her across to the far side of the bed and out of harms way at the same time his hand snaked beneath the bed to where the gun lay and without aiming fully shot out the lamplight in the room now only the oblong of illumination filtering in through the open doorway to the hall pushed back the darkness and in its midst the shadow rushed into the room hes a goddamned bull croaker thought as he pushed alixs inquisitive head down to the carpeting and rose at the instant he felt the shadow at its closest he lifted his arm brought the muzzle of the pistol down in a vicious slash across the shadows cheekbone felt the contact with pleasure the split of skin flesh and the pressured scrape against bone but despite the blow the shadows momentum was enough to keep him coming on and such was his strength that he slammed full tilt into croaker knocking the pistol from his grip it skidded across the floor in the darkness lost oh christ croaker thought were in for it now he felt a heavy blow land on his shoulder twisting him and blindly he kicked upward missing once his knee connecting with the shadows thigh bone adjusting his aim accordingly and plowing into the shadows groin he heard the whoosh of air and a groan and the weight and pressure on him eased sufficiently for him to squirm out from under come on he yelled at alix fumbling for her hand and half dragging her from the room down the blindingly lit hallway to the exit door and the stairs down the metal and concrete staircase they ran until at last they burst out into the softskinned night the car would have been the best bet but croaker had left the keys back in the room he took a quick look around there were few people about except at the entrance of the hotel where locals were drawing up as they went into the disco in the lobby one of the only nightspots in the area croaker took them that way though they were certainly not dressed for the occasion people in dinner dress watched their approach with more amusement than alarm but he saw it was going to be no go right away they stood out like beggars at a masked ball so he veered them away rushing down the sloped scimitar drive toward highway dodging the slowly approaching line of cars pushing alix out of the illumination of the headlights he did not turn his head to see if the blue monster was after them he assumed the worst if he had been dogged enough and croaker had to admit to himself smart enough to follow them all the way from key west he wouldnt be so stupid as to lose them now he rushed them across the sixlane highway on the amber with the traffic already beginning to pile up and move jockeying for position for turns christ alix breathed where are we going croaker made no reply he thought it wiser to let her believe that he knew what he was doing ahead of them loomed the darkened mass of the shopping mall all angles and black shadows a silent deserted city in the heart of the darkness croaker took them down an exit ramp and they were plunged into the wide spotless avenues of the arcades their footfalls made no sound on the stone flooring and croaker was grateful at least that he had his topsiders on but alix was barefoot and though from an aural point of view that was good still with all the running they were doing he was fearful of sharp objects she might inadvertently step on well he thought theres no help for it now we have to go on deep inside the mall he stopped them though they were both in reasonably good shape a breather was nevertheless called for alixs chest heaved with exertion and fear she stared around her wideeyed shoe stores clothing boutiques a local sears endless rows of glasspaneled windows featuring a bewildering variety of wares crouched on either side of them closed and unhelpful what are we go croaker put his palm quickly over her mouth and said in her ear no talking the sound will carry and bring him to us like a beacon okay she nodded her head vigorously and he took his hand away he wiped the sweat from his face with his shirtsleeve straining his ears for some semblance of sound but he heard nothing above the soft susurrus of the faraway traffic on highway dim light filtered across their shoulders in thick swatches from the interiors of the shops along the arcade but patches of deep shadow remained all about them like impenetrable stands of trees they were in a forest of metal and glass alix grabbed his shoulder and leaned her lips against his ear what are we waiting here for she whispered lets go out of here before he finds us croaker debated with himself whether to tell her the truth he knew it would probably be better to keep her in the dark as long as possible but on the other hand she was in this as deeply as he was and it was unfair to keep her ignorant about such a thing besides if she did not know she might do something stupid at the last minute and screw things up he put his mouth to her ear and said softly ive got news for you your former keepers followed us this far hes not gonna stop now even assuming we could find a car and i could boost it we wouldnt lose him not now her large clear eyes stared into his for the moment it took her to put it together no she said theres been one killing already yeah croaker sighed and therell be a lot more unless hes stopped he looked at her it has to be done alix you know it does after a time her eyes slid away from him her cheeks were wet and he heard her whisper i wish now hed never saved me i wish id drowned that day in key west you dont mean that he said automatically the hell i dont she flared her eyes bright what kind of life is this im living can you tell me th croaker shoved her hard sending her spinning flat on her back across the cool stone flooring as the whine turned into the spang of a ricochet he saw the place where the bullet had gouged out chips of stone and dived after her pulling her up onto her knees then to her feet dragging her after him down the arcade turning right then right again pushing her into a darkened doorway where they both crouched alix was sweating and shivering all at once croaker looked both ways before he reached again for her hand but alix was shaking her head no she said i cant go on its useless like you said wherever we run hell find us get up he said fiercely she shook her head again her spungold hair obscuring her face its no good i havent got the strength well for the love of god find some he hissed at her bending over and hauling her to her feet im tired lew her eyes were hooded i just want to sleep he saw the lassitude flooding her body and wondered if this was how she had felt in the moments before she had hurled her body into the turquoise ocean that day aboard her boat he grabbed her cheeks in the pincer of his thumb and massed fingers listen you he said his face close to hers youll sleep when i tell you to and not a minute before christ she cried tearyeyed youre a goddamned knight without a lady cant you see that i just dont care anymore but i do he jerked at her now come on he skidded them to the left as another bullet whined into the stone just behind them and to the right whats the use she said as they ran hes got the gun yeah i noticed that i hate guns she said and croaker had to laugh yeah he said me too especially when i dont have one but the fact was that she was right the blue monster had an edge croaker could not possibly overcome a gun against nothing not a particularly fair fight but then nothing much was fair in life anyway as he ran he recalled nicholas telling him that he had never used a gun yet croaker knew his friend to be one of the most dangerous men on earth what then was his secret when he had asked nicholas that question he had merely smiled enigmatically and said there are ways now what the hell did he mean by that croaker wondered i sure could use one of those secrets now as the third shot rang out barely missing him he berated himself think use the brain your old man bequeathed you there was nothing around them but stone metal and glass what could he ah he had it there was no time to think of whether or not it was a good idea it was the only one he had and the blue monster was right behind them closing in for the kill he ducked them around a corner dropped alixs hand and sprinted ahead just around another rightangle turn he slid to a stop and pulled his shirt over his head wrapping it around his left hand he shot the swathed fist forward into a sheet of glass alix gasped at the sound as she came hurtling around the corner what the hell are you doing get back there he said waving her behind him as far as you can without losing sight of me alix did as she was bade and he knelt down searching among the glitter of glass shards somewhere in the dim recesses of the store a ringing was sounding and he knew that this was strictly shutended now because as soon as he had tripped the alarm by breaking the window a new element had been added the police and he had as much stake in keeping them out of this as the blue monster had croaker found what he needed both pieces one a narrow long strip the second a shorter jagged one with extreme care he placed the smaller piece in his right hand keeping the razorsharp edges away from the web of his hand now he took up the larger piece in his wrapped left hand he moved to the inner edge of the corner keeping his body flat against the column and away from the bright fingers of shattered glass still in the windowframe now came the moment of truth he could stick his head out to see where the blue monster was like all the cops on tv did but then hed probably get his head shot off the blue monster wasnt firing blanks real life presented problems hollywood scriptwriters never seemed to address hey buddy he called from his place of concealment its all over the copsll be here any minute youd better be six miles away from here by then you v me both came the voice from around the corner and croaker thought ive got him using the aural fix and bringing his left hand back in a tensed arc the muscles quivering with the strain of anticipating the hairtrigger release the forebrain acknowledging the existence of only one chance then croaker was holding his breath striding his left leg forward in a blur shooting his upper torso forward closing his mind to the thought of himself as a target and the forearm already coming forward with rocketing speed the swathed fingers releasing their burden at the far apex of the arc when momentum combined with croakers own strength to turn the shard of glass into a glittering missile thats what you think buddy let it all out in a harsh rush providing twin stimuli for the blue monsters brain to chew on during this moment of extreme stress he saw a blurred glimpse of the blue monster jerking back at the sight and sound the glass shard already upon him cracking in two across the bridge of his nose croaker had no time to wish that his aim had been more accurate blood was streaming from the blue monsters face and both his hands were up trying to free his vision but there was nothing at all wrong with his hearing and his gun hand leveled on croakers stomach as he heard his adversary coming on he squeezed off one shot two then swung the barrel of the gun into the oncoming head it was a lucky blow coming in blind as it did landing just behind croakers left ear croaker staggered off balance from having swerved away from the gunshots in the midst of transferring the smaller shard of glass from his right hand to his left missing the first stab now at close range with the blue monsters sight back he could imagine the hole the slug would tear into him there wouldnt be much left of his insides and as the blue monsters finger began to squeeze the trigger croaker put aside the pain flashing through his head and through sheer force of will made his motor functions return to life swinging his left arm in a shallow arc inside the muzzle of the pistol stabbing inward and up with all his might he gave a mighty groan at the pain that shot through him and dimly he felt flesh and sinew giving way beneath the pressure he was exerting as he jammed the glass shard into the blue monsters chest blood flowed from his own palm mingling with that of the blue monster he pushed at the body as the gun went off in reflexive response scattering plaster off the ceiling high above croaker became aware of something pulling at his arm soft breath on his cheek and a voice as insistent as a bee in his ear come on alix begged him pulling at him desperately oh god lew theyll be here any second he rolled heavily only dimly aware of who she was and why she was bothering him now when he was so tired and only wanted to close his eyes and get up his mind screamed at him get her out of here before its too late too late for what just want to turn over and close my eyes and for gods sake stay awake on his hands and knees now bleeding all over the cleanshiny surface of the arcade floor alix tugging at his arm pulling him dizzily upward the corridor beginning to be bathed in pulsing crimson light the sounds of sirens blossoming in his ears he turned with her now allowing her to head him out of the labyrinth loping willing his stiff legs to work trying to ignore the pounding in his head the roar of his own pulse the acrid coppery taste in his mouth making him want to gag red black red the illumination revolving until gradually the red began to grow dimmer and then he felt the cool incredibly soft night breeze on his hot cheeks and he had the presence of mind to tell her keys alix get the goddamned car keys nangi turned his torso over in the bed ignoring his useless legs he reached out in the darkness and touched the slim shoulder of the second chinese girl on the beach nangi shook her with some power he leaned his head in toward the curtain of nightblack hair and said wake up sleepy one directly into the hollow of her ear he was greeted with nothing more articulate than a snore he rolled away from her and sat up good the bit of white powder tasteless and odorless he had put in her champagne had done its work nicely now it was time to go to work the villa was silent as he quickly dressed in shirt and trousers he left off his shoes and socks transferring several small objects from a deep pouch hidden within the silk folds of the lining of his suit jacket into his trousers pocket across the room ribboned in bluish shadow he took up his walking stick and carefully opened the door the hallway was dark and silent and slowly he crept awkwardly along it turning his mind from thoughts of powerful athletes legs which in this situation would have served him in good stead when he reached the closed door behind which liu and the tall girl had disappeared not more than fifteen minutes ago he paused unscrewing the white jade dragon at the head of his walking stick he inserted one of the small objects in his pocket he pressed a stud peered at the inside mechanism satisfying himself as to its working order and slowly using infinite care turned the knob on the door before him he froze as a sliver of pink lamplight slithered out the tiny crack between door and frame when nothing further occurred he continued pushing the door inward it was time to see if the sensation he had picked up from liu at the moment he watched the tall girl earlier on the veranda had any validity now he could discern the faint floating lilt of the chinese surprisingly it was not cantonese nangi had enough ongoing business in hong kong so that he had made himself learn the language because he never quite felt secure leaving his business fate to interpreters but this was a dialect he was not familiar with it was not so much that liu would be speaking it he was a communist chinese from the mainland where cantonese was certainly not the lingua franca but these two beach girls surely they were local of course they could be chiu chow or originally from any number of other provinces but still nangi set his walking stick point first along the carpeted floor and slowly slid it through the gap in the door extending it to its full length then he settled himself to listen after a long while he picked up a word he knew and his heart began to race but cautious man that he was he waited for another word or phrase that would give him confirmation when it finally came he gave a tiny inward sigh they were speaking mandarin there was no doubt of it it was extremely unlikely that liu would find a street girl in the crown colony whose native tongue was the same as his own nangi crouched uncomfortably in the hallway waited patiently through the grunting coupling and the languid aftermath when the conversation picked up again when at last he heard the soft slide of bedsheets he withdrew his walking stick the barely discernable pad of bare feet came to him as he was closing the door forcing himself to do it slowly a millimeter at a time lest either of the occupants discover the movement at last he rose and went down the corridor to the back of the villa there he opened the door and went out earlier in the evening the stars had been visible but now the clouds had come occluding all light the air was heavy with incipient rain as he took out a cigarette and lit it he took the smoke deep into his lungs let it out with a long satisfied sigh then he threw the thing into the sand and went down the stone steps and across the winding road within the deep shadows along the far verge he found the small red alfa run up beneath a pair of enormous leafy trees youre going to catch your death of cold he said in idiomatic cantonese eh the driver of the car turned his head as if he was only now aware of nangis presence its going to rain in a moment nangi went on he gestured toward the car youd better get the top up they watched each other for a moment a pair of wary animals about to enter into a contest of territory i fear youve picked the wrong car to follow anybody in i dont know what youre talking about the man said using the most abusive inflection nangi bent down so fast the other man had no time to react they were face to face i know who you are nangi said in a rush or rather what you are either the communists hired you i spit on the communists the man broke in then youre working for sato never heard of him im the one wholl pay you eventually the whites of the mans eyes took on a slight sheen as they shifted toward nangi are you telling me he wont come through with the rest what im saying is this you do what i tell you from now on and i wont inform mr sato of your clumsiness what are you talking about the man protested dyou think those sea snakes know im here they damn well dont but i do nangi said and you were hired to follow me what if i was lets see if youre really any good nangi said unscrewing the head of his walking stick he extracted a small plastic cassette and held it in his palm like a priceless jewel can you speak mandarin the man looked up at him no sweat no sweat what books have you been into i read raymond chandler oh madonna nangi thought he probably thinks of himself as a private eye he gave the man a judicious look wondering whether or not he could trust him listen the man said shifting uncomfortably in his leather bucket seat give me the tape ill get it done you want it first thing in the morning thats exactly when youll get it he glanced upward the gods assure it look it hasnt rained here in three weeks now the heavens are about to open guaranteed all right nangi said making his decision he didnt see that he had much choice he did not want to involve allan su at this stage and there seemed to be no other alternative he dropped the microcassette into the other mans palm bring it to my room at the mandarin at seven am that give you enough time the man nodded then as an afterthought he said hey mr nangi my names fortuitous chiu the whites of his eyes showed again im shanghainese my family owns onethird of the godowns in sam ka tsuen and kwun tong were into restaurants and tourist cabarets you know the highclass topless places outside of wan chai we trade in carpets diamonds jade if i dont show on time you go to my father pak tai chiu he lives in the villa with the jade green tiled roof up on belleview road overlooking repulse bay nangi knew enough about the ways of these people to understand how much of himself fortuitous chiu was revealing you come to room this morning fortuitous chiu he said as the first warm drops of rain began to fall and ill have more for you to do he pointed right now youd better get your top up or youll drown in the next five minutes the ringing of the phone although muted from inside the house disturbed the contemplation that the tea ceremony brought them for a time there had been perfect harmony in the room the two men kneeling on the greenishyellow reed tatami both in flowing kimono between them were the carefully placed implements of the chanoyu porcelain kettle with a pair of matching cups whisk at right angles to this display was the hardwood case within which reposed nicholas daikatana isshogai also between the men and above them to the right was satos tokonoma the slender translucent vase contained two pure white peonies flowers that sato knew nicholas loved above the froth of the blossoms was the scroll on which had been handlettered this phrase be intent on loyalty while others aspire to perform meritorious services concentrate on purity of intent while those around you are beset by egoism nothing else was of import within the study the confluence of forces from these entities and objects created the aura of barmoniousness that is so rare in life and toward which each individual strives the momentousness of the moment was lost on neither man after the ringing came koten he bowed deeply waiting for his master to become aware of his powerful spirit an intrusion and thus an end to harmony satos head came up his eyes refocusing slowly he and nicholas had been at the void together as very few men in this imperfect world had been during the long burning pages of history his heartbeat as well as his breathing were still abnormally slow he might have been in a trance of a mystical state well known in the far east and highly prized a thousand pardons satosan kotens voice highpitched and slightly comical emanating from that vast rumbling body never ceased to amuse sato the man who will not leave his name has called he must speak with you yes satos voice was slightly thick nicholas had made no move and sato envied him he rose and followed koten out of his study during the time when he was alone nicholas slowly pulled himself back from the void it took him longer than it otherwise might because part of him did not wish to leave the vast harmony that he had just been a part of still hovered like an afterglow in the study after a time he lifted his head and studied the words on the tokonoma scroll they were oddly unpoetic yet very much in keeping with the kind of man nicholas had come to know sato was ha was a kanryodo sensei one of the last true samuraibureaucrats soon sadly there would be no place for him in the world as japan moved fully into the modern world the last of the kanryodo sensei would die out and in their place would come the new breed the westernized entrepreneurs who understood world economics no longer true japanese at all but world citizens japan would need them in the coming decades these farthinking trendanalyzing dealers if it was to survive past its difficult adolescence these were the men who would remember the policies of reagan and mitterand long after they had forgotten those of ieyasu tokugawa without having seen him nicholas knew that koten the giant sumo had entered the study are you any closer to finding the murderer he had an odd direct style of speech that outside the dohyo at least was stripped of politeness and the traditional niceties unless satosan can summon up the past wholesale nicholas said all i can do is protect him and nangisan koten said nothing nicholas turned saw that the giant was glaring at him he laughed dont worry youll get in your licks it was somewhat of a relief to be able to speak freely again if youre good koten said well work together no one will get past us nicholas said nothing an american here would have boasted about his prowess no one will get past us koten repeated then as he heard sato returning he retired to the hallway the older mans demeanor had altered considerably when he reentered the study all languorousness had melted away in its stead was a high degree of excitement held tightly in check he came swiftly across the room and sat close to nicholas breaking the hostguest barrier i have had some news his voice was very soft but urgent concerning tenchi of course the keiretsu has official protection from the government concerning the project but privately i enlisted the aid of several members of the tenshin shoden katori ryu ninja such as yourself to safeguard our secret he paused for a moment looking around he nodded his head and rose together they went through the open fusuma into the garden the bees were out descending on the peonies the gray plover was long gone from his spot beneath the boxwood tree the sun wove in and out from behind silver and purple clouds a sensei was killed there not long ago along with a student now my contact whose ryu name is phoenix informs me that a second student was killed only yesterday it now appears from what this man tells me that the ryu has been infiltrated infiltrated nicholas echoed the tenshin shoden katori are you certain sato nodded but phoenix was not calling from yoshino hes in the north in hokkaido satos face was grave i fear our last stand against the russians has begun linnearsan you were quite right about their involvement it took phoenix some time to evaluate his situation the death of the jonin he was their spiritual leader he cocked his head did you know him by the purest chance he had the same name as the hero we were discussing once masashigi kusunoki its been many years since ive been at the tenshin shoden katori nicholas said sato looked at him oddly for a moment then shrugged his death was totally unexpected and they were thrown into chaos for a time it took all of phoenixs skill to return absolute order in such a short time meanwhile it seems the soviet agents were doing their work his beefy shoulders were bent as with an incalculable weight we cannot allow tenchi to be infiltrated nicholassan the knowledge that the russians are so close fills me with dread they have the power to destroy us all of us if they discover tenchi what has happened nicholas said in a voice a good deal calmer than he felt phoenix is pursuing one of their agents the last remaining one within the ryu the man has fled north with a topsecret profile of tenchi he is now on hokkaido phoenix has allowed him to go even though the man murdered one of his students in the process he believes the agent will lead him to the soviet local control but you cannot imagine just how dangerous this maneuver is this agent must be stopped by any means before he can pass on that profile viktor protorov nicholas thought i must be at this phoenixs side when he infiltrates the russians base sato will have his secrets back and i will have protorov where is phoenix now precisely sato glanced at him i fathom your intent but if you go i must also that is impossible nicholas said sharply purely from a tactical point sato raised his hand my friend he said softly there has already been too much murder here for me to allow it to go on three human beings people i counted as friends as well as valued work colleagues and indispensable parts of my kobun have ceased to exist because of me that is a heavy burden for anyone to bear while you were gone funerals for all of them were held as well as temporary burials miss yoshida had no family so it was not so bad in her case but the others kagamisan and ishiisan both did they will of course obey my orders to keep the police out of it we do not need the kempeitai in here stomping around in their efforts at investigation but i do not like it i want these people to have proper burials in their family plots can their kami be at rest until then nicholas thought of the afternoon with miss yoshida the sight of her kneeling within a long stones throw of where his own mother and father were buried he resolved to be at her final burial to light joss sticks before her gravestone and to say the prayers of reverence for the safekeeping of her spirit i know where this is all leading nicholas said and i cannot allow it youll stay here where its safe satos laugh was hollow and without humor have you so soon forgotten the wushing my friend thats what koten is here for nicholas said stubbornly do you doubt that he can do the job this has nothing to do with koten or anyone else i am responsible for your safety satosan this is what you wanted it is what we have sworn to sato nodded gravely what you say is true nicholassan you are sworn to protect me and i am sworn to consummate the merger of our kobun without difficulties but this oath only goes so far i am the final arbiter of my life and death you must accede to this you know you must there was a silence for some time a brace of plovers broke cover past satos left shoulder racing into the clouds the wind was picking up and a heaviness was returning to the air unless the wind direction changed abruptly there would be rain again a good deal of it then the oath that binds us is severed it was a desperate ploy one which nicholas feared would not work are you free to walk away then sato smiled by all means do so i will not think ill of you i can force you to stay here and where would you go my friend only i know where phoenix would meet us you could roam all of hokkaido without ever finding either him or the soviet agent there was a deliberate silence then youll still join me i seem to have no choice in the matter good we will take koten and fly to the north island from there a rented car will take us to our final destination which is nicholas said warily a rotenburo an outdoor hot bath my friend sato smiled with real warmth and why not you appear to be in need of some relaxation in the middle of the night the phone sang shrilly in her ear justine who had had trouble falling asleep started awake her mouth was dry and her throat sore as if she had been straining for something or constantly calling out in her dreams she brushed her hand out to the receiver to stop the racket picked up her watch off the nighttable just after threethirty jesus she heard squawking from the phone picked it up as if it were alive justine rick whatre you dont tell me you forgot she put her hand to her head i dont haleakala the dormant volcano you promised i could take you up there but its threethirty in the morning for gods sake rick if we leave now well make it in time for the sunrise thats the time to be up at the crater but i dont want to see the sunrise i youll never know until youre there come on now were wasting precious time weve got to be there by fivethirty justine was about to protest some more but suddenly she felt too tired to try it seemed easier just to go along with him besides she thought wanly maybe it will be fun it certainly proved to be nothing she had expected for one thing just the drive up the winding slope of the volcano was fascinating the summit was two miles up and she could see the terrain changing before her eyes as they ascended rick had cautioned her to dress warmly in slacks and sweater a jacket as well if she had one walking out to the car in the cool but balmy night air she had felt faintly ridiculous being so overdressed it seemed inconceivable to her that there could be any place on this tropical paradise where the temperature was hovering at thirtyfive degrees fahrenheit but as they rose as the terrain metamorphosed from palm tree laden to the dominance of spiky desert cactus to long stands of stately pine trees more appropriate to maine or vermont she was obliged to roll up her window and don her jacket near the crater itself rick switched on the heater they had already passed the tree line and now she looked out on black desolation long ago massive lava slides spewed up from the depths of the earth had rolled slowly downward inundating all in their paths now hardy grasses peeped up here and there through the dark mounded lava but otherwise there was nothing as the car made one switchback after another justine glanced back over her shoulder from this vantage point she could look across the vast undulating slopes of haleakalas base down to the shoreline the crescent beach just beginning to glimmer with an odd kind of phosphorescence and the utterly black feathery silhouettes of the slenderboled palms she had said not a word to rick on the long drive up huddled on her side of the front seat as if she expected him to deliver a blow to her face she was shivering by the time he pulled the car into the wide blacktopped parking lot she put it down to the unnatural cold as they got out she could see the looming spectral shapes spiderweb gantries towers and electronic equipment belonging to various institutions from both the military and the private sectors used for ongoing weather and seismographic study signs bade them to walk slowly cautioning those with heart conditions not to come up this high at all and indeed as they began to walk justine felt a lightness in her head a certain feeling that her lungs were not getting their quota of oxygen a fierce wind tore at them sent paper flapping making breathing that much more difficult she was grateful when they reached the shelter at the top of the wide stairs this was a stone and masonry edifice whose entire eastern face was composed of large panes of glass from this eyrielike observation post they stared out on the blasted landscape of haleakalas craters the area resembled photographs justine had seen of the moons surface more than it did anything she had come to associate with her own planet with no visual fix distances were impossible to judge five miles looked more like five thousands yards it was fantastic people gathered in this small place just as the ancient hawaiians had centuries before to watch the rising of the sun it was on this very spot legend had it that the sun was caught and held hostage released only when it promised to move more slowly over the hawaiian islands to fill them to the brim with its light there was nothing in the sky but darkness there was no hint of change of the ending of night but the sun was coming they all could feel it like a shiver down their spines and then like a foundry being fired one bright red spark speared upward over the intervening rim of haleakalas crater there came an exhalation in concert from the assembled as light came into the world clear and direct and adamantine it was a color that had no earthly analog it took justines breath away she felt as if all gravity were gone and unmoored she was about to float away pale fire crept across the blasted plain of the crater long sweeping shadows impossibly black scored the face of the lava like newly etched cracks there was no gray only the darkness and the light then without any of them knowing quite when it happened the multifaceted illumination they had all been born into and knew well returned to haleakala and just as if it had been some manmade show the event was over now will you forgive me for dragging you out of bed justine and rick leaned on the wooden railing the last two still inside the observation post behind them they could hear the muffled cough of engines as cars started back down the serpentine drive to warm sea breezes im tired she said take me back outside she saw a lone couple at the rim of the crater their arms were around one anothers waists their bodies glued together justine stopped to watch them her attention caught the woman was tall and slim her copper red hair pulled back in a long ponytail the man was dark haired and large muscular even through his windbreaker when the woman moved she did so with the fluid grace of a dancer the man had somewhat of the same quality but justine had lived with nicholas linnear long enough to be able to identify another of his dangerous breed what are you staring at rick followed her gaze and his head went down his gaze swinging away i want that justine said to herself still staring at the lovers moving embracing above the jagged lava cliffs sunlight bathed them as if they were gods tears burned behind her lids and she thought i will not cry in front of him i will not she turned away from the lovers and from him walking quickly down the stairs so that she was gasping for breath by the time she reached the asphalt parking lot by comparison everything here looked banal and uninteresting she got into the car and leaned her head against the window closing her eyes just below the level of the lot rick stopped the car and got out these are silvers words he told her they only grow upcountry he pointed to a fencedoff patch of ground where two or three vertical plants soared from the dark earth true to their name their spiky leaves were a peculiar silvery gray its said that they take twenty years to bloom and then once they do they die justine was staring at the beautiful plants when rick said this and despite her resolve she abruptly dissolved into tears great wracking sobs broke from her trembling lips and she sat down hard on the path her head in her lap justine justine she did not hear him she was thinking of how sad life was for the silversword and then of course how ridiculous that notion was no life was sad for her at her fathers funeral she had felt only relief had thought she was reveling in that relief but now she knew the truth she missed him he was the only father she would ever have he raised her and in his own way she supposed even loved her now he was gone without mourning or a sense of the diminishing of the quality of life or so she had thought she was so smart oh yes the truth was that she was a moron she could no more understand her own emotions than she could anyone elses thats why she was useless to gelda useless as well to nicholas but now was not a time to think of that not yet this was her time to grieve as a little girl who missed her daddy who had always missed him and who could never now say to him how sorry she was that they had not had their time together as was right and fair life was unfair and now she knew it to her roots she could not stop weeping she did not want to her mourning was long in coming for her father as well as for the confused and vulnerable young girl she had been up until this moment her rite of passage was upon her and at long last she was making her torturous way through the thorns and nettles that separated childhood from adulthood slowly as she allowed her long pentup grief to flow through her as she allowed her entire being to feel it wracked with a pain that was almost physical justine began to grow up nangi lay atop his bed in room at the mandarin hotel he was on the island from his sparkling windows he could see victoria harbor and just beyond the clock tower of the star ferry terminal the very southern tip of kowloon and the asian shore somewhere far to the north ultimately in peking no doubt lius masters lived they as well as he would have to be dealt with judiciously the main problem nangi thought was time he did not have very much of it and as long as the communists believed that to be the truth they would sink their teeth into him and never let go what they through liu were asking was patently impossible to give up control of his own keiretsu was unthinkable he had struggled all his adult life conquered innumerable threats neutralized many competitors sent many an enemy to his grave to get to this exalted state yet if there were any other way out for him but to sign that paper he was not aware of it either way he would lose the keiretsu for he knew his company could not long weather the set of pyramiding losses and future pledges in which the accursed anthony chin had enmeshed the allasia bank for all this nangi was calm life had taught him patience he had that rare ability known to the japanese as nariyuki no matsu to wait for the turn of events he believed in christ and he surely was a miracle if he were to lose the keiretsu that was karma his penance for his sins in a previous life for there was nothing tanzan nangi held more dear than his company and yet he was absolutely certain that he would not lose it as had gotaro on their makeshift raft so long ago nangi had faith his agile mind and his faith would see him through this as they had all the other crises in his life nariyuki no matsu a knock on the door did he feel the tides turning or would they continue to run against him until they pushed him far out to sea come in he said its open fortuitous chiu appeared closing the door behind him he wore an oyster gray raw silk suit in the light of day he appeared trim and hard muscled he had a handsome rather narrow face with keen intelligent eyes all in all nangi thought sato had chosen well its seven oclock on the button fortuitous chiu said he stood by the door i am anxious to make a good impression after last night did you finish the translation fortuitous chiu nodded yes sir it was only difficult in parts because as you no doubt already know inflection is infinitely more important than the word itself in chinese you neednt be so formal nangi said fortuitous chiu nodded came across the room grinning there was a great deal on the tape that was wordless someday if the gods permit i would meet this woman she must have been born under a lucky star if her manipulation of this foulsmelling communist son of a diseased dog is any indication ive taken the liberty of ordering breakfast for us both nangi said swinging his legs off the bed with the aid of one hand sit down and join me will you he began pulling small plates out of the food warmer piling them on the table dim sum fortuitous chiu murmured nangi saw that he was impressed being served a traditional chinese breakfast by a japanese the young man sat down in one of the satincovered chairs next to the table and took up his chopsticks while they ate fortuitous chiu spoke of what the tape had revealed to him first i dont know how much information you have on our comrade liu nangi shrugged the basics i suppose im no newcomer to hong kong but i have been unable to call upon the knowledge of my bank president allan su he is not privy to what we do here i dont want him involved until the very last instant nangi paused for a moment marshaling his thoughts lius a member in good standing of the crown colony his varied businesses on the island and in kowloon have brought a great deal of money into hong kong shipping banking printing i believe one of his companies owns a majority of the godowns in kwun tong shoveling a shrimp ball into his mouth fortuitous chiu nodded he munched with the quick short bites of the chinese indeed yes but did you also know that he is the head of the syndicate that owns the frantan the gambling casino in macao the same fortuitous chiu said consuming a doughwrapped quail egg the communists find it most convenient to wash money in and out through the frantan because it allows them to convert bullion into any currency they choose without embarrassing questions being asked some of the tapans here do the same thing though not at the frantan nangis mind was working furiously considering the possibilities he had begun to get an inkling of the tides turning comrade liu and this woman succulent pien are longtime lovers that much is clear fortuitous chiu stuffed a pork roll into his cheek chewing contentedly while he continued to talk the slimeridden sea slug has thought up so many ornate endearments for her it made my head swim he is quite ardent and she nangi inquired ah women fortuitous chiu said as if that covered it all he stacked the empty plates to one side brought other laden ones before him grabbing the soy sauce he shook the bottle vigorously over the dumplings before him then he reached for the fiery chili paste red as blood it has been my experience that one can never tell about women they are born with deceit as a deer is with a cloven hoof they cultivate it like they do a current hairstyle is this not your experience as well nangi said nothing wondering what the young man was getting at well it has been mine fortuitous chiu said just as if nangi had interjected a comment and this one is no exception does she love the communist oh yes i think she does though what she could find of sufficient promise in that liceridden motherless goat i cannot imagine but what she feels for him is i believe irrelevant he cleared another plate pulled another toward him on went the soy sauce and the chili paste that is because it is clear to me that she loves money much more ah said nangi he sensed the tides rolling back and where does she assuage this burning desire from friend liu yes indeed fortuitous chiu nodded he had worked up quite a sweat eating the poxinfested dog enjoys giving her presents but i fear that he is not as generous as our succulent pien would wish thus she wanders afield so i have been told nangi was quick to anger he was walking a fine line here who knows what you do no one but you at last fortuitous chiu was finished he pushed the last plate away from him his face was shiny with grease and sweat but something she said to liu caused me to make enquiries succulent pien lives in the midlevels on po shan road that territory belongs to the green pang triad he produced a white silk handkerchief and carefully wiped his face he grinned it just so happens that my number three cousin is of the green pang i dont want to owe anyone in a triad a favor nangi said no sweat fortuitous chiu washed away his words number three cousin owes his rise in the green pang to my father hes delighted to help no strings attached nangi thought he could go into culture shock talking to this one go on he said it seems that someone else is plowing the same fragrant harbor that comrade liu is and who might that be im not a miracle worker i need some time to find out theyve been very careful to cover their tracks he leered at nangi number three cousin and i may have to do some onsite inspection during the night does the green pang have to be involved ive got no choice its their turf i cant make a bowel movement over at the midlevels without letting them in on it nangi nodded he knew well the power of the triads in hong kong what did succulent pien say to get you started on this redman fortuitous chiu said charles percy redman she used his name know him nangi thought for a moment shipping taipan yes british fellow family goes way back in hong kong thats redman fortuitous chiu acknowledged but what almost no one else knows is that hes an agent for her majestys government redman a spy madonna nangi was genuinely shocked but whats his connection to succulent pien is she somehow raiding him looks that way doesnt it this is all very interesting nangi thought but how does any of it help me with the communists my time is running out if i dont give liu an affirmative by phone by six tonight the deals off ive got no capital the allasia will fail and eventually so will the keiretsu is there more he asked not until i climb into bed with succulent pien and see what shes got between her thighs its a pillow like all the rest nangi observed tartly i need something before six this evening fortuitous chius eyes opened wide no way jose shes home and not going anywhere she had her amah go shopping for her i think shes whipping up a midnight snack for a friend early tomorrow mornings the best i can do im sorry nangi signed deeply not nearly as much im afraid as i am night the dripdrop of rain pattering all around them the sky was black and impenetrable save for a tiny patch a nacreous gray behind which the full moon rode as ghostly as the face of a former lover the warm water moved in minute wavelets up to their bare flesh reflections of the swinging yellow lanterns in the trees behind them in a white spangle diffused and softened to a rich glow by the stream rising all about them a double strand of manmade lights curved like a string of lustrous pearls around the neck of an exotic african princess showed the way toward a black humpbacked shadow rising out of the undulating land and behind its bulk must be the sea for nicholas could already scent the salt tang sato stirred beside nicholas sending soft ripples away from them both out there he said softly tell me that sight is not one of the most beautiful in the world a sight that makes japan unique nicholas followed the direction saw the steep falloff of the cliffs down to the pacific and on its heaving bosom the rhythmic bobbing of tiny orange lanterns hung from the prows and the sterns of the squid boats as their masters and crews bent to their task they seem as small and fleeting as fireflies nicholas said his eyes were somnolent it had been a long hard day full of anxiety and fear for his friends life and now the hot water was working its magic on his tensed body loosening his knotted muscles the cords in his neck and shoulders relaxing the days accumulated tension leeching away from him it was not that his anxiety about allowing sato to come had disappeared entirely but with him here and koten guarding the front of the rotenburo he felt more confident than he had at the outset sato luxuriated in feeling good he stretched his long legs outward into the gently swirling water sighing deeply with the sense of wellbeing this spa engendered in him it was then he felt something against his left calf soft and warm bumping bumping bumping with an odd kind of insistence languidly he leaned forward imagining himself a crane gliding through the currents of a narrow inlet to the sea his searching fingers grasped what felt at first like a bed of seaweed curious sato drew it upward slowly it had great weight the rain let up racing clouds became visible as the lanterns glow illuminated their billowing undersides now they slid apart and the cool opalescent light of the pocked moon crowned the silhouette of what he dragged upward from the steaming water satos muscles bulged with the effort and he was obliged to use his hands even with nicholas helping him struggling with the monstrously heavy thing that now fell across his legs beneath the water slowly it rose like a specter out of the deep and nicholas made a sharp movement beside him grunting oh buddha sato whispered his hands shook so much that droplets flew from the thing like rain off the great tiger curving around one shoulder flung down the muscular back the extended talons of the rear paws indented along the buckled ridge of the spine movement as if the colored tattoo had come alive ohwhat have they done to you phoenix sato cried softly those eyes milky and unseeing in death fixed him as the bloated face rose glittering in the moonlight the teeth clamped together in pain and determination akiko was thinking about the promise she had made to saigo or more precisely to saigos kami she rolled over on her futon passing ah arm across her eyes red light blotted out the darkness giri it bound her like steel manacles not for the first time she found herself wishing that she had not been born japanese how free it must be to be american or english and not feel gin because akiko knew that if she did not feel giri she would not be bound by it but she was japanese samurai blood flowed through her veins oh not the blood of the famed ofuda she had chosen that name upon her majority for much the same reason that justine had chosen to call herself tobin instead of tomkin she wished to conceal her past but had there ever been a time when she had thought of herself as akiko shimada she did not even know her mothers last name in fuyajo only given names were used and oftentimes those were not real ones ikan had her mother been born with that name had she taken it inside fuyajo or what was just as likely had those who ran the castle that knows no night assigned it to her she put her hands down between her thighs cupping herself she could still feel the aftertremors the expansion of her inner flesh that nicholas stroking had caused she would never be the same now and terrifyingly was not sure that she wanted to be then what of her vow revenge had shaped so much of her life had given her purpose when she thought that she had none without the solace of revenge to warm her soul she might have withered and died those who had driven her out of fuyajo were long dead put to endless sleep as she hovered over them in the night but they were old men and that was not true justice as she saw it she could do nothing about their longevity to her way of thinking they had seen the procession of too many days still she had avenged herself life must have a shape revenge was her destiny she must have been someone evil in a previous life she had thought for her karma in this one to be so unremitting now nicholas linnear threatened that dark harmony she supposed that she had known it from the moment she had first seen him in person at jan jan he had melted a heart she had thought made of granite and ice she thought in her arrogance that she was beyond love she was wrong as she wept on her futon in the otherwise deserted house of her husband and her prey she beseeched the amida buddha only for absolution and death for the thought oh buddha the knowledge that she could love just like any other mortal sent waves of panic through her she had set her life on a certain course believing specific things about herself but now the ache she felt through to the core of her spirit whenever she thought of nicholas linnear which was to say all the time blasted her in the furnace of revelation for she was sworn to destroy him she thought about turning away from her vow of letting peace flow down around her she dreamed of surcease but then she parted her naked thighs and stared down at the delicate flesh of their insides on each writhed a flaming horned dragon multicolored tattoos of fantastic workmanship and she knew that peace was not for her or love either for kyoki had marked her soul just as surely as he had her flesh there was no hope of surcease she had had her respite the one lull in the storm and for that time had reveled in the joy of another life giri bound her heart and spirit what had begun must be seen to its final conclusion she thought of saigo again standing strong and handsome in the forest glade in kyushu the sunlight striking his shoulders silvering his hair how his presence had altered her life she rose and went through the silent house it already seemed dead and buried the thick bars of sunlight beating against the closed panes of glass seeking entry but this was a house of the dead the sun no longer held any dominion here akiko glided from room to room as if fixing each space each object in her mind for the last time she touched everything she moved everything in this manner she came upon the mini tape recorder by which koten had been eavesdropping on her husband when she rewound the tape and pressed play she heard all that phoenix had said to sato rain puckered the skin of the rotenburo splashing against their shoulders beating against the tops of their heads neither of them felt a drop in the distance the beckoning amber lights of the squid boats winked on and off through the downpour as nicholas and sato hauled on phoenixs corpse pulling it slowly out of the heated water amida sato whispered through the sibilance of the rain and scrambled hastily out of the pool holding the small patch of cloth over his groin while he searched in the wetness and the dark for another one he returned as quickly as he could to where the ninja was stretched out by the side of the rotenburo his legs crossed at the ankles his arms spread wide sato placed the small square over phoenixs private parts the indignity of it he murmured as he hunkered down beside nicholas there was no one else about the rain had seen to that this is no way to die it was not how he would choose to go nicholas said and pointed look here a hole black and gaping disfigured the back of phoenixs head this was done by no samurai sato looked sadly down at the corpse white and bloated spat upon by the storm it could be a kgb execution his voice was a trifle unsteady i had a cousin once in the kempeitai he knew all about such things and he told me a bullet through the brain thats the russian style whoever did it nicholas observed had to be very good indeed this man was ninja sensei sato put his head in his hands he had information for us perhaps he got careless he was certain that the soviets had no knowledge of his pursuit he had to have been surprised here he would never have died otherwise this could not have happened in a pitched battle they were here waiting for him sato lifted his head his eyes were red rimmed and perplexed but how nicholas did not like the answer he was about to give if theres a traitor in the keiretsu perhaps he is closer than that inside your kobun nonsense sato said no one from my kobun absolutely no one knew where i was going phoenixs call came to the house only you were there akiko and koten koten satos eyes were wide all around oh buddha no then he considered he has been with me the last three or four times phoenix phoned he shook his head but even so i took great pains to make certain i was alone when we spoke you mean it was impossible for him to eavesdrop well no i mean sato slammed fist into palm koten is sensei of sumai the most ancient form of his art combat sumo phoenix knew him trusted him he looked to the sky muhonnin he cried between them steam rose slowly from phoenixs cooling body and it seemed as if the twisted multicolored tattoo that covered his shoulder and back was rising with the mist the only part of him still alive he must pay sato said he knows where phoenix would have led us and ill make him tell us he was up and running before nicholas could stop him beyond the rotenburos terraced tract the lights of the squid fleet had disappeared and now only swirling darkness sought to engulf them the lights of the swinging lanterns in the trees surrounding the pool were smeared by the slanting rain some of them had already gone out felled by the strengthening wind satosan nicholas called as he ran but it was useless the wind tore his words from his lips and in any case sato was not about to listen to reason tenchi was far too important to him and there was no time for caution nicholas raced across the open expanse between the camphor trees that lined the walkways to the pool there was no sound but the moaning of the wind and the heavy beating rain nicholas concentration narrowed as he slewed into the dimly lit locker room koten master of sumo and the more deadly sumai would need less than three seconds with sato to put him away and thus nicholas anxiety level was high that was the only explanation as to why he did not sense the surreptitious sound until quite late and then it was actually the movement of shadow on the periphery of his vision that alerted him he whirled just in time to duck away swivel to his right heard the whirr as of a bright insect the brief puff of wind at its passage the soft thunk just behind and to the left of him indicated the position of the thrown shuriken ninja that meant that phoenixs quarry the muhonnin who had fled the tenshin shoden katori was still here then there was still a chance to keep tenchi alive and out of reach of the russians nicholas followed his instincts his working muscles gleaming with beaded water and sweat he set off after his adversary he wanted to come to close quarters with him as quickly as possible in order to negate the advantage of the longrange shuriken he twisted and turned through the tunnellike labyrinth of the rotenburos corridors sliding and sometimes crawling on his belly always mindful of breaking up any rhythm to his movements twice he heard the buzzing passage of shuriken quite near him and he redoubled his efforts knowing from the sounds that he was closing in but it was a bad situation and growing worse all the time where was sato his absence was a constant distraction and any kind of distraction was dangerous in battle he skidded around the end of a row of metal lockers thinking about getting to his locker and his daikatana and felt a blow strike his shoulder numbing it momentarily he cursed himself mightily as he slid forward seeming to skid out of control on the damp floor the bulk of the oncoming shadow careened past him just above nicholas torqued his torso lifting his right arm in a blur the elbow locked the heel of his hand leading crashing into flesh and bone he heard a heavy grunt and simultaneously felt the crash of a weight to his left he twisted using his knees and ankles using the chrysanthemum to bring power back into his frame he rained blows onto the form which crouched in the darkness in the lee of the lockers he felt the satisfying smack of flesh against flesh and began a series of interlocking strikes abruptly there was a blow to the side of his head and when he reached out again the form was gone he rose to his feet swaying his senses questing went instinctively into getsumei no michi and found the spirit of the ninja he was moving away from nicholas why then he had the answer and his heart constricted in anxiety loosing the kiai shout that rocked the walls of the rotenburo nicholas raced through the darkened interior tearing after terror sato had found the interior of the rotenburo deserted where was koten where was the muhonnin anger burned through him like a sun he gritted his teeth the deep feeling of betrayal powering him feeding adrenaline into him he burst out into the night filled with swirling rain no one was about not even the proprietors koten he wanted to cry out im going to kill you slowly so that i can watch your face as life ebbs out of you into the parking lot he ran two or three cars remained beneath the lights he wiped at his eyes to clear them all the cars were empty then his gaze came to rest on the rented vehicle they had used to drive here from the airport koten sitting in kingly silence dry beneath the opening heavens unthinking sato ran toward the car skidding once on the slick tarmac almost wrenching his back all breath went out of him for a moment then with a grunt he lifted himself off one knee and loped the rest of the way to the dripping car now he shouted koten reaching for the chrome handle wrenching the door open there was a sharp click as distinct as a dry twig cracking on a forest floor and the night erupted into a fireball of orange and crimson flames the car ballooned outward coming apart in hot twisting shards of metal and pinpoint fragments of sprayed safety glass the ignition instantly disintegrated the rubberized mannikin in the front seat a sharp report like a cannon shot and then a trailer of dense black smoke oily and twisting ascending into the full force of the storm the body looked enormous a lumped animal throwing a deep shadow across the surrounding stone ah about it shards of glass glittered like stars arcing tiny rainbows into the cold overhead illumination three uniformed men from the raleigh city police stood around taking notes while the fourth half in half out of one of the squad cars was on the twoway radio a pair of backup units squealed to a haltbeside him and the cops inside emerged and began to set up sawhorse barriers against the growing knots of curious onlookers harry saunders the sergeant on the twoway wrapped up his conversation with his captain and threw the mike on the car seat as he backed out of the unit his face was set in hard lines as he ambled slowly back to his three buddies might as well burn those pads he told them as he approached aint gonna be any use those notes how dyou mean bob santini said still scribbling in his flipup pad someone coming any minute now to take over captain says this isnt anyve our business now santinis head came up and he glowered at saunders you mean a man is killed and we just walk away from it saunders shrugged funny you should say that cause i asked the captain the selfsame question he screwed up his face know what he told me wouldnt do no good no matter what we did his finger stabbed out in the general direction of the corpse this poor sumbitchs got no prints got no history at all hes a nothing a big fat zero a spook ed baine said now thats interesting well you just take your interest somewhere else saunders said cause after we beak up here not even our wives or in your case baine your gf are supposed to know anything that went on here oh shit spinelli said with mock disgust no pillow talk now whatm i supposed to do afterwards do what you always do shithead baine said roll over and go to sleep saunders head turned sit on it your clowns he said sotto voce we got company they all turned their heads saw a trenchcoated figure coming down the corridor none of them liked what they saw oh holy christ spinelli said under his breath its a fuckin woman gentlemen she said as she came up whos in charge here detective sergeant harry saunders maam saunders said taking a step forward at ease sergeant she said with a straight face im not about to make a grab for your clusters she took a quick look around anything been touched here no maam hes just as you found him exactly saunders nodded and then swallowed angry at himself for being drymouthed in front of this woman can i ask what your er affiliation is she turned away from him running her gaze carefully across the area immediately surrounding the body you may ask your captain that sergeant saunders he may be more willing to assuage your curiosity saunders clenched his teeth biting back a sour comment while spinelli smirked at him from a distance sergeant she was kneeling down now beside the corpse i wont need your help anymore why dont you and your men retire to the barricades and assist with crowd control ill call you if i need you yes maam saunders said with exaggerated politeness and turning sharply jerked his head at the other three who followed him silently down the faintly echoing corridor of the mall to where their units red lights flashing were parked when they were gone tanya vladimova confirmed her initial id the body was indeed that of jesse james quickly she opened up a small kit and set about taking a set of prints off the bloody glass shard that still pierced james chest for the first time she allowed herself to think of what had gone wrong but she knew the answer without having to go through any process at all it had been foolish to allow alix logan to live foolish and from a security point of view sloppy but men were weak she thought now even a man as powerful and intelligent as c gordon minck it had been minch after all who had insisted she be kept alive over tanyas vigorous protests and not for any humanitarian reasons but because he had been making love to her on a regular basis flying into key west on clandestine weekends when he was supposed to be sailing his boat on the chesapeake like scheherazade alix logan had wrapped minck up and in so doing had stayed the date of her execution pajalsta zameretse no myeste gospadin linnear please stay where you are mr linnear he saw the gun muzzle looming dark and impossibly large if you make a move i will shoot you dead nicholas was not giving away any knowledge he had of the language so he took a step in the direction of the gun the night exploded for a second time and a clot of asphalt screamed upward erupting in flying fragments so close they stung his ankles and calves i know you can understand me gospadin linnear the next shot will take off the top of your head to his left the twisted remains of the rental car lay partially on its side smoke coiled about its stark sculpture like a loosed cage of serpents nicholas body had twitched when he had heard the muffled explosion the reaction of an animal in flight for its life skidding out into the night he had confronted the dying flames of the initial fireball blackened parts of seiichi sato lay smoldering in three separate spots on the tarmac rain pounded it all charred flesh and scorched metal into rivulets black against the black of the parking lot immediately he had ducked back into the concealing shadows of the rotenburos cedar eaves the russian with a sharp eye and even sharper ear had found him anyway nicholas suspected that this had been the one who had executed phoenix after koten had incapacitated him he was carrying one of the newest of the kalishnikovs the akl a short doublebarreled shotgun that threw antipersonnel projectiles it was so compact it could be used with one hand there was absolutely nothing nicholas could do against it so he came out into the night and was pelted by the rain thats better the voice said still speaking russian now i dont have to guess where you are with that thing all you need is a guess nicholas said precisely nicholas could see him now a tall squareshouldered man most probably a soldier judging by his bearing and gait in a long blackbelted raincoat he wore no hat and nicholas could see his face clearly in the harsh spill of the overhead lights beak of a nose below brows that would in middle age become beetling and would dominate his rather handsome face now that face was dominated by wideapart pale blue eyes the russian smiled thinly i am interested in intelligent men no matter what their ideological perversion his head gave a formal nod pyotr alexandrovitch russilov i was expecting protorov he had only words to work with at the moment and he intended to make the most of them russilovs face closed down his amiable expression wiped away what do you know of protorov how did you know i spoke russian nicholas countered lets have an exchange of information the russian spat gestured with the akl youre in no position to bargain move out farther into the light nicholas did as he was told he sensed movement behind him in the doorway to the building and a moment later koten emerged he looked transformed in the bad light it appeared as if his already considerable girth had been added to his shoulders enormously wide humped with unnatural muscle then as he came out from beneath the dripping eaves nicholas saw that he had a body slung across his shoulders using a short stepping trot he moved easily with his burden keeping away from russilovs line of sight finally depositing the body at the russians feet like a retriever the ninja is beyond reclamation it was odd to hear him speaking russian that one he shrugged in nicholas direction hit him once too often russilov did not even glance downward did you find it koten held up a tightly rolled oilskin pouch it looked minuscule in his huge fist it came out of him when he died and then he laughed a highpitched squeak seeing the russians hesitation go on take it he proffered the thing in his open palm it looked no less tiny the rains washed it clean quickly with his free hand russilov pocketed the cylinder and there goes tenchi nicholas thought he remembered satos words they have the power to destroy us all of us if they discover tenchi what was tenchi that its infiltration by a foreign power could ignite a world war nicholas knew that he must find out and soon kotens dark eyes slid toward nicholas shall i take care of him now keep away from him russilov said sharply koten glowered at him youve just lost him face pyotr alexandrovitch nicholas said the two of you are far too dangerous to pit one against the other really this exchange was beginning to interest him how in the world did this kgb operative know so much about him surely you cant have a file on me im a private citizen oh russilovs dark eyebrows lifted then what are you doing here satosan and i are were friends as well as business partners and thats all the russians voice was brimming with irony there was no point in keeping things at this level that car bomb couldntve been meant only for sato theres no way you could have been certain that just he would be at the car when he opened the door if you went so much the better as long as we got this he patted the pocket where he had dropped the packet we didnt need either of you if our agent had been intercepted by phoenix or myself oh i believe koten here would have found some way to deter you but as i was saying had our agent been intercepted we would have brought you in if you want to live nicholas observed youd do well to shoot me now i plan to then youll never know the modifications we recently made in tenchi we for the first time russilov seemed uncertain why do you think tomkin industries is merging one of its companies with sato petrochemicals not for the sheer pleasure of it i assure you youre lying the russian said i dont know anything about this of course you dont nicholas thought but you cant be sure and if you dont get me to protorov it might be a grave error time is short this is no time to blunder well there is something you dont know then part of his training had been in speaking just as kiai was used as a war shout to terrify and in some cases paralyze ones opponent so there was a more subtle offshoot ichi in this case it meant position because of what the wielder could accomplish with inflection and intonation it was immensely difficult to master this combined with the fact that ichi was often affected by outside factors beyond the wielders control made it virtually a lost art akutagawasan had among other things been an ichi sensei and he had seen in nicholas an apt and willing pupil i was beginning to think of gospadin protorov as omniscient he thought that ichi just might save his life now kill him koten growled shoot him now or i will kill him for you quiet you russilov said he had not taken his eyes off nicholas during the entire exchange he cocked his head come here comrade linnear he said as thunder rumbled east to west above their heads the rain beat down on them silvered as it spun through the lights you are going to get your wish after all and nicholas thought protorov kumamoto asama kogen switzerland autumnwinter spring this is how akiko came to save saigos life and how he paid her back in kind the autumn of was a cold and dismal one filled with an inordinate amount of rain sleet and even snow premature and the color of silver dying upon the ground like stranded carp already in kyushu where sun hsiung sent akiko for the next phase of her training the farmers were hard at work atop stained wooden ladders spinning delicate cocoons of retted linen gauze over their precious trees to keep them from winters harsh hand it was unusual to see them at this so relatively early in the year and like the unpredictable inclement weather it boded ill for the coming winter whose expected virulence had been spoken of in hushed whispers throughout the countryside ever since summer evaporated overnight like woodsmoke mist shrouded this part of kyushu so thoroughly that upon her arrival akiko could discern neither mount aso nor the giant smokestacks of the vast industrial complex sprawled through the valley to the northwest of the city she hated kumamoto immediately once in feudal times perhaps it had possessed a certain charm but in these days of japans mighty economic leap forward the blued patina of industrial wastes coating the old buildings were merely a reminder of how tiny a backwater kumamoto really was nevertheless akiko had resigned herself to be here at the kanaka na ninjutsu ryu its symbol was a circle within which were nine black diamonds within the open heart of them was the kanji ideogram komuso and when she saw it she knew the kujikiri black ninjutsu there was difficulty even with sun hsiungs personal chop affixed to her letter of introduction the sennin an axfaced individual who appeared to be almost unhealthily thin let her cool her heels for fully half a day before he summoned her within his chamber then he was most effusive in his apologies in his eyes akiko could discover nothing not even the basic spark that distinguished human beings from the less sentient creatures of the earth and alone kneeling before him on a bare reed tatami she began to feel at last a sadness she needed some time to identify at length she was surprised to discover that she missed sun hsiung and part of her wished that she had never left his warm and comfortable house and yet there was a stronger more urgent desire which had driven her from comfort and warmth it was her karma to be here now she knew that as well and did not question it acceptance was all she had of her own now for his part the sennin despised her on sight and silently cursed her former sensei for evoking his right of privilege here there was absolutely no question of sending her away though the sennin wished most fervently for such an occurrence his only hope he correctly detected was if the training here and the life were too rigorous too taxing both emotionally and physically for this woman he shuddered inwardly and tried not to think about her presence here the inevitable disruption of discipline and ritual her wa would cause even now he could sense the peculiarly female flux of her spirit experiencing it almost as a painful interruption in the confluence of forces he and those beneath him had labored so long and hard to perfect therefore he smiled as benignly as he was able and with an inward exclamation of delight consigned her into the care of the one pupil who at the very least would drive her out of kumamoto the sennin watched unblinking as she bowed formally and rose as he watched her retreating back he smiled to himself his thoughts on the best of possibilities regarding his newest students fate that saigo would destroy her not literally of course for had that occurred the sennin would have lost enormous face with sun hsiung and that he could not have tolerated no no if he knew anything about his pupils he had chosen correctly there was a peculiar and somewhat frightening demon which rode saigos back its talons sunk so deeply that the sennin had given up trying to exorcise its presence let the haunted one as saigo was known privately by a number of the sennin drive the unwanted female out let it be her choice that way face was saved all around the sennin could take no blame from sun hsiung and the female could return with honor to the areas for which she was best suited the tea ceremony and perhaps flower arranging the moment akiko came up to him in the dojo and told him of his assignment saigo knew the low regard in which he must be held by the sennin this was an outcasts work he thought darkly holding the hand of a female student he glared at her as anger and resentment welled up in him for her part akiko sensed immediately that she had been directed into the tigers den her wa contracted at the icy contact with saigos hostile emanations and she knew that in order for her to survive here she must first win him over and then one by one do the same with every individual at the ryu akiko spent more of her time that afternoon observing him as he took her on a tour of the ryu which was in effect a world within a world a secret dojo in the middle of a basically industrial town wrapped in the trappings of a drab and windowless warehouse there were no other students or sennin about when they completed their rounds i want you to stay here he told her while i go out on an errand she nodded in acquiescence make no sound while i am gone and especially when i return what is happening without warning he hit her a heavy blow on the side of the face akiko staggered backward and fell on one hip saigo stood over her his feet apart his body totally relaxed do you wish to ask a question his voice was mocking possessing an edge to it that caused akiko to shudder inwardly she made no sound or movement grunting in some satisfaction saigo turned and departed when she was alone akiko sank immediately into shinki this involved keeping her tanden that part of her called the second brain by some sensei the reflex control center immobile in this way she detached a part of herself from the area where she burned after a moment of intense concentration she felt no more pain slowly she rose staring at the door through which he had departed of course she had felt the spit of his spirit microseconds before that vicious emanation had been transmogrified into physical action she could have easily dodged the blow but what good would that have done saigos anger would have been further fueled and he would have come after her with more serious intent besides she sensed that he was a man so unsure of his own masculinity that he needed to physically dominate those people around him men and women alike if she was ever to find an accommodation with him she must first allow his natural tendencies to be made manifest to her only then could she choose her own strategy and then could she tame him saigo was gone several hours during that time all light left the sky the day burned out like the dregs of a roman candle it was dinnertime and akiko found herself hungry since there was no food here she padded silently into the dojo and opening her bag dressed in her allblack gi she did forty minutes of centristic meditation leading ultimately to shinki kiitsu the unity of soul mind and body that is so essential to reaching the very apex of all martial arts she felt the weight of the universe collecting in her lower abdomen shitahara she breathed in jitsu fullness out kyo emptiness strike at the precise moment you feel kyo in your enemy sun hsiung had said strike at the precise moment you feel jitsu in yourself thus will victory be assured yet he had told her over and over if you are so foolish and full of ego that you allow yourself to think of victory then you are undone attach your awareness on saika tanden the breath of the void from that central nothingness all strategies may be observed and formulated she did ninety minutes of formal exercise increasing in difficulty until she was sweating profusely working on her quickness and her timing coordinating the two alternating them and then combining them in sets of three then six then nine rapidfire attacks and defenses then because she was still a student still learning because some essentials still had to be thought about consciously rather than accomplished as second nature without any volition at all she returned to saika tanden from her bag she unfurled a length of strong cotton it was sun hsiungs only gift to her which she folded twice and wrapped with deft economical movements about her abdomen so that the upper edge just touched the bottom ribs on either side it was very tight it was a cincture a constraint she worked on inhaling as deeply as she could down into her bowels she sat crosslegged her body soft and pliable her shoulders curved and relaxed her torso bent well forward so that the tip of her nose hung approximately over her navel saika tanden every breath she takes and breathing was what consumed her still when her keen hearing detected soft padding outside the metal door in a moment the grate of the padlock could be heard jitsu kyo fullness emptiness in and out she heard saigo in the dojo and her head came up she focused fully on him get up he whispered come here he stood just inside the closed door she did just as she was told rising and unwrapping the cloth she treasured though it was quite plain and could be bought at any neighborhood store folding it reverently she place it inside her loose black cotton blouse and moved to stand beside saigo listen he said his voice was as indistinct as the buzz of a mosquito in the distance they both stood quite still she would have known not to utter a sound even had he not cautioned her against doing so hours before there was nothing but the slight tickle of sawdust a remnant of the original use to which this old building had been put no sounds from the streets three stories below made it through the thick walls and massive floorboards it was as silent as a tomb someone coughed and again akiko heard soft footfalls from behind the door she glanced at saigo whose entire being was focused at the closed door and what lay beyond who was there akiko wondered she listened what is it where are we a female voice whispered come on male voice then more insistently though no more loudly come on presence faded but akiko had at least a semblance of the two spirits male and female yin and yang hate burned itself across saigos face turning him into a gargoyle so much hate twisting him she thought eating him up inside hate was an emotion that she could understand perhaps it was at this moment that she saw them as soulmates akiko and saigo they were meant for each other werent they after a while the chalkiness flushed from his face and he was about to speak again but strangely he said nothing further of the incident you waited he said isnt that what you wanted me to do she watched his eyes which were like dead stones at the bottom of a silkskinned lake if it were true that the eyes were windows to the soul then saigo had surely been born without one she saw no anima there only the gyring of emotions dead weight like a corpse at the gibbet he nodded and she saw that he was pleased he felt wrongly that his physical strike had caused her to acquiesce someone else of his personality type would have relaxed then but he did not akiko noted that its late he said time to leave get dressed he did not turn away as she got out of her gi she felt his stony gaze on her at every moment as she peeled down she had never felt the intense sense of embarrassment about her naked body that most japanese apparently did yet she was acutely conscious of saigos presence his scrutiny it was not prurience she felt from him exactly at least not in the sense of simple lust that she would have had no trouble understanding on the other hand there was no sense of a cold calculating inventory of all her parts being made that too would have made some sense to her he was of another type entirely one with which she had had no prior experience when she was fully undressed and toweling herself off she confronted him turning to him face to face what is it here that fascinates you so as she said this she twisted the towel back over her shoulder so there was nothing for him to miss if its sex youre talking about he said ive had my share of it he seemed to be staring at a point below her navel perhaps at the spot where her curling glossy pubic hair began i dont give it that freely she said simply what makes you think id give it to you youre naked arent you you barely know me if i was like this and i did know you well she observed thered be far more of a chance you mean this isnt an invitation if you want me thats your problem she said beginning to pull on her clothes it was you who did not allow me the privacy to undress he watched her for a moment then abruptly swung away striding to the metal door he unlocked it and busied himself with unfastening the square symbol of the ryu from the door he put it aside and began to work on the crimson lacquer so that no marks of its presence remained akiko was curious but knew better than to ask him why he was going to the trouble of erasing all evidence of the ryus presence in the warehouse since this thirdfloor door was the only one that led out to a landing and the outside it was the only one that concerned him dressed akiko picked up her bag and went out past him she watched him carefully padlock the door i have no place to stay she said he gave her a key out of his pocket theres a spare bedroom he said dont touch anything else in the house he wrote a street address down for her wait for me he said i dont know when ill be back three weeks later they were in the countryside surrounded by mandarin orange groves much of the southern island was still rural retaining a high degree of the old ways saigo said he liked that even this far south the snow lay heavily banked glossy on its surface crackling underfoot with the thinnest crust of ice as delicate as ming porcelain in the moonlight it was luminescent pushing back the spectral darkness their breath hung in the air their words made visible in albescent puffs as connected as an island chain much had changed in akikos life in this time and she wondered if the same could be so for him with almost any other person she would have known the answer it had begun three weeks ago when he had come back deep into the night opening the house door with absolute silence akiko had been dreaming but even so his spirit obtruded into the beta level in which her mind drifted while her consciousness slept she opened her eyes and was fully awake this had never surprised her because she had been born with the ability but it confounded others saigo standing in the shadows just inside the doorway said were you asleep if he were any good at all he would know the answer to that so she said no you wanted me to wait for you i did he came into the room on the balls of his feet and she felt the spitting of his spirit again the anarchic emanations of a spiteful child she did not flinch from him or give any sign no matter how remote that she knew of his intent to do so would remove her greatest power over him also it would frighten him and she could not afford that after he had hit her and assuaged his own weaknesses he said there is a package outside go and fetch it his voice was absolutely normal akiko got up and went past him as she did so she felt the dullness of his spirit like a sated serpent dozing on the stoop she found to her surprise a young girl of herown age she was leaning against the doorframe and she was shivering putting one arm around her akiko took her inside the young girl stumbled over the doorjamb and fell heavily against akiko who was obliged to support her entirely for three or four steps the young girl was late in recovering and in the warm lamplight inside akiko looked at her her face was beautiful but as dulled as saigos spirit the pupils of her large eyes were heavily dilated and there was a subtle musk emanating from between her half open lips she is drugged akiko said indeed his reaction was no more than if she had said shes japanese put her to bed he said a trifle wearily she will share your room without another word akiko did as he ordered her when she had put the young girl to sleep on the one cotton futon wrapping her carefully in wool blankets she returned to the living room she watched saigo he had sunk onto the tatami his snowcovered coat crumpled around him like a frozen lily his chin was on his chest and his head was nodding his eyes were not quite closed for a moment akiko wondered what would happen if she took him now she knew that she could do it and if that were to be her strategy she would find no better time he was at full kyo but at that moment his head snapped up and he glared at her like a viper poised to strike immediately sensing the acute danger she washed her mind of taking the offensive and sinking down knelt before him her hands open and in her lap his eyes became hooded and at last he had fallen asleep akiko dozed as well but once she awoke just before dawn her attention focused across from her saigo still slept his breathing deep and regular and slow still she could not rid herself of the feeling that he continued to watch her work at the dojo was difficult in the extreme all life there appeared to come to a stop when she approached all were polite to her but there was no harmony when she was about and no one was more aware of this than she she felt that the sensei distrusted her and the students disliked her there was no help they would give her if it were not a matter of face that they do so she had never felt so alone adrift absolutely cut off from everything and everyone it was as if she were an iceberg in the tropics that the sun refused to melt if she existed at all for them it was as a wound which refused to heal they wished her gone and she knew it still she refused to knuckle under the force of their combined will men had never dictated the course of her life and she was not about to allow them to now she had fought against that perhaps from the moment of her birth her will was cast in the terrible shades of steel a thousandfold that went into the creation of the katana the sword of honor did they actually think that they could break her but oh how they tried for a start the sensei put her in with the slowest group of students those young men who akiko judged would be forced to leave the ryu within six months inside an hour she had made an astoundingly accurate assessment of their abilities all were at a lower level than she was it was a deliberate slap in the face but rather than allow herself to feel humiliation she resolved to use this maneuver to her own advantage as any student new to a particular ryu will do she sat silent and rapt during the senseis lessons watching with concentration the exercises and later the strikedefense combinations being illustrated all of this was material that sun hsiung had taught her and which she had mastered years ago her mien was that of the learning student attempting to absorb the new and complicated for the moment she was content to give them what they expected when it came her time to practice the moves the sensei gave way to one of the students in the class another deliberate slap in the face for all who had gone before her had worked directly with the sensei she was given a polished wooden pole perhaps half the thickness of a bokken the wooden kendo practice sword and three times as long she arranged herself on the polished wooden floorboards encompassed by wood she did not ignore this aspect of her surroundings taking her cue from the qualities of hardwood that the japanese most prized flexibility and durability went into shinki kiitsu and lifting her pole at the last possible instant she easily knocked the student off his feet as he attacked within the silence surrounding the class the sensei sent the next boy at her the result was the same though she varied her response to his attack now the sensei sent two of his pupils at her at once akiko still knelt staring straight ahead she did not have to turn her head in order to know where the second student was or what he was doing shinki kiitsu revealed his strategy to her both her fists gripped the wooden pole lightly yet firmly at its exact center this was essential because she was employing the fulcrum concept and balance was crucial she kept her place at a disadvantage because she did not have her feet but there was a lot she could do with her upper torso concentrating on the void she felt the advancement from behind her she torqued her shoulders dipping her right side and bringing it up to increase momentum and thus power the pole whistled through the air slammed into the students rib cage sending him flying the opposite end of the pole now the lower end began its upward swing at just that moment its rounded end jamming lightly into the oncoming second students throat he sat down hard on his buttocks a stunned look on his face it was only then as her concentration broke its intense focus that she became aware of the interest from other quarters of the dojo what she had thought to be an isolated incident had been observed by fully threequarters of the ryu but if she suspected that the sensel of her class would now accord her the honor of performing against him she was mistaken again the school sought to subtly humiliate her the sensei bade her rise taking the pole from her he led her across the dojo floor to where saigos class was working he left her in care of another sensei a dourfaced individual with severe pockmarks across his cheeks and chin he bowed formally to her welcome he said though he did not for a moment mean it it was as if she were a gaijin in her own country his hardcalloused hand as yellow as tallow extended please be kind enough to assume kokyu suru kokyu suru was an attack stance but as with all japanese words and phrases it had another meaning it also meant breathe jinsan the student he had named stepped forward bowing toward his sensei hai it seems that ofudasan has been inadvertently put in the wrong class through an administrative oversight we do not wish for such an occurrence to happen again would you be so kind as to convince us that with us she has found her proper place so saying he retreated to the edge of the circle formed by the rest of the class out of the corner of her eye akiko could see saigo standing relaxed and calm was he curious about how she would fare in his more advanced class was he wishing that it were he instead of jinsan who had been chosen to test her there was no bowing done within this dojo circle as there would be in any other form of martial discipline in japan they were ninja here the code of bushido the creed of the samurai was meaningless to them though honor was not jinsan stood facing her his feet apart to about the width of his shoulders his fisted hands were held before him at waist height the left cupped over the right there was something disturbing in this stance that akiko could not quite put her finger on then he moved and were it not for the fact that she could read his spirit anticipating his physical strike she would have been finished even before she had a chance to parry as it was she barely made it her foreknowledge allowed her to both prepare her spirit and focus her attention on the unknown therefore she saw the glint of the manrikigusari literally the chain with the strength of ten thousand men consisting of two feet of handforged iron chain with threeandonehalfinch bluntended weights attached to each end and now she knew what had disturbed her about jinsans stance it was gohonokamae one of the openings or kamae in spike and chain fighting jinsan was already halfway toward her his arms spread so that the manrikigusari hung in a loose arc between his fists he would seek makiotoshi she knew winding the chain about her neck because not only was it essential that he defeat her but also that he do so quickly and decisively she did not make the mistake of trying to grab for the chain she knew that she could expect only a weight in her eye for her trouble or if she were foolish enough to manage a twohanded grasp crushed knuckles therefore she sought to ignore the manrikigusari entirely as a target she bent her torso only slightly and to the side not as he had expected away from the attack this allowed some of her own momentum to build up while she came inside the attack using her left side as a wedge combined with his own forward momentum to strike at ekika a vital spot just beneath the armpits the ate broke both jinsans rhythm and his concentration thus cut off from the void he was easy to take down the pockmarked sensei said nothing as jinsan got shakily to his feet and returned to the sanctuary of the circles edge but akiko could feel a great leap in the onlookers tension in her memory there was something absolutely otherworldly in the next several minutes how many times had she relived the senses next movements watching as if in slow motion as he turned toward the press of his students and uttered the word saigosan there was no hesitation no eye contact nothing at all in saigos demeanor to tell her what was in his mind but she knew that in the next instant as they came at each other the fate of their relationship present and future would be spelled out she also knew that both their fates were completely in her hands in his own mind he had already conquered her so he held none of the dominanceanxiety for her that he might male rivals of his here he would simply do what his sensei asked of him that is defeat her as convincingly as possible humiliate her in public it was up to akiko therefore to divine the twining of their karma if there was to be any at all and to use this moment to defuse the deep well of hatred that seethed like a volcano inside of him he was very dangerous and she never lost sight of that he could very easily hurt her seriously if she allowed that well to come uncapped she did not believe the sensei would be able to sense it soon enough and intervene in time saigo might easily kill her gripped in the heat of his own energies without even knowing it all this flashed through her mind as saigo entered the inner circle where moments before jinsan had gone down before her seeing his tense hot face she knew that he had vowed not to allow the same indignity to happen to him he took three minutes to defeat her but in that time an eternity of knowledge seethed back and forth between them in microcosm the employment of strategies revealed the layers of the spirit there was nothing behind which to hide they became more intimate than lovers sharing more even than twins the void connected them in its wholeness as they maneuvered as they stared down the dark tunnels of each others souls yes the pockmarked sensei said with no hint of the disappointment he felt at the defeat of even one of his pupils at her hand youll do here ofudasan afterward saigo suggested that they go out to dinner the slumbering young woman who he had brought home the night before had been transferred to his futon akiko had made no comment about that nor about the fact that she never ate and barely opened her eyes during the daylight hours drugged she had been and drugged she stayed saigo said nothing at the restaurant picking disinterestedly at his yellowfin sashimi and daikon salad for the longest time life went on around them in a dizzying explosion of drinking and forced gaiety as if these people who worked so hard and long during the day at the giant factories just beyond the town felt compelled to cram a weeks worth of carousing into a single evening akiko saw many women who were in the same profession that her mother had been in these were of a different level of course but the end remained the same observing them made her feel odd as if she were back in fuyajo peeking through gaps in bedroom walls during the endless nights yet she felt as if she had changed for it occurred to her that her mothers utter refinement was but a facade that in some unfathomable way she was no better than these women here who lacked status dignity and ultimately that most precious of all japanese commodities honor dean had had no family no ancestors she wished to honor no husband to protect her through whom she could guide her own destiny and that of her progeny she had only akiko and that responsibility had been too great for her for she like these women now lacked a future into which a child could grow prosper and find herself akikosan she shifted her attention back to him hai why didnt you do it she knew what he was talking about but perhaps it would be good for him to say it i dont know what you mean saigosan he thought about that for a moment you could have defeated me in our confrontation at the dojo yet you chose not to she shook her head please believe me i could not stand against you i felt it her dark eyes held his shadowed ones what you felt perhaps saigosan was your intense anxiety not to be defeated in front of your peers honor rules you it is your weapon and your fear how could i possibly strip you of either now three weeks later trodding the snow strewn aisles between rows of dreaming orange trees awaiting next years sun akiko knew that she had taken the right path michi it was the japanese word for path but it could also mean a journey as well as duty the unknown a stranger akiko abruptly felt that she must be the first person on earth to have come upon a situation in which all of the words meanings were in play simultaneously for her life with saigo was tinged with all these things and it was impossible for her to say where one left off and the other began silently they passed a stand of tall whipthin bamboo a branch of one older tree was heavily laden with icecrusted snow surely at any moment it must break beneath its burden but no the gusting wind caused the branch to bob up and down and such was the resilient nature of the wood that at length the branch sprang upward and like the finest of bows loosed its charge snow in a fine spray dusted the cold air powdering down upon them in bracing fashion and in its wake they saw the branch of the bamboo now free of excess weight they passed on shoulders hunched bunched hands in the pockets of their coats while the wind continued to whistle by overhead within the shelter of a dense copse of pines saigo stopped them a river sang merrily to their left and below them from this interior space it was impossible to see either the industrial sprawl beyond kumamoto or even the looming presence of mount aso with its plume of pumice and hot ash it was possible to believe for a moment that one could be divorced from such things that the heavily layered structuralism of life had momentarily disappeared turning his back to the gnarled trunk of one great grandfather tree saigo slid down until he was on his haunches akiko knelt beside him at right angles he did not turn toward her but continued to stare straight ahead at the puzzle of crisscrossing branches white with snow and ice akiko stared at his proud profile in many ways he was still an enigma to her but then she suspected that he was even more of an enigma to himself though he was inordinately introspective for a young man it was not selfexamination that occupied him the eternal flame of his hate had to be nurtured and on occasion fanned akiko suspected quite rightly that with the cessation of his hatred saigo would perish it was his primary nourishment mothers milk to his spirit already she suspected that he was wholly evil yet she was drawn to him was it despite this knowledge or because of it she felt frightened when she was near him as if the blight eating away at his soul was contagious but at the same time she felt a distinct lessening of the anomie which at times buffeted her spirit with the viciousness of a riptide with saigo she felt that she belonged time and place coalesced into meaning for he had the spirit of the outlaw not the outcast which she had always assumed herself to be an outcast had no status no dignity no honor she recalled her feelings that night in the restaurant when she saw the geisha with their snapping black teeth and faces coated with white rice flour it occurred to her then that she thought about ikan infrequently and then it was with a painful lurch as if she were fighting to disengage herself from a particularly loathsome creature ikan had no status save that of tayu oiran which of course was meaningless outside the yoshiwara ever since akiko had escaped from there her contempt for courtesans was boundless had not ikan been sold into what was effectively slavery had not the very fact that she had worked in the happy field rendered her undesirable as a wife where was the dignity in this way of life where was the honor akiko could not even summon up anger at her mother her emotions had gone beyond the stage where she resented leans inability to accept her she felt only contempt for what her mother had been what she had done ikan had been an outcast and without even knowing it akiko had cast herself in the same mold but now saigo had shown her that there was another path she could take for an outlaw possessed status dignity and honor japans ancient tradition of the nobility of failure the triumph of ideals over actions proved this beyond any doubt beside her saigo felt a spasm grip him he felt as if something inside him were being pulled in opposite directions spite surged within him and a fulminating desire to hurt her there must be an ending he said the wind snatched at his words sent them hurtling among the snow laden pines still he did not turn toward her there was a minute trembling to his head and she felt the tension in his frame you may have wondered at the identity of the girl i brought home some weeks ago his head lowered until his chin almost touched his chest she is the one that i love akiko felt the knife in her ribs turning slowly as he had wished her name is yukio and she has betrayed me betrayed me to my cousin to a gaijin iteki the last two epithets were spat with such vehemence that akiko was obliged to close her eyes against the force of the rage saigos lips curled back in the semblance of a smile that was more a snarl you may well ask yourself how a gaijin came to be a cousin of mine well my mother itami had a brother a fierce and loyal man of great samurai blood his name was tsuko and in the winter of following the death of his superior he was given command of the garrison at singapore there he served his emperor long and well until september of when outnumbered he tried to hold the city against the advancing british forces his men were surrounded they died defending the honor of japan as befits true samurai tsuko was the last to perish shot many times by iteki while he slashed their limbs and heads with his katana the british like all barbarians have no concept of honor at the time of his death my uncle was married to a woman who was quite beautiful but of dubious parentage that is to say it was suspected that she was at least part chinese she must have bewitched tsuko for he apparently ignored these rumors i know that she could not have been japanese no samurai blood runs in the veins of a woman who will not avenge the murder of her husband this cheong instead married the man who commanded the enemys attack on singapore perhaps he himself fired one of the bullets that fatally wounded my uncle she did not care saigos head lifted the offspring of cheong and this barbarian colonel is nicholas linnear with that one last foreign word akiko felt a prescient thrill shoot up her spine could it be so she asked herself could the wheel of life have brought her to the one person on earth who could truly help her for it had been this same colonel linnear this iteki as saigo called him who had pressed for public disclosure of akikos fathers socalled indiscretions thereby murdering him she concentrated further anxious now to absorb it all it was he who came to the precincts of our ryu hand and hand with his lover yukio saigo continued she and i were lovers before he met her like his halfbreed mother did to tsuko nicholas has somehow seduced yukios spirit now i must drug her or she would seek to escape and fly to him now only i have her you make love to her still saigos head whipped around and his dead eyes glared at her challenging her i take her whenever i choose to do so he turned again to stare out at the crosshatch of branches she betrayed me she deserves no less akiko remembered his words from before there must be an ending now you wish to kill her saigo said nothing for a time then i wish for revenge for myself for my mother most of all for tsuko and she thought kai ho i see a gap i must enter swiftly but softly she said two weeks ago you left abruptly i did not see you at home or in the dojo for four days in tokyo he said i attended the funeral of my father he closed his eyes i wished to take you but i could not she bowed to him i am honored he was a great man again tension gripped him but eventually he was destroyed by the invading barbarians by colonel linnear the iteki garrotted him now i have begun my revenge i have administered a poison to the colonel it is absorbed through the pores of the skin and is untraceable it is slow acting creating a deadly accretion day by day and then he nodded his head you are right yukio must die but this fact must not reach my cousin nicholas he must wonder and wait until the time is right then i will confront him and just before i deliver the death blow i will tell him of his beloveds fate thus will all the unquiet kami who hover about me demanding retribution and rest be assuaged death death and more death it surrounded them as if they were adrift in a sea of skulls the giri saigo bore seemed a burden of unconscionable weight to akiko no wonder his spirit was being trampled into dust how well she saw now the twining of their karma without thinking she reached out her fingers sliding up his arm his head whipped around that red challenge back in his eyes and she said let me banish your kami if just for a moment something seemed to melt inside him a barrier swinging down and the proud warrior collapsed into her embrace a child at its mothers comforting breast the cold was no deterrent to their fire and for the first time in his life saigo felt the hot surge of blood into his penis at a womans touch always before there had been a certain violence to his coupling with yukio and more often than not he would take her from behind as he did with his young men lovers so that there was nothing about it that could be termed lovemaking but with akiko it was different perhaps it was because he had allowed akiko to melt him to take the lead it was he who now acquiesced to her lovemaking responding as she led using hardcalloused hands given to inflicting pain and death in long legato caresses across the snowy contours of her steaming body the moment he felt the movement of her moist lips beneath his the moment he became aware of her tongue emerging probing he was as hard as a rock and as ecstatically eager as a virgin and in regard to lovemaking he was a virgin tenderness and compassion held no domain inside him love was unknown michi her breasts swelled to his touch sensation buzzing from her erect nipples he wanted to enter her almost immediately such was his excitement but akiko persuaded him otherwise with her lips her deft knowing hands and the clamp of her trembling thighs near the end she held the base of his erection as tightly as she dared so that he would not ejaculate before either of them wanted him to meanwhile she teased his nipples with the tip of her tongue his scrotum with a wave of her fingers the head of his penis with the tender flesh of her inner thighs she rolled him around and around in that pliant grip until the friction became unbearable and he was so engorged that she took pity on them both and placed him at the font of her vagina with a long drawnout groan he pushed into her his eyelids fluttering his chest heaving until his slender hips crashed into hers and he was fully hiked she would not let him move fearful that just one bull thrust would send his twanging emotions over the edge instead she cupped her hands against his buttocks fitting her to him as closely as possible then she commenced to squeeze and relax her inner muscles the resulting contractions caused far less friction than if he were stroking into her he would last longer though he was on the verge of orgasm when he entered her akiko watched his face feeling her emotions soaring not only from the liquid erotic contact but from what was written across his features she reveled in the pleasure she was giving him the banishment at least temporarily of the kami that haunted him day and night sweat froze along their backs riming them making them into creatures of the winter countryside where they made contact their bodies were slick with juices as if hot oil had been poured between them akikos eyes lost focus and she found her mind wandering as if in a dream she was close herself she made herself focus on saigo he was past seeing or hearing anything his hard lean body surged continually against her in minute ripples cords stood out along the sides of his neck and his teeth were gritted hard in his effort to continue the ecstasy but he could not ohh yes she cried beside herself biting his neck as she too lost herself in pleasure for a long time afterward he did not seem his old self remnants of what he had been lost in her embrace continued to hold sway like beautifully architectured ruins on a bloody battlefield he continued to cling to her his breathing taking an unaccountably long time to return to normal even when they both became chilly and were forced to don clothing he did not wish to be apart once he began to weep silent tears when she asked him what troubled him he said i was remembering that bamboo we passed earlier oh how i wish i could be like that tree so resilient so able to free itself of the greatest burden but then slowly he returned to the saigo she had known and at length they sat apart not even their shoulders or hands touching it seemed to akiko that in some strange way he had become embarrassed by what they had done here as if he had allowed himself to transgress against internal rules only he was aware of she wished she could say that it was only the tears of which he was ashamed but she feared that was not so it seemed to her that he was regretting the fact that he possessed emotions and needs just like every other human being akiko had been around him long enough to understand that saigo had built for himself the concept of his own separatism from the entire human race if he believed in a god at all it was this one for his separation gave him power as the void gave most others power it allowed him to accept all that he did as necessary and right without that belief he like a priest without buddha would be bereft but in this one instance this turning away had hurt her terribly and she could not hold her tongue watching his face she said you did not enjoy our joining saigosan you did not feel the outpouring of love as i did his face screwed up derisively love pah there is no such thing yet before you told me that you love yukio akiko persevered though she felt a foreboding building inside her what i feel for yukio is none of your concern he snapped as for what i said i used an equivalent word what i feel for her is inexpressible in language but certainly it is not love and for me she knew it would come to this but her fear of what he might or might not say was insufficient for her to hold onto her words what do you feel for me saigosan is it too inexpressible questions questions and more questions why is it that all women know how to do is ask questions he lurched drunkenly to his feet his breath was a steamy cloud before his lips he was fully the warrior again i find questions insupportable akikosan you already know that about me yet you persist in asking them i am only human she said sadly unlike you oyabun he laughed then a low guttural sound oyabun eh that is good akikosan very very good you see me as your mentor your overlord well ill say this for you you certainly know how to keep me in good humor but already he suspected that the supposedly immutable continents of his being were shifting off their divine axis now with a brilliant flash daylight had begun to pour in through the resulting rent flooding his world scoring demarkations to a landscape alien to him and in the shadowed recesses flickering fires licked funeral pyres to what had once been looking at her now it seemed abruptly clear to him that he indeed had never loved yukio had in fact not understood that feeling could be warm as well as cold as his eyes drank akiko in he felt a return of the deep sexual throbbing she had elicited from him he felt none of the aggressive rage toward her that he had felt toward yukio or his many male lovers he was astonished to find that with akiko there was no anger at all only this warmth that belatedly he could identify as comfort and now he knew that all that he had said to her today was not as he had thought to hurt her but to unburden himself the sky had grown dark with low surging clouds the air was damp and leaden it would rain or snow soon depending on the balance of the temperature a premature twilight was coming on as purple as a new bruise storm coming from the northwest he said time to go he wanted to pull his eyes away from her but he was like a child who had discovered his love of sweets once in the shop he was reluctant to depart yet at the same time he felt a need to break the tenuous connection that still linked them like a length of twined silk it was important for him to regain a sense of himself to know that all of him had not been transformed by this new feeling that the iron warrior still beat strongly within him thus he began without her walking as if he had forgotten her existence then as akiko rose to follow him she saw that something that was hidden from her vantage point had caught his attention she watched as he turned off the path heading into the pines on his left in a moment he was back in his left hand he held a squirming ball of gray fur by the scruff of its neck eeya akikosan see what ive found a wolf cub smiling akiko came toward him down the path for just an instant he had the happy carefree aspect of a little boy it was so good to see that spark in him she thought if only this time could be extended at that moment she became aware of a blur hurtling through the air toward him she opened her mouth to scream a warning but it was already too late the great gray thing was already atop saigo snarling and clawing saigo staggered and fell sideways beneath the fury of the onslaught instinctively he dropped the cub but the mother was oblivious attacking him with insane ferocity akiko ran up saw them twisting back and forth on the snowy ground she bent down trying to grab the wolf behind its neck in order to pull it off him but saigo must have hit a patch of ice for he spun beneath her and tumbling head over heels man and beast flew over the embankment down twenty feet to the riverbank akiko running to the edge saw saigos back arch agony contorting his face then she was half sliding half scrambling down the rockstrewn embankment landing on her buttocks she lashed out with her foot catching the wolf on the snout with the toe of her boot the animal leaped high into the air yelping and when it landed turned and loped upward into the rising copse of pine where its cub still wandered lost and bewildered akiko knelt beside saigo his face shoulder and forearms were a mass of slashes she saw a set of teeth marks just above his left wrist all these were minor but his spine was canted at an unnatural angle and his rolling dilated pupils showed how much pain he was in with the utmost care she turned him onto his stomach it was immediately clear to her that in his fall he had smashed part of his upper spine against the outcroppings of rock spiking the embankment delicately she ran her fingertips as a surgeon might along the ragged jutting spine at least three vertebrae were involved perhaps four she took a deep breath among other things sun hsiung had been a koppo sensei with two fingers he could break any bone in the body of his enemy that was koppos most commonplace and well known expertise but sun hsiung had taught her the other aspect of koppo katsu it was a form of deep resuscitation once she had seen him use seikotsu an adjunct to katsu and had begged him to teach her this more esoteric and difficult art it was a form of bonesetting she slowed her breathing knowing that if she began the process and failed she would most likely doom saigo to a life of partial paralysis for him that would surely be a death sentence but what was the alternative she could not move him she could not leave him for the time it would take her to search out a telephone he was already in shock and unconscious she could not ask his permission and if she did not act swiftly the cold would infiltrate his natural defenses and kill him without another thought she put her fears aside and went to work on him for twenty minutes she labored with only one brief interruption as she had suspected a fourth vertebra was involved lower down than the others she did not know if any of the seikotsu aiki would work here she did not know whether to proceed then she closed her eyes and sought the nothought that was the void here instinct and something more guided her a sense of cosmic harmony using both thumbs at kyusho vital spots on either side of the unaligned bone she pressed inward and apart heard the pop like a cork coming out of a bottle of champagne and thanked buddha for strength and courage for a time after that she knelt over him slumped with fatigue and relief her hot breath keeping the ice from forming on his naked back then gathering herself for the ordeal she slung saigos still unconscious form across her shoulders settling his weight as comfortably as she could as a weight lifter will she rose with her burden and started off home and that is how you came here he said akiko nodded it was saigo who told me of you it was he who suggested that i seek entrance where he could not i consider that presumptuous of him he observed but hardly surprising he was not fit to stay here i do not believe that he is fit to stay anywhere for very long she resented his words bitterly knowing that saigo had deliberately paved the path for her that he had sought for himself but had been denied kyoki broke into her thoughts what is it that you seek here akikosan what do you believe i can provide you that others cannot i want to learn how to hide my spirit she said to exhibit perfect wa even when i am about to strike down my enemy kyoki poured them both more tea he commenced to sip his they sat crosslegged facing each other across the flagged stone floor the castle in which they sat he had told her had been built by ieyasu tokugawa sometime during the first decade of the seventeenth century for a woman who was halfportuguese and halfjapanese a very special woman akiko had thought outside a komuso with a reed basket over his head played his bamboo flute in plangent fashion tell me he said after a time how a young girl comes to have so many deadly enemies there was no recourse but to tell him all of it of ikan and fuyajo of shimada her father and those who had set the wakizashi in his hands guiding it in two powerful lifedenying strokes into his lower abdomen destroying his hara his life seppuku kyoki closed his diamondshaped eyes it is gratifying to see such an unwavering expression of filial piety in one so young he took up the goldthread fan lying beside him and began a soft fluttering motion at his cheek it was feminine and akiko felt unflattering immediately kyoki ceased this motion his eyes pierced her penetrating her thoroughly the fan was a stilled butterfly at the side of his head does my use of the fan disturb you akikosan she had to stifle the urge to lie to him saigo had cautioned her against this kyokisan will know he told her and at once you will be asked to leave the truth shamed akiko and she felt blood rush into her cheeks the fan seems unbecoming to a great warrior such as yourself or yourself i am no great warrior sensei but you aspire to be hai then you spurn the fan as a woman i she watched openmouthed as the fan hummed through the air embedding itself in the exact center of a camphorwood chest across the expanse of the room not as a woman kyoki said but as a warrior unconcernedly he sipped more tea please retrieve my weapon he said when he had put down his porcelain cup akiko rose and went across the room she reached up and as she touched the thing spread like the hand of buddha spearing the wood he said this is no ogi no mere fan you pull from my chest akikosan it is gunsen a weapon of battle as she brought it back to him he said all ten ribs are of handforged steel the fan itself a membrane of steel mesh that can slice through skin flesh viscera even bone with the proper strike in his hands again the gunsen fluttered back and forth at his cheek the docile butterfly returned to its chrysalis your room is on the second floor he said directly below mine i have no parents i make the heavens and the earth my parents i have no home i make saika tanden my home i have no body i make stoicism my body i have no eyes i make the flash of lightning my eyes i have no strategy i make sakkatsu jizai my strategy i have no designs i make kisan my designs i have no principles i make rinkiohen my principles akiko alone in the room of all shadows knelt before the double line of joss sticks and long white tapers both were lit and the resulting scents pervaded the chamber the atmosphere seemed to absorb her prayers as if it were listening kyokis castle lay nestled in a glen shaggy with white birch and larch acres of bright blooming giant azaleas and stands of peach trees one thousand meters above sea level in asama kogen these were the highlands cool in summer frosted in winter just over kilometers from tokyo northeast of the sprawling jammed supertropolis almost squarely in the center of honshu japans main island the kogen were dominated by meter asamayama an active volcano whose upper slopes were kept sere and utterly barren by frequent eruptions on the opposite side of the highlands from where kyokis castle stood sweeping northeast off asamayamas skirt was onioshidashi a black blasted lavascape aptly named after the monstrous outpouring of the earths depths in the devils discharge parkland and villas of the rich were strewn all about here but none within seeing distance of the castle named yami doko kite in the darkness by kyoki soon after he came to live here akiko had as little an idea when that was as she had about anything else in the sensefs background with her eyes alone she could tell that he was at least part mongol the slant to his eyes the width and flatness of his cheekbones as well as the hue of his skin she could envision his ancestors wrapped in wolf skins and beaten metal corselets descending on horseback from the chinese steppes snowy wind at their backs to raid the villages of the plains they worked within a rigidly formulaic framework that wa without even the most minute deviation this was in direct counterpart to her two years at the ryu in kumamoto every moment of akikos time in asama was mapped out and had to be assiduously accounted for a blank spot was cause for punishment excuses of any kind were not tolerated neither was illness which was treated by kyoki with various natural poultices and herbal combinations he was a giftedyogen chemist and akiko who was rarely sick in any case inevitably found herself recovered within ten hours meanwhile her studies even the most taxing physical exercises were performed uninterrupted for weeks at a time they lived in the wilderness leaving the castle far behind often this occurred during inclement weather in the dead of winter or during late summer and early autumn when successions of typhoons lashed the islands southern coast sending dark whipping squalls into the interior like a dragons raking claws this was purposeful he taught her how to use the elements and even in many cases to tame them with them they took only rokugu the ninjas six tools for traveling five were all contained within the sixth uchitake a threemeter length of hollowedout bamboo inside was stored medicine a stone pencil towel hat and musubinawa an eightmeter coil of rope made out of womens hair lighter than regular rope and stronger they lived in trees and in the bush by lowlying alpine streams on rock outcroppings along shiraito falls a staggeringly beautiful network of narrow water chutes climbing up a sheer foliageencrusted cliff face tsuchigumo was a technique that kyoki claimed had been passed down to him through his father from jinnai ukifune an assassin in the service of nobunaga oda powerful feudal daimyo unique among all ninja because he was a dwarf tsuchigumo was as kyoki put it bat in the rafters he taught her to cling to the tops of rooms where crossbeams and such could be employed with the aid of nekode cats claws of forged steel hour after hour they hung in the darkness of the night using arcane breathcontrol techniques to slow their metabolisms and therefore remain motionless until just before dawn at that time they would drop lithely and silently down onto the stone flooring free of muscle knots and cramps ready if this were a real situation to deliver a lethal blow to an unsuspecting enemy one evening perhaps a year and a half after she had first entered the castle kyoki summoned her to a room which she had never seen before it was large and had an arching ceiling so high its upper reaches were lost in gloom it was divided by an oddlooking doorway that had the aspect of a chinese moon gate almost circular in nature there were tatami the first she had seen at yami doko kyoki knelt on one of these just beyond the arc of the moon gate before him was a lacquer tea service a small plate piled with rice cakes akiko bowed low and doffing her boots knelt opposite him the moon gate rose above them and between them the demarkation between sensei and pupil all was quiet in the room all was serene akiko questing as he had taught her to do felt only the harmony of his wa she watched him prepare the green tea she had not known that he had these skills she was mesmerized by the movements she felt languid and calm almost at peace kyoki put aside the whisk and turning the porcelain cup one half a revolution presented her with the steaming tea he bowed low to her and she followed suit extending her torso forward her forehead touched the tatami on the other side of the moon gate whisper as of silk against flesh or galvanized her adrenals pumping furiously she tucked her head under and launched herself forward rolling balllike forward across the tatami behind her the metal blade hurtled downward from the apex of the moon gate arc slicing through the reed mat at the precise spot where the exposed back of her neck had been a split second before burying itself in the floor beneath akiko bounded to her knees and stared wideeyed at her sensei who was calmly sipping at his tea how she said wonderingly i felt not even the tiniest ripple in your wa there was nothing nothing at all this is why you are here kyoki said simply jaho masks my wa jaho akiko echoed magic the sensei shrugged call it what you will it goes by many names which one you use is unimportant it exists were you aware of my intentions i might have died would you really have allowed that once the blade is released i can no longer control it he said as always you were the master of your own fate and i am pleased to see you here beside me you are not the first woman who has ever come here seeking that which was meant for man women traditionally seek to control power and in that way possess it it is an oblique strategy a female stratagem in this way in our society a mother controls her son a wife controls her husband it is rare indeed for the woman to seek a more direct means to possess absolute dominion over men through her own strength as i have indicated several have tried ah have failed perhaps now you will be the first miko he rose held out his hand palm up come it is time we begin your true education he was a face in the rain she saw him and did not see him he was there beside her and he was not quick as a kami he flickered a blazing light and then was gone though she had spent years with him though he had held the key to her world and had passed it on to her there came a time when she began to doubt that she had ever been to yami doko the swiss alps rose all about the vast chalet in which she lay swathed in pure white bandages she could not see and most of the time there was nothing of interest to hear she fed off her memories kyoki became a dream as insubstantial as smoke rising from a forest floor but not what she had absorbed from him every day whitesuited nurses wheeled her outside into the thin sunshine for exactly forty minutes the swiss were as precise as the japanese about some things schedules were one of them she remembered the moment the wild boar came crashing out of the underbrush to confront them she stood her ground as the snorting creature bore down upon her she was aware of the boars tusks rough textured and oily looking curving outward from that lowered jaw set to impale her she made no move however her spirit was like an untroubled lake she opened her mouth from it emanated a kiai known as toatenoate the distant strike the boar spun in the air emitting a highpitched squeal quickly cut off as if a powerful grip had been put on its throat it fell heavily on its side and was still until as kyoki had taught her she chose to end her shout she remembered the touch of kyokis kimono against the back of her hand the passage of his presence during long afternoons of sleep when he seemed to stalk her dreams as if even her sleep at yami doko was part of her training she longed for his lessons the way a young man longs for sex aches for it dreams about it becomes at length obsessed with it there was a chasteness to their relationship which she could never remember having with a man before he was not saintly but she did not desire him because she lusted after what he possessed more he had jaho and she longed for that until it became her lover she remembered their parting she had been with him seven years which was a significant number to both of them a magic number it was time to return to the world and claim her revenge a face in the rain flickering behind her she half suspected the castle to fall into ruin disappearing amid new foliage magically springing up rain beat down on her shoulders in rhythm with the komusos melody before her rabbits skittered out of her way and a lone hawk flew over the treetops searching while it rode the inconstant currents coming down off the frosty asama kogen mingling with tourists and tokyo residents alike in the rolling parklands it occurred to her that the person she missed most was saigo that kyokis lessons had been her lover for seven years because saigo could not be she had deliberately put the thought of him aside so as not to torture herself he was no longer in kumamoto she was told by telephone so she traveled to the outskirts of tokyo where he had told her his family lived she had had no contact with him in seven years yet as the gleaming railroad took her toward her destination it seemed to her no more than seven minutes one inhalation of time there was no space between them no sense of change or alienation occasionally saigo had spoken of his parents and of course she had seen the devastation written across his face when he spoke of his fathers death but nothing he had said prepared her for the splendor of that house for one thing it was large a rare quality in japanese homes for another it was surrounded by the most beautiful gardens and orchards space was so highly prized that akiko was slightly stunned to see so much in the hands of one family deeper was her surprise when she found that the family now consisted of saigos mother and a dozen servants no brothers or sisters no other family members she was a diminutive woman with delicate bones and the beautiful commanding face of a samurai lady tradition meant a great deal to her as a welcomed traveler akiko was met at the door by a servant and escorted to a room where another servant unpacked her bags while a third led her to the bath afterward she was fed broiled fluke fin in soy sauce a superb cold seaweed salad chicken yakitori rice and a pale gold tea the taste of which was unfamiliar to her by this time it was late in the evening a fourth servant appeared when she was finished led her back to her room where her futon had been prepared for sleep thus she spent her first sixteen hours in the house without ever meeting her hostess the next morning akiko arose and dressed in her best kimono which she observed sadly as she saw herself in the mirror was not very fine at all her life up until now had left precious little room for her to be concerned with the niceties of being a woman the hems of both sleeves were threadbare and the silk of which it was made was hardly of the finest quality by contrast itami was splendidly attired but then akiko thought she would be so even in the company of the greatest ladies in japan they met in one of the sixteentatami rooms where akiko was led as soon as she was dressed and properly coiffed the young woman who had first seen her to her room had knocked quietly and politely on the shoji entering only when she was bade to kneel behind akiko spending almost an hour brushing combing and putting up her hair with the implements akiko had handed her the tsuge wood kushi that had been ikans the matching set of kanzashi that had been presented to her by shimada handed the mirror by the servant akiko was struck by how much she resembled her mother how many years had it been since she had had her hair like this she could not remember could not even say whether she liked herself this way a tea set separated them of superb workmanship and material of equal quality the porcelain was translucent and as thin as skin the intricacies of the ceremony itami was performing with the tea served a dual purpose it alleviated the tension and uncomfortableness strangers inevitably feel when first they meet it also served to focus their attention on zen on the formation of harmony at the end of the ceremony if they were not exactly friends neither were they strangers it pleases me that you have come itami said she had a pleasant wellmodulated voice and her manner though formal in the sense of ancient tradition was nevertheless fueled by a genuine warmth that served to put akiko at her ease my son has spoken of you several times there was more that she wanted to say on this score akiko sensed you have arrived at a fortuitous time itami continued for while saigo is not here he is scheduled to arrive in a weeks time you will stay of course i could not think of intruding for so long akiko said but thank you for your offer an offer is nothing unless it is accepted itami replied as you can see this house is large some might say overlarge for one woman my days are sometimes lonely ones life can be filled with too much contemplation it would please me greatly to have a companion will you favor me if you wish it of course i have never seen such a beautiful house it is exhilarating to be here now you are exaggerating itami said but akiko could see that she was pleased by the genuine compliment late in the afternoon of the next day itami said after poor yukios untimely death i was afraid that saigo had turned his heart away from women he loved her so his spirit was crushed by her death of course it came on top of my husbands death and well he and saigo were always very close and akiko thought filial piety binds us all twisting us to its will she found herself liking the older woman immensely she had contrived to make akiko at home without voicing the usual battery of questions directed at the woman to whom a son is attracted what is your family where do you come from what is your fathers station and his fathers so on rather itami seemed content to accept akiko at face value and this touched akiko deeply today itami said all things are different the time when the immutability of japan was assured is gone modern times have assured that it will never come again there was a silence then as the two women walked side by side through the groves of lemon and plum trees pink and white chrysanthemum bobbed their heads like a greek chorus in the following breeze overhead white clouds drifted below which slate gray plovers swooped the sun felt warm and comforting on their backs tomorrow my son comes home itami had stopped to peer at a lizard basking on a rock akiko paused beside her perhaps it would be best if you left early in the morning akiko studied the words as if she were an archaeologist who had stumbled over what might possibly be an important find i care about saigo she said after a time very much yes itami said i know still i think best if you were not here when he arrived why is that itamisan the older woman turned to face her my son is evil akikosan sometimes i think that it was a blessing that yukiosan died so early so tragically i did not wish her involved with my son when she met nicholas linnear i hoped that would be the end of it but like you she came back to saigo i do not want the same mistake to be made twice do you fear for my life lady itami stared hard into akikos face no akikosan i fear for your soul my son is the bitterest of fruit with his ideas he is a poisoner and it is best to stay away from him lest you too be poisoned it has not hurt me so far akiko said lightly it would be a mistake to make a joke of this my dear itami began to walk again if you decide to stay i will not seek to stop you i have learned that nothing ever changes in this regard and that it is folly to attempt to turn the will of another i could not do it with my husband or my son or even my sisterinlaw i have not the power certainly to do it to you still i speak from the heart and ask you to at least listen silence once again engulfed them eventually to be broken by akikos words itamisan i wish to see him the older womans head bowed of course you do my child only the four of them were at the wedding saigo and akiko hand in hand itami and the shinto priest who presided the ceremony took place in the north garden amid the scents of lemon and rose the day was clear and bright as crystal the sun was strong overhead its warmth pouring down over them like a benediction then saigo took her away to tokyo and she saw itami only infrequently she could not be at the funeral when the body was shipped back from america in a sealed coffin that itami did not want opened after she heard the account of how he died but itami wrote her saying all she wanted now was to have him buried deep next to his father who had loved him in a way that she could not who had twisted his spirit in a way she could not forgive him for as for akiko there was no question but that she do what saigo had asked of her before he departed for america even had he not talked with her she would have known what to do i know how to do it she had told him triumphantly on a day just shy of their eighth anniversary it will mean change for me total change and she held up the photograph for him to see for a long time he said nothing merely looked from her to the photo and back again it will destroy him he said utterly and completely should i not come back his face creased but i will akiko knew better saigo was dead the moment he boarded the jal flight for america for his final confrontation with his cousin nicholas linnear but this knowledge did not allow her to stop him or even hint to him of his fate he was a warrior and to deny him battle was to destroy him on the spot when the news reached her she was already five weeks in switzerland she grieved even as she worked out the details of the revenge he would have wished she wanted to exercise during her long internment in the swiss clinic but she was forbidden to do so at least for the first week after that it was at her own discretion they said believing that she could do nothing while the swath of bandages blinded her they were wrong but then the swiss are a peculiarly insular people guided to the gym each day just before lunchtime akiko performed ninety minutes of hard physical exercise to keep her superb body in shape in the late afternoon she did the same and because she was used to the night she arose by herself and using her hearing guided herself away from the nurses back into the gym for further work she was desperate for physicality throwing her entire being into it for one thing it took her mind off the consequences of what she had done if the doctors had not been successful here she would be lost they had assured her of their talent and she had seen examples of their handiwork herself rationally she had been satisfied but now that it had been done now that there was no turning back now that the akiko she had known all her life was gone doubts returned to plague her what if what if what if so she toiled hard in the garden of mind and spirit building on the foundations with which kyoki had provided her that sun hsiung had drilled into her now that saigo had been killed there was nothing else for her and at last there came a morning when darkness began to lift layer by layer searchlights turned black into shades of gray lightening from charcoal to slate to dove hazily the room appeared its shape and character emerging slowly from behind gauzy veils the shapes had been drawn the overhead light extinguished only a small lamp was on its soft glow fiery to her eyes unused to light for six weeks it hurt to see and she was forced to blink rapidly bringing some of the darkness back so that she would not be overwhelmed by the candlepower everything appeared strange and different distant as well as if she were a new arrival from another planet she took the mirror that had been placed in her hand by one of the nurses and shone it on herself what she saw there was no face in the rain but the first true blossom of her vengeance she saw yukio staring back at her blinking furiously in the first light of a new day book five the miko new york city hong kong hokkaido maui washington tokyo spring present hello matty who wants to know croaker detective lieutenant nypd nah hes deader than a doornail then

and the friendship he had with the man were there any of the usual strings attached to the relationship he was sure there were not that was part of what made their friendship so special so binding fleetingly he wondered where nicholas was now and what he was doing the last hed heard of him he was back in west bay bridge probably off on his honeymoon now he thought croaker knew that he would have tracked his friend down long ago were it not for the fact that he wanted this danger kept away from nicholas at least until he could define it he refocused his attention youd better give me all

through the phone yeah matty the mouth said i know at precisely six pm hong kong time tanzan nangi sitting high up in the offices of the allasia bank picked up the telephone and dialed the number liu had given him at the end of their first meeting all afternoon he had glumly watched the ants far below queuing up before the entrance to the allasias central district branch in order to withdraw their lifes savings suddenly the allasia was poison it would swallow their money whole the chinese were pulling out the mechanism by which such enormous masses of people were so instantly galvanized was a mystery to nangi but he had no doubt as to who was behind the run the communists were turning the screws how long can we expect to hold out nangi had asked allan su just after the doors were closed at three police had been called to disperse the mob who had been on line when the bank was closed at this rate su said no more than fortyeight hours ive just been on the phone with our other branches in wan chai tsim sha tsui aberdeen and stanley its the same all over more or less well have to go to the vault tonight dont do anything yet nangi said fist against his cheek not until i give you the word yes the female voice was quiet and well modulated mr liu please nangi said hating this moment hating the communists more now than he ever had whom shall i say is calling at sevenfifteen that evening nangis car pulled up in front of the sun wa trading company on sai ping shan street in sheung wan it was a long store front painted a garish glossy vermillion the chinese nangi reflected did not comprehend the subtlety of pastel shades instead they surrounded themselves with childlike primaries they were as superstitious about color as they were about everything else he stepped out into the crowded street inhaling the scents of fivespice powder star anise dried fish soy and chili they made him long for home with an intensity that was almost painful but he knew that part of the pain was from the knowledge of what he was about to do squaring his shoulders he concentrated on walking as normally as possible so that he would not be further shamed in front of his enemies inside the atmosphere was gritty with spice powder residues bringing a tickle to his nostrils at first the place seemed deserted it was past the time when the regular employees had gone home nangi paused in the dimness and looked around without seeming to he spotted a shadow amid other shadows moving slightly i have brewed fresh tea especially for this occasion it was unmistakably lius voice nangi moved in his direction mindful of the crates and cartons scattered about he sat down on a plain wooden chair opposite the chinese a scarred table was between them on it were only two items a pair of identical documents nangi did not have to touch them to know what they were tea first liu said amiably i want this to be as painless as possible he was positively exuding good fellowship now that his triumph was imminent they both drank black tiger tea liu said from peking only a very small quantity is produced each year do you like it very much nangi said almost choking on the brew liu inclined his head slightly i am honored he continued to sip i understand that there was a disturbance in front of the allasia this afternoon he said conversationally nangi decided to test him it was nothing at all enough for the police to be called in yes traditionally the police are summoned when more than a score of chinese assemble in one place in the crown colony nangi observed blandly it gives her majestys government something to do even the voracious crow knows when to quit the corner field mr nangi this all had the appearance of an elaborate charade it was as if liu felt compelled to drag out the hoary clich of the aphoristic chinese but why surely he knew that it would not impress a japanese then it occurred to nangi that charades were never acted out unless there was an audience shadows wreathed the rafters inside the sun wa trading company outside the light had failed so that even the skylight far above had turned opaque and impenetrable sawdust on the floor the spices rich and pungent if there was movement in the darkness nangi could not detect it yet his sense that he and liu were not alone was inescapable how bad was the run mr nangi liu was pouring more tea it seemed he was bent on carefully delineating the boundaries of his superiority i am certain that you already know that mr liu nangi said carefully all runs are bad in and of themselves thats obvious what is obvious to me mr nangi liu said sipping his tea again is that you will not make it without our direct intervention that occurred to me as well that is why i called perhaps this was all liu had wanted in the first place a humbling by verbal admission for he nodded now as if accepting a compliment he inclined his head toward the contract i trust you will find each clause you required satisfactorily rendered he spoke as if it had been he who had made all the negotiating concessions as if it were he who were under the gun and not nangi for a moment nangi did nothing to make an immediate move would have cost him too much face and he had already given up more than he could spare by agreeing to this meeting after a suitable amount of time had elapsed he took up the document and commenced to read every sentence froze his spirit every clause to which he was being forced to sign his name made him sick at heart the moment he touched pen to paper effective control of his keiretsu would be transferred to lius masters in peking the chinese had placed an oldfashioned fountain pen squarely in the middle of the tabletop nangi would be obliged to reach for it we plan no immediate intervention or policy change liu said there is absolutely no cause for alarm i was thinking of the thirtyfive million dollars nangi said it must be delivered by eight am tomorrow morning liu nodded unperturbed where were his firms prior commitments now if you would ask mr su and whichever other bank officers you designate to appear at the allasia banks main vault in central that sum will be handed over to them oh yes nangi thought im certain youre quite familiar with our vaults thanks to comrade chin but what he said was that will be entirely satisfactory and then deliberately ignoring the fountain pen liu had set on the table nangi extracted a pen of his own and signed the last page of both sets of contracts retrieving his pen liu did the same he pushed the top copy back to nangis side a little more tea perhaps his eyes danced in the darkness nangi declined folding away the document which felt hot and unclean to his hands he was about to rise when lius motion stayed him from within the chineses breast pocket a shiny red envelope appeared liu handed it to nangi without a word nangi looked at him enquiringly we chinese have a custom mr nangi it is most civilized the sum inside that envelope is payment for transfer transfer of ownership of power call it what you will with the physical transfer there can be no loss of face because there has been an exchange one for the other nangi nodded respectfully as if they were two men exchanging pleasantries on a park bench but in his heart he seethed the anger crackling through him making his pulse skip a beat nothing in his outward manner conveyed his inner resolve to liu and whoever else might be watching concealed in the shadows he was a clever businessman at the crevasse of defeat carefully nangi slid the red envelope away next to the document that lay like a lead weight against his heart he pushed away from the table and taking up his cane rose and walked awkwardly out of the sun wa trading company to where his chauffeured car was waiting for him there was no aspect of nightlife that interested him so he went directly back to the hotel food tasted like ash and stuck in his throat as if it were the contract itself that liu and his masters had coerced him into signing stoically he went on eating until his plate was clean and then could not remember what it was that he had ordered it did not matter undressed he lay atop his bed and stared up at the ceiling at the river of the past as always kanryodo consumed him once a warrior always a warrior he thought it was impossible to hang up your katana even if as in his case it was figurative rather than literal the face of makita his sempai floated through the clouds of his memory as it often did rather than allow them to take out his diseased stomach he had committed seppuku he had asked nangi to be his second and acquiescing nangi had taken up his mentors long sword and with one swift overhand strike had ended the excruciating pain of the two wakizashi slashes the first lateral the second vertical that makita had managed to inflict himself and though it had been the honorable thing to do though nangi had had no choice but to comply with his sempais wishes still he was ashen as he stared at the bloody blade his friend and surrogate fathers head on the tatami he shook all over as if he had contracted ague his skin felt feverish and dry and there was no saliva with which to swallow surely nangi had thought christ could not have wished such a thing and he had fled to church where in the confessional he had spewed out what he had done in rapidfire bursts like retching but even that could not cleanse him and he spent the next six hours on his knees before the image of christ on the cross praying for forgiveness it had been sato who had come for him persuading him to leave that sanctuary where the real world could not intrude my friend sato had said softly you cannot possibly blame yourself you did what had to be done what any samurai would do you stood by your friend when he needed you the most what more can you ask of yourself it was gin nangis eyes had been full of pain and selfloathing it was not the christian thing to do seiichisan to which sato had had no reply but to get nangi out of there thoughts of makita inevitably led nangi back to mabiki the decadeslong weedingout process he had performed at miti for his sempai how many had he slain in this way destroying any chance they had for advancement in japanese bureaucracy always he asked himself that question because always he was uneasy with what he had done shimada had been the first one shimada had been the beginning of mabiki he had paid for his greed and his shortsightedness he could not see change coming and thus nangi had doomed him to humiliation or death shimada had chosen the honorable path and had committed seppuku opening the way for makitas immediate appointment as first viceminister of miti shimada had been the hardest one after that the mabiki was easier to handle the concept easier for nangi to accept kanryodos precepts had hardened his heart now sweating in a hotel room in a foreign colony clinging with the tenaciousness of woodbine to the very tip of the asian continent his great dream lost to him he wondered piteously whether he had murdered in the name of christ he was never quite certain whether the ringing of the telephone had roused him out of slumber or deep thought in any case he rolled over and grabbed for the instrument the glowing dial of his wristwatch told him that it was thirteen minutes before four am a chinese might have found this an inauspicious numerical combination nangi did not care yes its fortuitous chiu came the thin voice down the wire im on po shan road a block from succulent piens flat he sounded a bit out of breath nangi sat up havent you been able to find a way in yet been in and out already now nangi recognized the excitement in the others voice i think youd better get down here pronto what is it forgive my bluntness sir but i dont think youd believe me if i told you outright if you see for yourself thatll be another story im on my way nangi said his heart beginning to beat fast the sweat had dried on his skin swinging his legs over the side of the bed he reached for his cane the vault was as airless as it was lightless behind him nicholas could hear the circular door through which he had stepped sighing closed he heard the pneumatics and was not cheered alone and in total darkness he moved to where his haragei told him was the center of the vault then he stood still his senses questing a desk and several chairs a lamp unlit some machinery which it was beyond him to identify in the absence of visuals a kind of wooden scaffolding whose purpose was also a mystery to him took stock he was on hokkaido but he did not know where since koten had blindfolded him after binding him hand and foot he had then been carried to what he could only guess was the trunk of the soviets car and locked in they had driven for just under an hour giving the car an average speed of fortyfive mph put him in a radius of approximately thirtyfive to forty miles from the rotenburo he knew that was not good enough humming invading the void of darkness in which he stood broke through his thoughts it was subtle might not have been discerned by a normal man immediately nicholas went toward the sound sniffing like an animal quick shallow breaths scented it when he was fifteen feet away from the vent high up in the wall and turned away getting away from that side of the room it would only prolong the time that he had left before the chloroform derivative took effect on him but he needed all the time he could get now i dont see why were waiting so long the doctor said pointedly it only takes the gas threeandahalf minutes to fully permeate the vault space he waggled the wrist on which his chronometer was fastened so that those around him would not miss the fact that it had been almost fifteen minutes since the gas an interesting mixture of a soporific in the chloroform group and a powerful peyote concentrate altered to be effective when inhaled rather than ingested had been pumped into the room patience doctor viktor protorov said calmly i fully appreciate your enthusiasm to sink your spikes into a new client but i think i know what is best in this case the doctor shrugged his shoulders began a ragged rendition of the czarist and the revolutionary a folk song his grandmother had taught him when he was a child just to show these others that he was not the total protorov puppet that they were with the doctor and protorov were pyotr alexandrovitch russilov koten and a pair of junior lieutenants under russilovs direct command the most recent alphathree codes had brought protorov word that yvgeny mironenko the gru colonel had received enough vouchers from his compatriots for protorov to hold a special session of the general staff all the senior generals would be in attendance all that was required now mironenkos most recent communique had said was for protorov to bring the generals proof of his power proof of my power protorov thought now tenchi then for the first time in history the gru and the kgb will be united in a common cause the kremlin will shake to the sound of our bootsteps the old men will fall before us like stalks of wheat the day of the bureaucrat will be a memory all the russians will be on the march the day of the second revolution will have dawned with great difficulty he kept his elation concealed not even russilov must suspect the vast changes forming on the horizon not yet he will have his hands full running the ninth protorov thought i do not want to give him too much too soon all right clear the vault he ordered one of the junior lieutenants responding to a hand sign from russilov shut one valve opened another a pair of hp suction fans drew the noxious fumes out of the room when the red light ceased to glow replaced by the green one protorov ordered the vault door unsealed koten went first then russilov and the two junior lieutenants the doctor and protorov brought up the rear inside they could smell nothing the air was pure and clean again the men fanned out into the vault as if they were a line of gentlemen on the hunt arrogant in the knowledge of their elite status yet wary of a new and extremely dangerous prey he seems quiescent enough the doctor said pushing his glasses back up the bridge of his nose i dont think there is going to be anything different about him thinking him a fool protorov signed to koten as the enormous sumo moved across the room protorov paced him at a tangent that took him to a spot directly in front of where nicholas lay on his left side breathing is deep and regular the doctor said circling the fallen figure no eyelid flicker pulse is slowed skin color is consistent with deep delta unconscious state he recited these medical observations like a litany against that which he did not understand and therefore could not control from his position protorov signed to russilov to move into position just behind nicholas all right he told koten nicholas launched himself feet first at the oncoming hulk it had not been difficult for him to cease to breathe a sufficient amount of the gas to put him under at least eight separate forms of ninjutsu discipline had as their bases the breath and autonomic system regulation that tibetan yogi practiced this extended to body temperature control as well the doctor yelped skittering away as nicholas careened into the oncoming sumo the heels of his feet directed at kotens knees not as someone unfamiliar with a sumos strength would have done at his vast stomach koten was incredibly quick and he almost regained the angle he needed to deflect nicholas strike but not quite as it was he saved himself from a pair of broken joints moving slightly into the line of attack and thus canceling a measure of its force he went down anyway nicholas was aware of protorov shouting orders the doctor retreating past the fringes of the melee two younger soldiers moving in he was certain that he could handle them all yet some unbalanced equation stirred the periphery of his mind he was busy with koten and most of his consciousness was taken up with constantly shifting stratagems against four enemies four it was his last coherent thought before russilov plunged the sixinch needle into the meaty part of his upper arm too late he lashed out five black spots swirled before his eyes he saw five of each individual closing in on him felt kotens blow on the side of his head five times the five spots expanded into five black wells down which he plummeted from a long way off echoes came to him words without meaning questions without answers then the powerful drug hit his cortex and he passed into unconsciousness good work protorov said to russilov you see doctor he went on contrary to what your book may tell you we are not dealing with an ordinary human being this man could reach out with one finger and destroy you the doctor said nothing he was quietly shaking thinking do not understand this at all he should have been unconscious long before this perhaps he is faking yet again protorov snorted i think not he has no power to counter injections into his bloodstream he nodded toward the wooden scaffolding set against part of the back wall all right koten he said softly string him up you must return to the sourcehis source masashigi kusunokis words rose up from her unconscious penetrating the dialogue between sato and phoenix akiko had played and replayed that section of tape as if this might give her some further insight turning an artifact over and over again in a vain attempt to divine its secret she sat in kotens room her forehead against her drawnup knees her arms girdling her shins she was naked and in the lamplight her skin gleamed as if oiled shadows rilled her even as light revealed her hidden and open she was a physical paradigm of the riddle inside herself the people who sent him who trained him represent a very great threat to japan masashigisans words masashigi what had possessed her to go to the gyokku ryu in the first place she did not know or could not recall she remembered the first moment she had seen masashigi kusunoki though it was as if she had found a connection with her past some past as she belonged with saigo in her private life so she t seemed to belong with masashigi in her martial one she had been married to saigo for three weeks gone from kyokis castle for six the gyokku was where masashigisan had made his first stand for her together they had left when the other sennin of the ryu rose up and dissented they would not allow her a woman to stay together they had gone to the tenshin shoden katori in yoshino why had he done this for her what was it that the sensei had seen in her what made her so special and how wrong he had been all his loyalty had brought him was death death by the hands of the one he had defended akiko remembered the smile that wreathed his face like lilies at the moment he passed from life into death why why would anyone smile at that instant sadness had no place in masashigisans life he was attuned to the universe at peace with himself and the cosmos he could not have welcomed death he was at least in akikos mind somewhat of a holy man that was another reason why she had chosen him as her first victim if the masking of her wa that kyoki had taught her would work with such a one it would work on anyone there was something in the air a spice perhaps that akiko could not define her head came up and she looked around as if she suspected that she was not alone for a moment the air shimmered before a halfopen kywma papers stirred on the desk farther into the room but it was only the wind wasnt it akiko shivered slightly why was she dredging all this up now the people who sent him who trained him represent a great threat to japan masashigisan had been speaking of the muhonnin tsutsumu she herself had slain the second muhonnin tengu returning that which he had stolen to the ryu now she knew that there had been a third traitor within the tenshin shoden katori masashigi kusunoki rose up like a specter before her and bade her do what he had trained her to do to fulfill the promise he alone had seen in her she thought of sato phoenix and nicholas in the north in hokkaido especially nicholas she rose and went into the bedroom from the bottom of a low drawer where sato would never look she drew out a kimono light gray on dark gray the top half of one side was stained a dark brown where some of the senseis fountaining blood had spattered slowly reverently she drew it on within moments she was ready she headed north when nicholas awoke he found himself on a wheel he rose out of unconsciousness rapidly but did not open his eyes change his breathing pattern or in any other way give those who he assumed to be in the vault with him any indication that he was now conscious whatever they had pumped him with was very powerful for its effects were not yet gone his head felt light he felt a touch of vertigo he was not at all sure that he could fully trust his senses still logic dictated that he attempt to assess his current situation he was bound by fingers wrists waist thighs and ankles with leather straps he was suspended off the floor he recalled the dim outline of the scaffolding but what worried him most was protorov he was smart enough to understand what kind of creature nicholas was he alone among the russians had suspected that nicholas training would keep him from succumbing to the ambient gas he had set nicholas up superbly distracting him with koten the obvious main threatwhile he kept within nicholas sight only the young officer who had been in charge of the rotenburo russilov had been missing not missing but behind nicholas and no time for even haragei to work the stress factor had been too high nicholas reflected that perhaps he was getting too old for this he should have felt russilovs presence he had underestimated the soviets protorov in particular and had paid the price opened his eyes ah viktor protorov said amiably did you enjoy your rest how does he know so much about me nicholas asked himself as he tried to flex his fingers the straps would not allow it interesting nicholas thought he had this ready for me surely this would be unnecessary for a prisoner without my skills nicholas was aware of how many people were in the roomtwo besides himself and protorov russilov and the doctor as well as where they were russilov stood just behind and to the right of his directorate chief the doctor was near nicholas left shoulder a hypodermic and medical kit on a stool beside him protorov was not interested in a reply instead he unfolded a long sheaf of computer printout which then trailed down behind him like a tail he held one page up in front of nicholas face nicholas stared at the markings trying to focus his brain he thought he had seen something quite like this in several magazines such as scientific american and smithsonian detailing passes of various nasa satellites across the face of the earth does this area appear familiar to you gospadin linnear so far protorov had used nothing but russian with him it should it is the northern half of honshu the whole of hokkaido the nemuro straits the southerly end of the kuriles protorov had not taken his eyes off nicholas here he said stabbing at one of several redmarked spots offshore is a crack between two geological plates here and here on honshu itself are where earthquakes of sizable magnitude over seven points on the richter scale will occur within the next week already an onset trembler has been felt here just to the northwest of tokyo protorov snapped his fingers and russilov like a prestidigitators assistant replaced the exhibited item in this frame the magnitude had been increased so that a detailed section of the topography from the first page was reproduced now here protorov continued pointing again is another hot spot but lo and behold it is not at any previously known geological fault rather it is at a precise spot where nothing had shown before there is no natural reason for its existence the paper rustled like anxious insects what do you make of that gospadin linnear what the hell am i looking at anyway protorov clucked his tongue against the roof of his mouth now that would be telling during his adolescence nicholas could recall coining in contact with a number of japanese nuns to him the sight had been incongruous the japanese spirit had come to be synonymous with acquiescing to nature the elements of the cosmos to him christianity preached a divine order that had been meted out by man himself though its adherents professed otherwise the history of the roman catholic church was a bloodstained banner lifted to the concept of domination all catholics he had found were arrogant and none more so than nuns or priests it was their utter faith in a narrow spectrum morality that took into account absolutely no natural factors mans nature as well as that of his environment held no interest for the churchs hierarchy their moral rectitude rendered them deaf dumb and blind it occurred to nicholas now that though he might howl in rage at the comparison viktor protorov possessed those same hideous qualities espoused so righteously by the church he was not so far from priestly though in a manner he could never comprehend communism was as blind in its moral rectitude as was catholicism if you dont tell me gospadin protorov nicholas said i can provide you with no coherent answer can you tell me that you do not recognize these contours as they might appear from afar protorov brandished the sheets flailing his tail behind him say kilometers above the earths surface that would give it a synchronous orbit keep it stationary over this one spot in the pacific protorov stepped closer do you see this gospadin linnear the straits of nemuro an international boundary between japan and the soviet union his eyes were fever bright and do you further see the area marked in red it is at the bottom of the straits in japanese territory and in ours he gave a nod and nicholas knew what was coming there was nothing he could do for his body now but his mind was another matter the gleaming steel needle entered his upper arm a scant centimeter from where the first shot had been administered his skin ballooned outward fluid swamping the bellows of his lungs he was drowning it made him want to cry out his heartbeat accelerated wildly discipline he took his consciousness by the hand as a father will his frightened child and entered a place that held no fear getsumei no michi somewhere outside of him protorov called in a voice turned aqueous what do you know of tenchi how much does minck know you will tell me that gospadin linnear before you die you will tell me that much will you tell me now why you really followed me all the way to hawaii rick millar sat at one end of the clear plastic raft they had rented at the hotel beach shack his long tanned legs dangled in the water he wore a surfers brief bathing suit he had bought in lahaina i think you already know the answer justine smiled her heart felt lighter than it had in many months im flattered that you wanted to seduce me millar laughed goodnaturedly it wasnt all lust you know i do want you back at the firm no matter what happens between us its already happened she said im glad you came actually he watched a school of small golden fish race by just above the reef over which they bobbed you must love him a great deal for you to be so loyal what justine thought about most now what she held most closely to her was the memory of waking in the middle of the night anxious and afraid and being able to reach out to touch nicholas hand it was a hand like no other she had ever encountered she would lie there stroking its bottom edge hard with castiron callus like hugging a teddy bear the motion would calm her and soon she would slip back to sleep but those were the old days and that was the old justine she did not believe that fear and anxiety would be a part of her life any longer staring out over the sundrenched molokai channel where the humpback whales broke the surface of the water in white and black splendor she saw her immaturity as if it were part of another person clearly objectively it was already separate from her she supposed now that she had always been afraid of love true love such as she felt for nicholas her entire adult life had been a series of encounters with males who could not possibly give her the stability of a twined life rather she had been attracted to men lusting to use her to leave her to in effect return her to a lone state where she felt more secure more the little girl and where this being the most astonishing revelation of all she would be assured of her fathers intervention his protection and yes a manifestation of his love for her it occurred to her that she herself had provoked what she had deluded herself into thinking was his meddling in her life she understood now that this very meddling had served as an assurance to the little girl inside her that he still loved her that he cared enough to break away from his allconsuming work to do something for her stunned she sat in the hawaiian sunshine staring blindly at the island that formerly had been a home for lepers it seemed ironic and somehow proper that she should have come all this way to be near molokai of course she was aware now of just why she had come here she ws six thousand miles from home give or take a couple three thousand miles into the pacific she was that much closer to japan and nicholas would you like to go for a swim millar asked gently justine reached out and squeezed his arm you go if youve a mind to ill join you in a minute or two he nodded and slipped over the rafts side moving in a slow easy crawl away from her all his muscles working in concert she watched him idly with the kind of detached contentment she had never before thought she could feel he was a handsome man desirable in all ways how many of her women friends unattached or otherwise would have given their eyeteeth to be in her position now she laughed out loud it felt good to be wanted by such a man but it felt even better to revel in the completeness of her love for nicholas for she sensed with a wonderful intensity nicholas spirit as if it were he who swam so near her their fight now seemed trivial and ridiculous to her whereas before it had taken on the titanic proportions of an olympian struggle that was because she had not been battling nicholas at all but herself from a distance she recognized the panic with which she had greeted his announcement because she had been quite certain at that moment that the man she was going to marry would be a reincarnation of her father now she understood that she had feared that only because an unconscious part of her had wanted it but nicholas was not her father what he would do with his life had only to do with himself and now justine they had their own lives to lead how would nicholas put it they had their own karma she smiled again at that yes karma and her karma dictated that she be at his side whether it be as the head of tomkin industries or anywhere else she was no longer afraid of giving her heart away to another human being she was no longer afraid of spending her life with someone in fact she knew that that was precisely what she did want in the water she stroked easily toward where rick was floating as he watched the antics of the leviathans far out in the channel finished cogitating he said lightly cogitating she laughed joyfully thats an adult activity isnt it ive got a lot of catching up to do he eyed her warily as if she had changed from a puppy into a doberman instantaneously will you come back and be my creative design vp justine sobered rick ive got to have some reassurances from you before i make any decision he nodded whatever i can do i will good she watched him speculatively i dashed away so fast that i didnt have the time to connect with mary kate though i left a message with her service that means for the moment at least im going to have to trust you she paused deliberately to see if he would defend himself but when he said nothing she went on if you summarily dismissed her against her will if you leveraged me into her spot before that happened as i told you before i want nothing to do with the job thats absolutely final okay granted ive received your message loud and clear mary kate wasnt happy with us and the reverse was true we were coming to a mutual parting of the ways when i met with you i tried to help her justine i wanted her to work out but the truth is she didnt she was smart enough to see it thats all so you and she had spoken about her leaving before you had that first lunch with me yes rick this is extremely important to me so i dont want any mistake made about it one call to mary kate is all itll take then i think you should call her justine id like you to trust what im telling you but i can understand that you might have doubts theres nothing your friend will tell you that i havent period it was time to break the tension justine decided she smiled and splashed water on him then i think ill take your offer they bobbed together like a pair of corks as the wild tide rushed at the coral reef like an enemy on the march dissipating itself along the spiky ridge but right now im going to japan he knew what that meant she had told him about nicholas about where he was and what had happened between them he smiled and there might have been a trace of wistfulness to it it was the kind of smile a fine fisherman will give a valiant marlin that outfought him snapping the cable at the end he might rue not making the catch but he admired the creature that had deprived him might even be glad that independence had won that day you know he said ive been envious of the japaneses advertising methods for years i hope youll come back with a portfolio full of their trade secrets they both laughed at that fortuitous chiu made no answer but to put his forefinger up against his lips and sign for nangi to follow him a block up po shan road the highrise housing structures of the midlevels built for hong kongs wealthy loomed all about them giving the impression that they were moving through some enormous spectral forest mist hung heavy in the air and there were no stars or moon to be seen nangi was grateful for this he did not think that he wanted to be spotted prowling around the colony at four in the morning fortuitous chiu took them quickly off the sidewalk as they approached one towering structure silently the two of them moved down a narrow shadowshrouded alleyway filled with garbage cans and other refuse down a short flight of concrete steps and through a metalpaneled door they were inside the building in the basement light came from the lowwattage bare bulbs strung from flex along the concrete ceiling two young chinese were playing fan tan in the corridor they looked up apparently recognized fortuitous chiu and went back to their game not a word was uttered by anyone nangi did not have to ask his companion who the youths were green pang soon nangi knew they must meet third cousin tok the who must still be secreted in succulent piens apartment the triads who had effectively infiltrated most of the chinesedominated crown colony and this included the corruptionriddled royal hong kong police force were a partial acronym for san ho hiu three harmonies association this had once been the most powerful of the original chinese secret societies they had been founded by fiercely patriotic men to fight an ongoing guerrilla campaign against the invading manchus who overthrew the traditional ming dynasty in now they battled one another through the narrow streets of hong kong with cleaver and ax for the right of jurisdiction it was the spread of voracious urbanism which had broken down the chinese family unit so successfully that and the toorapid industrialization of a predominantly agricultural people now the triads offered a surrogate family and with more prestige than running a cutter which turned out three thousand blue jean legs a shift ever could these were pathetic reasons to become a street fighter for the green pang or the k the cantonese equivalent nangi thought they got off the elevator on the fourteenth floor and fortuitous chiu led the way down the hall he stopped in front of a door and extracting a set of picks from his trousers pocket set to work on the lock it popped within seconds an apartment laid out in pinks and warm yellows the color combination made nangi bilious it was a spacious twobedroom affair and he was led into one of these saw the glint of reflection off an eyeball and this was his silent greeting with third cousin tok he was a wideshouldered man younger than nangi had surmised for someone of his exalted rank with a scarred dangerous face nangi saw no resemblance whatsoever between the cousins crouching down they approached third cousin tok who when they were near moved away nangi saw that he clutched a blackbodied nikon with a mm lens there was a door between the bedrooms and it was open just a sliver nangi could make out whisperings and peering over fortuitous chius shoulder eyed the next bedroom he saw a slice of window the shoulder of a teak dresser laden on top with small crystal perfume bottles several lipstick canisters a frame was on the wall the print or picture itself out of his line of sight a bed with pink satin covers yellow sheets piles of pillows and two bodies both were quite naked they contrasted badly in the same way the color scheme did succulent pien lying languorously with her yellowtoned flesh gleaming in the shaded lamplight beside her appearing enormous and grossly overwhelming was the pinkish flesh hairy in some places ruddy in others hairy and ruddy in still others of a westerners body it was not liu at all sharing her bed but a caucasian well over six feet nangi judged with thick gingercolored hair a rather high forehead neat mustache and clear intelligent blue eyes now where have i seen that face before nangi asked himself at the moment no one else could supply the needed information he settled down to watch and listen they were speaking in english they will be bringing threequarters of a ton across next tuesday succulent pien was saying as usual it will be lius task to guide the property through into the colony can we intercept it the gingerhaired man said its only been six weeks since the last raid there is more than bullion on this one succulent piens eyes were sparkling information is to be relayed as well very secret information what on she giggled and stroked his hairy thigh how badly would you like to know me i dont care one way or another it dawned on nangi that the man spoke with a decidedly scottish burr then it doesnt matter that i cannot tell you succulent piens voice was a rich purr now as her fingers moved down off the muscled ridge of his bare thigh she cupped him in the palm of her hand i am sworn to secrecy the gingerhaired mans eyes were half closed though i dont care a fig my darling her majestys government might have some small interest in this very secret information her fingers were stroking lightly but what am i to do stuck on the horns of dilemma this way i cannot betray a trust the gingerhaired man gave a low groan since youve sought my help my darling i think you should tell me he said through teeth gritted in pleasure its so big succulent piens gaze had dropped it constantly amazes me how big you get her head came up because this is so i will tell you nangi saw that this was all a sexual game between them she had every intention of telling him from the outset so this was how succulent pien supplemented her income he thought a confidante of the most powerful communist chinese in the crown colony she then selectively betrayed him to the other side she was stroking more strongly now her eyes never left her work the information contains new assignments for over half of the upperechelon communist operatives secreted within the crown colonys government police department and security services god in heaven it was unclear to nangi whether the gingerhaired man was reacting to the news or to succulent piens ministrations he was beginning to understand the reason for her name with a throaty laugh the chinese girl swung herself atop the prone figure inserting his rigid length into her with one swift movement closing her eyes she pushed herself against his pubic mound shuddering deeply at the contact pull on my nipples she gasped i love it when you do that his hands raised obediently and she cried out shrilly meanwhile in the adjoining room third cousin tok was snapping away with the blackbodied nikon the telephoto lens ensuring him of clear and exacting shots of the participants faces as well as their joined sweating bodies beside him fortuitous chiu raised the volume on the micro tape recorder with its extended narrowdispersion microphone on the pink and yellow bed the gingerhaired mans buttocks were bucking upward in a ragged rhythm as if he wished to dislodge his rider which he most assuredly did not but he was not yet far enough gone to lose track of priorities i dont want to compromise liu you understand that succulent pien was gasping and moaning i know it ohhh and he knows it as well he has arranged everything perfectly her voice rose to a scream oh now now now my great stallion fill me all up gradually after that nangi and fortuitous chiu crept away back the way they had come in the hallway of the basement the same two green pang were deep into their fan tan outside in the filthy alleyway nangi wiped his brow with a handkerchief its not her at all he said its liu himself hes working both sides of the street madonna hes sure to get himself killed he hasnt so far fortuitous chiu grinned hugely hes a very smart man as well as being a very nasty one nangi was doing his best to keep the elation he was feeling out of his mind it was far too busy for such an extraneous and potentially dangerous emotion he sensed the tides turning for real now and he was thinking furiously he had to be certain and he needed help for that fortuitous chiu he said how can we be certain that what the woman fed this man is not communist disinformation normally there would be no way the young chinese said certainly my sources among the communists are not good and you can imagine that third cousin tok might fare no better on that avenue he was grinning again and nangi wondered what it was that was so hilarious he was about to find out but in this case we need no outside verification the young man went on because you see the foreign devil locked in the embrace of succulent pien is charles percy redman himself and no one in hong kong least of all succulent pien would dare risk feeding him false information of this sort hes so well plugged in hed know in a shot and she would never see the light of dawn nangi his hand in his breast pocket touched the glossy surface of the red envelope liu had given him thus causing him to lose enormous face now he allowed his elation full rein what do you mean you cant read it just that protorovsan koten said its japanese isnt it protorov who had never bothered to learn the difficult and timeconsuming japanese language could nevertheless not understand that failing in anyone else it is and it isnt i dont pay you to give me riddles i did what i was ordered the immense sumo champion said i infiltrated satos kobun i worked with your lieutenant russilov at the rotenburo and as a consequence we lost your last spy i have done my duty your duty viktor protorov said is precisely what i tell you it is you must read me the papers from the tenshin shoden katori your very life depends upon it then i must surely die protorovsan for i cannot translate this paper true it is based on chinese ideograms on which also my own language is based however it uses ideograms that kanji discarded as being perhaps too complex difficult or open to misinterpretation he spread his pudgyfingered hands this might as well be arabic as far as i am concerned there is no doubt that this is the ryus code if you had allowed me to handle matters at the rotenburo your spy would now be here instead of six feet underground no doubt he could have translated this his shoulders lifted fell but now protorov slammed the tabletop grabbed up the sheets of paper in his fist it was so unfair here was the secret to tenchi literally in the palm of his hand the fruition of the most important clandestine operation he had ever mounted the sword he needed to dazzle the gru generals to galvanize the red army to begin his coup and he could not read it it was unbelievable for a moment he thought he might go mad with frustration then he took several deep breaths to calm his racing pulse one two three set his mind to working linnear is ninja koten said softly he got his training at the tenshin shodien katori it is conceivable he allowed his voice to trail off hope exploded like a lightning flash across protorovs mind yes linnear was his only hope now it had been many years since he had lived at the ryu but still traditions in japan rarely die protorov knew that there was at least some chance that the code would be the same on the surface it seemed a desperate gamble but he was now working under a severe time element mironenko was gathering the generals in six days time they would meet and he had to be there to present his plan to them he had to deliver tenchi to them or lose them forever with the neanderthals who inhabited the gru there could never be another opening not at least for the kgb protorov spun and strode from the small room calling for the doctor and his magic needle i need to speak with the subject now he said to the bespectacled physician now the doctors eyes were round and startled behind his thick lenses but you told me you were giving me fortyeight hours for the softeningup process i no longer have the time protorov snapped the real world doctor is infinitely mutable you must get used to these sudden changes but i dont know how much i can do on this short a notice the doctor said falling into step with protorov im getting erratic readings from the cerebral cortex i cant make head nor tail of them i cant guarantee how far hes under if at all then double the dose protorov ordered triple it i dont care just so long as he talks now the doctor was frantic but that strength will surely kill him in fifteen minutes twenty at the outside protorov nodded thats all the time ill need doctor please go to work on him at once his name is gordon minck and he came down to key west every so often to be with me what exactly do you mean by be with me he loved the way i went down on him alix logan said somewhat nastily does that answer your question i think it does croaker said they were in the car heading through the fumy innards of the lincoln tunnel on their way to matty the mouths place he considered the nature of her response for a moment im sorry he said i didnt know that was a sore spot alix put her head back against the seat closing her eyes her thick blond hair spread like sea foam around her cheeks what do you think a guy whos strong and handsome powerful in an oh i dont know interior sort of way goes all googleyeyed over me hes a dangerous man you can see that on his face like a scar or a ridge of pockmarks i should have you killed he tells me but i cant i dont ever want to think ill never see that face again oh very cute croaker cut in why didnt you tell me this before shut up alix snapped im telling you now arent i fluorescent light and shadow fell over them in a rhythmic pattern like notes controlled by a metronome i dont want to lose you he said but im in a business where i cant afford to make a mistake he looked at me in a way that made my insides go cold will you be a mistake alix no i wont i told him is that a promise he asked yes said and i meant it she began to cry and now look what ive done sobbing fully its all your fault it was the wail of a lost and confused child croaker didnt think he needed to refute that it was too irrational instead he changed the subject slightly so whos this mystery man minck minck alix logan said minck minck minck it was like a new toy which she did not want to give up then she decided gordon minck is the man who killed angela didion almost drove the car into the side of the tunnel what his head began to ache and there was a fearful red light behind his eyes you must be mistaken his voice was a dry rustle no more than a whisper it was all he could muster at the moment but what if shes right he asked himself all these months hiding living in fear of discovery he was a pariah at the new york city police department he no longer even existed save as tex bristol he had lied stolen gone beyond the law he had so many long years ago sworn to uphold and protect what had happened to him what madness had possessed him he felt like a malaria victim who had just awakened from an endless fever through which he had been raving he had believed so mightily in this truth that raphael tomkin had murdered angela didion in cold blood he had been so sure all the facts had pointed to it now they darted like tiny frightened fish weaving away from him as he sought again to compile them to reassure himself that he was right and alix was wrong alix sniffed wiped at her nose its like this she said ignoring his interruption tomkin made the mistake of talking to angela about his connection with minck and angela the bitch had a memory as deep as the ocean floor she remembered everything that was part of her scam how she could get whatever she wanted from almost everyone she remembered what they did not want known so of course there came a day when she threw this knowledge up at tomkin i dont really know why perhaps there was a diamond she wanted that he wouldnt give her maybe he wasnt coming by enough or maybe he was dropping in too much you could never tell with angela she blew so hot and cold anyway she could always spot a lever and she knew she had a powerful one with tomkin she wanted something from him and if he wouldnt do it she told him shed go to the papers with what she had on him it was sop with her however this time i dont think she really understood the nature of the beast she had by the tail tomkin shut up immediately refusing to get into an argument with her he saw right away that she was intractable so he called minck and minck sent out his hounds to snuff angela there was no negotiating no thinking it over whatever minck and tomkin were into was far too big of course tomkin had to be there when it went down angela was so paranoid she wouldntve opened the door to mincks people tomkin was the front man but once she unlatched the chain the three of them came in was tomkin actually there when she bought it he trembled as he voiced it knowing how important her answer was to him in the apartment but not in the bedroom he was at the bar taking an anesthetic his hands shook so much he got as much scotch on the counter as he did in his glass i had the angle from where i was hiding inside angelas clothes closet i was just coming out of the bathroom when she went to answer the door her eyes were bleak almost as if they had lost their rich color heard angelas highpitched yelp it sounded like a dog being whipped she shrugged i dont know why but i ducked into the closet right away so you were an eyewitness all right there was nothing mean about what they did to her her voice like her eyes had become washed out maybe croaker thought it was her way of protecting herself from something no one should see he took her hand in his fingers entwined they were very businesslike about what they did to her it took no time i remember just afterwards being so shocked by that such a monstrous thing it should take a long time to undo life her eyes closed for a moment incipient tears glistened along the lashes afterward they made it look like something else of course not an execution then they went into the living room and thoroughly cleaned up after tomkin they didnt find me because i crawled into a secret compartment angela had built into the back of her closet to store her furs and jewelry she loved being close to them had to curl up into a ball it was stifling and i couldnt hear anything i was terrified that at any moment theyd discover me they didnt then but they mustve known about my relationship with angela because they found me a week after i flew down to key west in the meantime theyd done their homework they knew where i was that night they knew id seen it all mincks men are professionals so ive come to learn croaker said distantly he put both hands on the wheel so the truth was close but not close enough his inner laugh was ironic and bitter the truth was nothing so clearcut as black and white tomkin hadnt killed angela he had only set her up he didnt order it didnt execute that order he merely went along with it stood by a wall away while it was happening guilty as charged your honor the voice echoed hollowly in croakers mind but what was the charge not murder in the second degree not even manslaughter instead tomkin had been an accessory to murder it had not been he who had put pressure on the commissioner to sweep the didion murder under the police blotter that had come all the way from washington dc from minck himself cloakanddagger minck croaker thought bitterly how many murders could he be held accountable for angela didions was just one in a long line he felt deflated and saddened by the vast gray areas of the world within one of which he now found himself it was a bog without form or substance where direction became hazy before fading out altogether where to go now that angela didions murderer was beyond him for he knew without doubt that he could never touch minck on this charge or any other he was defeated sunshine hit them like a fist on the manhattan side of the tunnel bouncing off the hood like a starblaze croaker headed right toward thirtyfourth street where he turned left for several long blocks then right after the light changed heading downtown on second avenue the city beckoned them with grimy fingers anger bubbled inside him turned without his knowing on alix womens motivations were so opaque to him he wished to god she had told him all this days before although what he would have done differently he did not know they still had to make the trip out of there damn it damn it damn it she touched his arm and he glanced at her im sorry for what i said before i know none of thiss your fault she ran tanned fingers through her hair i couldnt stand it down there anymore it was like prison worse in some ways at least in prison i imagine you know where you stand in key west surrounded by those two i didnt know what to expect next would minck continue to come would his feelings fade would one of them kill me then it began to feel like there was a balloon inside my head and each day it was being filled with more air soon thered be more balloon than brain and then i wouldnt be able to think at all she gave a little strangled laugh silly isnt it no croaker said softly it isnt it was remarkable how she could defuse his rage so utterly she had only to touch him to turn those eyes on him to whisper softly and all the blackness curled like ash inside him she gave a little sigh as if it had been extremely important that he corroborate her feelings i wanted to tell you all of it right away lew its important that you believe that i do her head was turned sideways toward him not just say it i dont say anything idly alix she seemed to accept that i was in shock you were such a oh i dont know a bolt out of the blue a knight in shining armor it was a joke but she did not take it that way oh yes i wanted to believe that very much but i was afraid to it was almost like you were too good to be true i had been involved with this for so long all this knowledge inside my head like a time bomb with a hair trigger i felt like i had when i was younger and you know i was the prettiest girl in my class by far oh dont think me bigheaded you only needed a mirror to see it boys buzzing around me like bees at first i reveled in it what girl wouldnt but then as i got to know them as i went through them one by one as brief boyfriends just dating and doing you know kid things id always get to a point when id suddenly realize why they wanted to date me they werent interested in talking in getting to know me they loved being seen with me and after a time trying to slip a hand underneath my dress they were hard all the time it was the only thing they thought of for a while it made me hate my beauty it was as if i had thick ankles or a long nose or was flatchested she put her hand on him it was the same with you lew why were you there i asked myself what was it you really wanted from me she laughed again it even occurred to me that minck had sent you to test me but i soon realized that was really crazy you killed both his men do you care about him it wasnt an idle question in the future it might become a key bit of knowledge for croaker to have like an extra shield or a mace held behind his back because he had already come to a decision there was only one thing left for him to do after all how can i answer that alix said as they pulled up outside an apartment house in the twenties the affair has been taking place in limbo or outer space i dont have any signposts to use as reference points she turned away i wouldntve gone to bed with him if i hadnt felt something im not at all like angela was yet i havent a clue what it was i felt its almost as if by having sex with him by establishing a link that was physical as well as oh what should i call it psychic i suppose she shrugged not emotional its possible but i dont think so i have some small perspective on it now i think i felt that by establishing this link with my well he was my jailor really wasnt he id somehow be less of a prisoner but it didnt work out that way the curl of a smile do you really think it could have no of course not it was stupid of me really i never should have trusted someone like that in the first place but my god lew was so desperate it was just crushing me inside i felt alix screamed as the explosive bullet burst through the side window tore off threequarters of the top of the sedan croaker had already been moving pulling her toward him covering her upper torso and head with his bulk at the same time his gun was drawn but another shot rocked the car on its shocks a great fist reaching out from the void exploding layers of chrome steel aluminum and plastic safety glass webbed and pebbled fluttering down over them as gently as doves wings croaker could smell smoke there was no rear door left on his side not much top over their heads either he leaned forward making alix squeal with the pressure and jerked down the handle of the door on her side pushed with the flat of his free hand rolled her out onto the sidewalk like a sack of potatoes he turned off the ignition but the third shot had already hit the car ripping through metal into the gas tank there was a dull thud like a dropped bowling ball flames licked up and a curl of oily smoke made him cough croaker turned toward the direction from which the shots were being fired but he had no vantage point could move very little and the smoke was becoming denser he heard sirens rising and falling loudening coming this way he got out the same way alix had and taking her hand began to run he ignored the entrance to matty the mouths building as if it had no significance for him they hurled down second avenue passing a police emergency squad wagon a fire truck and a pair of blueandwhites all heading the wrong way up second horns blared traffic snarled people stood and stared then began to drift toward the scene within moments a goodsized crowd had formed watching the flow of people tanya vladimova cursed herself for firing prematurely but she had not known how long they were stopped for further just ten minutes ago her beeper had gone off it was time for the drop into japan she had not been ready for that not when she was so close to her quarry circumstances had conspired against her they had manipulated her rather than the other way around now as she dismantled the attlovsonigen stowing it in a compartment beneath the carpeting of her car she resigned herself even had she not been on a time allotment she would not have been able to go after alix logan and lewis croaker her linkup with arrts had digested the fingerprints she had lifted in raleigh had spat out his name too many people too many cops more coming more sirens detectives unmarked cars spreading the traffic like moses heading out across the red sea tanya turned her ignition and got out of there heading uptown through the midtown tunnel out to the long island expressway and kennedy airport she cleared her mind of what she had not been able to accomplish here she accelerated into the left lane not more than a mile later she was slowed by traffic that seemed to build up out of thin air she began to go over what she had to do next and in what order she must do it there was a pinpoint of light it was extremely annoying because it kept pricking into his brain in an odd kind of cadence dumteedumteedumdum otherwise he was surrounded by the milky luminescence of getsumei no michi it should have been wholly opalescent and peaceful it would have been except for the pinpoint of light dumteedumteedumdum he tried to think of nothing that at least should have been easy he could not in vain he reached out for the void but each time he sought a clear path to it the pinpoint of light stood directly in his way he tried to push it aside he could not he tried kiai this too had no effect he had no strength left within him because the white pinpoint kept pricking his brain as if with electric shocks he could not think could not concentrate could not center himself if only he had his katana if only he could remember where he had left isshogai dumteedumteedumdum isshogai nicholas murmured strapped and sweating on protorovs wheel what the hell is that protorov wanted to know koten it means for life the sumo said sullenly it sounds to me like a name of a samurais katana he was not happy this process was tiresome he wanted to be left alone with nicholas linnear five minutes would do nicely he thought although what a ninja would be doing with a samurai sword is beyond me its his sword protorov asked missing nothing russilov did you confiscate such a weapon from him no sir did you see such a thing no sir protorov directed himself back to his client nicholas he asked in an entirely different tone of voice where is your katana where is isshogai dumteedumteedumdum the pinpoint would not let him go pincers inside his brain ro rotenburo thats not good koten said a samurai sword is its masters signature we dont want anyone picking it up and asking questions about it protorov nodded as if he had already thought of that go and get it koten he said if you bring it back here theres a chance hell be able to get his hands on it the sumo warned that wont matter at all protorov considered options tell me is he right or lefthanded koten moved closer to nicholas observing the layers of callus along the bottom edge of either hand right i would say break the first three fingers of that hand koten was overjoyed to doit almost lovingly he reached out and grasped the index finger of nicholas right hand he undid the strap then snapped the digit sideways nicholas groaned his body shook sweat rolled off him like water scrolling from a swimmer twice more koten unstrapped a finger and went to work on it twice more nicholas groaned and jerked he was drenched his head hung chin on heaving chest the doctor stepped in and checked his pulse his blood pressure now go and do as ive ordered protorov said to koten you will save us the possibility of embarrassment and he will only be able to look at his weapon longingly when koten was gone protorov dug out the papers his spy had stolen from the tenshin shoden katori ryu he stared at nicholas right hand hanging by the straps at two fingers and wrist already the broken digits were swollen like sausages the flesh was darkening how will the pain affect him he asked the doctor it should rouse him a bit will it interfere with cerebration at all with him i would say no definitely not protorov nodded and reaching out took a handful of nicholas wet hair he picked up the head slapping at the cheeks until the eyelids fluttered open then he shoved the first page of coded text in front of the blearyeyed face focus he commanded in a soft voice something here for you to read nicholas something youll enjoy nicholas frowned deep down he felt a terrible aching a trident its tines coated with poison lancing into him it seemed very far away however as if even it might be part of a dream or an hallucination it seemed important to focus so he tried to do so he seemed to be swimming through viscous gas he could not fathom how he was breathing the stuff because it was obvious that he could not move through it he flailed and stayed still or was it that he only thought he was flailing black and white breaking up coalescing only to dissolve once more focus came the command from the bright pinpoint which seemed directly inside his brain so he thought he would do that focus characters swimming by him like schools of fish like a forests underbrush like tongues of fire like the hissing rain it was pouring pouring letters not letters ideograms he read and came face to face with that which he had sought for so long tenchi three years ago hare maru lost at sea in violent typhoon over fifty lives lost sailors and civilians greatest marine disaster in twentyfive years therefore underwater salvage operations begun immediately the weather cleared at spot of last radio message nemuro straits he pushed the dulled pain away from him sealing it off he closed an inner door on the white pinpoint dumteedumt quiet he moved out of getsumei no michi which had been no shelter at all and therefore of no use to him he commenced to still himself beginning with his fingertips a number of which for some reason he could not feel rising inward the moon lifting into the cloudy heavens its bright clear face reflecting in unending undulations thus he began to pull himself together centering slowly despite the enormous amount of chemicals inside him while he began the difficult process of breaking them down into harmless components which would then be flushed out a ninjutsu art known as ogawanojutsu he did precisely what protorov was asking him to do discover the secret of tenchi it was not lost on him that what he was reading was in code the tenshin shoden katori code he also grasped that if his enemy was showing it to him then he must have no one else to translate it for him and if nicholas died that would be the end therefore protorov would have nothing to transmit or to use therefore nicholas decided after he had finished reading this document he must die and even as his mind reeled with the fantastic knowledge of just what tenchi was even as he recalled satos wish for japan to end its childhood of dependence on the rest of the world to enter the adulthood of selfsufficiency he began the process just a foot away from him protorov could not tell whether nicholas was just looking or reading did he know the code or didnt he tell me what this says he repeated over and over brandishing all four sheets tell me tell me tell me but nicholas eyes kept crossing and protorov noticed that his clients color was fading the doctor stepped between them thats enough he said putting the flat of his stethoscope over nicholas heart immediately he ripped the ear plugs off and began to pound on nicholas chest fist against the flat of his hand i warned you against this he managed between grunts were going to lose him no protorov cried you must save him i order it the doctor gave a grim laugh unlike you comrade i know that i am not a god i cannot create life out of death he allowed his hands to drop he stared at them then turned around to glare at protorov i cannot undo what you have done colonel rouse him doctor protorov was beside himself he has told me nothing nothing at all thats always the risk one takes in these neuropharmacological matters the balance is ever so deli he recoiled bounding off nicholas frame as protorov hit him with his fist that will cost you colonel he said wiping at his split lip central will hear about this you protorovs voice was a low guttural growl you killed him it was your doing his hands were shaking with the force of his rage tenchi the grukgb summit the great coup all dust in the wind now as ephemeral as wishes russilov he cried take him into protective custody if he gives you any trouble at all put a bullet through his head he grabbed the doctor by his shirtfront jerking him forward youve made your last empty threat he said just before he threw the doctor away from him russilov one hand on his holstered pistol took the mans arm in a viselike grip watching them depart protorov tried vainly to control the rage sweeping through him shaking him like a tree in a storm he could not believe it how could this happen he thought it was outrageous inconceivable he would not believe it he turned back to nicholas limp body he looked upon it as one does ones own failings he despised it with a fierceness that bordered on pain he remembered striking down an icon once a crucifix made of wood painted in gilt and white bright red where drops of blood leaked at open palms crossed ankles bethorned forehead it broke when it fell and he ground it underfoot with the heel of his polished boot the agony it had conveyed which for the owner at least had been transmuted into a constancy of faith had been incoherent to him yet now the extreme of pain the crucifixion represented was revealed to him it was as much a shock to him as if he had woken up in the morning to find that his legs had been amputated abruptly the world was not the same anymore and never would be again a certain peace a wholeness not only of flesh but of spirit as well was gone and in its stead rose a torment engulfing and endless up until this moment there had never been any real doubt in his mind that he would achieve his goals lofty or not they would be his he was clever and he was ruthless like einstein he was an intuitive thinker who could make great leaps that bypassed plodding logic that he knew was as close as man would ever get to traveling at the speed of light now he had to face the crushing reality that that was not enough he would not learn the secret of tenchi he would not make his summit there would therefore be no coup no greatness for viktor protorov history would not enthrone him it would now not even notice him protorov looked at nicholas linnear with a murderous glare and saw only his own undoing he saw how close he had come to ultimate victory and how far away it was knowledge that he could not tolerate a man berserk he railed at the cool flesh pounding it over and over again while great gasping grunts emanated from him in such profusion and with such clarion pealing that even russilov dared not reenter the vault but even this physical venting of his rage and pain was not enough the body was manacled an absolute prisoner to strike his late client thus a man who had caused him to lose everything both diminished protorov and increased his agony swiftly still grunting like a wild boar he unfastened the leather straps that bound nicholas to the wheel first fingers and wrists were freed then thighs and ankles lastly the waist strap came undone and the form fell onto him with the force of a sack of cement clawing and kicking protorov thrust the body away from him while at the same time seeking to follow it to attack it anew now that it had been freed and in his mind at least was fair game for him what could he think then when in the midst of his red red rage a corpse pronounced deceased by his neuropharmacologica expert reached an arm out and grasped the side of his corded neck for the western mind death is a difficult commodity to come by because there is no acceptance of it because there is no thought as to its confluence with life human beings are more often than not most difficult to kill the simple fact is that the organism does not want to die to this end it will cling tenaciously to life it will push the body to superhuman inexplicable feats of strength and endurance cars have been moved by quite ordinary people in this kind of situation extraordinary jumps have been made exposure to the elements sustained beyond all measure then there is the body itself a bullet to the head may be turned aside by the skull similarly a knife thrust can be deflected by an intervening rib in the east however where traditionally death means nothing it is different death comes with the speed of a lightning bolt giving the spirit of the organism no time to react at all ancient teachings as well allow an assailant to actually use the human body against itself and that was precisely how death came to viktor protorov how nicholas linnear did indeed become c gordon mincks terrible swift sword perhaps he knew to what use he had been put certainly he did not care nothing was in his mind his spirit was as clear as a mountain lake after a strong rain as he pressed inward with the thumb of his left hand breaking apart protorovs collar bone and using it as a sword to sever the vital arteries that rose upward from the heart like a branching tree there was nothing to it it was over in the space of a double heartbeat it was so simple thirtyfive years of personal training perhaps a thousand more before that for the discipline itself made it so nicholas was slow to rouse after that the process by which he had withdrawn blood from the surface of his body by which he had stilled his pulse and his pressure was an enormously complex and draining one both physically and mentally slowly blood returned to all of him and his skin blushed he was heating up again a dying sun returning from the embers of dormancy slowly he focused on the grotesquely canted corpse sprawled beside him blood drenched them both binding them in a last attempt to bridge a gap that could never be spanned nicholas felt no remorse though there was no fine feeling in snuffing out the life of another human being or even an animal for that matter the elation of life lifted him in its glorious embrace he was alive and viktor protorov was dead he was flooded with the juices of life he rode all the air currents of the world swam in all the seas lakes and streams he padded through the forests and loped across the plains he stalked the veldts skittered through the deserts there was not any place on earth where he was not at that moment connected once more to the cosmos he stood at the void and was replenished and this is for third cousin tok himself nangi said sliding hk across the table to fortuitous chiu i want you to be generous with the heung yau he said knowing that the sowing of fragrant grease brought great face with it but also be certain to stress the patriotic elements of this matter i want it made perfectly clear to third cousin tok just who these people are in that event there will be genuine pleasure in what they will be doing fortuitous chiu nodded i understand completely good nangi smiled he had already sown his seeds in the form of anonymous calls to several police sergeants one in wan chai one in central a third in stanley who it was suspected by the green pang were working for the communists when nangi had asked fortuitous chiu why they were allowed to operate the young chinese had smiled and said how do the quai loh put it better the devil you know than the one you do not youd do well at the golden mountain nangi had said using the chinese designation for america perhaps the young man had said but i have no wish to leave the crown colony my fortune will be made here nangi had no doubt about that at all now as the heavy fog of twilight settled over hong kong like a mantle of velvet he rose and said im starved shall we have dinner fortuitous chiu nodded where would you like to go i want a fine chinese meal nangi said ill leave it in your hands the young man looked at him for a moment then he bowed slightly and without making another gesture said this way please fortuitous chiu took him into the countryside north into the new territories gradually as they approached the border of china itself the communities became smaller high rises giving way to two and threestory housing strung together by arcs of slapping washing naked children ran in the dirt streets dogs barked angrily and fought with each other amid the trash heaps parking they crossed a kind of central square where hawkers abounded edged down a side street that was impossibly narrow this is the restaurant we will be going to the young man said using his chin to point its the best of its kind in hong kong they went past the place and entered an openair market nangi saw that this was built on a long dock he could see the water the fishing boats tied up their crews making ready for the early mornings sail as they walked between rows of stalls fortuitous chiu said usually those boats return with holds filled with more than fish its a bit too hazy tonight to see but just across there is communist china refugees are brought in here all the time all the stalls sold live fish tanks were set up filled with seaweedy water in which somnolently swam fish big medium and small shellfish such as giant prawn and abalone conch and crab squid with the black button eyes of the dead were much in evidence as were crayfish as large as lobsters what is your preference we are in china nangi said a chinese should choose fortuitous chiu took this responsibility quite seriously as they moved from stall to stall he would indicate an item here two there as they were drawn out of their tanks he would handle them all sniffing and prodding like an old woman to make certain he was picking the finest specimens of the lots then would begin the haggling a game of endless manipulation and strategy that like gambling fascinated and invigorated the chinese at last carrying his catch in plastic bags made heavy and bulging with sea water fortuitous chiu led nangi back to the restaurant the owner a fat sweating chinese greeted the young man with the kind of respect one normally accords a visiting lord nangi wondered at this but he knew that good manners forbade him from asking fortuitous chiu about it that evening they dined on no less than nine courses of exquisitely prepared seafood from succulently sauteed abalone to grilled crayfish choked with fiery hot chili sauce that made even nangis eyes water made him long for the relative calm of wasabi the traditional japanese green horseradish he loved so much for more than three hours they feasted and in true chinese fashion talked of nothing of serious import during that time the chinese as opposed to the japanese who were far more fanatic about business believed that nothing should take away from the savoring of a meal in that respect they were the french of the far east when at length they returned to the hotel nangi bade fortuitous chiu come with him stuffed into the mail box of nangis room behind the concierges desk was a telephone message there was no number to call back rather the slip of paper contained an address a date tomorrows or rather because it was already after midnight todays and an hour two am madonna nangi thought disconsolately on the elevator ride up what am i going to do now im to meet a man this morning he told fortuitous chiu when they had reached his room in just under two hours he read off the address which was on wong chuk hang road thats ocean park fortuitous chiu said normally it would be closed this late but this week its being kept open all day and all night to coincide with the dragon boat festival which is actually the day after tomorrow the fifth day of the fifth moon also to raise money for the amusement park the tourists they say love it nangi went into the closet rummaging around out of the others sight for a moment he returned with two identical manila envelopes he handed one to fortuitous chiu i must take one of these with me tonight he said the copy you have was destined for the governor i wanted you with the governor at the same time my meeting was taking place i would have felt safer that way but now hold on fortuitous chiu said may i use the phone of course for a little more than five minutes he spoke in a choppy rapidfire dialect fortuitous chiu put down the phone turned to nangi its all set now no sweat whats all set at two this morning he said i will be sitting opposite the governor of hong kong nangi was nonplussed i i dont understand how is that possible my father is taking care of it like i said no sweat nangi recalled the manner in which fortuitous chiu had been received at the restaurant in the new territories he thought of the power of third cousin tok he thought of the green pang lastly he thought of the five dragons the five heads of the hong kong triads the most powerful men in the colony who could fortuitous chius father be to be able to reach the governor at this time of the night how powerful did he have to be how much clout did he need to possess nangi bowed slightly i am in your debt as i am in yours i have gained great face with my father now to business you will sit with the governor nangi said god alone knows what you will converse about my father will do all the talking nangi thought about that if i dont call you by three you must assume the worst give the governor all the evidence against liu it will cause a sensation fortuitous chiu said a scandal of the highest order the communists will lose enormous face they will wont they nangi said musingly very bad for them nangi nodded either way its very bad for them they stood facing each other in the room there was not much more to say and time was running short fortuitous chiu gave a little bow until we meet again elder uncle nangi held his breath the honor which he had just been accorded was vast elder uncle was a term used to connote respect and a certain sense of friendship that was not possible to accurately translate into western concepts may all the gods protect you nangi whispered he was speaking of the myriad chinese deities none of whom he needless to say believed in but who were very important to fortuitous chiu silently then he prayed for them both godspeed ocean park built primarily with funds donated by the royal hong kong jockey club was nangi discovered set on two discrete levels one entered through turnstiled gates strolling along paths bordering massive flower gardens arbors filled with brightly colored parrots who for hk would accommodatingly perch on ones shoulder while a color photo of the occasion was taken by an attendant up a short hill was a bonsai collection of awesome proportions there were tiny pavilions erected by air new guinea and other such airlines featuring local flora farther along in this area was a swan pond numerous waterfalls and beyond an openair stadium where sea creatures performed nangi did not get that far however he had been told to buy a ticket on the funicular which ran at an extreme angle from ocean parks lowlands three thousand feet into the air to the sky terminus high atop a rocky promontory jutting out into the south china sea there a manmade atoll reef the worlds first wavecove and another larger stadium waited to entertain visitors there were four sets of funiculars tiny glassenclosed bubbles within which as many as six people could sit facing inward hanging by what looked to nangi to be a slender piece of steel from the cable line nangi had been told to take the funicular on the far left he joined the line moving forward periodically as the cable cars came back down the mountainside swung around to make the return journey he did not look around that would have cost him face but he was nevertheless acutely aware of who stood near him in front and in back on either side he saw tourists from the west and from japan he saw chinese teenagers chattering no doubt about the excitement of being at the park so late or else he thought cynically they were betting on which car would detach itself from the cable and plummet to the craggy slopes far below he was aware of no one who took the slightest interest in him he wondered when contact was going to be made he was at the front of his line now perhaps it would not come until he had landed on the promontory would he share the funicular with the chinese family just behind him the car came in empty swung around the doors swung open and the uniformed attendant waved him forward he became aware that the attendant had barred the family behind him from entering his car it was so small in there that he experienced some difficulty in sitting a man swung aboard where he had come from nangi could not say the doors closed and they were caught in the moving gears the funicular shuddered slowly forward ahead nangi could see what was waiting for him a string of tiny lighted cars like glass beads strung on a wire arced ahead and above they halted momentarily at the edge of the concrete terminus it all seemed very solid safe as a stroll in a garden then with a breathtaking abruptness they were launched out into space swinging back and forth giddily following the path set by the glass beads before them nangi turned his attention to his companion he was a heavyset chinese of indeterminate age he could have been fifty or seventy or anywhere in between he had a flat nose brushcut hair that was so short his sunburned scalp could be seen through it against this close scrutiny the chinese bared his teeth all gold in a smile or a grimace nangi could not tell which good morning mr nangi the chinese said nodding i am lo whan nangi returned the pleasantry tell me have you been to ocean park before never but i have been to hong kong many times indeed lo whans tone of voice indicated that it was of no import to him he turned in his molded plastic seat the kind one encountered in hospital waiting rooms i myself have been here many times i never tire of this view and one rarely gets a chance to see it at this time of the morning indeed the sight of the great flat expanse of the south china sea the black humped and hilly shapes of the small islands dotting the space like rocks in a zen pebble garden was spectacular long ships strung with glowing lights like eyes plowed the depths here and there dusky jewels set in a dark rich fabric moonlight lent it a metallic aspect scimitars of cool illumination glancing off the oceans face as if it were chain mail consider yourself fortunate lo whan said and nangi did not know whether he meant the sight or something more hidden the chinese closed his hand in his lap as they ascended the steep wooded slope if they were to drop off the line now nangi observed there would be no chance for either of them the scree below would batter anything that fell to oblivion it has come to my attention lo whan said through sources both far removed from me and devious that some information is about to be moved his eyes were bright vitally important information was i think the particular phrase used further it was passed on to me that this information concerns certain ah links to canton and northward that could perhaps be compromised under particular circumstances nangi nodded that in essence is correct i see nangi produced a copy of the contract that he and liu had signed he unfolded it put it carefully on the empty seat to his right lo whan observing what that seat now contained did nothing but look back at nangi though the information that had made its circuitous way to him had included the stipulation that he bring lius copy of the document his eyes were stony nangi handed over the manila envelope carefully as if its contents might be lethal lo whan used one long nail to slit the seal he slid the contents out one by one and looked at them they consisted of sixteen x black and white prints of very high quality and resolution a mini tape player in which resided an unedited copy of the tape fortuitous chiu had made of the proceedings at succulent piens apartment a twelvepage transcript of the tape recording lo whan slipped on a pair of goldrimmed spectacles and for the next ten minutes or so ignored nangi and his surroundings engrossed by what he had been given by the time he had reviewed all of the material thoroughly they had alighted at the sky terminus they went out away from the crowds along the rock promontory interesting lo whan said carrying the incriminating evidence under his arm like a business portfolio but hardly worth the price you are asking the chinese shoulders shrugged we can return liu to the sanctity of his homeland at any time i dont think it will be quite that easy nangi said working hard to avoid the rocks the path lo whan had deliberately chosen was strewn with them liu is a fixture here hes known by everyone if you pull him now in the face of the scandal that i assure you will follow your country will suffer a great propaganda loss you will lose all the advantage over england you have gained in the past two and a half years worst of all you will lose great face the wind blew lightly in their faces smelling faintly of salt and phosphorus lights from the ships far out semaphored unknown messages to unknown recipients they are like lo whan and me nangi thought staring at the lowlying vessels they may know where they are going but they cant actually see it lo whan was lost in thought it seemed to him only just if in the next several moments liu were to slip in the bathtub and break his neck it would save us all face and i could dismiss this clever ape of a japanese sending him back across the sea to his puny island home where he belongs but he knew none of that would happen or was even possible everything nangi said was true it was galling he could not do away with liu not with the information the japanese had one word to the governor and he would be on the phone to her majestys government to one ministry or another that would be intolerable to lo whan and his superiors then an idea hit him he stared out to sea as if nothing at all had happened he turned it over looking at it from every side as if it were a gemstone he was considering purchasing which in a way it was he did not rush yet he was acutely aware of the passage of time he could not make as much use of it as he would wish to take too long would lose him face in this battle of wits but the longer he examined his idea the more he liked it and the more he felt that by employing it he would gain the upper hand over this oriental barbarian it is our considered opinion he began cautiously that we want nothing untoward to happen to mr liu in fact we want him precisely where he is undisturbed now he reached into an interior jacket pocket and drew out the mate to nangis contract this becomes null and void he said the moment we agree on one point all evidence amassed against mr liu and indeed this succulent pien will be destroyed copies originals negatives everything will be delivered to an address that i will provide in addition you will sign an agreement that from this day forward you will make no move against either of them nor employ either directly or indirectly anyone else to do so but i do not want that contract voided nangi said this was a terrible risk but he judged the potential rewards more than worth it lo whan stood stock still it was as if nangi had slapped him across the face with the document his surprise cost him face and he did not like that what is it you want then he said testily i want us to go back to the original agreement i proposed to liu that is in exchange for a thirty percent interest in the keiretsu a strictly nonvoting interest you agree to provide capital over the next three years in semiannual payments on january first and july first of each year we already have a great deal of capital invested in you mr nangi lo whan pointed out thirtyfive million dollars worth but nangi was already shaking his head that was for the inconvenience your lieutenant chin caused the allasia bank as of now you have no investment at all lo whans eyes locked with nangis he was burning inside with anger and loss of face he had no intention of being defeated here on his own soil he had only one last desperate recourse i wonder he said whether you have lost your interest in why we have taken such exquisite pains to acquire a sizable portion of your keiretsu a vague premonition sprang up inside nangi but he forced it down he is bluffing he thought carefully he said mr liu has already delineated the communist point of view the oriental alliance yes we are both familiar with lius er drawbacks he cocked his head surely you dont think weve told him everything nangi was silent there are currently in peking two distinct factions we have the maoists on one side and the socalled capitalist readers on the other in the fifties as you no doubt know the soviets rejected stalinism mao an avowed stalinist bitterly accused the russians of revisionism that ideological rift between the two countries has more or less stood until the present however those currently in power have been clandestinely seeking an accord with the kremlin for some time now lo whan shifted his buttocks as if he were uncomfortable others perhaps not content with the current flow of the river are seeking to dredge an alternative course they it is whispered seek a propaganda weapon to use against the soviets and thus against those in power in peking nangi now saw the precarious spot his adversary was in lo whan need not spell out in so many words to which faction he belonged his masters were not yet fully in power in the north his heart beat fast did the communist know about tenchi it seems to me he said that there was little good that came out of maos reign i will not debate ideology with you lo whan said your keiretsu may hold the key to the future of our country the oriental alliance was not a lie it was simply not the whole of it nangi felt the triumph surging through his veins i have won he told himself there are no more cards for him to play he is truly defeated now he may know tenchi exists but he does not know its secret and now he never will there is nothing more to do nangi said but to amend the documents lo whans back bowed he felt one hundred years old then you have doomed us and yourselves to a pact that must have diabolical consequences i dare not contemplate what the outcome of a full alliance between my country and russia might be he spoke but it was as if nangi had not heard him nangis own personal triumph had made him drunk the ancient enmity between these two people impossible to overcome it took them almost forty minutes to make all the require changes in the two contracts to initial the changes and to resign the documents lo whan drew out a pad and commenced to draw up the final clause which he had verbally outlined to nangi at that point nangi excused himself and went picking his way over the black rocks to make his call to fortuitous chiu when he returned both signed the two copies lo whan had made nangi was now enjoined from interfering with liu or succulent pien both men put their documents away they stood on the rock promontory in neat silk suits despite the hour solemn despite the joyous yelps of people on the other side of the cliff applause came ringing from the ocean theater where killer whales were jumping through hoops and seals were spinning striped balls on their upraised noses with care nangi extracted the red envelope that liu had given him he presented it to lo whan and now came the electronically amplified voice of the master of ceremonies ringing through the rocks faces ladies and gentlemen the thrilling finale tony theerson c gordon mincks boy wonder had one of those beehive minds so sought after in the highest levels of computer technology perhaps it was because when you came right down to it his mind was tuned more to the binary byways of machines than it was to the ephemeralia of human thought it was a rare day indeed when the boy wonder felt any more complex emotion than hunger thirst tiredness or the mild discomfort of a full bladder elation came with the final dissolution of a difficult code he had ranked them in his mind giving them names he had made up into orderly rows of words sentences paragraphs which he then turned over to tanya vladimova and minck himself in fact orderliness to a degree a normal human being would find intolerable was tonys way of life the clutter of his office was evidence enough of that his idea of orderliness resided in his computers memory banks and in his own genius mind for theerson was aptly nicknamed no one else on this side of the atlantic had any chance of deciphering the soviet alphathree ciphers except the boy wonder they were absolute ballbreakers which not coincidentally was tonys designation for the highest difficulty codes he was given to crack and like other geniuses of his ilk theerson was thrown by factors either unknown to him or inexplicable his whole life was a crusade to make the unknowable knowable logic rulesl said a brass plaque in his office thus when he finally cracked the most recent of the alphathrees when the english words swam upward onto his terminal screen from the belly of his own private farm of beasts he assumed that a glitch had sprung up he cleared the screen and called up the program from scratch and got precisely the same message that meant no glitch but he rechecked his functions back down the line until he reached each and every input the result was still the same no glitch for a long time he sat staring at the message it was like reading martian it made no sense it had no logic just like he thought the lyrics to a rock and roll song its bad he said after the melody had faded off his lips its very very bad he was abruptly aware of how shaken he felt with that he punched for a hard copy when it clattered out he folded it up and wiped the screen of words it was time he thought to see minck when theerson found him minck was contemplating the end phase of his vendetta against viktor protorov in fact he was enormously pleased with himself sending tanya vladimova in against his archenemy was a step he had longed to take years ago but could never bring himself to do the entrance of nicholas linnear into his life had changed all that in the innermost sanctum of his mind minck tended to think of himself much like the god wotan that richard wagner had depicted in the ring cycle oneeyed and full of pride and thus flawed a loving god and a vengeful one it would never have occurred to him to go after protorov in any direct fashion it would have been unthinkable for instance for him to board a plane for japan himself a webley pistol in hand to hold to his enemys head and pull the trigger that was not at all because minck was a coward he was far from that battle did not faze him hardship both emotional and physical had been a way of life for him for many years rather he saw this kind of personal revenge as being overshadowed by his duty to red section to the people who worked for him and thus depended on his skills to guide them and keep them whole in a world that wished to blow them apart duty to his country much of this was indeed true however it was to mincks benefit not to dwell too deeply on the other baser motivation he suspected now that he was perhaps closer to feeling like a god of wotans stature than he had realized the valhalla syndrome afflicted many of his kind throughout the world for it was mincks firm conviction that he possessed a power fully as great as the spear wotan had fashioned out of the world ash tree the spear by which he controlled all creatures even the giant fafnir the spear by which he need only touch someone to end their life the agents of red section were mincks spear they were his power tanya vladimova was part of that to be sure but he loved her too much to be able to commit her to entering the den of a lion of protorovs cunning oddly he loved her in just the way wotan loved his daughter brunnhilde she was closer to him than any other human being in the world with her he played out his plans he spun his variegated web he could not bear the thought that he might send her to her death at the hands of his enemy he had held back waiting as patiently as any japanese for the right moment which was now already she must be landing in tokyo his weapon against the fall of night abruptly he looked up aware that someone was standing in the open doorway to his office few had clearance onto this level of the building fewer still were allowed to roam unescorted through the set yes tony he said switching off his train of thought as he would a faucet do you have something for me a flicker in the boy wonders manner alerted minck and he beckoned with his hand come in come in all his senses were questing now theerson came across the bare wood floor and sat in a canebacked chair in front of mincks desk i just cracked the latest alphathree the paper in his hand wafted back and forth lifting and falling in his grasp are you going to show it to me or just use it as a fan minck saw the boy wonder wince and his heart beat fast what was wrong youd better let me see that he said holding out his hand almost reluctantly theerson passed it over he sat staring at his hands in his lap he felt useless and impotent mincks gaze went from him down to the sheet of paper this is what he read newest penetration via linnear nicholas amateur status warning highly lethal objective tenchi your death sanctioned by this office accessed file on linnear follows am linnears backup will advise on arrival tokyo volk volk minck thought a wolf in the fold his mind had gone numb with the thought that tanya vladimova his tanya was a dig dug a soviet plant but how oh christ he slammed his fist down on the desk with such force that tony theerson jumped as if struck with a needle get out of here minck growled get out of my sight the boy wonder jumped up and retreated across the room he had seen minck in a fury twice before and had no desire to get in the way of it now at the door minck stopped him hold it reluctantly theerson turned to face his master theres something i dont understand tanya knew that you were working on the alphathree codes she knew you were the best at breaking them why in christs name would she use them the boy wonder shrugged for one thing i dont think she had a choice the alphathrees are still by far the most secure ciphers the soviets have he shuddered when he said the word soviets he still could not believe the truth she knew that my success was spotty in fact not too long ago we spoke about it now that i think about it she even asked me how i was coming on the latest one he nodded that would have been this one here i told her it was the worst yet i didnt think id crack it maybe twelve hours after that i got the first breakthrough it came like a bolt of lightning after that it was just a matter of a lot of donkey work much of which the computers did minck contemplated the boy wonder he had not even bothered to say something as fatuous as there must be some mistake he knew theerson too well the man just did not make mistakes he might not be able to break every alphathree but when he did he knew whereof he spoke you did a fine job tony his voice was as bleak as a winters day theerson nodded sadly im sorry really i am minck waved him mutely away when he was again alone he rose and taking the hideous message with him went into the now windowless room next door dhzerzinsky square greeted him as ugly as all russian architecture was to him above the dark crepuscular sky across the square childrens world where gift wrapped presents were presented back across the square the black zil entered the rats hole of lubyanka he had returned running for his life through the snyeg all sound muffled all life stifled how much information had he unwittingly provided the russians how many steps ahead of him was viktor protorov for the message was clear enough volk reported to him tanya and protorov how had he done it how minck ground his teeth together he was having trouble breathing how the wolf must have laughed at his idea to send her in to back up linnear and how she must have panicked on learning that he had sent linnear in against her master he could see her face clearly at the moment she had learned what he had done how he had so cleverly improvised how he had misread her concern what perspectives the truth lent reality he paced the room moscow all around him cloaked in winters dank and frosty grip he did not want to see the changing of the seasons there like his burning hatred he wished only to see the citys immutability what to do now he wondered how in gods name could he salvage the operation he had not heard from linnear certainly he could send no other agent in after her she would be instantly alerted a call from him an order home would have the same effect she knew there was nothing on the boards there could not be as important as tenchi and protorov like a parent at the moment of parting with his child he felt utterly betrayed yet he could not bring himself to hate her nothing she could do to him could destroy his love there must be an answer he thought furiously i have pulled victory from the edge of defeat many times before why should this be any different but he knew the answer to that never had he been faced with a disaster of this magnitude to have a dig dug within his own red sector was for him intolerable it was to him other agencies came to ferret out just such dangers within their own hierarchies no answer came to him tanya by her very position within red section knew all of its personnel individuals from agencies allied with the family would never get to her and besides alerting her there was another danger in going outside his own organization hed never live the infiltration down no one must know of tanya vladimovas heinous betrayal he was becoming frantic his mind racing from one possibility to another discarding each one almost as soon as he had thought of it why hadnt linnear used the access number his intercom buzzed he ignored it but the sound would not go away he wanted no interruptions now and reached out for the disconnect button he hit the on switch instead and the floor receptionists voice rang in the room someone here to see you sir i want to see no one is that clear yes sir but the gentleman will not leave he insists on oh for christs sake minck thought does this gentleman have a name yes sir he says you know him his name is detective lieutenant lewis croaker his body was a mass of bruises where protorov and koten had beaten him the first three fingers of his right hand were broken and badly swollen the pain however was no problem he knew how to control that he walked gingerly over to protorovs desk turned on the paper shredder and fed the coded sheets into it now the information existed only in his head he crawled back to where protorov lay and continued his deep breathing he stared down at his bloated fingers and knew there was no help for it he could not leave them in this condition at the tenshin shoden katori he had learned koppo the subspecialization of ninjutsu which dealt in the breaking of bones in fact he had applied some of those techniques when he had gripped protorov now he needed to reverse the process on himself using only thumb and forefinger he gripped one finger at a time and began to explore just as a safes tumblers will somehow convey to the trained ear when they are about to fall into place so nicholas reached a moment in each exploration when his body told him the spot had been found more investigation revealed to him the precise angle he would need a westerner would grit his teeth tense his muscles against what his mind told him was coming thus increasing the pain nicholas relaxed his body and mind decreasing the pain he floated in getsumei no michi as his body healed itself when his eyes returned from middle distance he saw that his fingers were set ripping off a length of cloth from protorovs dress blouse he wound the coarse heavy material around and around the line of breaks until it was thick enough to act as a temporary splint he used his teeth to tie it off mindful of not cutting off local circulation then he took stock it was not good he was in a strictly shutended situation he had been lucky up until now that no one had entered to see what protorov was up to that could not last much longer he knew he was in the center of a veritable fortress in a room with one doorway thick as a banks vault he glanced upward this room by its very isolated nature had an oversized ventilation system it would have been entirely possible for him to get up to one of the vent ports high up near the rooms ceiling and exit that way had it not been for his broken fingers and the residue of the drug he needed help but he had no allies for many miles around therefore he would have to create one using ichi he gave as accurate an approximation of viktor protorovs voice as he could summon up calling out for russilov when the lieutenant appeared through the doorway he heaved protorovs limp form at him face first russilovs reaction was predictable the first autonomic reaction of throwing his hands up to protect the body was quickly followed by a stunned cry as he recognized the identity of the corpse the combination was enough to paralyze him for the amount of time nicholas needed to rush him and make him prisoner he touched russilovs chest and the russian felt his heart stutter he sagged a bit feeling abruptly faint and unable to breathe he might just as well have ingested a toxic substance all color dropped out of his face and cold sweat appeared on his upper lip and at his hairline still his head whipped around to get another look impossible he cried youre dead then we have just proved that there is life beyond the grave nicholas hissed in his ear there was blood on russilov and fastidiously stupidly he tried to brush it off nicholas took his sidearm searched him thoroughly for other weapons he found a knife on the inside of the russians left calf now youre going to get me out of here impossible as well russilov said and when nicholas tightened his grip said hurriedly no it is the truth there is an electronic scanner prisoners are stamped with an invisible mark that is renewed every week if we were to walk or drive out through any gate you would be fried i along with you if we were in the same vehicle there must be some way to get it off prematurely nicholas said there is russilov nodded protorov knew how only protorov youll never get out of here with me or without me nicholas did not despair he had been taught to infiltrate and he knew that there was a way out of every manmade structure just as there was a way in quickly he said tell me about this place russilov complied the building that protorov had chosen as his base had originally been a barn complex which he had converted to his own uses there were two exits and as russilov had said they were useless to nicholas stone walls had been erected inside the wooden ones one extra story had been built which was where they currently were russilov laughed low in his throat theres nowhere for you to go but up to the parapets from there you may leap into the dense woods my friend perhaps you will not die perhaps you will be lucky and the fall will only break your legs nicholas mind was racing it was conceivable that russilov had described his way out out now he commanded and whoever we run across must not become suspicious is that clear if you raise your voice you die if you make an unaccountedfor move you die clear the lieutenant nodded outside in the hallway they saw no one the two lieutenants had taken the doctor downstairs to a detention cell russilov led him toward the stairs up to the roof on the way they passed a number of bamboo and aluminum poles perhaps fifteen meters in length nicholas stopped him what are these for bamboo groves all around here russilov said sullenly farmers used to store and age these here the aluminum ones were for anchoring fledgling stands against the winter winds take two nicholas ordered and when russilov did so said no the bamboo poles on the roof nicholas commanded the russian to strip ordering him to spread out each item on the stones in the meantime employing russilovs knife he cut the bamboo poles in half then he set about cutting off the arms of the lieutenants blouse and jacket he cut his trousers in two took the laces from the boots what are you doing russilov asked huddled naked in a corner nicholas said nothing he sliced the russians heavy leather belt into four long strips using these and the boot laces he set to work constructing his scaffolding then he attached the pieces of cloth he worked with the loving concentration of a father constructing his childs first kite what in fact he had made was a hito washi what some ninja called the human eagle it was a makeshift glider when he was finished he walked back to where russilov knelt stripped of his uniform his rank he seemed to have shrunk in size like many military men he very nearly had ceased to exist without the armor of his command goodbye russilov nicholas said bending down and touching the juka one of the kyukon the nine organ meridians this one was just beneath the ears russilov immediately collapsed unconscious then nicholas mounted the hito washi there was a fair wind blowing from the southwest gusty and unpredictable he shrugged mentally karma he was enormously tired and he wanted to sleep badly soon he thought be careful now he mounted the stone parapet there was no moon and his chronometer had been taken from him it was deep into the night the early hours of morning it was not yet that peculiar time of predawn when a special tinge of nameless color comes into the world but he did not know how long dawn would be in arriving two good gusts came while he was still working out the vectors then as he set himself the wind died to a tickle on his face come on he thought come on his hair began to ruffle he felt the temperature drop on his bruised and purpled skin strengthening such an ephemeral thing you could not even see it he closed his eyes and felt it and when his body told him it was time he used the powerful muscles in his legs to launch himself into the dark dark void spinning for a moment plummeting then he corrected and caught a substantial updraft soared into the night like a bat akiko picked koten up at the rotenburo and followed him out of there he had arrived emptyhanded and he left with a long polished wood case to akiko whose eyes were trained for such things it appeared to be a weapons case judging by its length it could contain nothing but a daikatana the longest of all the samurai swords deep in the shadows she stiffened koten had passed through a squat ellipse of lantern light and she had gotten a good look at the case it was the same one she had seen open in the garden between nicholas and her husband koten had nicholas sword car followed car but because there was little traffic this late at night akiko was forced to douse her headlights using peripheral illumination as well as the twin ruby taillights of kotens car to aid her once or twice when the road wound up a hillside she thought she had lost him but each time as she crested the lights reappeared this was farm country very rural and she had to be careful not to be spotted but the skys darkness that hindered her also aided her for it made kotens vision behind him that much more difficult not more than thirty minutes after they left the rotenburo kotens car abruptly slowed turning left onto a hardpacked dirt lane that immediately disappeared in underbrush akiko quickly pulled onto the side of the road and got out following on foot she could not chance taking her own car in there the noise alone could alert her quarry because of the narrow twisting nature of the path she had no difficulty in keeping koten in sight in a small clearing bordered by great stands of whispering bamboo he drew up men were all about and she was close enough to hear what they were saying nicholas had escaped but what of sato she had not been at the rotenburo for long enough to find out anything of substance other than that a man apparently a patron had been killed in a mysterious auto explosion who she did not know koten had come distracting her but even so she would not have been able to ask questions without arousing suspicion japanese society was extremely clannish there was a fierce community spirit she did not belong here a stranger asking questions about what might easily be a murder what was in any case an unexplained death would be noted and the local police notified akiko could not afford such scrutiny but now she had to wonder they had spoken only of nicholas not one word was spoken of sato his name simply never came up to akiko this led to one inescapable conclusion sato was dead perhaps it had been he who had died in the car explosion or again perhaps he had died here at this forested place it did not matter part of her revenge had been taken care of for her that did not make her particularly happy she would have preferred to exact her own vengeance but she resigned herself to the reality of the situation nicholas was now her target she turned away from the edge of the clearing beginning to quarter the area immediately surrounding the clearing and its central building which looked so much like a barn but which she was certain was not at length to the southwest she found the remnants of the hito washi she hunkered down fingering it admiring the workmanship she laughed low in her throat then she set off after him of course alix had tried to stop him she had called him everything from a madman to a moron she had even cried and at the end begged him not to go by all this croaker surmised that she was genuinely afraid for him but he was not at all sure after all she was a consummate actress making love to the camera every day when she worked she could turn on or off any emotion as easily as she applied mascara each morning and wiped it away at night but then it occurred to him that she had no earthly reason to act in this case what would she get out of deterring him from flying off to washington besides seeing him safe she knew full well who it was who had tried to kill him or at least who had ordered it the same person who had now contracted for both their deaths breaking his oath to her c gordon minck the man before whom croaker now stood where the hell are we he said looking around at the leafy patio the goddamned african veldt he did not like the edge to his voice but he was frightened not only of this man and the power he wielded to cut off pursuit to twist the law to his own design but also of what he himself was thinking of doing to minck minck contrived to laugh and croaker glared at him his tightly controlled emotions flaring i ought to kill you right here with my bare hands he said low in his throat minck was still trying to recover from seeing a man standing next to him who up until just a moment ago he believed dead and buried at sea he put one hand tentatively up to his temple as if with that gesture he could press away the pain that now throbbed there like a traitor youve got to get a grip on yourself lieutenant it was the best he could do for the moment he needed some time to marshal both his emotions and his thoughts this day was rapidly turning into one of the worst in his life and he was determined to give his full attention to it lest matters deteriorate even further he gestured please sit down which one of these chairs is mined croaker said with a sneer just whats that supposed to mean minck said despite himself he had promised himself that he would not vie with lieutenant croaker on his own base ground but the pain in his head was unsettling him youve tried to kill me three times youve tried to kill alix logan twice what else would you expect me to say walking in here minck sat heavily down he groaned inwardly as the pain increased his heart rate was accelerating what are you talking about his voice was a trifle shaky his face pasty beneath his rich tan it was only now that the true gravity of the situation was beginning to dawn on him croakers expressed threat echoed in his mind like a taunt how had he managed to miss this tinkering croaker observing all this was curious the edge of his anger had dulled alix and i were pursued out of key west once in raleigh north carolina and once in new york city we were attacked thats attempted murder minck minck shook his head i dont understand this he said to no one in particular i never sanctioned alixs death he looked up as if abruptly aware of croakers presence i would never do that i told her i wouldnt you must believe me words as croaker knew well were cheap but there was something in mincks eyes a kind of pleading that caught him he saw that somehow minck who through alixs eyes he had come to see as a master spider spinning his unbreakable web from the absolute sanctity of the nations capital was enmeshed in a gray area just as he himself was suddenly they were both lost both confused as to which direction was up who was good who bad in that moment their adversary position had somehow been dissipated for the first time since he had entered angela didions plush apartment and found her naked body as cold as ice croaker began to see that there was more here than one models murder much more then who did he said gruffly and minck was forced to another inescapable conclusion to whom had he given over custody of alix who had he entrusted to keep her safe from all harm tanya vladimova thats who the same tanya who had been gone from the building god only knew where for the last forty hours or so he grabbed up a phone asked for a trace on tanyas movements during the last three and a half days he was immediately patched through to the arrts computer he repeated his question and waited impatiently for the answers when they came he stared openly at croaker tanya he said slowly who the hells tanya croaker asked shes the woman who sanctioned both your deaths he improvised telling a half truth something had begun to spin inside mincks mind one dark and tiny satellite that needed some space and time to grow the germ of an idea the beginning of a massive salvage job a kind of miracle even if such things actually could be said to exist minck did not believe in god so therefore it followed that he could not believe in miracles until this moment perhaps in a more normal tone of voice he said about alix is she all right shes confused angry frustrated and maybe her lifes been ruined by all this crap but yeah shes essentially okay minck found some genuine solace in that if he had suspected for any amount of time that he was merely indulging himself by keeping alix logan alive he now dismissed such thoughts entirely the relief that swept through him went deep indeed he took a breath but before he could continue croaker said dont think for a minute ill tell you where she is though if you make any move against me now shell go straight to the states attorney general with everything she knows i know you cant afford that youve gone to great lengths to prove it minck paused for a moment as if weighing croakers words all right he said at last ill propose a truce a kind of bargain if you wish what kind of bargain despite observing mincks genuine feelings for alix croaker was a long way from trusting this man what i propose is this i will not harm you or seek to find alixs whereabouts unless she wishes it of course in return you will sit down and listen to what i have to tell you and consider it carefully then what oh good minck thought this man is clever in addition to being resourceful he has killed two of my agents and evaded termination from another my most deadly my most traitorous tanya perhaps he can do what none other i can call on could perhaps he thought as he began to talk of tanya vladimova and her ultimate betrayal of her manipulation of the spearfish ops which was alix logans detention protection this man can destroy that which protorov and i jointly created inside c gordon minck began to glow like a man who has won back his life at the brink of death he was suffused with an eerie kind of elation that made his fingertips tremble it was not difficult to sell croaker on what he must do minck had two powerful motivations which he offered the man sitting across from him and which minck was quite certain he could not refuse if the situation were reversed minck was aware he would have been hooked just as much as he perceived croaker was becoming revenge and patriotism these were the two reasons that minck suspected croaker would accept this bargain tanya had personally tried to kill him and his charge that was something croaker could not tolerate he wanted her now and minck could not blame him at all they both wanted her he explained it was merely that croaker was in a position to get her while minck was not then there was the russian angle no one liked that least of all minck himself croaker was right behind him there youll have full diplomatic immunity minck concluded a new identity as far as customs and immigration are concerned youll have full support over there if you need it he waited a beat and youll be linking up with an old friend of yours nicholas linnear he had saved what he suspected would be the best for last the clincher and croaker bit but a half hour after the detective lieutenant had been provided with a new passport birth certificate business papers et al money in the form of american dollars japanese yen and american express travelers checks and delivered to dulles international to make his flight to tokyo minck abruptly broke down and for the first time since his long incarceration in lubyanka wept bitter tears he thought of what had been done to him and what in retaliation he had been forced to do meanwhile the object of mincks love and hate was at the moment debarking at narita airport outside smogbound tokyo she had not had a pleasant flight just after takeoff from kennedy she had taken two sleeping pills and had fallen into a leaden slumber which had been dominated by visions from her childhood protorov stalked her dreams like a sentry on horseback and on foot weaponed and booted wherever she went he was there before her tanya was back in grade school in rechitsa the closest town to the rural hamlet where her family lived already there was friction at home her older brother mikhail did not approve of their father being a policeman as such her father was in touch with the kgb whose blackraincoated agents appeared at the house from time to time to remind him to report all unpatriotic activity within his purview within six months mikhail would leave him and within a year at eighteen would become one of the more militant and successful dissidents working inside russia but by that time the headmaster of the school in rechitsa had journeyed by an old and dilapidated car out to tanyas house to speak to her parents she had been offered a scholarship to a fine academy with facilities that regretfully the headmasters school lacked she was an extremely bright girl he said and deserving of this chance but certain sacrifices had to be made this new academy was in the urals a good kilometers away tanyas mother had cried at the prospect after all her son had already gone but tanyas father was firm he was only a country constable he said and he wanted at least one of his children to have the benefits he had never had so it was settled much to the relief of the headmaster since a great deal of pressure had been put on him by protorov himself to bring tanya to his academy quite naturally her parents and tanya herself had no idea of the skew of the new schools curriculum after she arrived there and discovered where she was and what she would be made into she dutifully wrote home every week never did she hint to her parents or to anyone else for that matter as to the academys true nature though in truth perhaps she longed to tell her father knowing how proud he would be and how this knowledge might help assuage the terrible ache he felt inside from mikhails betrayal protorov she tried him from the airport while waiting for her one bag to come through then again when she reached the pulsing overpopulated heart of tokyo she used the fourdigit access code and received the same answer both times dead air that in itself was not alarming but pyotr alexandrovitch russilovs presence at her hotel was she registered had her bag sent up to her room then allowed the lieutenant to guide her back outside where they strolled amid jostling throngs of graysuited men carrying black rolled umbrellas just as if they were londoners many wore white masks over nose and mouth an increasingly common sight in this city tanya judged that russilov did not look at all good his color was pale and he had picked up a nervous habit sometime recently of turning his head to see what was happening behind him she liked none of this but she liked even less what he had come south to tell her her skin was like crepe the most delicate of rice paper crumpled beneath a powerful fist translucent still even after seventynine years i will be eighty tomorrow she told him there was no pride in her voice merely wonder that life could last so long even now she was one of the most beautiful creatures he had ever seen as a child he had often compared her beauty to his mothers he had always found her perfect symmetry losing out to cheongs more exotic beauty it was natural perhaps for him to be loyal to his mother but mere had been something more he had hated her for being saigos mother and was blinded is there anything else i can get you itami asked his head was lowered no hahasan mother much had passed between them for him to be able to call her that from the time he had come stumbling to the portals of her house she lived where she always had ever since he had known her on the outskirts of tokyo to the northwest not far from the spot where sato and akiko had been married nicholas had made an arduous journey south from hokkaido breaking into a clothing store at night and armed with fresh clothes and some money trekking down to hakodate he could have stolen a car but did not want to leave such a clear trail to those who might follow or even for the police who would inevitably investigate the breakin at the clothing store they would pursue their investigation with the assiduousness with which the japanese approached every task the less he gave them the more secure he felt he used buses occasionally and when he was able hitched rides he avoided both main highways and railways however knowing trails were more easily left there at last at the southern coastal town he took the ferry across tsugarukaikyo to aomori on honshus rocky northern tip lacking papers he could not rent a car and in any event preferred to utilize buses again heading roughly south in a zigzag nonlinear route he had been terrified at the thought of seeing his aunt again it was he who had murdered her only child it had been nicholas father who had garrotted her husband for which saigo had in turn poisoned the colonel and years later had pursued nicholas all the way to new york he did not know how she would greet him he could not imagine what he could possibly say to her what were words any words in the face of the finality of death nicholas thought that the words im sorry were perhaps the most inadequate in the english language but there was nothing much better in japanese or in any of the worlds tongues for that matter the house was built by an architect who had been elderly when itami and her husband satsugai had commissioned him he revered the old styles of the seventeenth century which he had said were still the best time was their proof had been their victory he had designed this house after one in kyoto called katsura rikyu an imperial villa from four hundred years ago which was still the finest example of the blending of the manmade with the natural to be found in all of japan what i try to do the old man had said is to impose my spirit upon nature so that it appears to remain natural that the result of his handiwork was exquisite in the japanese sense of the word was without question perhaps too many of these details had been too subtle for nicholas mind when he was younger for he had not loved the house as a whole but only one room the one in which the chanoyu was performed and it was to this room that he was conducted after he had been met at the door by servants itami informed of his arrival bathed and his hurts attended to by a bent old man who spoke to himself in a constant singsong but who nevertheless knew what he was doing feeling better than he had in many days nicholas knelt alone in the room turned toward the garden outside the opening was all the length of the room and perhaps six feet high however the top half was covered by a ricepaper latticework screen so that only the bottom part of the garden could be viewed while being immersed in the tea ceremony it was a peculiarly zen concept to have as part of your surroundings the wonders of nature yet only so much beyond that invisible boundary it was felt one would have been overwhelmed by the bittersweet delicacy of the cherry blossoms or the flamboyant fan of autumnal foliage and thus the concentration one needed for chanoyu the harmony of this place would have been broken sunlight splintered by the trees splattered against the lattice turning it the color of newly churned butter warming the room in tone and temperature a lone bird strode through the pebbles of the garden pecking here and there a breeze sprang up and rustled the tops of the cryptomeria making soft shadows move behind the screen on the polished wood floor nicholas shuddered inwardly remembering the trembling flight on the hito washi the ruffling of his tattered clothes like pinfeathers the rush of the night against his face the fear that the inconstant wind might die in midgust sending him diving hard against stands of bamboo exhilaration and terror mingled within him like liquor tingling his blood he was exhausted again physically the drugs had been dissipated eliminated from his system yet their accumulated effect on muscles tissue and brain still lingered exercise was the only remedy for that she came into his sight with a stiff rustle of silk he rose and bowed his heart in his throat he was overcome by the awesome majesty of her beauty it was not as if time had not touched her merely that she had somehow made it her friend rather than her enemy time followed her about like a tamed animal present but quite irrelevant itamisan his voice was a reedy whisper oba sit please nicholassan he did so not wishing to analyze what was in her eyes what was in her mind after tea and rice cakes had been served after they were alone again she said it is so good that you have returned my heart is gladdened to see you again watashi no musuko my son something broke within him and he bent forward until his forehead touched the glossy wood with the ache inside him he wept no longer able to hold all his emotions within him his japanese side ashamed even as he did so but his western side needed this release and could no longer be denied by any discipline on earth watashi no musuko her voice held such tenderness that she might indeed have been his mother i knew you would come back i prayed you would have the courage i was afraid oba his voice too was tear streaked i was afraid because of what i had done i did not want to face all the pain i have caused you you never caused me any pain at all nicholas she said softly you were always more a son to me than my own blood child ever was his was a weak spirit and he belonged body and soul to his father satsugai ruled him as the sun does the earth it was satsugai who determined saigos life path it was his paranoia which saigo absorbed nicholas became aware that at no time had she referred to saigo as my son that was quite odd in a mother his head came up and then eyes met he found no anger there nor even any sadness rather there was a mix of resignation and love love for him he was totally evil itami said i never before believed such a thing possible in a human being complexity after all vitiates extremes or at least one believes that it should she shook her head not in saigos case there was an uncanny purity to him that might have been admirable if it had been channeled in a proper direction that it was not was a burden i was obliged to live with should be shamed to say that i wished him dead but i am not how could i be everything he came in contact with withered and died he was a spiritdestroyer even so nicholas said i am not proud that i destroyed him of course not she said you acted with honor you are your mothers son all at once he realized that she was smiling at him without thought he did the same his heart lightening just as the clouds roll back after the thunder of a storm for a long time they did nothing but that basking in the presence of each others spirit becoming reacquainted finding a new and unexpected level to their relationship that the heavy baggage of the past had denied to them before im glad you came when you did she said the next day weve had one or two earth tremors nothing major but uncomfortable enough nicholas recalled the first satellite readout protorov had shown him that indicated a crescendo of earthquake activity he said nothing about it however i did not choose the time oba it was chosen for me she nodded smiling slightly that is why we must all learn to cross at a ford eh nicholas he was slightly surprised i did not know that you had read musashi read and studied him now she was laughing outright there are many things you do not know about me though surely in all the world there is no other with whom i have shared so many secrets it was i who guided certain businessmen to saigo people whom this raphael tomkin had offended people who wanted him dead nicholas turned to look at her i dont understand do you think for a minute watashi no musuko that i lost track of you when you left your home my love is as long as my protection whose daughter had you fallen in love with how long would it take saigo to find out the same piece of information how long before the diamondlike precision of merging the two assignments one professional the other personal would dawn on him surely it would appeal to his delicate sense of logic he could not resist it nicholas mind was reeling you it was you who sent him after me he put his hand to his head he could scarcely believe what he was hearing my dear she said softly he was like a cape buffalo or one of our giant wild boars who had been wounded he was dangerous and becoming more so each day that dawned i could not in good conscience allow that to continue she stopped them in their walk and for the first time touched him a light but definite gesture full as was the case with all japanese gestures no matter how small of exquisite meaning did you think i would send him to harm you i sent him to his death perhaps i murdered him if one chooses to look at it in a certain light but other people died in the process oba you must have thought of that she said nothing moving across the grass dappled in the shadow of a sculpted arbor of boxwood trees what would you have me say watashi no musuko life is imperfect because we are humans and not gods gods by their very definition do not live but rather exist they paused and she put her hand against the gnarled back of a tree trunk am sorry for death any death but often some good tissue must be excised in order to destroy a malignancy it is not fair and it is certainly not to my liking but it is a time that we must learn to cross at a ford it is not what we choose but rather as you have said it chooses us that was not precisely what he had said but he suspected itami knew that what she had said was far more apt in any case he knew that what had happened between saigo and himself was really not either of their doing rather it had been determined a generation before by the abiding enmity between their fathers filial piety bound them causing them to end what had been begun so long ago he could not help but think of those who had perished because of an honor a code that was not theirs eileen okura terry tanaka doc deerforth how many cops and others whose names he did not know and yes even lew croaker nicholas understood the wisdom of his aunts words even agreed with them yet something inside him recoiled calling out as if from a distance its too much even the expunging of one life is too great a price to pay for the extirpation of giri after a time itami said i have been truthful with you nicholas now you must return the kindness tell me why you have come here it was not just to see me again after all this time part of it was that yes but she was right again all the way on the trip south his mind had been rolling the question around as he had done so it began to increase in size until even in sleep he could not be rid of it akiko she was not yukio yet she had yukios face why surely she could not have been bom with features so precisely akin to his lost loves nature simply did not repeat its handiwork in such a manner save perhaps between twins and if as he believed now her face was manmade then he was led like a dog on a leash back to the one person who could wish him destroyed one person who could conceive of such emotional torture itami had been quite correct he was totally evil saigo so he had instinctively come here to his cousins house in search of answers to the unanswerable but there is another reason oba a more urgent one i recently came across a woman with yukios face she wasnt yukio and she was her name is akiko itami turned away her face to the dying sun i knew a woman with such a name once she said i loved her once she revered me once as was proper between mother and daughterinlaw nicholas felt his heart constrict what itami was suggesting felt monstrous to him unclean if not unholy she was married to saigo he managed to get out itami nodded was she a student itami knew very well what kind of student he meant to them there was only one kind yes her voice was a whisper they met in kumamoto she was there for two years studying before she left where did she go i do not want to talk of it itamisan it is a shameful thing her voice was cold old and sad for the first time do not make me utter it he moved around in front of her i must know i must she is your sons do not call him that she is saigos last weapon against me cant you see that if you do not help me i am afraid she may succeed where he did not her eyes were clear is this truly so he nodded hai oba in the alps somewhere to the north lives a sensei his name is kyoki that is no name nicholas said stunned that is a state of being madness nevertheless that is where akiko went that is where she learned to mask her wa where she learned jaho itami made a face and turned away there ive said it all now though it makes me ill he waited a long time before he spoke again there were many reasons for this he wanted first of all to allow her to recover her composure too he wanted to drink in this most serene surrounding that gentled his spirit like a mothers caress lastly he did not want this time between them to end but at last he was moved to speech i must go haha yes will you kiss me goodbye as my father taught cheong to do itami turned her eyes were brimming and so huge they seemed to encompass the world gently her hands held him and lifting herself lightly on tiptoe she pressed her lips to his cheek just as she had done it thousands of times before happy birthday haha he whispered live long nicholas itami breathed but she was already alone in the bower the birds trilling sweetly overhead with the first onrush of twilight to justine tokyo was as bewildering as new york city would be to a teenager from nebraska it was not what she had expected it to be nor what she had wanted it to be it throbbed all around her like a neon hive its atmosphere as chokingly heavy as that of a coal mine she entered into it with increasing trepidation and by the time she had been conveyed to the portals of the okura was prepared to turn right around and go home the only thing that prevented her was nicholas or more accurately the thought of him craig allonge was staying at the okura she knew him slightly and in desperation she scribbled a note for him and asked the concierge to see that he got it the moment he returned to the hotel then she went up to her room and collapsed on the bed her skin felt as if it had been coated with oil and her hair was greasy from the long flight groaning she got up and drew a bath using water as hot as she could tolerate she felt she would need that to peel all the layers of grime off her she had soaped up and was soaking her knotted muscles slowly unwinding when the phone rang there was an extension within reach and she used it it was allonge he had been set up with a temporary office at sato petrochemicals and had returned to the hotel to change for lunch he was a shirtsleeves man and no one had told him how formal the japanese could be when justine asked about nicholas allonge did not know what to tell her he heard the agitation in her voice and did not want to alarm her unduly by telling her he had no idea where his boss might be instead he said he would find out and would call her right back he disconnected and called satos office no there was no word as yet from mr linnear did allongesan wish to speak with nangisan tanzan nangis return from hong kong was news to allonge and he said yes put me through please when the connection was made he told nangi about justine bring her back with you nangi said ill talk to the young lady nangi put down the receiver and swung away from his desk having just an hour ago deplaned at narita his thoughts were still partially back in hong kong he thought of fortuitous chiu and his dragon father but even more his thoughts were concentrated on the green pang triad sometime within the month they would raid the sun wa trading company on tai ping shan street there would be violence people killed one of those people would be mr liu perhaps another would be a young woman by the name of succulent pien whatever the outcome it would have nothing to do with nangi it was rather triad warfare a territorial dispute or at least that would be how all the newspapers would write it up how the populace would see it that was the accepted way of life in the crown colony lo whan would have to accept it as well karma perhaps he should have consulted a feng shui man before entering into the agreement with nangi in fact the raid had been agreed upon by nangi and fortuitous chiu before the meeting with lo whan at ocean park took place that had been the reason for all the heung yau spread around the partriotic angle that nangi had asked fortuitous chiu to bring up to third cousin tok nangi had not abrogated his agreement with lo whan and the disinformation connection with redman would cease to exist within three weeks time but his satisfaction was to be shortlived because in a moment a discreet knock was heard at his door and nangi swiveled around he saw kei hagura one of seiichis senior vice presidents enter hagurasan the man looked decidedly unwell nangi thought perhaps he needs some time off with his wife and children there is nothing like being with ones family to restore the spirit pardon me for intruding nangisan hagura was bowing profusely his face was white and pinched and over his shoulder nangi became aware of a stir within the hive of offices on the fiftysecond floor come come hagurasan nangis voice was slightly irritated what can i do for you haguras head was down his eyes would not meet nangis own a report has just come over the wire from our hokkaido office there has been some kind of well an accident perhaps no one is quite certain as yet nangi sat forward his pulse accelerated what sort of accident hagurasan how bad was it who was involved i am afraid that it concerns satosan haguras voice was faltering just as if he had contracted laryngitis there has been some form of automotive accident and satosan there was a catch to nangis voice how is he there was no chance for anyone hagura said he did not want to say the word as if his reluctance would make all of this mere speculation rather than fact hagurasan nangi commanded the senior vice president closed his eyes in acquiescence to the inevitable satosan is dead sir nangi was careful to let nothing show face was all important now he knew this kobun was like a samurai in the employ of the shogun it was absolutely committed to its course it could only march forward never retreat even to falter was forbidden and tenchi could not wait thank you hagurasan i appreciate how difficult this must have been for you hagura bowed accepting the compliment it was my duty nangisan inside he was mightily impressed with nangisans wa he felt the harmony still pervading the room lending it power in the face of his tragic and totally unexpected news this was heartening indeed the news of what had happened in here would spread through the kobun nangis heroism and iron determination offsetting some of the void all must feel at seiichi satos passing alone in the office after haguras departure nangi broke apart tears filled his eyes there was a fist in his throat that made swallowing painful he stared out through the high panes of glass first gotaro he thought then obachama makita but not seiichi never seiichi how many people in ones life were there who one could talk to how many were there in a lifetime who understood him one or two a handful if one were exceptionally fortunate who would he talk to now nangi asked himself who would he confide in formulate plans with gloat over his recent triumph in hong kong with all of this had fallen to seiichi now there was no one there was anger as well as a deep and abiding sadness within him now for this time he turned his love around and hated the god in whom he believed in whom he put all his trust and into whose care he had delivered his immortal soul how could you do such a thing he railed inside where is the sense of it there was only a perception of harsh cruelty of an unfairness so huge as to be overwhelming they had been like twins tanzan and seiichi knowing each others heart trusting each others spirit through all their squabbles arguments disagreements and as in every good marriage those battles had been ironed out in the end to the satisfaction of both of them no more why had nangi been able to see himself objectively at that moment he would have understood that he had lost more than the friendship he held most dear he had also lost the eastern sense of acceptance and resignation that belief in the course of a cosmic sense of life he had lost his place in the scheme of things and that was a serious matter indeed his mask slipped back on his face when craig allonge brought justine into the fiftiethfloor garden where nangi wished to receive her the tomkin industries executive did not remain long he made the introductions then left for his business lunch so nangi thought looking her over this is raphael tomkins daughter is she still in love with the gaijin linnear he wondered he had heard about their icy demeanor at tomkins funeral may i offer my personal condolences miss tomkin nangi said inclining his head i knew your father personally and admired him greatly justine almost said thats miss tobin but already the distinction she had created herself years ago seemed artificial and meaningless instead she nodded thank you nangisan your generous bouquet was most appreciated she looked around its beautiful here he nodded in return may i get you a drink a gin and tonic would be nice she said sitting down on one of the chairs near a stand of green bamboo whats going on here she asked herself he seems old and shaken she knew from nicholas that she could not ask a direct question she sipped at her drink studiously ignoring nangis limp as he went from the bar to a chair near her it is somewhat of a surprise to see you here in tokyo he said after he had seated himself is there something specific i can help you with you have only to ask i will assign a young lady to take you shopping to all the finest stores at night a male escort will take you ive come here to see nicholas she said stopping him in midsentence she resented the assumptions he had made about her simply because she was female but she had the presence of mind to show none of this on the exterior she was cool and calm and thus in nangis eyes gained enormous face he was impressed despite himself i see well that is an admirable reason for traveling all this distance and as he paused justine felt her insides go cold how she longed to scream out whats happened is he all right do you know where he is at the moment she was quite surprised to find that her voice was steady nicholas would be proud of her but with that thought tears brimmed her eyes what has happened she asked herself again unfortunately no nangi said i myself have just returned from a lengthy business trip i am being filled in now as to events that have transpired in my absence hes so damned calm justine thought how does he do it she was unaware that she was matching nangi stride for stride every moment that nangi sat talking with this gaijin his respect for her increased grudgingly at first then more freely because of her wa he decided to tell her what she would otherwise find out hours from now i am afraid that there has been some sort of mishap miss tomkin in my absence sato seiichi he used the japanese form has been killed in an auto crash oh my god justines hands gripped each other in her lap her drink forgotten beside her was he alone her voice had gone quite low i understand your concern nangi said and yes my information is that he was alone in the car at the time of the mishap justines eyes closed a muscle tic beginning in one eyelid mishap she thought he uses the word like doctors use the word expired to tidily explain away something dreadful im im terribly sorry nangisan she said please accept my condolences i have heard many stories of satosans prowess in business and personal life nangi stared openly at her amazed where was the gush of disgusting emotionalism he had expected from this barbarian where was the embarrassing reference to sato and nangis closeness that would have humiliated him neither had come instead she had expressed the proper sentiments in the proper manner honoring both of them as well as satosan i appreciate your thought tomkinsan he said his voice softened by emotion you are welcome to return to your hotel or as i said before i will assign company personnel to take you about the city as you wish in any case you will be informed the moment we have word of linnearsans whereabouts if you dont mind id prefer to stay here justine said that is if you dont think ill be in the way absolutely not nangi said and rang for kei hagura he had learned his lesson no woman was summoned in the dense forest surrounding itamis house nicholas began his search employing several of the simple implements he had taken from his aunts kitchen with her blessing he was searching for any of several kinds of holes in the ground and it took him some time the forest was thicker than it had been when he had been here as a young boy but that could only be his imagination for one is never as alert to ones surroundings when at a place one despises the sky when he could catch a glimpse of it through the arching canopy of branches and leaves seemed odd and yellow it was certainly no longer day yet it was like no twilight he had ever seen before too the atmosphere felt different it was as heavy as lead windless not a blade of grass stirring even the insects were quiescent he saw no birds at length he found what he had been searching for and went to work most of the time was spent up in a tree waiting when he was finished and quite satisfied he set off in little time he found an outcropping of rock and settled down on it to wait and that was how akiko found him sitting in the lotus position darkness was encroaching long shadows as blue as ice creeping along the woodland carpet over rocks and toadstools moss and wildflowers it was the time of the evening when normally the changeover from diurnal to nocturnal was being made larks and finch giving way to whippoorwills and owl boar and rabbits to foxes and weasels there was little stirring she stopped before him she had emerged out of the dense foliage as just one more shadow approaching i regret that i could not bring you back your daikatana she said would you have killed me with it she answered him only in the most oblique fashion come down off your lofty perch she said and we will speak together with deliberation nicholas descended he was thinking of masashigi kusunoki ever since sato had mentioned that name in connection with the tenshin shoden kaktori ryu it had stuck in his subconscious like a thorn although he had been away from yoshino for quite a long time still he knew of no sensei either in japan or outside it who went by that name yet he knew that sato had not lied and that he had not been lied to for what possible purpose would either thing have been done he could think of none masashigi kusunoki existed or had before he had been murdered yet he did not exist who had he been and who had killed him had it been akiko his pupil who had sat before him across the tatami speaking of mundane matters hiding her intent with what kyoki the madman had taught her so that the sensei felt only the glow of her wa and was thus put off his guard was that what she was about to do with him now grass verge served admirably as their tatami darkness stealing in over the hills and treetops shrouded them nocturnal creatures that they were gentling them in its webbed cradle they were home again in the blackness of the night the merest trace of starblaze smeared their faces in cold blue highlight i would have found you out even without the tattoos he said no one but you would have understood their true nature her head inclined slightly yes he agreed i know the legend of hsing the shapechanger the akuma he created with jaho she was laughing at him and you believed all of that i believe in the kujikiri he said in the kobudera and in the wushing i knew one mahozukai he had kept his inflection up so that she would know that he had not finished she was no longer laughing you knew him too akikosan saigo he had brought the key in his pocket and now he had offered it to her he thought that she had taken it but might not yet be ready to use it on herself he continued now i know the truth your twin dragons spoke to me with tongues of fire before he was murdered by his jealous compatriots hsing had branded his akuma hsing was sensei to many arts tattooing was only one of them he did this so it was said so that he might be able to identify his pupil for all time so that they would be inexorably linked on the wheel of karma did you have a sensei akikosan who marked you so with such skilled hands i cannot think you went to a common parlor off the street he might of course have said more mentioned kyoki by name but in doing so he would give up an enormous advantage so you know about wushing she said inserting the key he had given her she nodded perhaps it is a relief to me that someone else knows that that someone else is you and all the while she thought amida i cant believe it i look upon him and my love for him is so strong that i need to clasp my old hate to me with white fingers i must concentrate on it every single moment or it threatens to slide away from me like sand hsings akuma had just cause to enact the ageold vengeance as do i my family name is not ofuda no nicholas interrupted deliberately it is sato and satosan your husband is dead she inclined her head i suspected as much i am sorry her eyes blazed in the cruel starlight sorry i could not end his life by my own power using the fourth state of the wushing kung nicholas said using the chinese word for palace the eunuchs punishment you would have castrated him before you killed him he deserved no less she said with venom as does his friend tanzan nangi he has yet to experience my terrible power together they conspired to destroy my real father hiroshi shimada nicholas was truly surprised your father was viceminister shimada he knew the name well and in a quite personal way because shimada had been one of the colonels prime postwar targets but his wife bore him only two sons his mistress was my mother akiko said proudly she was tayu oiran in the yoshiwara she was the best there was shimada committed seppuku there was a huge scandal cleverly concocted by nangi sato and their mentor yoichiro makita nicholas knew that this was patently untrue the evidence against shimada had been overwhelming and incontrovertible they made up lies halftruths innuendoes it was enough her face was twisted with her hate more than enough in an atmosphere that bordered on phobic hysteria when it came to the subject of the war he felt a gathering of her forces but it was your father colonel denis linnear who insisted on making these falsehoods public knowledge linnear had wanted my father out of the way ever since he had championed a hard line against scaps interference into mci policies nicholas remembered what his father had told him on the day viceminister shimada was found near his wife in a pool of blood never rejoice over the death of another human being rather take satisfaction that a source of evil has been expunged in this case elements within mci were perpetuating the power factions begun years ago by members of the prewar zaibatsu in their kanmin ittai control associations if a man aligns himself with evil we have our duty before us we must act mankind could not long tolerate life without this weedingout process there was nothing false in the accusations leveled against your father akiko he said you cannot deny the symmetry of crime and punishment but his words seemed distant to his ears for he found it enormously difficult to disassociate himself from the face so close before him it seemed to make no difference that he knew that she was not in fact yukio that was an intellectual response and what he was feeling was emotional it bypassed the intellect the rational completely what did he see inside her that caused him to react this way it did not vitiate in any way the danger he felt himself to be in it merely clouded the issue turning the translucent into the opaque and he was truly amazed in an entirely different manner as well despite what itami had told him despite what he already knew of akiko plus what he suspected it came as a shock to probe and feel nothing but the glow of her wa harmony whatever she was actually feeling toward him he could not say he felt no aggression no animosity nothing negative whatsoever and again he found himself wondering whether this was what the mysterious masashigi kusunoki had felt just before akiko had reached out with her jaho and had freed him from life they used the colonel she said you must see that eyes like stones they fed him their garbage and he ate it all up whatever sato and nangi deserved had no bearing on the three innocent people you destroyed in the process he said ignoring her line dont talk to me of innocence she spat there is no innocence inside that company at all two are guilty all are equally to blame nicholas thought of miss yoshida and he was as sad for this woman sitting not a handsbreadth away as he was for her look what can become of life he thought after this there is no hope but he had accomplished one of his goals had found out all that he needed to know by her words he knew that she would not allow him to rise and walk away that whatever her personal feelings might be she had been trained too well her spirit in the end as weak as her first husbands the spell of jaho taking her over he could never convince her of the truth as akutagawasan had said the force of jaho was so corrosive to mind and spirit that one always ran the terrible risk of succumbing to it rather than as one did with all martial arts harnessing it to ones own needs now he gazed upon her with eyes filled with new knowledge for at last he saw who it was he was truly facing she was miko a sorceress who could reach out at any time masking her true intent and snuff out his life it could come in the midst of a kiss or an embrace he would never know the difference never feel the flickering of her wa the breakup of harmony by the spitting of aggression he would never even know that she had reached for the void her intent was forever beyond his knowing and he knew that he had been right to wait up in the tree for so long he knew that he faced death it did not seem ironic to him that it should come to him in the form of his first true love only just and fitting if he should die now hers would be the last face that he would see he would go down dreaming of yukio it is very still akiko said softly the animals are hiding the birds are nested the insects sleep even the wind has ceased to blow all for us her eyes were luminous he imagined that he could see the moon reflected in their convex surfaces they had the sheen of finest silk they reminded him so much of yukios eyes for we are lovers nicholas the last two true lovers alive on the face of the world when we made love it was not just our bodies that were entwined penetrating and being penetrated it was our spirits as well the clouds and the rain made our spirits one nicholas now we have our own tattoos as indelibly etched as my dragons we shall know each other for all time however we may be reincarnated whatever our karma dictates we must be still will we recognize one another as human or badger plover or serpent the spirit dance we performed will preserve our link had she moved perceptibly closer nicholas could not tell her words had become as luminous as her eyes as the starlight that partially enveloped them where broad fans of shadow from the surrounding trees did not was she leaning forward now did he feel the hard press of her jutting breasts against his chest did he feel her warmth bathing him her breath like the scent of lilac on his cheek in all the states he summoned up both exalted and common he felt only her wa a glowing beacon as constant as the sea he remembered their fevered night in satos garden and thought he wanted that onrush all over again sato felt one of her arms coming around his back lying along his shoulder fingertips caressing the side of his neck remember sato he thought and how you failed him failed in your sacred oath to protect him there was only one possible way out for him now no his cry echoed into the night i cannot allow this i cannot love you a miko and as he pulled away from her halfembrace he withdrew the shortbladed knife he had taken from itamis house though it belonged in her kitchen still its blade was finely honed still it was a weapon of honor without hesitation nicholas drove the blade to the hilt into his abdomen blood flashed out black in the darkness glinting on his knees the grass akikos lap nicholas face was distorted by agony his head trembled as he slashed horizontally from left to right across his lower belly the place where ham resided akiko was in shock her eyes were open wide amida she breathed there was so much blood it ran in a torrent from him from the center of his being draining him of strength of life so many conflicting emotions strived for dominance inside her elation and sorrow shock and panic satisfaction and fear was this the end she had been seeking was this the culmination of her long thought out vengeance she knew that it was but now she was beginning to suspect that it was not what she wanted she had struggled all her life it seemed to be free of womans traditional role as servant to man her rejection of all that her mother had been her revulsion for that lofty state of tayu had this as its basis as did her decision to train in the most demanding of the martial arts mans work all her life she had fought to take her place beside men as an equal but now she was coming to see that that obsession had put her in the position of becoming a pawn to the drives and hatreds of those certain men who she had thought she was closest to kyoki saigo and ultimately viceminister shimada she understood that more than any other person her father had shaped the direction of her life just as saigos father had done his they were the same then she and saigo exactly the same totally evil too late had she made this discovery it had taken the death of one she now knew she loved in a way she had loved no other man or woman she opened her mouth to speak she opened her arms to show him her intent but at that moment the earth beneath them commenced to roll as if it had been transmuted into water by jaho beyond even her ken cannonfire crossed them echoing eerily into the night the sound bouncing off obstructions that had just a moment before not been there for in truth the world was dissolving had opened up like a pair of gaping jaws wildflowers and bushes trees and grasslands were eaten up swamped down into the yawning pit that had no end raw gases stung her nostrils sulphur and the stench of molten metal and then she had lost her balance was falling rolling end over end filled with vertigo so that she had no idea of where the sky was and where the earth all she could do was reach upward stretching and grabbing at fistfuls of crumbling soil nicholas too was tumbling and rolling in the grip of the first earthquake shock whose epicenter as the soviet satellite had accurately predicted was not more than a kilometer away to the east he was sent flying in fact away from the spot where he and akiko had been kneeling away from the glistening pools of blood which had spurted out when he had knifed into the freshly killed fox he had strapped like a cincture around his abdomen beneath his kimono he had suspected rightly that only a shock of the first magnitude could deflect the jaho for long enough he fetched up hard against rocks made sharp by fissures forming in their midst dividing them cracking them open like eggs nicholas tried to regain his feet but the earth shudders were still too violent and he tumbled downward again he had been thrown perhaps ten or fifteen meters from where he had been and now he lifted his head searching for akiko he could not see her but that was not surprising in all the chaos he was in the midst of a world gone mad where trees had been was nothing now but great holes like wounded gums those trees now protruded from the agonized earth like arrows shot into it by a giant archer far above his head their webby root structures shaking themselves free of huge clods of earth in a moment nicholas began to crawl back the way he had come it took him some time he was obliged to make many detours and to stop several times while aftershocks vibrated beneath his hands and knees like the angry shouts of the gods he came finally to the fissure a mighty jagged rent in the universe it was awesome to see open space where just moments before solid ground had been it gave one pause even one such as he who had been born here and thus was not a stranger to quakes one never got used to them or ceased to be humbled by their titanic display of force in the hollow silence after the grinding of the quake he thought he could hear a voice slowly he crawled to the edge of the fissure its sides were as jagged and irregular as was its face he saw her down there her tiny oval face leaped up to him through the jumble of debris rent rocks split trees and the like nicholas he saw those eyes luminous still yukios eyes he moved forward toward her and felt the earth begin to give way beneath his chest dirt crumbled away from him in a torrent and she screamed head cast down into that stygian gloom he inched carefully backward his eyes roved for another way down to her perhaps that tree just above her but he could not see its underpinning and if he was wrong if it would not hold his weight she would be instantly crushed by its descent nicholas something in her voice drew his attention back to her he peered down no it was her voice itself it seemed to have changed not only pitch but timbre as well dont move he cautioned her i cant take a chance on coming down myself theres too much instability within the fissure im going to find vines i can weave into a rope that will hold you no the amount of anguish in her cry froze him dont leave me nicholas not again a rumbling had begun deeper this time as if truly it were emanating from the bowels of the earth had he heard right nicholas asked himself had she said not again then im coming down after you he called no no amida no he saw her face limned by starlight which was somehow stronger now after the quake it was as if the universe were awakening from a deep slumber youll be killed there was movement from down there he had already lowered himself halfway into the fissure his bare toes searching for a substantial hold he saw akiko reach for the bottom of the tree substructure a massive tangle of roots like the gordian knot but she had no magic sword and could not unravel it the rumbling reached a crescendo and nicholas heard the awful grinding of the world pulling itself apart deep below him plates shifted the pressure shooting upward the fissure walls trembled and slid farther open even the sky seemed to judder in pain the starlight winking out as the earth heaved in exquisite agony nicholas could hear nothing above the rush of noise that filled his ears to overflowing he thought their drums might burst with the intensity of the vibration he saw the tree shifting downward heopened his mouth to scream then he was obliged to turn his full attention on raising himself out of the lethal pit before he was cast down when he was able to look again it was as if he gazed upon an entirely different world there was no tree no split rocks none of the rills and valleys that he had recorded in his mind preparatory to his attempted descent like a fragrant fertile valley reformed out of sere desert all that he had first gazed upon was gone and akiko with it the first familiar person nicholas saw when he left toranomon hospital in tokyo was tanya vladimova he was not particularly surprised to see her he had never bothered to call minck she was coming out of an elevator along the same bank in front of which nicholas stood at the okura what happened to you she said checking herself in midstride nicholas elevator came and she got in with him you look like somebody put you through the meat grinder and forgot to turn the thing off were you here for the quake it was the best he could do at the moment and was not as inane a question as it seemed on the surface oh yes her head nodded it was quite frightening i must say the japanese took it with just a bit more equanimity she was evincing a light tone and forcing it nicholas wondered why how about you no he said i missed the worst of it she waited patiently while he opened the door to his room i was in la once when a minor quake hit she said conversationally it was like here really though this one im told was far worse no one paid the slightest attention to it it was as if it did not exist thats not at all how the japanese view it nicholas said as he went into the bathroom and turned on the taps the shower he was obliged to raise his voice over the sound of all the rushing water they accept earthquakes as part of nature to californians its like death theyd rather not think about it fifteen minutes later after a long steaming shower followed by an icy one he emerged wreathed in towels he stripped off the plastic bag used to keep his newly bandaged fingers dry im glad youre here actually oh good she said staring at his hand ive come as mincks messenger girl really the focus of our hunt has shifted since your meeting with him last week away from protorov toward tenchi perhaps it was the fatigue that gripped him or else akiko was still on his mind how wholly she had become yukio or some semblance of yukio that he still held sacrosanct and pristine in his memory perhaps it was only his imagination but it was his decided feeling that the kami of his first beloved had somehow taken hold of her lookalike at the end filling her heart with love and compassion where before there had been only hate and a burning need for revenge in the end that might have been foolish of him but he did not think so he was too aware of the intertwining of life and death in any event he missed the falseness to her voice that normally he might have picked up he was not fully attuned to this conversation his thoughts were elsewhere relaxing his overworked muscles he was diffused without concentration and therefore vulnerable thats just as well he said turning away from her to rummage through his dresser for fresh clothes because protorov has ceased to be a threat to anyone what do you mean tanya said though she knew very well i mean nicholas said that i killed him he turned back in time to see the surprise in her eyes when he said ive also broken tenchi wide open tanya felt as if she had been struck by lightning after russilovs terrible news she had lost much of her hope with protorov gone what chance did they now have for the kgbgru summit she too knew mironenko in fact he had been her first lover thus had she brought him into protorovs axis this had been just before her graduation from the academy in the urals mironenko and several other upandcoming gru officers had been given a threeday tour of the premises and facilities of all the visitors protorov judged mironenko to be of the most use to him in the future that had been the reason for extending him an invitation in the first place protorov had sent tanya into his room at night she had been sexstarved the passion of her emotions mingling with her physical needs the combination had proved irresistible to mironenko as it would have been for almost any man tanya was his first link with protorov after the visit he did not want to give her up and in fact their affair lasted through the spring and into the summer but summer meant tanyas graduation and because he had another assignment for her one far more risky one that only she could perform protorov contrived to have mironenkos wife become aware of his passion chastened he left tanyas side but partially because protorovs subsequent intervention saved his marriage and his career as well and partially because his own political bent was similar he moved into protorovs camp in the meantime protorov had moved tanya out of the academy allowing her to find her own way into the midst of her brothers mikhails dissident apparatus from his own point of view there was no risk of course he knew quite well that tanyas heart belonged to her father that she had seen mikhails behavior as a betrayal to the family he had had his instructors work on that angle in oblique manners during her schooling mikhail for his part was overjoyed to see her to him it meant that she had matured it simply was inconceivable to him that she might be a kgb apparatchik now as hope returned to tanya she automatically abandoned her backup plan to kill nicholas and reporting back to minck in washington put a bullet through his brain with tenchis secret safe inside her mind she would contact russilov to initiate an escape route for her of course she would not tell him of her discovery rather let him think that she was returning to central a disgrace having been blown by linnear after what had transpired in the safe house in hokkaido hed have no trouble swallowing that then across the frontier through the kurile chain to mironenko there was still time to make the summit deadline and she wished to have no eager ambitious male trying to share her triumph no she alone would address the kgbgru summit as viktor protorovs handpicked successor the coup would take place the dream had not died after all trying with all her will to control the fluttering she felt in her chest she said the sooner you tell me about it the sooner i can send a signal to minck and we can put this to bed once and for all dressed nicholas was counting out money into a new wallet thankfully no action will be needed on our part im quite sure of that but it would have been a fullfledged disaster had the soviets been successful in penetrating it tanya ground her teeth in anticipation she could barely contain her anxiety she moved with him as he walked back into the bathroom to brush his hair standing just outside the door as he flicked on the hairdryer tenchi is an apt code name he began it means heaven and earth tenchi is in fact a superrobot what tanya cried what is this a sciencefiction film let me begin at the beginning three years ago the hare mam a japanese tanker loaded with radioactive waste was lost in a typhoon while crossing the nemuro straits between hokkaido and the southernmost tip of the kuriles it was a disaster of the greatest magnitude and one which the japanese government as you can imagine did not want made public salvage operations were begun as soon as fair weather returned the radioactive wastes as it turned out had not broken through their sealed containers and the operation proceeded without a hitch but on the third day divers using an enormously powerful vacuum pump that must be anchored on the ocean floor discovered that the vibrations of the mechanism had opened up a hairline fissure out of it a black viscous substance had begun to leak they had accidentally discovered oil off the coast of japan where it had been determined by a host of geologists none could exist excitement rose to a fever pitch as the divers rose with their news and the information was transmitted back to the prime minister oceanographers as well as geologists were sent into the area what they came back with three weeks later was unimaginable it looked as if this pocket of fossil oil was set very deep also it was vast if the government could find a way of extracting it they might never have to buy a barrel of crude again japan would be selfsufficient it was an answer to many prayers but the thorn was getting it out of the rock conventional methods of offshore drilling were useless because of the type of rock and its formation besides they were not all that far from a known ocean fault and they were terrified that any undue activity in the area might cause a major earthquake and so tenchi was born it has eight articulated arms and legs it can move over any kind of terrain no matter how rough it can see hear even smell it can and will extract the oil from the bottom of the sea the first conduit into which billions of barrels of fuel will be pumped on its way up to the surface and a line of waiting tankers via fathoms of pipeline but why all this secrecy tanya asked surely it could have been developed in the light of day perhaps nicholas conceded however the oil reservoir is not only on japanese soil though they think it is what are you saying tanya said her heart in her throat the kuriles are a source of dispute between russia and japan you know that its elementary the real question is who owns the oil japan or russia youll get two different answers depending on whether you speak to a japanese or a russian he turned away from the mirror now you see why protorov was so anxious to penetrate the operation the russians could also have been selfsufficient he came out of the bathroom and looked around but tanya had already gone moments later he was on his way out to the shinjuku suiryu building the offices of sato petrochemicals when his phone buzzed he picked it up yeah the weather was great in key west buddy the voice said in his ear but the company was lousy croaker like air being let out of a balloon his knees felt weak and he had to sit down lew it cant be you can buddyboy and is im in the lobby i didnt want to give you a heart attack by coming to your door unannounced can i come up im just on my way out ill meet you downstairs a thousand questions chased each other through his mind lew croaker alive how was it possible nah with what i got id better come on up okay sure there was a pause how you been anyway the voice had gone gruff nothings the same nicholas said but then it never is hah tell me about it ill be right there he was a bit leaner certainly tanner his robert mitchum face seemingly far more deeply lined still he looked fine to nicholas they embraced like brothers and this time croaker did not mind the contact he was amazed at just how much he had missed his friend he pointed whats with the bandages later nicholas said now tell me all and croaker did from the moment the mysterious car had rammed him off the road in key west to alix logans revelations so minck sanctioned angela didions death nicholas said wonderingly it wasnt tomkin at all he only knew about it croaker sneered he only let the killers into her apartment i suppose that absolves him of guilt nicholas looked at him he felt a curious ache inside im sorry he was so weak he mustve been thinking of the leak she represented national security hes still a murderer in my book croaker cut in national security my ass big goddamned deal i disagree lew croaker rounded on him what dyou mean you know what i mean nicholas said softly why are you here now croaker thought about that national security he said at last it was a sigh of defeat im sorry nick forget it lew it only means we can all be suckered in the name of patriotism is that what really led tomkin to let them in nicholas looked at his friend i honestly dont know well it sure dont make a bit of difference to angela one way or another shes still six feet under you cant keep torturing yourself over one death lew be reasonable youve done everything you could its more than anyone else wouldve done i think angelas spirit can rest now croaker sat down heavily his head in his hands i did nothing i solved nothing ive gotten nowhere just spinning my goddamned wheels in a pile of quicksand no ones gonna pay for angelas death not now not ever now nicholas was concerned what happened to you down in key west my friend i mean really croakers voice was muffled i dont know nick damned if i do nicholas said nothing and croaker was forced to go on to rid himself of the oppressive silence my lifes come apart i guess he paused began all over again i dont know whats happened to the kid who graduated the academy in the top five percent of his class then i had the law in one hand and my service revolver in the other i knew what to do with them i knew that i was on the right side and they the murderers rapists addicts armed robbers muggers were on the wrong side that was a long time ago or so it seems somewhere in the interim i seem to have lost the facility to determine the perpetrators from the law officers i thought sure as im sitting here that tomkin killed angela i was wrong or was i i dont know anymore minck had her killed and i knew i had to confront him why i dont know did i want to murder him myself become the ultimate anarchist against the law im sworn to uphold a vigilante i knew when i stood before him that at least part of me wanted to even though i know what kind of a bitch angela was even though i know that she could and youre right would have screwed this whole spook deal minck had cooking with tomkin but the end result is that they took a human life they played god with her they destroyed nick his head came up and nicholas winced at the bleakness in those redrimmed eyes perhaps he had been crying for himself for one lost soul no matter what she was nick she had a right to live im right about that at least arent i nicholas put his arm around his friend as together they sat on the edge of the bed she had a right to live lew croaker gave a little bark of confused anger so instead of taking minck out myself i wind up working for him i dont understand yeah well you will in a minute i guarantee you croaker stood up began to pace back and forth like a caged tiger he was tense and did not mind showing it reason is see this minck bastards sanctioned someone else it seems that tanya vladimovas a kgb bug planted on him you aint seen her skulking around here lately have you nicholas mind was on fire there were too many things hitting him at once tanya he said a soviet spy but why didnt minck contact me himself croaker pointed to the phone ever think to get your messages buddy actually no ive had other things on my mind i only walked into the hotel a half an hour ago i ran right into tanya she yeah where the hells she got to oh my god nicholas thought tenchi ive given her everything i fought so hard to keep from protorov perhaps hes won after all but that thought the knowledge of an almost certain war sparked by the territorial incident was too terrible to contemplate come on nicholas cried where we going to hamamatsucho when tanya left nicholas room she took the fire stairs down the seven floors not wanting to wait for the elevator or to be seen in the street she turned north heading away from the hotel at a rapid pace she longed to take a taxi but was afraid to leave a trail in any case within three blocks she knew that she had made the right choice traffic choked the streets and she was far better off on foot plowing with great power through the crowds like a salmon struggling upstream up the sakuradori she found the toranomon station of the ginza line down into the ground she went paying her fare riding one stop to shimbashi where she transferred to the jnr line to hamamatsucho there she emerged in the midst of hundreds of other people mostly tourists to wait for the monorail to haneda airport and a flight to hokkaido now she took time out to wait on line for a phone booth where when it was her turn she used a special code to alert russilov that she was on the run parachute she said when the line opened it was that time of day in tokyo after the noon lunch stampede and before the evening rush hour when traffic is variable it can be good or bad according to the whim of the gods nicholas decided to take a calculated risk and grab a cab to hamamatsucho it was a mistake sakuradori was jammed and none of the alternate routes were any better near the onarimon station he had had enough and dropping yen like flower petals onto the drivers lap jumped out croaker just behind him onarimon had been on their way along the city streets but now underground they found themselves having to change trains twice once at mita for the toei asakusa line to shimbashi thence to the jnr following tanyas route to hamamatsucho when they came up into the pointillist sunshine they were faced with a massive crowd that flowed down the two staircases on the departing side of the monorail station a riot of color voices jostling bodies a sea of faces the rhythm of the heat she could be anywhere here croaker said or she could be twenty miles away stop being so optimistic nicholas said dryly and go down to the far staircase in three minutes precisely well both start up me here you there well get her someplace in between croaker got serious you really are sure shes here arent you you dont know tokyo lew he said shes got to get to hokkaido as quickly as possible haneda airports her only means of doing it this is her best shot for it but therere always a busload of ways out of any major city what makes you so sure itll be this one nicholas could not say really because it was an intangible he conjured up tanyas face at the moment he had told her that he had broken tenchi that surprise now had added meaning for him he knew that she had not been prepared for flight whatever her plan had been when she had run into him at the okura it changed immediately he told her about tenchi lew he said earnestly shes going home to russia shes running on instinct and instinct dictates taking the most direct route as well as the fastest its a hunch but an accurate one i think okay buddy croaker said with a brief grin ive had some experience with your hunches before see you in the middle up there it was hot and getting hotter so much so that tanya had begun to sweat something was wrong on the monorail line the unthinkable had occurred a form of japanese transportation had broken down moments ago as she glanced at her watch she had begun to regret not shooting nicholas linnear where he stood in front of his bathroom mirror but she knew quite well why she had hesitated and then decided against it she was afraid of him afraid that she would try it and he would somehow ferret out her intent and stop her from bringing the secret of tenchi to the summit she consoled herself with the fact that the meeting was paramount and could not be jeopardized for anything she had stayed her hand and was sorry that she had not taken the risk for she had bolted and was now vulnerable to pursuit the thought of nicholas linnear as hunter filled her with dread that was why at the precise instant she saw him moving up the stairs at the near end of the platform she turned away and began to fight her way through the densely packed throng toward the platforms far end she had been scanning the bobbing crowd at fifteensecond intervals as she had been taught at protorovs academy using reflective surfaces when she could to do much of her work for her her heart turned icy when she saw him rising onto the level of the platform itself he seemed to slip through the jostling sweating mob with the greatest of ease unlike her who had to battle for every inch she felt as if she were in quicksand her legs frantically pumping but not seeing much result from all that furious effort quicksand or a dream but it was neither tanya knew quite well so discreetly she drew out her modified beretta a flat powerful weapon for close range she was looking over her shoulder as she had seen russilov do she had laughed silently at him for it but she found nothing amusing in the gesture now and so intent was she on fleeing from her personal hunter that she paid little attention to what was in front of her to her those people were a quagmire through which she must force herself they had ceased to be individuals but rather were a part of a maddeningly delaying whole she wanted to kill them all spill them pellmell onto the gleaming track that arced away toward fujiyama blued in the industrial haze and the safety of a plane at haneda something hit hard against her chest and she pushed back frantic now seeing nicholas gaining on her stay right where you are comrade a rough new york accent her head spun around the beretta coming up automatically her finger tightening on the trigger put it down lewis croaker said into her face theres nothing you can do with it now theres no place left for you to go she turned for one last look at her oncoming pursuer and felt the lurch of his open hand against her weapon instinctively she got off a shot and was preparing for another when a single black eye rose like a tower not six inches in front of her face and erupted with the noise of the death of the world croaker got off the phone and said were to stay right here until mincks support crew does what it has to he eyed nicholas the police have already been contacted no ones going to make a move against us nicholas said nothing he was staring down at the covered corpse of tanya vladimova cops were already on the scene separating the observers from the participants moments ago nicholas had spoken briefly to a young sergeant in rapid japanese there were still a battery of formalities to go through but he was thinking of other matters he was thinking again of what his father had said about taking life and eradicating evil from the world that was the dilemma he saw now why was it that to do the one you had to do the other wasnt there any other way hadnt there been with tanya there had been no other way with protorov he knew with akiko as well karma he knew that he had still not yet learned to accept life on its own terms he felt too much for others or was it only that he was reluctant to relinquish that degree of control it was a myth anyway life could never be controlled and yet he continued to try perhaps it was time to end all that he thought at the shinjuku suiryu building nicholas saw tanzan nangi first even though he had been told on his arrival that justine was there waiting for him he did so because he wanted at least one major element in his life settled before he saw her again he wanted his mind totally free so that he could concentrate fully on whatever it was she intended he had spent three hot and sticky hours scouring the city after he left croaker and now he carried with him a silkcovered package he was shown into satos huge office without undue delay they bowed linnearsan please sit down if you dont mind nicholas said id prefer the next room nangis eyes opened wide and he hesitated a moment as if nicholas request had disrupted a pattern set inside him he nodded recovering quickly of course he murmured they walked through the narrow passageway housing the tokonoma its slender vase holding one purple peony nicholas read the poem on the scroll just above wo rainfalls without bringing life to blossoms on mountainside or vale nangi led him past the small alcove and into another smaller room that was not an office at all it was a space that nicholas had not seen before but had known must be there just before the threshold the two of them removed their shoes it was a twelvetatami room the walls were shoji screens though undoubtedly they covered plaster and lathe cool light indirect and dim played over the expanse and from somewhere came the silvery tinkle of water through a streambed there was a low lacquer table in the center of the room several chinesered kansu chests along the wall a cedar desk with phone a hard cedar chair they knelt down on opposite sides of the gleaming black table nicholas looked away to admire the room as nangi spent some time and considerable energy in getting his ruined legs to bend beneath him i have come to report my failure nangisan nicholas said after a time nangi was curious how so linnearsan while you were away sato and i struck a bargain he wished the merger to go through with all good speed i wished to aid him and you as well against the wushing you and seiichisan felt that we both had something to fear from these heinous crimes then eventually yes we both felt that you and he were to be the final targets had you any proof it was satosans belief that something in your past had triggered this vendetta when nangi said nothing nicholas went on i swore to protect him nangisan it is why i went with him to the rotenburo in hokkaido to find the ninja phoenix but koten betrayed us to the russians they killed the ninja and they killed satosan he went on to relate what had happened next at protorovs safe house he said nothing of what had happened after his winged escape phoenix was from the tenshin shoden katori nangis voice was deliberately calm was anything put into the soviets hands for a moment they had it but they had no one to translate the kanji cipher i see the relief flooding out of nangi was palpable i read the document nangisan i have penetrated to the core of tenchi there was no sound in the room now but that of the flowing water unseen and constant nangis eyes closed finally he felt enormously tired like a longdistance runner who had just expended his last ounce of gallant reserves to embrace the finish line only to be told that the course has been extended another mile his dark avian eyes opened and in a voice like tissue paper he said and now that you have the leverage you need what will you do with this information if i do not accede to your demands regarding the terms of the merger i have had a call from a man named c gordon minck nangisan he is in the united states government i know him somewhat i have run a certain errand for him because it suited my purposes because i wished to save tenchi nangi nodded save it from the russians i understand you are an american citizen and now the american secret service establishment knows our deep secret they can keep us under their thumb forever nangisan nicholas said softly i told minck that the soviets had not penetrated tenchi and neither had i satosan once told me that he feared the americans penetrating tenchi almost as much as the russians i did not understand what he meant then but i know now america would not wish for japan to become independent of it i agree with him for nangi nicholas could not have uttered more startling words but this is impossible he said for once flustered you are an american you are iteki isnt that how youve seen me from the first nangisan as a barbarian a halfbreed nangis eyes lowered to the tabletop but all he saw there was his own reflection i hate this man he thought and i dont know why he has suffered for this keiretsu has kept its secrets has almost died for it he is loyal beyond question he tried to save seiichisans life at the thought of his dead friend a knife went through nangis insides and he was shaken anew by his rage against this man yet he struggled with himself to understand my spirit is japanese nicholas said softly you have only to feel my wa to know that it was not so hard for satosan to accept me to befriend me satosan possessed a number of bad habits nangi snapped immediately he bowed his head all the way to the lacquer he was terribly ashamed forgive me linnearsan his voice was a cracked whisper filled with pain and selfloathing you deserve only my abject gratitude for what you have done to protect my keiretsu and preserve tenchi i am truly sorry that you cannot give it nicholas face was sad as he rose the pledge of merger was with satosan i will not insist that you be bound by it linnearsan nangis back was rigid please sit down and when nicholas made no move i beg of you do not add to the disgrace i have already heaped upon myself if you walk out now i can never regain face nicholas folded his legs beneath him i have no wish to disgrace you he said softly remembering all sato had told him of this man whatever accord you had with seiichisan you have with me we are one and the same entity wish to honor his word he passed a hand across his eyes i was brought up with kanryodo i hated foreigners as if they were a disease some perhaps most are like that nicholas said nangi looked at him curiously in truth think i never bothered to understand you i saw what i wanted to see his eyes slid down again and i resented you your easy rapport with my friend he could love you no less for it but that is obvious nicholas raised his cup if you wish we will light incense on seiichisans grave together yes nangi said and he was no longer ashamed to drape his voice in sadness his good eye was moist he raised his glass to departed friends missed and honored for all the days of our lives they drank now what of the wushingl nangi asked the threat of the wushing is gone you have nothing more to fear from that quarter viceminister shimadas daughter has been silenced she has been taken by the earth her revenge is incomplete nangis face seemed to collapse his voice was a whisper shimadasan had a daughter i know only of his two sons who were killed overseas in a plane crash a daughter by a tayu oiran of the yoshiwara oh my god a tic had begun beneath nangis good eye i recall some information i amassed on him there was mention of a courtesan mistress but that she bore him a child it gets worse im afraid i dont see how shimadasans daughter was akiko ofuda sato oh madonna no its impossible he wiped the sweat off his face did seiichisan know no thank god for that small blessing she must have planned it all the courtship the wedding how seiichisan loved her he watched his hands shake fascinated that he had lost this much control he looked up shes gone you say nicholas nodded swallowed up in the recent earthquake she could have destroyed everything everything it was close nicholas acknowledged the russians and the americans arent the only ones interested in tenchi nangi said after a moment now that we are partners i have an obligation to tell you why i went to hong kong i deliberately did not speak of it to seiichi before i left because i had no way of knowing the outcome in advance and i did not want him to worry nicholas listened with growing interest to nangis tale of intrigue but i won everything nangi concluded nicholas was silent for a time digesting all that he had heard i wonder he said at last what do you mean linnearsan would lo whan have any reason to lie to you about his motives nangi shook his head no it cost him too much face he was begging me for tenchis secret i think we should give it to him what nangi exploded after all youve said you must be mad oh i dont mean right away within thirty days tenchi will be under way the oil will be flowing nothing can stop us then tell lo whan that he will have what he wants within a months time but thats treason the communists would you rather have the russians link arms with china what kind of position do you think that would put japan in i dont think even americas might could save us then he spread his hands dont you see nangisan by providing this faction with a unique kind of ammunition you will ensure that russia and china stand apart and you will gain an incredibly direct foothold into peking the forbidden city lo whans faction will owe us much and in time they will have to repay that debt the price will be up to us to negotiate but they are chinese nangi protested they are communists theyre also asian nicholas turned and brought up the silkcovered package this he put on the table this is for you he said in light of this discussion i think it doubly apt nangis good eye opened wide and again he bowed until his gleaming forehead touched the black tabletop carefully he opened the wrapping an oiled boxwood container was underneath he lifted the lid and peered inside age seemed to dissolve off his face with great tenderness he reached inside and took out the two cups they were of the most exquisite translucent porcelain tang dynasty he breathed he watched the light enter them thinking of obachama domo arigato linnearsan it would have been unseemly to have said more he looked at his new partner and perhaps as he was learning his friend i will consider your suggestion there was the ghost of a smile on his lips i for one would welcome constructive talks leading to an oriental alliance slowly like the cool tendrils of the sea nangi felt a return of a certain centrism he had possessed all his life but which had been ripped from him by the news of seiichis death without thinking he hugged this core of comfort about him like a robe around a bluelipped bather it took him a while to reach the conclusion that this miracle of sorts had come about because he had allowed himself to trust another spirit gotaro obachama makita seiichi and now nicholas linnear with a sharp pang of excitement he felt the rhythm start up inside him again a powerful engine roaring in his ears when sometime later he was about to leave and they were standing side by side at the door nicholas said this kobun no longer manufactures petrochemicals does it nangisan nangi laughed ah linnearsan i believe i am going to enjoy our partnership immensely if only you were going to stay here instead of returning to america it is here that you belong truly japan is your home eh but i tell you nothing that you do not already know in your heart he smiled again but to give you an answer no sato petrochemicals was what it was when seiichisan began this kobun but after the oil shock of he perceived that petrochemicals would rapidly become a declining industry in this country the government in the form of miti stepped in that was me of course since i was still viceminister of the ministry before fujitsu matsushita nec and the rest got into artificial intelligence and robotics seiichisan and i spoke of such futuristic concerns slowly so as not to bring any attention to our movements we began to shift goals and priorities from past industry into future ones we kept the old name as camouflage and when years later the government began the tenchi project we were in a unique position to help them he opened the door you must come up to misawa one day and see tenchi herself youve earned the right nicholas found justine on the fiftieth floor near the pool where miss yoshida had been killed she had not been told of nicholas arrival he stopped still when he saw her tan face his heart fluttering and he thought yukio belongs to my past here is my future you look well nick she whirled my god i didnt hear you come in he laughed you should be used to that by now he came toward her his face sobering listen justine theres something i have to tell you but she put the flat of her hand against his lips no nick please ive come thirteen thousand miles to tell you i love you i acted like a spoiled little girl i took out on you an anger that i felt at myself that wasnt fair and im sorry i know i hurt you and just because i was hurt myself that was no good excuse he took her hand away held it justine whatever you have to tell me doesnt matter anymore dont you see theres nothing you could possibly say that could change the way i feel for you nothing could diminish my love so why say it he saw that she was right after all he had wanted to tell her about akiko about yukio he recalled vividly her phone call to him just after satos marriage how wrapped up in his past he had been then how impossible it had been for him to connect with her he was sorry for that as well but he thought that she already knew it he drew her into his arms and she became aware of his maimed right hand what have you been doing she said taking it in both of hers he tried to joke made a grab for another woman she was a black belt in karate she looked up at him really she breathed i stuck my nose in something and got someone mad really will you ever tell me all of it justine he said softly his face in her hair its not so very important she was weeping it caused you pain its important to me he stroked her hair his eyes closed theres no pain now its all over together their lips opened their tongues met tasting they felt the heat passion rising a cloud of heavy emotion enveloping them oh nick she murmured im so happy she was thinking of the couple on the crest of haleakala crater now i have what they have she thought contentedly slowly gently they began to reexplore each other both physically and emotionally two blind people who had suddenly regained their sight they kissed as teenagers often do as if this intimacy was the ultimate one full of emotional complexities and tiny pleasures evolving into a shimmering network of eroticism the kiss was representative of more than mere lust justine had always felt that one gave ones heart in a kiss the same could not be said for the sex act itself it was quite possible to penetrate and be penetrated without kissing at all love was waiting on his lips in the flick of his hot tongue against the inside of her mouth how long had she waited for this moment she would never know for certain but she suspected that it had been all her life she felt alive and free at the same time the combination was an entirely new sensation for her she luxuriated in this pureness but still there was so much about her that had changed and she wanted to share it with him have you been successful so far she asked how do you mean with tomkin industries of course he seemed skeptical you mean you really care one way or the other its my fathers company isnt it my future husbands running it isnt he i think i have a bit of a stake in its success or failure he smiled surprised at how enormously pleased he was nangi has just agreed to the merger of sphynx silicon and satos nippon memory chip kobun but theres much more i think that within eighteen months two years at the outside more than just the two divisions will be merged nick she exclaimed thats fantastic she hugged him my father would have been so proud of you i see thats changed too he said grinning she nodded ive done a lot of thinking about him since the funeral about me all the hates gone i think im able to see him more objectively now as he really was i can see the bad and the good im just sorry that it took his death to allow me to understand all of it id dearly like to tell him all about it to see his face when i told him he stroked her arm your father was an exceedingly strong personality justine he was too much for many adults its not particularly surprising that he should have overpowered his children the important thing is that you realize that he did not dominate you and gelda deliberately he didnt know any other way to live she nodded and held on to him thats another reason i love you so nick you understand me you understood him they kissed again sliding into it as if they could never get enough of one another nicholas because it was his way probed inside her with haragei he found to his utter astonishment the flame of wa perfect harmony ablaze inside her where before had only been darkness and chaos he sighed into her mouth and justine groaned melting against him this state was what he perhaps had seen a spark of when first they had met running into each other on the beach at west bay bridge for both of us now he thought the long journeys ended and its just begun dinner tonight he said softly after a long time in her arms justines eyes were hazy with mingled love and lust and until then go shopping he said buy a matsuda dress spend a fortune on tonight yeah whats the occasion cant tell you he laughed its a surprise oh come on nick she had caught his mood was laughing too tell me oh no he said all i can say is that while youre out making yourself even more beautiful ill be working out with a friend it seems hes anxious to learn aikido and ive promised to go with him theres a dojo ive been to quite near the okura where were all staying i sent him there this afternoon to make an appointment well meet you back at the hotel at about seven wait a minute you mean this friends the surprise nicholas shrugged laughing still dont know could be oh who is he nick this isnt fair ill give you a hint hes an american someone you havent seen in a long time someone you thought youd never see again justine screwed up her face i cant think of who it could be youll meet him soon enough oh no she cried thats all ill be thinking about all afternoon i wont be able to concentrate on anything shopping included nicholas decided to tell her his face was alight justine lew croakers alive and well and staying right here in tokyo what youre kidding she watched his face but the paper the news story was wrong its a long involved story but the gist of it is someone tried to kill him and missed lew stayed dead in order to do what he had to oh my god she gripped him but thats wonderful how fabulous oh ive got to give him a kiss for not getting himself killed nicholas laughed delighted that her reaction mirrored his at seven he said you can do whatever you want with him within reason that is they both laughed at that relief and a cessation of tension dissolved them into fits of giggles that did not stop for a long time their sides ached with the laughter but still they did not stop it felt far too good nicholas met croaker in the tiny exquisite park in toranomonchos sanchome they went up the steps to the building on the thirteenth block that overlooked the small temple and atago hill how long ago it seemed since he had first entered these doors nicholas thought like another lifetime he and justine were both so different now and croaker was there beside him in the locker room they changed out of their street clothes nicholas climbing into his gi croaker into the simple loosefitting white cotton trousers and blouse he found neatly folded in the locker he opened it was very quiet in the do jo classes had been over for some hours there was no one about and so they went in search of kenzo the sensei who had almost defeated nicholas the first time he was here he was telling this to croaker who was saying how nervous and naked he felt without his gun you know us cops nick he said we even take a shower with our piece strapped under our armpits they had come through the dojo proper and were now in the senseis quarters a series of small tatamied rooms separated by ricepaper shoji ive been thinking im getting too old for this im tired of caring more for my piece than i do for the woman beside me they pound that into you at the academy at least they did in my day your pieces the only thing between you and a hole in your chest cant say the same about your woman he tried to smile but could not make it work does that include gelda nicholas asked gelda i dont know but it seems to me that if she cant make it on her own we wont make it together im just no good as a crutch it wont be long before i come to hate her at that moment he had a piercing image of alix in the safe house matty the mouths apartment she was sitting with her hands clasped between her knees staring into the darkness traffic hissed by outside uncaring was it a true image he wondered was she really waiting there for him to come back or was she gone from his life a puff of smoke he had once felt beside him and nothing more on the covers of vogue and bazaar she bore an unattainable demeanor but he had felt her head on his chest had seen the despair opaquing her caged eyes he had taken her hand and in its trembling had been privy to her vulnerability he was astounded by the depth of his hope that she had not fled mattys into the endless night away from him then youre through being a cop if only i knew what that meant croaker said but i dont you knew it well enough with tanya nicholas observed yah croaker said i did at that there was a shadow beyond the last shoji it could have been a human figure sensei nicholas called there was no answer he reached out and slid aside the shoji oh jesus christ croaker said staring kenzo the sensei of this dojo was strung up from the ceiling a length of nylon cord lashed around his ankles his legs were white as bone his face the color of a ruddy sunset his blackened tongue protruded from between his engorged lips nicholas saw the slash through kenzos heart neat as an incision and knew instantly what weapon had been used to kill him goddamn croaker cried i told you i felt naked without my piece he turned running back through the path of the open shoji toward the staircase and the locker room where his gun was locked up thinking a cops what i am its what ill always be the beat of my heart no nicholas cried spinning lew stop running after his friend but croaker did not hear him he was in a foreign land and he felt terribly vulnerable without his gun he was in the second room nicholas increased his speed lunging forward just as croaker sprinted through into the first room grabbed at his cotton blouse pulling backward and down but there was already a whirring in the air a dazzling blur the brief wind of an insect passing close by ah god it was croakers voice full of surprise and pain there was blood and a flurry of bodies rolling nicholas was up in a crouch only an expertly wielded katana could have made that lethal cut in kenzo and that was what he had feared the strike he was trying to protect croaker from had been meant for him he saw his friend kneeling on the tatami his right hand gripping his left blood poured out of the wound at the open wrist that had abruptly become a stump fearful shades of steel had sliced through flesh and bone alike that peculiar silvery tone was in the air a lethal shimmer an oncoming rush of wind that would slice him open if he let it used tobi ashi the flying step launching himself upward and over the oncoming strike koten laughed harshly all your ninja acrobatics will avail you nothing i have the daikatana and indeed it was as nicholas had feared the moment he saw the expert incision through kenzos heart koten was wielding nicholas own sword isshogai fleetingly nicholas found himself wondering how a yokozuna a sumo grand champion such as koten had had time to learn kenjutsu he was wearing montsuki and hakama just as if he were about to step into the dohyo to begin a match his gleaming black hair was immaculately coiffed in ichomage even the daikatana with its thirtyinch blade appeared thin and puny so near his great girth he was an enormously powerful man and nicholas had to be constantly aware of the discipline in which he was sensei sumo was a bit more limited in range than many other martial arts perhaps just over two hundred combinations were possible stemming from thirtytwo key techniques based on pushing with the hands tsuki with the entire body oshi and clinching yon but koten was also a sumai sensei all contact with such a sumo could be instantaneously dangerous since their size combined with their huge hara gave them leverage normally unheard of for a human being unaided by mechanical means unarmed koten was decidedly lethal koten extended the blade and moved forward in quick crablike steps he was close to the ground almost squatting where he was most comfortable and the strongest nicholas burst backward through the last of the shoji found himself in the dojo proper he looked for the katana but their ceremonial spot was empty koten slashed downward in an oblique strike the daikatana piercing wood and rice paper ripping up the shoji only centimeters from nicholas retreating leg ill cut into your ankles first koten said and make you scream he came crashing through the rent shoji like a wild boar i made sumo scream too in the dohyo isshogai swept through the air left to right then abruptly reversing course swiping at nicholas feet you thought ozeki made no noise during a match the audience figures they grunt like territorial animals blur of blade again that is the secret of sumos popularity beneath the formal rituals the veneer of dignity and civilization the audience is excited by what they believe they are seeing antlered stag going at it with instantaneous savagery kotens bead eyes were bright as his massive legs powered him forward as his bare soles beat the floor in a thunderous tattoo but within that space of time thirty seconds no more i learned to make my opponents scream the thunder of the crowd was such that only i heard locked against his sweating body nicholas feinted right then came in beneath kotens guard but the sumo let go of the blade with his left hand slamming the forearm into nicholas chest nicholas hit the floor hard koten laughed again i didnt hear you scream that time barbarian but you will soon the daikatana swooped down its finely honed tip splintering the polished wooden boards at nicholas feet nicholas knew what all this bantering was in aid of it was kotens aim to make nicholas come against him to make nicholas use whatever he might know of oshi drawing nicholas into his own strength i might as well give him what he wants nicholas thought it is time to pass on to koten that which he wants most koten laughed as nicholas came at him a human mountain attacked by an insect who possibly could sting but nothing more he countered nicholas oshi using the hilt of the sword instead of as nicholas had expected returning oshi for oshi nicholas felt the crushing blow on the point of his shoulder felt the resulting grinding of bone and the audible pop of dislocation pain ran like fire down his arm rendering his right side totally useless this is what musashi called injuring the corners barbarian koten gloated ill beat you down in small strokes ill make you scream yet he ran at nicholas feinting with the long sword employing oshi now to throw nicholas hard onto the floor he knelt over him on one knee the blade sizzled downward cutting a vicious arc through the air desperately nicholas twisted raising his left arm upward so that it broke inside kotens upraised arm deflected the blow out and away from him but because of the injuries to shoulder and fingers he was unable to complete the suwari waza move as he would have wanted to instead he was obliged to release kotens arm prematurely to deliver an atemi a percussive strike with his left elbow heard the answering crack as ribs caved in beneath the blow koten cried out twisting his body up and away at the same time slashing back toward nicholas body with the daikatana two attacks at once and nicholas was able to handle only one at a time the steel blade was his first priority he made contact with kotens forearm gliding his left hand along the flesh at the point of the bone protrusion along the bottom side of the wrist he broke inward twisting with the fingers of his left hand because it was aikido he was combining his own strength with that of kotens own momentum it was power enough to snap the bone now they were even in a way koten was obliged to drop the twohanded grip on the sword his right arm hanging loose at his side as the broken joint began to swell but his second attack could not be stopped and he used a shoulder throw to nicholas right side this time nicholas cried out with the pain directed at his dislocated shoulder he rolled away scrambling he knew that he would be done for if he allowed kotens bulk to dominate him while he was off his feet this was the danger with sumai and it was enormous their territory was bringing their weight and strength to bear in an area close to the ground nicholas was moving away when he felt the presence of the blade swooping after him he leaped aside directly into a powerful tsuki that forced all the air from his lungs his head went down and he began to wheeze reflexively as his lungs tried desperately to regain the oxygen denied them a second vicious tsuki to his sternum rocked him backward awkwardly so that he sprawled on the floor in an instant koten was over him his weight pressing oppressively on nicholas chest further denying him air nicholas began to cough bile rising into his throat koten brought long gleaming isshogai crosswise along nicholas chest drawing a horizontal line peeling back his black cotton blouse the next stroke will pierce skin drawing blood koten said his voice silky stupid iteki protorov wouldnt let me at you in hokkaido lucky for you unlucky for him but now i have you unlucky for you lucky for me koten leaned forward bringing more pressure down on nicholas chest next this katana of yours will slice through flesh finally bone and organs he grinned fiercely tell me barbarian how does it feel to know that you are going to die by your own daikatana beginning the first cut skin rupturing peeling back like the rind of a fruit blood welling dark and hot nicholas mind was screaming for surcease reaching back for the no mind of the void he allowed the organism to work on its own his left arm shot straight up the fingers together and as rigid as any swordblade ever forged into the soft spot of flesh joining kotens chin with throat nicholas struck as he had been taught kenjutsu as he would have done a sword strike with all his muscle mind and spirit he thought not of kotens flesh but rather of what lay beyond it the kite struck through flesh and cartilage ripping through kotens larynx his mouth and sinuses the sumos eyes opened wide more with shock than with fear there was no time for anything else he was dead before sensation could reach the brain and register sirens screaming inside the ambulance lew croaker lay on a stretcher unconscious in mild shock the paramedics had kept the makeshift tourniquet he had fashioned afraid to remove it lest the bleeding begin again nicholas sat next to him one shoulder lower than the other he had refused a shot and now sat staring at his stricken friend and his ruined left hand that was no more than a stump across his lap lay isshogai in its black lacquer scabbard he gripped it so hard his left hand was white for life its name seemed ironic to him now theres magic in a japanese forged blade he had once told justine but what use was magic that could do this at the hospital he climbed painfully down after croaker had been wheeled inside the emergency room leaning the daikatana against a pale green cinderblock wall he dug a coin out of his pocket and dialed the hotel justine he said wearily when the connection was made come and get us were at toranomon hospital he put his forehead against the cool wall an intern was calling urgently to him coming across the crowded corridor to take him away everythings all right he said into the phone but i miss you he put down the phone and began to cry tokyo suburbs spring present on a clear day in late spring three weeks after the incident at the dojo nicholas and justine returned from jampacked narita where they had seen lew croaker off to america his arm was healing well the operation an attempt to sew back the hand that had been so cleanly sliced off had been a failure too much time had elapsed but otherwise the news had been good no complications no infections the tourniquet he had fashioned from strips of cloth blouse had quite possibly saved his life the surgeon had said he was very encouraged about the prognosis instead of heading back into the choking riot of tokyo nicholas drove them northwest skirting the city itself in the backseat of the nissan sedan isshogai lay scabbarded and quiescent its presence an everconstant weight they went past the lake above which sato had gotten married where akiko had first revealed herself where yukio had returned from the grave bright sunshine turned the water to gold and glass herons rose near the inlet to the stream that fed the lake their white bodies bright and sharp against the deep translucent blue what a beautiful place justine exclaimed nicholas said nothing just outside the gate to itamis property he stopped the car and they got out he wanted to walk the rest of the way it was as if the modern conveyance did not belong there he felt strongly that he would defile the grounds by driving in together they strolled down the flagstone path justine holding lightly to his left hand how are your fingers today she asked better he said it was what he always told her has feeling come back yet theyre better his voice was gentle just better justine looked at him wondering what it might take now to set his spirit at rest they passed a stone basin in the shape of an old coin it was round carved on its top with one character at each cardinal direction rock rain fire cloud justine wanted to walk over to it and they went off the path water filled its square central well a handmade bamboo ladle resting on the stone im thirsty she said and nicholas took up the ladle they both drank from it the water was cold and sweet for a moment the well was less than full and as nicholas bent to return the ladle to its resting place he saw that there was an ideogram carved into its bottom michi a path also a journey miraculously the house and grounds had sustained no major damage in the aftermath of the earthquake one outer wall at the southerly end of the house had collapsed and several trees nearby had been split but that was all still it was hardly the same without itami and her legion of servants the place seemed deserted indeed she had died sometime during the day and a half he had been at the hospital the funeral had taken place two days later when nicholas was healed sufficiently to attend she was buried in a plot quite near cheongs and the colonels as she had wished there had been no pain in her dying the whitehaired physician had told nicholas he had attended to itamis medical needs for more than thirty years one moment she was there he said the next she was gone nicholas was at least grateful for that justine watched him as he wandered the house something had come over him the moment he had alit from the car she had felt it when she had taken his hand when she had looked at his strong handsome profile as they had walked the gravel path to the house in the small room where only chanoyu had been performed he sank down onto his knees he winced a bit as pain flicked through his shoulder then by some process that was totally mysterious to justine he flicked it off and his face cleared she knelt at his side bending her head a bit to see more of the beautiful garden than the halfscreen permitted why is it like that she said theres so much more to see out there but even when he explained it to her she was not certain that she understood if its there she thought why not take advantage of it ive met with nangi several times he said his voice drifting hes anxious that we stay at least for a time theres so much to do he turned his head would that be okay with you a month or six weeks tokyos not so bad once you get used to it i dont mind she said watching him still there was a wistful look on his face and a calmness young boys have after a long days exertion when happily exhausted they return home to a secure rest well really hed like us to stay here permanently i told him that that was out of the question why did you do that he looked at her quickly why its not possible and you wouldnt like it youd miss new york and your new job id miss you more if we went back to the states and i saw you longing to be here besides i think i could talk rick into letting me start up a branch office in tokyo hes fascinated by japanese ad methods i dont want to be here he said besides where would we live she smiled at him why not right here oh no he said immediately there are too many memories here the pasts all around hanging in every corner like a spider web i like it here she said regaining her feet im sorry that you dont on the way back they stopped by the side of the lake the birds were trilling sweetly and the air smelled very fresh justine gently stroked the back of his injured hand why wont you smile nick youve been brooding for weeks it worries me to see you like this nicholas spread out his hands palms up i look at these justine and wonder what theyre for besides inflicting pain and death she put one of her hands in his theyre also gentle hands nick they caress me and i melt inside he shook his head thats not enough i cant help thinking what theyve done i dont want to kill his voice trembled i dont believe that ever could have you never sought out death nick youve always killed in selfdefense yet i sought out the training first bujutsu then ninjutsu why his eyes were pleading what answer do you think will satisfy you she said softly thats just it he cried in anguish i dont know i think thats because there is no answer his head went down and he said in a muffled voice then i have no answer for how i maimed my friend oh nick she said pressing her lips against his cheek lew doesnt blame you why blame yourself because without me hed still have two hands no without you hed be dead and hed never have found out who really murdered angela didion nicholas had told her as much as he could during their long vigil during croakers operation you know how obsessed he was over that with a little cry nicholas tore himself away from her loving embrace he went around the car reached into an open back window and took the daikatana up he kissed justine hard on the lips ill be back in a little while wait for me listen to the birds watch the sunlight drift through the leaves he went away from her up the small grassy knoll and down toward the lake the water sparked and danced as ripples creased its surface water lapped softly at his feet running into his socks it felt good on his feet and he waded in up to his thighs unmindful of his clothes there was a pain like a stone in his throat isshogai had been the colonels gift to him to commemorate his passage from child to man but he thought now there was another passage he must make that came after that one he was ready for it now prepared in every way he could imagine yet it would still hurt he knew not as much as his hurt for his friend but it would be bad enough thank you father he mouthed as he lofted the daikatana high over his head in his good hand and threw it with all his strength out into the middle of the lake it hit the surface point on and there was no splash at all soundlessly it disappeared into the depths for a long time after that nicholas stood thigh deep in the cool water feeling its lifegiving lap surrounding his body he breathed deeply of the air heard birds calling behind him he saw a pair of snowy herons lift off from the waters surface and wheel into the white sky he watched their flight until they too were lost to sight he recognized the lightness in his spirit when it came like a fresh breeze after a humid summers day it had been time to put away the lethal toys that had dominated his life for so long it was time to get on with living he turned at last and waded the short distance to shore just beyond the small crest of the knoll justine waited for him his heart expanded at the knowledge as he went toward her he thought that she might be right after all just as nangi had been right japan was his home did he really want to leave it now for the first time he could feel the real force of the calmness he experienced in itamis chanoyu room there his spirit was truly at rest he could imagine tsukimi moon viewing there celebrating new years with traditional mochi rice cakes hanami in april when the cherry blossoms fell rich and radiant reminders of all that life was exquisite and fleeting sakura were after all as mortal as men and women in itamis house his house should he wish it the modernday japan had not yet come the feudal kami still resided there proud and splendid and eternally victorious honor lived there as well as courage nicholas taking justines hand in his thought it would be the perfect spot to teach a new spirit what life was all about
